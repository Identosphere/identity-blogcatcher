<p>Today’s interconnected digital landscape, where applications seamlessly integrate to enhance productivity, is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, information is more accessible than ever, requiring switching between apps and services, ostensibly increasing productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the importance of robust identity management cannot be overstated, and if you’re not careful you can lose track of who, what, and where you’ve authorized permissions — and with companies under 2,000 employees <a href="https://youtu.be/s149kAiuCns?t=44">averaging more than 73 SaaS app integrations in 2020</a>, it’s clearly a growing problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s crucial to recognize the potential risks associated with <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth (Open Authorization)</a> grants and how they impact your organization’s data security. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the intricacies of OAuth and shed light on the vulnerabilities that may lurk beneath the surface.</p>
 Broad OAuth access can mean identity sprawl 
<p>Many applications today build on top of each other, using the data from one to power the other. A common example is Google. Google is not one thing; it’s Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc. And for each of these services, Google has a fine-grained API that engineers can use (usually read-only or read-write) to integrate with their products. OAuth is the standard authorization technology across services and is part of what makes an “interconnected” internet experience possible. For example, YeshID Onboard leverages OAuth APIs from Google, Slack, Zoom, and other platforms <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">to streamline identity management</a> for your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the devil is in the details when it comes to OAuth scopes, which are the permissions granted to applications. An alarming aspect is the breadth of these scopes. Some vendors offer OAuth APIs in an all-or-nothing approach, which hampers the ability to employ least-privilege access principles. This contrasts with providers like Google Workspace, known for their granular scopes, allowing for more specific permissions like manipulating mailbox settings, accessing sensitive files, and even user impersonation. However, granularity does not inherently mean restraint; vendors may still request more permissions than necessary, increasing potential risks.</p>
<p>Complicating matters, the risk of data exposure and account takeover is substantial if an OAuth-integrated application is compromised. This situation is akin to any custodian acting on our behalf; the extent of the compromise is proportional to the level of trust and access we’ve granted. So understanding the granularity and necessity of OAuth scopes is crucial in safeguarding your organization’s sensitive information. It’s imperative to assess not just what permissions are possible, but also what permissions are truly necessary for the task at hand</p>
 OAuth can introduce unintentional vulnerabilities 
<p>One of the major risks lies in users granting OAuth access without fully comprehending the implications, which can lead to unintended vulnerabilities. Consider the scenario of a vulnerability in a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism</a> that allowed unauthorized access using Google credentials. Users, in their quest for convenience, might inadvertently expose sensitive company data by granting access without due diligence.</p>
<p>The accidental use of work credentials in personal applications further exacerbates the problem. This unintentional mingling of professional and personal spheres can result in a breach of company data, underscoring the need for user education on OAuth access and permissions. Here’s an example of what you might wind up with.</p>
 Navigating OAuth security concerns 
<p>Enhancing the security of your accounts can be achieved by clearly understanding the difference between “session length” and “grant validity period.” In OAuth, permissions granted to applications often allow extended, but not indefinite, access to company data, raising potential security concerns. This issue becomes particularly critical when applications with extensive permissions retain this access for prolonged periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mitigate risks like unauthorized access, data exposure, and account takeover, it’s essential for leaders to proactively manage and monitor these OAuth grants. Regular reviews and audits of the grant validity periods are key practices in ensuring these permissions are necessary and relevant, and in maintaining the overall security and integrity of your organization’s data. <br>
<br>
Here’s a look at the OAuth request lifecycle to illustrate the issue:</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to do this is by <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgmail-high-risk-oauth-scopes%2Cdrive-high-risk-oauth-scopes">using your Google Workspace console</a> and navigating the following path: Security &gt; Access and Data &gt; API Controls &gt; Manage third party app access &gt; View list. There, you can view apps with access, revoke access if needed, and just get a general view of what’s going on in your app environment. Check out the video below, where I walk you through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, you can also easily track this information with YeshID. Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of app licenses, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions across different applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.</p>
<p>As leaders in the SMB space, it’s imperative to understand the intricacies of OAuth and its potential risks. By educating users, understanding OAuth scopes, and implementing security measures, SMBs can fortify their identity management practices, ensuring a robust defense against the evolving landscape of digital threats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To keep pace with the dynamic environment of digitally-driven business, organizations continue to embrace hybrid cloud, which combines and unifies public cloud, private cloud and on-premises infrastructure, while providing orchestration, management and application portability across all three.</p>



<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/image/IBM%2BTransformation%2BIndex%2B-%2BState%2Bof%2BCloud.pdf">IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud</a>, a 2022 survey commissioned by IBM and conducted by an independent research firm, more than 77% of business and IT professionals say they have adopted a hybrid cloud approach. By creating an agile, flexible and scalable computing environment, hybrid cloud offers valuable use cases for businesses to accelerate growth and gain a competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>



 What is hybrid cloud? 



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a>&nbsp;environment consists of three basic components:&nbsp;</p>



 
 On-premises&nbsp;(also referred to as “on-prem”) is a traditional form of computing that involves an organization running and managing computing resources, networking, storage and software on hardware and servers at its own physical location, such as in an office building or at an on-premises <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-center">data center</a>. 



 Public cloud&nbsp;is a form&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing-benefits">cloud computing</a>&nbsp;where a third-party cloud service provider (CSP)—e.g., Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Services, IBM Cloud or Microsoft Azure)—hosts public cloud resources like individual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VM)</a>&nbsp;and services over the public internet. Services and management tools include the following:
 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas">Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</a> for computing, storage and networking resources. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</a>&nbsp;for developing, running and managing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> applications. 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a>&nbsp;for end-user applications (e.g., Google Workforce and Salesforce). 
 
 



 Private cloud&nbsp;is a cloud computing environment where all resources are isolated and operated exclusively for one customer.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/private-cloud">Private cloud</a>&nbsp;combines many benefits of cloud computing with the security and control of on-premises IT infrastructure.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Initially, hybrid cloud computing focused on incorporating portions of on-premises data into private cloud infrastructure and then connecting that infrastructure to public cloud infrastructure hosted off-premises by third-party cloud providers, such as AWS. This was accomplished using a packaged hybrid cloud solution like Red Hat® OpenShift® or middleware and IT management tools to create a single <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">API</a> or dashboard. This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">‘single pane of glass’</a>&nbsp;gave IT teams a unified view of their applications, networks and systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, hybrid cloud architecture has expanded beyond physical connectivity and basic cloud migration to offer a flexible, secure and cost-effective environment that supports the portability and automated deployment of workloads across multiple environments.&nbsp;</p>



 Hybrid cloud vs. multicloud 



<p>Hybrid cloud is frequently confused with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a>, which refers to using cloud services from more than one cloud vendor. A multicloud environment helps prevent vendor lock-in, which can result in technical incompatibilities, legal restrictions and excess costs tied to using just one vendor.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that modern hybrid cloud architecture has evolved to where hybrid cloud and multicloud settings work in sync with each other. Most modern enterprise businesses have adopted hybrid multicloud environments, which combine the integration of public cloud, private cloud and on-premises infrastructure, along with public or private cloud services from at least two cloud service providers.&nbsp;</p>



 The modern hybrid cloud platform 



<p>A unified hybrid cloud platform plays an important role in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application modernization</a>—the software approach that allows developers to transform monolithic applications into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a>&nbsp;focused on specific business function. Microservices are an architectural approach in which a single application comprises many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components, or services. These applications are then deployed in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">containers</a>—lightweight packages of software comprised only of the application code and virtualized operating system dependencies needed to run in any environment depending on the workload. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">container orchestration</a> platform—usually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>—then automates that deployment across hybrid cloud and multicloud environments.</p>



<p>Additionally, modern hybrid cloud environments no longer require physical locations to “connect,” as they did when organizations ran private clouds exclusively on-premises. In contrast, these environments are now often hosted in off-premises data centers, on virtual private networks (VPNs), <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vpc">virtual private clouds (VPCs)</a> or on rented infrastructure from third-party providers.</p>



 Six common hybrid cloud use cases 



<p>Workloads, infrastructure and processes are unique to each enterprise. To that end, a hybrid cloud—or hybrid multicloud—strategy allows organizations to customize solutions to meet their specific technical demands and business needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are six compelling use cases that demonstrate how hybrid cloud adoption delivers significant business benefits.</p>



 1. Digital transformation 



<p>Regarding <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a>, a hybrid cloud setting provides multiple ways to modernize IT infrastructure specific to each workload. Let’s look at a couple of scenarios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A recent jump in cloud computing demands took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Businesses needed to modernize their IT infrastructure and create more resilient business operations to handle supply chain disruptions, accommodate remote working and optimize e-commerce service, and they turned to hybrid cloud to meet these sudden needs.</p>



<p>In relation to remote work, a hybrid cloud solution allows organizations to migrate sensitive data to their private on-premises servers while making key applications and services on the public cloud accessible to any employee in any location. This creates the flexibility, security and availability needed for employees to gain secure access to corporate resources and share tools like work management platforms to collaborate inside and outside the organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Financial institutions are part of a heavily regulated sector that still relies to a degree on legacy systems (e.g., mainframe-based platforms) to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. A hybrid cloud solution provides a flexible alternative way for banks to isolate this data by hosting applications on industry-compliant public clouds and storing sensitive information on-premises in their private cloud. Hybrid cloud also enables&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a>&nbsp;methodologies for banks to rapidly build customized solutions on software applications that streamline banking operations and deliver better customer experiences (e.g., fast and secure mobile banking apps).&nbsp;</p>



 2. Disaster recovery (DR) 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/disaster-recovery">Disaster recovery (DR)</a> involves IT technologies and best practices designed to prevent or minimize data loss and business disruption resulting from catastrophic events. Potential disasters include equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattacks</a>, civil emergencies or military attacks. A DR strategy is widely considered mandatory for many workloads in most organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A hybrid cloud strategy frequently includes a cloud-based disaster recovery plan. Such a plan involves housing systems and data in a private cloud and backing up that infrastructure on a public cloud. If a disaster strikes, the organization can quickly and smoothly move workloads to the public cloud with minimal disruption and continue running business applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of today’s cloud providers offer cloud management services, such as Disaster Recovery-as-a-Service (DRaas). This service allows organizations to back up their data and IT infrastructure and host them on a third-party cloud provider’s infrastructure. In the event of a catastrophe, the cloud provider can implement and orchestrate the company’s DR plan to ensure business continuity.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Development and testing (dev/test) 



<p>A hybrid cloud environment offers clear advantages for developing and testing applications as there is no need to purchase and set up on-premises physical hardware. DevOps teams frequently use public cloud platforms and other services, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-storage">cloud storage</a>, to host development projects. Compared to launching a testing environment in a private cloud, a dev/test approach in a public cloud offers cost-savings, flexibility and faster time to market. Once a team has developed an application in the public cloud, they may decide to migrate it to a private cloud environment, based on business needs or security factors.</p>



<p>Building and testing in a public cloud setting can also help advance an organization’s overall&nbsp;application modernization&nbsp;strategy, aiding in developing and testing microservices architecture designed for monolithic legacy applications.&nbsp;</p>



 4. Cloud bursting 



<p>Many companies deal with dynamic workloads prone to rapid spikes in resource demands (e.g., an e-commerce website during a holiday sale). Here’s where cloud bursting, a hybrid cloud deployment technique, comes in. A cloud burst is a configuration between a private cloud and public cloud that uses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/load-balancing">load balancing</a> to redirect traffic overflow. When a private cloud has reached 100% capacity, external workloads that would otherwise overwhelm an organization’s private servers “burst” to external third-party cloud services.</p>



<p>Besides avoiding interruption to business applications during sudden workload surges, cloud bursting can free up local resources for other applications and reduce capital expenditures tied to on-premises infrastructure costs.</p>



 5. Edge computing 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">Edge computing</a>&nbsp;is a distributed computing framework that places computer workloads as close as possible to data sources (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">IoT devices</a>). Edge computing has many business applications, ranging from predictive maintenance on a factory floor to in-hospital patient monitoring.</p>



<p>Edge computing has become a critical part of hybrid cloud architecture especially as endpoints, applications and data become more distributed. Edge computing— and mobile edge computing on 5G networks—keeps compute capacity closer to endpoints, resulting in low latency and high bandwidth availability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A modern hybrid cloud strategy combined with edge computing creates a seamless end-to-end solution that allows for the flexibility to run applications in private or public data centers and on the edge, bringing compute resources to end users, IoT devices, etc. In instances that require low-latency data transfer—such data analytics in self-driving vehicles or for real-time retail customer insights—hybrid cloud enables select infrastructure and application services at the edge.&nbsp;</p>



 6. Hybrid cloud and AI 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> continues to transform how businesses function by streamlining processes, increasing efficiency and reducing costs. By leveraging AI, businesses can automate repetitive tasks to free up their workforce, reduce errors and improve decision-making. A hybrid cloud environment forms a critical foundation for AI capabilities, including generative AI, which has become a top priority for enterprises worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models">large language models (LLMs)</a>&nbsp;associated with&nbsp;<a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a>&nbsp;demand enormous computing power to process high volumes of data in an environment that supports security and rapid scalability. A hybrid cloud architecture enables businesses to scale computing resources on demand and allocate resources during peak usage periods.</p>



<p>Data privacy, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">data security</a> and cyberthreats are chief concerns with generative AI and LLMs. A hybrid cloud environment provides companies with the flexibility to store and process sensitive data locally in a private cloud setting, thus safeguarding information from outside threats and ensuring regulatory standards are met.</p>



 Advantages of hybrid cloud 



<p>&nbsp;A hybrid cloud strategy provides the following benefits:</p>



 
 Agility:&nbsp;A unified hybrid cloud platform helps organizations easily adopt agile <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devsecops">DevSecOps</a> (development, security and operations) methodologies, eliminating bottlenecks and speeding time to market.&nbsp; 



 Scalability:&nbsp;Businesses can scale up quickly, automatically and inexpensively in response to unexpected traffic spikes using hybrid cloud. 



 Security and compliance:&nbsp;A hybrid cloud infrastructure lets organizations control how and where they place data storage and workloads based on security and regulatory compliance needs. 



 Business continuity:&nbsp;In the event of a surge in web traffic or a network outage, a hybrid cloud architecture allows businesses to continue operations with minimal interruption. 
 



 IBM and hybrid cloud 



<p>The operational demands on organizations today are increasingly complex, which is why a seamless and connected IT infrastructure remains a critical business imperative. The&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/image/IBM%2BTransformation%2BIndex%2B-%2BState%2Bof%2BCloud.pdf">IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud</a> revealed a strong link between hybrid cloud adoption and progress in digital transformation, with 71% of those surveyed stating they believe it’s difficult to realize the full potential of a digital transformation without having a solid hybrid cloud strategy in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern hybrid cloud architecture continues to offer powerful use cases for overall business transformation and innovation that are in lockstep with broader IT strategies, such as the integration of generative AI.&nbsp;As a leading global provider of hybrid cloud solutions, IBM is helping clients gain powerful data-driven insights, streamline business processes, enforce cloud security measures and save costs.</p>

<p>The pandemic has brought supply chain to focus, and organizations recognize dynamic supply assurance as a critical capability for their business. Chief Supply Chain Officers (CSCO) and other executives seek to optimize their supply chain by infusing AI, modernizing their technology and addressing sustainability goals.</p>







<p>Over the next decade, CSCOs will need to solve key industry challenges: supply chain disruptions due to climate events; regional conflicts such as Ukraine or Middle East; the desire for convenience and personalization; awareness of the environmental impact of consumption; meeting delivery expectations; fears about trade disruptions and fluctuations in cost. All of these challenges can be solved with more connected, agile and sustainable supply chains.</p>



<p>Organizations that proactively address these industry challenges can see some typical outcomes related to stock, including a 4-8% improvement of lost sales from stock outages, increased stock turnover, improved management of product risk, perishability and age, as well as increased management of lead time (a leading indicator of stock overage) and a reduction of days on hand. In addition, there can be financial benefits, such as a solution cost savings of 10%, reduced holding costs and improved gross margin return on investment. Finally, they may also see customer-facing benefits, including a reduced return rate, the ability to manage unusual supply chain interruption events including weather or natural disaster, and an overall improvement in customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>To help organizations address these industry challenges, IBM and Red Hat teams developed this whitepaper and supporting assets through an IBM Academy of Technology Industry Affiliate Initiative.</p>

<p>Security analysts are all too familiar with the challenges of alert fatigue, swivel chair type of analysis, and “ghost chasing” spurred by false positives. Facing massive volumes of data coming from an expanding digital footprint and attack surfaces across hybrid multi-cloud environments, they must quickly discern real threats from all the noise without getting derailed by stale intelligence.</p>



<p>Many organizations have to juggle dozens of security tools, which creates scattered, contextless information that often weakens the foundational triad of cybersecurity: tools, processes and people. To help manage these inefficiencies that can delay crucial threat responses, security operations teams need to explore how to embrace AI and automation.</p>



 A day in the SOC&nbsp; 



<p>A SOC analyst’s day often includes dealing with limited visibility due to expanding attack surfaces and responding to contextless alerts, which are challenging to decipher. As a result, they frequently spend up to one-third of their day investigating false positives.1 This not only impacts their productivity but also hinders their ability to address about half of the daily alerts,1 which might be indicators of an actual attack.</p>



<p>The biggest challenges faced by SOC analysts today include:</p>



 
 Poor visibility: Per <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51873">The State of Attack Management 2022</a> report, attack surfaces increased attack surfaces for two out of three organizations in 2022. 



 Alert fatigue and disconnected tools: According the same attack surface management report, 80% of organizations use 10 or more tools (e.g. EDR, EPP, NDRs, SIEM, threat intelligence, web traffic, email filtering, system, network and application logs, cloud logs, IAM tools, etc.). 



 Keeping up with cyberattacks: IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">Cost of a Data Breach</a> report found that 51% of organizations struggle to detect and respond to advanced threats. 



 Outdated tools and manual methods: The same data breach report also shows that 32% of organizations lack security automation and orchestration. 



 Lack of standardization to fight organized cybercrime globally: The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-51962">X-Force Threat Intelligence Index reveals</a> signs of increased collaboration between cybercriminal groups. 
 



<p>Adding to these major challenges are other usual suspects such as, increasing complexity, limited resources with increasing cost, and talent shortage (a.k.a skills gap).</p>



<p>As first responders, how SOC analysts prioritize, triage and investigate alerts and signs of suspicious activity defines the fate of attacks and the impact on the organization. When SOC analysts get slowed down by these challenges, it creates a growing defense deficit and breach window, which can expose organization to higher risks.</p>



 Finding the needle 



<p>Threats hide in complexity and noise and thrive with the inability to keep up with the acceleration of attacks. Attacks can occur in minutes or seconds, while analysts, consumed by manual tasks operate in hours or days.&nbsp;This disparity in speed is a real risk in itself.</p>



<p>Without comprehensive visibility, intelligent risk prioritization, effective detection, proactive threat hunting, and skills building, SOC analysts cannot improve their workflows and evolve with the threat landscape, perpetuating a vicious cycle.</p>



<p>Increasing the security analyst’s productivity is fundamental to scaling cybersecurity in a rapidly evolving threat landscape. After hearing customers and security professionals talk about their core challenges, this efficiency became the goal and IBM designed a purpose-built solution to deliver what is the required to unlock analysts’ productivity.</p>



 Investigating and responding fast 



<p>QRadar Log Insights provides a simplified and unified analyst experience (UAX) that enables your security operations team to search and perform analytics, automatically investigate incidents and take recommended actions using all security-related data, regardless the location or the type of the data source.&nbsp;</p>









<p>With QRadar Log Insights’ UAX, you get:</p>



 
 AI-based risk prioritization:&nbsp;As data flows in, logs and alerts are automatically checked against security rules and indicators of compromise (IoC) from threat intelligence sources. After being enriched with business context, they’re processed by a self-learning engine that’s informed by past analyst actions. This engine identifies high fidelity findings and filters out false positives.&nbsp;AI-based risk scoring is then applied. Although the analyst didn’t have to do anything, all the steps and information about the events, threat intelligence and applied score is available for analysis. 
 









 
 Automated investigation: A case is automatically created for incidents above a risk threshold calculated using a combined score from correlated events. Events in a case are arranged on a timeline for a quick view of attack steps.&nbsp;All identified artifacts are collected as evidence, such as IoCs, IP and DNS addresses, host name, user IDs, vulnerability CVEs, etc. Additionally, findings continue to be correlated with artifacts collected on a sliding time window providing continuous monitoring into the future. 
 









 
 Recommended actions: Based on the identified artifacts and techniques from the attack, Log Insights suggests pointed mitigation actions, ensuring a quick response and speedy containment. 
 







 
 Case management:&nbsp;Integrated case management streamlines collaboration and tracks progression toward resolution. Every piece of evidence is collected, appropriate action is recommended and those taken by peers are recorded. 
 







 
 Insightful attack visualization:&nbsp;A comprehensive graphical visualization illustrates the attack path, highlighting the sequence and mapping attack stages to the impacted resources—known as the blast radius. This visualization empowers SOC analysts to gauge the impact, understand potential persistence techniques, and identify what areas are most important to address first. 
 









<p>Attack steps are also mapped to MITRE TTPs, offering detailed insights into adversarial actions and progress:</p>







 
 Federated search:&nbsp;A high-performance search engine empowers threat hunting across all your data sources. From a single screen with a single query, search data from your security tools EDRs, SIEMs, NDRs, Log Mgt, Cloud, email security, etc. This capability enables extended investigations into third-party sources, on-prem and in other clouds, accommodating data not yet ingested into Log Insights. You can simultaneously query both the data within Log Insights and multiple external data sources, all included for no additional cost. 
 









 
 Integrated threat intelligence: X-Force and community-sourced threat intelligence are continuously updated, autonomously tracking threat activities. This dynamic system keeps up with previously unseen threats enhancing detection capabilities.&nbsp; 
 









<p>UAX integrated suite of capabilities powered by AI and automation, streamlines risk prioritization, threat investigation and visualization, federated searching, and case management, enabling analysts to handle incidents with remarkable speed and efficiency.</p>







 Unlock analysts’ productivity with QRadar Log Insights&nbsp; 



<p>Disjointed information and fragmented workflows can significantly extend the amount of time security analysts spend on investigating and acting on security events. In cybersecurity, how your security team spends their time can mean the difference between simply analyzing a security event and dealing with a full-blown data breach incident. Every second counts.</p>



<p>To cope with the rising tide of data and alerts, organizations must transcend the limitations of manual processes. By integrating artificial intelligence and automation into their workflows, analysts are better equipped to keep pace with and respond to the rapidly intensifying landscape of cyber threats.</p>

<p>IBM Cloud authentication and authorization relies on the industry-standard protocol OAuth 2.0. You can read more about OAuth 2.0 in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749">RFC 6749</a>—The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework. Like most adopters of OAuth 2.0, IBM has also extended some of OAuth 2.0 functionality to meet the requirements of IBM Cloud and its customers.</p>



 Access and refresh tokens 



<p>As specified in RFC 6749, applications are getting an access token to represent the identity that has been authenticated and its permissions. Additionally, in IBM Cloud, the access token also represents the current account selected. When applications invoke IBM Cloud Services, this access token is transmitted as part of the API call as HTTP authorization header to provide information about the caller. The target IBM Cloud Service will do its authorization decision based on the content inside the access token:</p>



Figure 1: API key is exchanged into an IAM access token, which is then used to call a service.



<p>For specific use cases, applications can also retrieve refresh tokens from IAM. This way, applications can retrieve a new access token when the previous one expires. This is important for the IBM Cloud Console or IBM Cloud CLI, for example, because otherwise, the end user would need to log in again after the access token expires (i.e., after at least 60 minutes or even earlier). Refresh tokens need to be stored in a safe place—and even then, they eventually time out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer applications in IBM Cloud have two ways to create an access token to be able to invoke IBM Cloud services:</p>



<p>1. Use an API key to get an access token (<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-identity-token-api#gettoken-apikey">see here for more information</a>):</p>



Figure 2: Exchanging an IAM API key into an access token.



<p>2. Get an access token when running on an IBM Cloud-managed compute platform. For instructions on how to do that, please refer to the following blogs:</p>



 
 For virtual servers, see “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/introducing-trusted-profiles-for-vpc-virtual-server-instances">Introducing Trusted Profiles for VPC Virtual Server Instances</a>.” 



 For Kubernetes or OpenShift, see “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/introducing-trusted-profiles-for-kubernetes-service-accounts">Introducing Trusted Profiles for Kubernetes Service Accounts</a>” and “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/using-trusted-profiles-in-your-kubernetes-and-openshift-clusters">Using Trusted Profiles in your Kubernetes and OpenShift Clusters</a>.” 
 



Figure 3: Exchanging a Compute Resource Token into an access token.



<p>In both cases, the application has access to the API key or the Compute Resource Token from the IBM Cloud-managed compute platform anyway. Therefore, there is no benefit in the application storing and using the refresh token. When the application requires a new access token, it can use the API key or Compute Resource Token again. Therefore, IBM Cloud IAM will not produce refresh tokens for those use cases.</p>



 Token format 



<p>IBM Cloud is designed to scale. Therefore, access tokens in IBM Cloud use the JSON Web Token format (see also RFC 7519). JSON Web Tokens have a standard format:</p>



Figure 4: Format of a standard JSON Web Token.



<p>The signature of IBM Cloud access tokens is created using the asymmetric algorithm RS256. This means only IBM Cloud IAM can sign those access tokens, but any IBM Cloud Service (and even third-party applications) can verify the validity of a token signature using the public part of the signature key. IBM Cloud IAM announces the public part of currently valid signature keys <a href="https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/keys">here</a>.</p>



Figure 5: Sample output of keys endpoint.



<p>IBM Cloud Services and other applications should download and cache those keys for one hour. Using those public signature keys, they can now validate the signature of those tokens. This way, IBM Cloud Services and APIs can validate those tokens without any relevant latency. They do not need to call out to IAM for each access token to check its validity. This method scales very well, as the validation load is scaled up with each IBM Cloud Service and API. As a consequence, those access tokens cannot be revoked—a revocation would require each adopter to check the access token with IAM. Such a call to IAM would destroy all advantages described above.</p>



<p>Refresh tokens do not follow any documented format. Only IBM Cloud IAM can create and understand them. To get a new access token for a refresh token, the refresh token needs to be sent to IAM. IAM will then validate the refresh token and its related entity and create an access token if the various validations are successful. This means a refresh token will fail to create a new access token if, for example, the related user was deleted from IBMid or the related Service ID does not exist anymore.</p>



 Login sessions 



<p>A login session is created at the time when an end user is logging in to <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/">IBM Cloud Console</a> or to the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli">IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI) client</a>. A user can view and manage login sessions <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/user/sessions">using the interface</a>. The user can end individual login sessions using this user interface or get an overview of login sessions for themselves. This way, the user can review and revoke their login sessions:</p>



Figure 6: Login session overview.



<p>A login session will end if one of the following events occur:</p>



 
 The login session is expiring (24 hours by default) 



 The login session was not actively used for a predefined time (two hours, by default) 



 A user manually logs out from a login session or revokes a login session 



 Too many login sessions have been opened (no limit, by default) 
 



Figure 7: Login session expires after 24 hours.



Figure 8: Login session becomes inactive after two hours of not seeing any activity.



Figure 9: Login session gets revoked by a user hitting the logout or revoke button.



 Configuring login session settings 



<p>The IAM Administrator of an IBM Cloud account can configure certain parameters for login sessions:</p>



 
 Active sessions: Maximum lifetime of one single login session. After this lifetime has exceeded, the login session is marked as expired. You can start a new login session by entering login credentials again. The default is 24 hours. IAM Administrators can extend this duration up to 720 hours or lower this duration to 15 minutes. Figure 7 above describes a scenario when the default lifetime of 24 hours has been exceeded. 



 Sign out due to inactivity: A login session is marked as being active based on the interaction of the application with IAM. For example, the usage of a refresh token resets the inactivity timer. The value to detect inactivity can be set by an IAM Administrator to at least 15 minutes or at most 24 hours. By default, two hours is used. Figure 8 above describes this scenario and ends the login session after two hours of inactivity. 



 Concurrent sessions: By default, you can create an unlimited number of login sessions. There might be reasons to limit the maximum amount of login sessions (e.g., to limit the number of scripts running in parallel for a given user). For this scenario, you can set a limit of concurrent sessions. If a new login session extends the limit of concurrent sessions, the oldest running session is revoked. The state of the session is the same as if it would have been revoked manually as described in Figure 9. 
 



<p>The configuration settings for Access tokens and Refresh tokens on the Token expiration section are not related to tokens that are created for login sessions. These settings control the behavior of tokens that exist without a connected login session. You will find more details later in this blog.</p>



 Login sessions and tokens 



<p>As explained before, the IBM Cloud Console and the IBM Cloud CLI internally work with access and refresh tokens to be able to invoke IBM Cloud Services and IBM Cloud APIs. IBM Cloud combines the security of the OAuth 2.0 model with the session management capabilities of login sessions.</p>



<p>For login time, the calling application (e.g., the IBM Cloud Console) gets an access token and refresh token from IAM. In the background, IAM starts a login session and connects the access and refresh token with the login session. As access tokens cannot be revoked, the lifetime of access tokens is limited to 20 minutes or fewer.</p>



<p>Whenever the access token expires, the calling application must use the refresh token to obtain a new access token. The session has an inactivity timer that is started at login time and reset whenever an activity (e.g., a refresh token operation) is detected. The session ends if the session is actively revoked, the overall session expiration is met or the session detects inactivity. All refresh tokens stop working if the session ends.</p>



Figure 10: Relation between login session, access token and refresh token.



 Tokens without login sessions 



<p>Creating and persisting login sessions is a compute-intensive operation. Therefore, IBM Cloud cannot create a login session for every interaction. Especially for service invocations, there is often no need for login sessions or the ability to revoke sessions or refresh tokens (if reasonable lifetimes are chosen).</p>



 Access tokens without refresh tokens 



<p>If you—as described at the beginning of this blog—create an access token using an API key or you retrieve access token based on your compute platform, you have no need to use a refresh token. You can always create a fresh access token using the API key or based on the Compute Resource Token that the compute platform provides. Therefore, IBM Cloud IAM will not generate a refresh token in those scenarios. Also, you will not create a login session in the background.</p>



 Access and refresh tokens without login sessions 



<p>If you log in to the IBM Cloud CLI using an API key that represents a Service ID, this interaction will not create a login session. Nevertheless, the CLI expects to run longer than it takes for an access token to expire, so the CLI will require a refresh token. IBM Cloud IAM will create an access and refresh token that are not connected to a login session.</p>



<p>Those tokens are usually expected to be used inside a CLI only, and therefore on an environment that has reasonable protection against misuse.</p>



 Configuring token expiration 



<p>The IAM settings allow you to configure the lifetime for access tokens and refresh tokens that have no related login session:</p>



 
 Access tokens: The lifetime for access tokens created inside this account is independent from login sessions. The default value is 60 minutes. This means that if you are creating an access token for an API key, you will, by default, retrieve an access token that is treated as valid for the next 60 minutes by IBM Cloud Services. If you want to limit the lifetime for access tokens, you can choose a smaller value. Consider choosing a value that still allows you to execute all required IBM Cloud Services. Some longer-running operations like searching with the Data Engine inside COS buckets might stop working. 



 Refresh tokens: By default, refresh tokens are valid for up to 72 hours. This means that if you logged in to the IBM Cloud CLI with an API key for a Service ID, this IBM Cloud CLI can continue working for the next 72 hours, as it can refresh the access token whenever required. If your account does not have such a requirement, you can lower the lifetime for refresh tokens to a lower value. Please consider that this limits the maximum execution time for long-running services that use a refresh token to proceed. Again, this configuration only applies to refresh tokens that are created independent from login sessions. 
 



 Summary 



<p>IBM Cloud IAM uses access tokens to allow clients to call IBM Cloud Services. For API interactions, IBM Cloud IAM avoids having to generate refresh tokens as much as possible. One exception to that rule is the use of Service IDs for IBM Cloud CLI operations. To also allow long-running interactions with IBM Cloud that go beyond the lifetime of an access token, IBM Cloud IAM offers login sessions that give the end user control over the session expiration and revocation.</p>



<p>Please review the IAM Settings to see if they match your needs:</p>



Figure 11: IAM settings related to login sessions and tokens.



<p>Please remember that the two expiration settings for access and refresh tokens in the section Token expiration only relate to API interactions and Service ID sessions inside the IBM Cloud CLI. Normal user sessions in the IBM Cloud Console or similar applications will create a Login session. The expiration of access tokens and refresh tokens are indirectly influenced by the session configuration parameters under Login session.</p>

				 <p>In the inaugural episode of the <a>(un)Trustables Podcast</a>, we delve into the fascinating landscape of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity (NDI) project. This groundbreaking initiative introduces Bhutan’s “edge wallet,” a highly secure mobile wallet designed to safeguard what Bhutan refers to as ‘foundational digital identity,’ the first verified credential issued to citizens.<br><a href="https://untrustables.simplecast.com/episodes/ep001-bhutan-has-launched-a-national-digital-identity-program">Listen to the full episode</a></p>
 The Birth of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity 
<p>Our conversation with Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments, reveals the genesis of Bhutan’s NDI project. This audacious endeavour embodies the vision of Bhutan’s monarchy, aligning perfectly with the principles outlined in the SSI book by Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed. The aim is clear: to create a citizen-centric digital identity system that empowers individuals and streamlines their interactions with the government and private sector.</p>
 Building Blocks of a Bhutanese Digital Identity 
<p>Bhutan’s digital identity framework is a marvel of innovation. It includes unique identifiers, permanent and current addresses, and other critical data points that form the bedrock of citizens’ digital identities. Beyond foundational identity, the NDI opens the door to many use cases, spanning government services and commercial applications.</p>
 Empowering Bhutanese Citizens with Digital Convenience 
<p>The NDI project isn’t just about innovation; it’s about transforming the lives of Bhutanese citizens. It eliminates time-consuming journeys to government offices, saving citizens valuable time and resources. Even in remote areas, the NDI project enhances accessibility, simplifying processes with mobile solutions.</p>
 Drummond Reed’s Perspective on Bhutan’s SSI Journey 
<p>Renowned digital identity expert Drummond Reed shares his initial astonishment at the audacity of Bhutan’s plan to implement a self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution at the national level. He reflects on Bhutan’s forward-thinking approach and alignment with the SSI book’s principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did research and then we read the SSI book which Drummond and Alex wrote, and we just felt so strongly that it’s exactly the vision of His Majesty, our King. We said, why don’t we just build the book? That was kind of our starting place. Since then, we embodied the principles. We really thought about what the idea of the book is and how it should benefit people. We wanted it to be very citizen-centric. – Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments</p>
</blockquote>
 Crafting Legislation and Governance for Digital Trust 
<p>Translating the SSI book’s vision into tangible legislation was a crucial step. Jacques explains how this process, guided by Drummond Reed and informed by extensive consultation with experts, culminated in the unanimous passing of an Act in Bhutan’s parliament. This legislation ensures a citizen-centric approach to digital identity.</p>
 Building an Ecosystem for Digital Trust 
<p>Drummond underscores the importance of creating a comprehensive digital trust ecosystem involving various stakeholders. Bhutan’s NDI project serves as a blueprint for other nations seeking to embark on similar digital identity journeys, emphasizing the collaborative nature of such transformative endeavours.</p>
 Addressing Device Accessibility 
<p>Inclusivity is a priority for Bhutan’s NDI project. Jacques outlines Bhutan’s strategies to ensure device accessibility for all citizens, including a fund to provide devices to families without them. For those in remote areas without mobile coverage, a unique biometric verifiable credential bridges the digital divide, enabling access when they visit friends and family with smart devices.</p>
 Digital Horizons Unveiled 
<p>Bhutan’s NDI project is a testament to the transformative power of digital identity. It offers citizens convenience, efficiency, and accessibility while laying the foundation for a more connected and digitally empowered society.</p>
<p>As we conclude Episode 1 of the (un)Trustables Podcast, we invite you to stay tuned for future episodes where we continue to explore digital trust and transformation worldwide.</p>

<p>The fast-paced business world we live in today requires smart tools to manage a business’s operations and everyday needs. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-resource-planning">Enterprise resource planning</a> (ERP) is a business management software built to do just that. This relatively new system offers a centralized platform with applications to manage all aspects of your business from supply chain management to inventory management to financial management. The benefits of ERP include built-in business intelligence and access to real-time data, along with integrated machine learning capabilities unlike a legacy system. While there are different types of enterprise resource planning systems, all solutions are built to help improve business functions and business operations.</p>



<p>ERP solutions are built to meet the needs of organizations across multiple industries including retail, consumer products, industrial, energy and utilities and government (including defense). When an organization is deciding which type of enterprise resource planning deployment type to use, there are multiple factors to consider including size, functionality, procurement and industry-specific requirements. If these factors are taken into consideration, it will be much easier to narrow down which types of ERP solutions might meet the organization’s needs.</p>



 ERP systems by deployment options 



<p>Some of the more well-known ERP software offerings are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/sap">SAP S/4HANA</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting">Oracle Netsuite</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/microsoft">Microsoft Azure</a>, Infor CloudSuite and Acumatica Cloud ERP. The different types of ERP deployment will be discussed below and will hopefully assist organizations in deciding which software solution type is best fit for its needs. It’s important to note each ERP solution offers modules such as e-commerce, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/human-capital-management">human capital management</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/order-management">order management</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/inventory-management">inventory management,</a> but will differ from one type to the next.</p>



<p>Some ERP software providers may also provide industry-specific ERP solutions or modules. An example is manufacturing industry software which includes MRP, or material requirements planning. Industry-specific software will vary from one organization to the next and can include modules, such as project management and project accounting. Other ERP software offerings can include customer relationship management (CRM) and human resources software.</p>



<p>Enterprise resource planning systems aim to address all aspects of a business and improve business processes, such as accounting, real-time financial reporting, forecasting and other processes. It typically come in three different deployment options:</p>



 
 On-premises 



 Cloud 



 Hybrid 
 



 On-premises ERP systems 



<p>The on-premises enterprise resource planning system is exactly how it sounds. The software is installed on an organization’s own servers and computer equipment. It is a licensed system that can be customized and upgraded and is typically maintained by the organization’s IT team onsite to streamline the business workflow.</p>



 Benefits of on-premises 



 
 Cost: Since the software is done on-premises there isn’t a monthly or annual subscription cost for the software. This could lower the cost of the ERP system over time both short and long term, resulting in better profitability. 



 Customization: Organizations can customize the software as they see fit. On-premises customization can be done during the implementation process and thereafter. The decision-making is much more in the hands of the organization itself. 



 Data security: The on-premises software means all company information and data remains on-site making it a very secure software system for your business. 



 In-house advantage: By having all data storage and hardware on-site the organization isn’t dependent on the software vendor for system needs. It can all be handled by the on-site IT team once they have been trained properly. 
 



 Disadvantages of on-premises 



 
 Initial investment: Software and computer equipment will require a larger investment up front. The software may also need to be replaced down the line. Organizations should factor in these expenses before choosing on-premises ERP. 



 Upgrades needed: The ERP software will need to be upgraded periodically to mitigate cybersecurity risks and ensure your organization has the most efficient software. These upgrades may also require working in the office and perhaps through a slower connection at times. 



 Data risks: Doing in-house data backups or upgrades could lead to corrupted files, potentially putting an organizations data at a higher risk. 
 



 Who does on-premises ERP best serve? 



<p>The on-premises ERP system is for an organization that wants full autonomy of its system. With this business management solution, the organization handles its data management and security on-site. The use of an ERP team or partner is recommended to help lead and handle any implementation questions.</p>



 Cloud-based ERP systems 



<p>The cloud-based ERP system has become more popular, especially among small businesses and medium-sized businesses. Since cloud-based solutions are managed remotely by a third-party vendor it reduces the need for an extensive IT team on-site and is often referred to as SaaS (software as a service) due to its ongoing billing model. It also removes the need of having dedicated servers specifically for this business management solution.</p>



 Benefits of cloud 



 
 Easy maintenance: Using a cloud-based ERP system means there is no need for an on-site IT setup. The third-party vendor shouldn’t need to handle the software and any updates, security and server maintenance. 



 Scalable: Organizations can easily modify their system as they grow over time and can make major or minor adjustments without having to spend a ton of money. 



 Cost: With the ERP system being cloud-based there is no need for on-site computer servers or an IT staff to manage the system, saving the organization money up front and down the road. 



 Accessibility: The cloud-based structure allows for the ERP system to be run anywhere and at any time. The updates are done automatically by the software vendor for all users; therefore, employees are freed up to perform other pertinent tasks. 
 



 Disadvantages of cloud 



 
 Cost over time: Cloud-based ERP allows organizations to spread the cost over time. However, the cost in the long run could become quite expensive. Try to consider thinking about where your business will be in, say, 10 years. 



 Less personalization: While custom applications or ERP modules can be selected with a cloud-based ERP system, it does limit what is available. The cloud-based structure typically has a template in place and while it can be molded it’s not the most customizable option. 



 Connectivity: An ERP cloud customer must rely on their internet connection and hope for little to no connection issues. The ERP system cannot run properly if the connection is dropped, therefore disrupting your organization’s workflow and business needs. 
 



 Who does cloud-based ERP best serve? 



<p>This ERP option is the most popular and trendy of the solutions right now. If your organization is looking to stay up to date and ahead of the curve in the business world then cloud-based ERP is the way to go. If the organization operates on the go or needs remote access often then the cloud is the best choice. It is also less expensive upfront and can be implemented quicker than an on-premises system. However, working with an ERP consultant or a team is always a good idea to help lead your organization down the path to success.</p>



<p>Cloud-based ERP examples:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/consulting/sap-insights">SAP S/4 HANA</a> 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/oracle">Oracle</a> 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/adobe">Adobe</a> 
 



 Hybrid ERP systems 



<p>The hybrid ERP system is a combination of elements from both on-premises and cloud ERP systems and infrastructure. This model is for organizations with specific needs or that have strict regulatory requirements. An organization can have the benefit of on-premises ERP hardware installed for all or some of its data, while being able to scale up in the cloud. The hybrid solution is going to be a mix of public and private cloud services depending on what the organization needs.</p>



 Benefits of hybrid 



 
 Tailored: With access to both cloud and on-premises organizations with multiple locations can have remote ERP accessibility. Through an ERP hybrid system multiple types of infrastructure and public cloud services can be molded to fit the organizations needs in a way having to choose one model over the other can’t achieve. 



 Scalability: A major benefit to on-premises ERP is the ability to control the ERP system as the business changes. With ERP hybrid solutions organizations get to control the ERP system and customize on-site, while not needing any additional business-owned servers or computer equipment. 



 Security: The security risks that come with ERP cloud solutions are no longer a concern when using a hybrid model. The ERP hybrid system allows sensitive data to be protected through the on-premises aspects of the hybrid tool. 
 



 Disadvantages of hybrid 



 
 Cost: The long-term cost might be more than a cloud-only ERP system; however, the upfront costs are likely going to be less aggressive than on-premises systems. 



 Deployment: The hybrid setup brings forth some challenges, one of which is in the deployment. In the case of hybrid ERP systems, the deployment and implementation process may require more time and attention due to its unique nature. It’s important to work with a good ERP implementation team to keep the process running smoothly. 



 Oversight: Since there is an on-premises component to the hybrid solution, an internal IT department is necessary; otherwise, the ERP vendor will need to monitor the software to ensure its functioning properly. There is also less flexibility to changing the system if your organization grows over time. 
 



 Who does hybrid ERP best serve? 



<p>This is a model for specific organizations that want aspects of both on-premises and cloud. This is a more expensive option, and it will likely take longer to implement due to its hybrid features. An example of a time when an organization may switch to a hybrid model is if your organization has invested in an on-premises ERP tool and is looking to update or optimize with the cloud.</p>



<p>An example of a hybrid ERP solution is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/aws">AWS</a>.</p>



 Types of ERP and IBM 



<p>When it comes to deciding which solution is best for you it’s important to consider your organization’s needs and the future of your business. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/sap">IBM Consulting®</a> experts can help your organization successfully migrate legacy ERP applications to the cloud, redesign processes to leverage data, AI and automation, and transform finance into a competitive advantage within your business.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity is everyone’s business—as it should be, given the staggering surge in cyberattacks. Today, these attacks exhibit an unprecedented level of frequency, ingenuity and speed.</p>



<p>The cyberthreat landscape is evolving and countries such as India are facing an alarming rate of increase in cyberattacks (<a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/india-faces-staggering-90-surge-in-cyberattacks-in-q2-2023-what-you-need-to-know-article-102898125">Q2 of 2023 saw a 90% increase</a>). Driven by accelerated hybrid cloud adoption and digital transformation efforts, the region is currently a beacon of innovation and a battleground for cyberthreats. This is creating more attack opportunities and vulnerabilities for businesses than ever before.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">IBM Security® X-Force® Threat Intelligence Index 2023</a> revealed that Asia Pacific experienced the most attacks globally (31% of total incidents X Force responded to) for the second year in a row. Backdoor deployments, which enable remote access to systems, were the most common type of attacker action that X-Force incident responders handled. Furthermore, 21% of incidents saw backdoors deployed, 17% of attacks were ransomware and 41% of incidents involved phishing for initial access.</p>



<p>These attacks have an exponentially ascending impact on the reputation and bottom line of businesses. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM’s 2023 Cost of a Data Breach report</a> reveals that&nbsp;the average cost of a data breach in India has increased to an all-time high of INR 179 million in 2023, which is approximately a 28% increase since 2020.</p>



<p>As cyberthreats continue to grow in number, severity and complexity, investing in cybersecurity for Indian organizations to ensure robust provisions is the need of the hour. Businesses, regardless of their size, are recognizing the importance of a solid security strategy—especially having a strong SOC. Some are investing in expensive security infrastructure and setting up internal security teams. However, these teams often lack the expertise, skills and resources to effectively combat increasingly sophisticated threats and provide the required security armour.</p>



 Here come the MSSPs 



<p>This is where Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) come into the picture. Armed with domain expertise and provisions of scalability (hence cost effectiveness), they offer a better return on investment to the businesses that may not have expansive budgets for security. Their expert, round-the-clock monitoring and management, threat detection and incident response capabilities ensure organizations can stay resilient. Mirroring the growth of cyberattacks, MSSPs have also seen rapid growth—the APAC MSSP market is expected to touch USD 14.7 billion with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1%, with India contributing USD 2.1 billion at an impressive CAGR of 19.3%.</p>



<p>On a mission to provide robust and holistic next-generation SOC solutions to its clients, eSec Forte offers state of the art security monitoring, user analytics, security audits, compliance management, digital forensics investigation and security incident response services as a service powered by IBM Security QRadar Suite.</p>



<p>Headquartered in Delhi, India and with operations across the globe, eSec Forte’s clientele spans different industries, with a strong presence in BFSI, IT, ITES and government sectors. Due to the evolving cybersecurity risks, threats, stringent and industry-specific regulations and compliance requirements within these sectors, their clients face a unique set of challenges, making the guidance and expertise of an expert MSSP such as eSec Forte indispensable.</p>



 Why did eSec Forte choose IBM? 



<p>eSec Forte chose the IBM Security QRadar Suite as the core solution to offer a comprehensive, next-generation SOC solution for clients to effectively monitor, manage and protect their hybrid, multicloud environment, addressing the aforementioned challenges of compliance. eSec Forte evaluated and tested the functionalities of the QRadar Suite and other solutions for an array of functionalities, ease of deployment, differentiated use cases and reporting templates, architecture conducive for the MSSPs and MITRE mapping—plus several other advanced features that its customers required to address their cybersecurity needs.</p>



<p>“IBM’s deep industry expertise in security domain was a big reason. QRadar aligned with our specific requirements, enabling us to deliver comprehensive and advanced security services to clients while ensuring regulatory compliance—ticking all boxes on our checklist with satisfying results”, said Priyakant Taneja, Vice President, eSec Forte Technologies. “In addition to helping us set up the SOC, IBM also helped in building baselines, use cases and dashboards, which resulted in quicker go-to-market for us. The seamless collaboration facilitated by joint sessions and several hands-on immersive workshops, enriched by with the wealth of industry experience brought in by eSec Forte and IBM, played a pivotal role in the successful deployment of the Security Operations Center (SOC).</p>



<p>eSec Forte adopted the QRadar Suite as the preferred SOC solution that provides security intelligence by collecting and analyzing data from various sources throughout an organization’s IT environment while offering near real-time event correlation, alerting, prioritization, incident&nbsp;investigation and response.&nbsp;The solution, deployed in a multi-tenancy model, helps manage security operations for multiple clients from a centralized platform—streamlining security management, reducing complexity and enhancing operational efficiencies—while ensuring data privacy 24×7, making it a powerful platform for enhancing their customer’s cybersecurity posture. Furthermore, the SOC&nbsp;has been enriched&nbsp;with over&nbsp;15 custom apps, more than 200 advanced use cases, reports and dashboards, along with threat feeds and IOCs integration for early detection of security incidents.</p>



 What is the next frontier? 



<p>eSec Forte’s SOC migrated from an existing platform to IBM Security QRadar in Q4 2022. eSec Forte started with small EPS but has expanded multifold within one year. The in-scope sources have also increased ­to over 1000 event sources, including firewalls, DLP, WAF, SaaS applications and cloud deployments. They were able to ensure that customers could demonstrate compliance for PCI and RBI audits. What started with one onboarded customer as operations began, is now a scaled-up, immensely successful offering with several new names added to eSec Forte’s customer roster in a short span of time—a roster that includes highly regulated FinTech players and banks.</p>



<p>“We experienced a transformative impact on our business after implementing QRadar SIEM’s multi-tenancy solution. The consolidation of client environments within a centralized platform streamlined operations, improved scalability and reduced costs. It has opened up the customer expansion route for our SOC services,” Mr. Priyakant Taneja concludes.</p>



<p>Additionally, the QRadar Suite platform brings the power of AI to empower SOC teams in several ways. It offers a unified analyst experience (UAX) for quicker decision-making, provides accurate risk insights through automated AI-driven threat detection, and streamlines workflows with continuously updated X-Force expertise. With AI-powered alert triage and correlation, threats are handled efficiently upon detection, and automated investigations and response recommendations ensure a comprehensive approach to threat detection and response, enhancing overall cybersecurity effectiveness.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We are glad to have partnered with eSec Forte’s MSSP success with IBM Security QRadar. We firmly believe that&nbsp;IBM Security QRadar Suite platform embedded with enterprise-grade AI and automation will help to dramatically increase analyst productivity, help resource-strained security teams work more effectively across core technologies and provide fast and user-friendly threat hunting with&nbsp;detailed, actionable threat intelligence to identify and&nbsp;prioritize the threats that are most relevant to specific industry and region,”adds Pradeep Vasudevan, Country Leader, IBM Security Software, India/South Asia.</p>



 No more policy vacuum 



<p>Cybersecurity in business strategy is taking center stage in India. As the policy vacuum gets addressed with the new Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023, a new wave of Indian businesses will leapfrog onto the digital transformation path—however, very few have an active security strategy in place. As per the recent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/security-cyber-economy">IBV report, Prosper in the cyber economy</a>, 72% of surveyed Indian companies have a security strategy, but only 23% of those companies have started executing those strategies.</p>



<p>MSSPs such as eSec Forte are a solution to the mounting costs of securing businesses and attending to skill deficiencies to address the security gaps. Leveraging their expertise along with a trifecta of plan, upgrade and upskill are the next steps for businesses to prepare themselves for the future. MSSPs can benefit from amping up the scalability that IBM Security QRadar’s multi-tenancy solution offers and bring in the formidable force of AI, to leverage and further their security offering process, leading to rapid customer acquisition and business expansion.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of talk about how organizations can and should reduce their negative impact on the environment. While staying focused on mitigating our current and future contributions to climate change is crucial, we cannot ignore the dire impacts of existing climate hazards. Risks from wildfires, floods, heat, drought and wind have always been a concern, but climate change has intensified these risks, making them more frequent and unpredictable for organizations. This situation increases the need for businesses to adapt their sustainability strategies to address climate change issues.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/business-operations/manage-climate-risk?utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_source=Nurture&amp;utm_content=EISWW&amp;utm_term=20BJH&amp;utm_campaign=PLACEHOLDER&amp;utm_id=Managing-Climate-Risk">Learn more about managing climate risk</a>



<p>As we saw in New York in September 2023, extreme precipitation can quickly stymie the ability to conduct “business as usual” and create a ripple effect of ramifications. When Brooklyn received a month’s worth of rain in just three hours, it disrupted the functionality of roads, bridges, tunnels, railways, ports and airports.</p>



<p>Extreme weather events not only threaten infrastructure but also obstruct routes, hindering goods transportation and disrupting supply chains even in regions far from the affected area. When lumbermills were shuttered during the 2023 Canadian wildfires, the limited availability and higher price of lumber was particularly hard on the housing industry across North America.</p>



<p>In Florida and California, where hurricanes and wildfires respectively have become more rampant, some insurance providers are choosing to stop servicing these regions entirely.</p>



 What can organizations do about climate change? 



<p>Here are six climate change adaptation strategies that can help you gain data and insights for managing and minimizing the impacts of climate hazards:</p>



 Make weather predictions 



<p>Predict&nbsp;climate change risks and the impact upcoming weather events have on your business operations. In retail, for example, use future flood risk predictions to inform store location planning, raw material procurement, and inventory supply chain logistics.</p>



 Understand the impact on the business 



<p>Prepare for the various ways weather and climate change can impact your business. In the electrical utility sector, overgrowth around powerlines increases susceptibility to storm or wildfires damage. Knowing the rates at which vegetation is likely to grow along the grid network aids in effective vegetation management planning.</p>



 Be adaptive with weather protection 



<p>Protect&nbsp;your assets and ensure business continuity throughout a severe weather event—before, during and after. For instance, proactively identify high-risk assets and develop a contingency plan. Should those assets be affected, establish and clearly document and communicate risk scenario protocols, and conduct routine risk scenario planning that includes several alternative logistic routes and methods of transportation.</p>



 Develop proactive solutions 



<p>Mitigate&nbsp;risks by proactively minimizing economic and environmental damage from severe weather events. An insurer, for example, could send an SMS alert advising policyholders to move their vehicles ahead of a predicted hailstorm.</p>



 Decarbonize your footprint 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decarbonization">Manage&nbsp;your carbon footprint</a> by understanding your organization’s scope 1, scope 2, and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/scope-3-emissions">scope 3</a> carbon emissions. By doing so, you model your energy supply to help navigate and accelerate your transition to renewable energy.</p>



 Make efficient decisions 



<p>Improve&nbsp;real-time decision-making to cut costs, boost efficiency and support sustainability goals. For example, invest in technology that enables you to see the current health status of vital assets and make necessary adjustments remotely and quickly.</p>



<p>While reducing their negative environmental impact is a key concern for many organizations, adapting to climate change and its associated risks should also be a business priority. Climate hazards affect everyone, regardless of industry, geography, business maturity or level of commitment to achieving sustainability goals. A proactive approach to mitigating your business’s climate risks includes staying informed about the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/info/it-and-sustainability-report">latest developments in sustainability</a>.</p>

<p>When migrating off IBM Cloud Functions, IBM Cloud Code Engine is one of the possible deployment targets. Code Engine offers apps, jobs and (recently function) that you can (or need) to pick from. In this post, we provide some discussion points and share tips and tricks on how to work with Code Engine functions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/code-engine">IBM Cloud Code Engine</a> is a fully managed, serverless platform to (not only) run your containerized workloads. It has <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-codeengine-relnotes#codeengine-mar2221">evolved a lot since March 2021</a>, when I published the blog post “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/migrating-cloud-functions-code-to-code-engine/">Migrating Cloud Functions Code to Code Engine</a>.” In 2021, there were only Code Engine apps and jobs. <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-codeengine-relnotes#codeengine-jun2923">Earlier this year, Code Engine added support for functions</a> (Functions-as-a-Service, or FaaS).</p>



<p>In this post, I am going to take a fresh look at that topic and discuss the options on how to move from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/functions">IBM Cloud Functions</a> to Code Engine.</p>



Utilize Code Engine environment variables.



 Apps, jobs and functions 



<p>IBM Cloud Code Engine features <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-codeengine">three different ways to run your business logic</a>:</p>



 
 An app is a continuously run process that answers to HTTP requests. 



 A job runs to handle a task and then terminates. 



 A function is a stateless code snippet that is invoked by an HTTP request and, after producing a response, terminates. Moreover, jobs usually run significantly longer than functions (“batch processing”). 
 



<p>There are many more <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-codeengine">characteristics that help distinguish between apps, jobs</a> and functions. In short, apps are a good fit if you want to craft a REST API or deploy a web application with backend/frontend functionality. You have full control over the HTTP server and its resources.</p>



<p>Jobs, on the other hand, are long-running processes that do not require any user interaction. They could be typical batch activities, analytics processing or even AI model training.</p>



<p>Lastly, functions can react to incoming HTTP requests very quickly. They serve low-latency use cases well, like chatbot integrations or webhooks. In contrast to apps, you do not and cannot define and configure the HTTP server.</p>



<p>When coming from Cloud Functions, you may have experienced that there are many <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-use_cases">use cases supported by Cloud Functions</a>. Similarly, a function may have different attributes that are important depending on the case:</p>



 
 The invocation or start-up time (cold start) might be important, leading to an overall short response time. 



 In other cases, the cost (billing) might have been the competitive factor. 



 The simplicity and agility, caused by a function as unit for development and deployment in a DevSecOps process leads some projects to opt for functions. 
 



<p>Often, it is a combination of the above that leads to people preferring functions (FaaS) over other runtime or compute options.</p>



 From Cloud Functions to Code Engine 



<p>When moving from Cloud Functions to Code Engine, the following function characteristics need to be taken into account when deciding to on an app, a job or a Code Engine function:</p>



 
 Is an http endpoint needed to invoke the code? 



 Is the processing triggered by an event? 



 What programming language is used for the existing function and how big are the required libraries? 



 How long does the processing take, what compute resources are needed, is parallel processing desired? 
 



<p>The guide <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-migrate">Migrating IBM Cloud Functions to Code Engine</a> has a detailed overview with Code Engine app, job and function characteristics. They help you to select the best entity for your existing workload. Additionally, the current <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-work#fun-limitations">Code Engine function limitations</a> and the general <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-limits">limits and quotas for Code Engine</a> need to be taken into account. The section <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-migrate#fun-migrate-faqs">Migrating IBM Cloud Functions Actions to Code Engine Functions FAQ</a> might help you decide how to migrate.</p>



 Tips and tricks for Code Engine functions 



<p>The following tips and tricks are based on my experiences with moving existing code from Cloud Functions to Code Engine functions. They help in cutting down deployment cycles by first utilizing local tests to implement similar functionality in combining Code Engine functions and jobs and designing integrated APIs by making use of Code Engine system variables.</p>



 Local testing of functions 



<p>Apps are regular web applications, jobs are like scripts, and both can be tested locally in several ways. Because functions are code snippets, some wrapper is needed to turn them into programs. The following approach has served me well so far.</p>



<p>With the function code in a subdirectory “func,” I utilize either the Python or Node.js wrapper code shown below and place it in the parent directory. There, I also maintain files with test configurations as JSON objects, <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-work#functions-data">similar to what is passed by Code Engine to the function on invocation</a>. For testing, I run the wrapper along with the configuration file as parameter. The wrappers for Python and Node.js are shown below:</p>



 <code># syntax: python wrapper.py params.json

# import the Code Engine function: func/__main__.py
from func.__main__ import main
import sys, json

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # open file, read JSON config
    with open(str(sys.argv[1])) as confFile:
        params=json.load(confFile)
    # invoke the CE function and print the result
    print(main(params))</code> 



 <code>// syntax: node wrapper.js params.json

// require the Code Engine function: func/main.js
var func=require('./func/main.js')

// read the file with function parameters
const fs = require("fs");
const data = fs.readFileSync(process.argv[2]);

// invoke the CE function and log the result
console.log(func.main(JSON.parse(data)));</code> 



 Job-like functions 



<p>Sometimes, you might need the HTTP endpoint of a function and the possibly longer execution time of a job. In that case, create both a function and a job. Then, utilize the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/codeengine/v2?code=node#create-job-run">Code Engine API to create a job run</a> from within the function. In this hybrid approach, the function can get called via its HTTP endpoint and it terminates after kicking off the job run. A job could then run up to 24 hours and benefit from the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-job-run-parallel">parallel job processing capabilities in Code Engine</a>. You can find a sample implementation of this pattern in the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/CodeEngine/tree/main/function2job">Code Engine code examples</a>.</p>



 Environment variables and API design 



<p>For designing your API and functions namespace, you can utilize <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-fun-work#functions-data">Code Engine-injected environment variables</a> like <code>__ce_path</code> and <code>__ce_method</code>. The former holds the path component of the requested URL like “/object”, and the latter has the HTTP method like GET or POST. By switching on the supplied values for these variables, you can serve multiple API functions from the same Code Engine function. The benefit is a single base URL.</p>



<p>Depending on your project and code management, you might even want to combine this approach with separating each API function implementation into its own file—similar to the wrapper approach shown above.</p>



 Conclusions 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/functions">IBM Cloud Functions</a> have many use cases and properties, so there is no straightforward mapping to a specific Code Engine entity (i.e., app, job or function). By comparing an existing (Cloud Functions) function’s attribute to those of the Code Engine entities, you can pick the best fit. In many cases, a Code Engine function might be a good choice. For these cases, we shared tips and tricks that you can use for your Functions-as-a-Service project with Code Engine.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Earlier this year, Wenjing and I delved into the fascinating intersection of Digital Trust and Generative AI in an SSI Orbit podcast episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/digital-trust-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/">here</a>), which serves as an excellent primer on the subject for those unfamiliar with it. Since that episode, the landscape of generative AI solutions has undergone significant transformations, prompting us to record a follow-up discussion.</p>
<p>In this Part 2 episode, we were joined by Sankarshan, who co-chairs the ‘AI and Metaverse Task Force’ at the Trust over IP Foundation, alongside Wenjing. His insights added a valuable dimension to our conversation, particularly as we tackled prevalent misconceptions in the field of AI.</p>
<p>One key misconception we discussed is the belief that AI systems are purely statistical and random. We emphasized that, in reality, the world itself is inherently statistical, and AI systems are designed to mirror human decision-making processes, which are also based on statistical reasoning.</p>
<p>Another topic we explored is the common overestimation of AI’s logical reasoning capabilities and the underestimation of the constraints within AI systems. This discussion led us into the realm of AI governance. We debated the suitability of non-profit models for managing emerging technologies like AI, considering their capital-intensive nature and ongoing maturation. Examples like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/our-guide-to-openai-sam-altman-and-what-the-heck-happened-34da070b">OpenAI </a>and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-operating-costs/">Signal</a> were brought up to illustrate these points.</p>
<p>We aimed to focus part of the discussion on identifying practical solutions and low-hanging fruits for building digital trust tools. These tools are crucial for consumers to discern truth in an era increasingly dominated by generative AI-driven content. Additionally, we delved into strategies to mitigate and prevent the risks of AI abuse, especially as AI systems become more integrated with our daily lives.</p>
<p>A topic that resonated with me was the importance of provenance and authentication in AI systems, especially in content creation. We underscored the need for more robust tools to authenticate AI-generated content. However, we also acknowledged the limitations of current tools in ensuring provenance and their inability to address all security risks comprehensively.</p>
<p>Our discussion also touched upon the influence of human nature on AI development and governance. We pondered whether the current ideal-driven structures would evolve towards more traditional capitalist models, accompanied by regulation. This led to a broader conversation about the purpose of technology, which usually gets categorized as ‘a benefit to mankind’ by its creators. Yet, the complexity of implementing this ideal becomes apparent when considering who should govern these technologies and how they should be regulated.</p>
<p>This podcast episode not only sheds light on the complexities of digital trust in the age of AI but also opens up avenues for further exploration and discussion. As we move towards 2024, these conversations are more relevant than ever, guiding us towards a future where technology is both a tool for advancement and a subject of thoughtful governance.</p>
 
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Wenjing, Sankarshan and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 OpenAI Drama – Discussion about the recent OpenAI drama, including Sam Altman’s firing and rehiring, and Microsoft’s involvement. 
 AI Governance and AI Misconceptions – Why we should focus on AI governance rather than getting caught up in daily news and doom scenarios. Discussion about misconceptions in AI, specifically statistical and computational misconceptions. Exploring practical solutions for digital trust in AI. 
 Provenance and Authentication in AI – The importance of provenance in AI applications, such as robotics or content creation. Challenges in authentication and the need for stronger solutions. The applicability of these solutions across various domains. 
 Content Authenticity – Defining content authenticity and its governance. The distinction between machine-generated and human-verified content. 
 Digital Trust and Content Authenticity – Discussing digital trust in the context of AI. Separating protocols from end-user platforms. The role of content authenticity in digital trust. Examples of current approaches to content authenticity on the internet. 
 Truth and Trust Registries – Human pursuit of truth and the influence of context and consumption. The role of trust registries in providing inputs for trust decisions. The need for widespread inputs to aid in making trust decisions.

Aussie Innovators Join Forces to Tokenize $100T+ Assets with End to End Solution for Tokenization<p>In an exciting new partnership, <a href="https://www.redbelly.network/">Redbelly Network</a> and <a href="http://verida.io">Verida</a>, two prominent Australian web3 infrastructure projects, have joined forces to tackle the challenge of tokenizing and managing high-value real-world assets within regulated markets. Amid the plethora of choices in the web3 technology landscape, Verida and Redbelly aim to stand out by providing integrated end-to-end solutions that prioritize ease of use, and regulatory compliance, while offering control and security for&nbsp;users.</p> The Complexity of Real World Asset Tokenization <p>Real-world assets (RWAs) encompass a broad spectrum of tangible and intangible assets, including but not limited to real estate, commodities, intellectual property, and financial instruments. These assets, which are collectively valued at <a href="https://www.redbelly.network/blog/solving-a-trillion-dollar-problem-with-a-ground-breaking-australian-solution">over $100 trillion</a>, have long faced challenges in terms of liquidity, divisibility, and accessibility. Traditional methods of managing and transferring these assets often involve extensive paperwork, intermediaries, and protracted settlement times. The lack of standardized and efficient systems for tokenizing RWAs has hindered their liquidity and the ability to efficiently leverage their&nbsp;value.</p> Redbelly: Bridging Real-World Regulation with Web3 Efficiency <p><a href="http://redbelly.network">Redbelly Network</a>, a layer 1 blockchain born from the <a href="https://www.afr.com/technology/csiro-and-the-university-of-sydneys-red-belly-blockchain-breaks-new-ground-for-speed-20180913-h15byh">University of Sydney and CSIRO</a>, stands as the world’s first formally verified blockchain protocol.

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF66 is live today, Nov 30. It concludes on Dec 7. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF66  Section 5: Challenge DF Wind-down   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has three substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and earn.<br>– Challenge DF. Accurately predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are four ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), Challenge DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF66 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Challenge DF Wind-Down <p>DF66 is the final round for Challenge DF.</p><p>Starting in DF67, the 1000 OCEAN/week will be redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF.</p><p>The Active DF budget will be 37.5K / 37.5K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor DF respectively.</p><p>For more information, please read the announcement <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#d8d5">here</a>.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $24K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Nov 23, 2023: $0.46 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.071 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.46 / OCEAN * 37,000 OCEAN = $17,020&nbsp;USD  $0.071 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,100&nbsp;USD  Total: $17,020 + $7,100 = $24,120 ≈ $24K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Insurers struggle to manage profitability while trying to grow their businesses and retain clients. They must comply with an increasing regulatory burden, and they compete with a broad range of financial services companies that offer investment products that have potential for better returns than traditional life insurance and annuity products. Although interest rates have increased at an unprecedented rate over the past year as central banks attempt to curb inflation, a significant part of insurers’ reserves are locked into low-yield investments, and their investment yields won’t improve for several years (as their portfolios turn over).</p>



<p>Large, well-established insurance companies have a reputation of being very conservative in their decision making, and they have been slow to adopt new technologies. They would rather be “fast followers” than leaders, even when presented with a compelling business case. This fear of the unknown can result in failed projects that negatively impact customer service and lead to losses.</p>



<p>IBM’s work with insurance clients, along with studies by IBM’s Institute of Business Value (IBV), show that insurer management decisions are driven by digital orchestration, core productivity and the need for flexible infrastructure. To align with key imperatives and transform their companies, insurers need to provide digital offerings to their customers, become more efficient, use data more intelligently, address cyber security concerns and have a resilient and stable offering.</p>



<p>To achieve these objectives, most insurance companies have focused on digital transformation, as well as IT core modernization enabled by hybrid cloud and multi-cloud infrastructure and platforms. This approach can accelerate speed to market by providing enhanced capabilities for the development of innovative products and services to help grow the business, and it can also improve the overall customer experience.</p>



 Role of generative AI in digital transformation and core modernization&nbsp; 



<p>Whether used in routine IT infrastructure operations, customer-facing interactions, or back-office risk analysis, underwriting and claims processing, traditional AI and generative AI are key to core modernization and digital transformation initiatives.</p>



 Core modernization with AI 



<p>Most major insurance companies have determined that their mid- to long-term strategy is to migrate as much of their application portfolio as possible to the cloud.</p>



<p>When use of cloud is combined with generative AI and traditional AI capabilities, these technologies can have an enormous impact on business. The initial use of generative AI is often for making DevOps more productive. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/aiops">AIOps</a> integrates multiple separate manual IT operations tools into a single, intelligent and automated IT operations platform. This enables IT operations and DevOps teams to respond more quickly (even proactively) to slowdowns and outages, thereby improving efficiency and productivity in operations.</p>



<p>A hybrid multicloud approach combined with best-in-class security and compliance control features (such as controls IBM Cloud® is enabling for regulated industries) offers a compelling value proposition to large insurers in all geographies. Several prominent companies in every geography are working with IBM on their core modernization journey.</p>



 Digital transformation with AI 



<p>Insurance companies are reducing cost and providing better customer experience by using automation, digitizing the business and encouraging customers to use self-service channels. With the advent of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>, companies are now implementing cognitive process automation that enables options for customer and agent self-service and assists in automating many other functions, such as IT help desk and employee HR capabilities.</p>



<p>The introduction of ChatGPT capabilities has generated a lot of interest in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">generative AI foundation models</a>. Foundation models are pre-trained on unlabeled datasets and leverage self-supervised learning using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-neural-networks">neural network</a>s. Foundation models are becoming an essential ingredient of new AI-based workflows, and IBM Watson® products have been using foundation models since 2020. IBM’s watsonx.ai™ foundation model library contains both IBM-built foundation models, as well as several open-source large language models (LLMs) from Hugging Face.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supervised-learning">supervised learning</a> that is used to train AI requires a lot of human effort. It is difficult, requires intensive labeling and takes months of effort. On the other hand, self-supervised learning is computer powered, requires little labeling, and is quick, automated and efficient. IBM’s experience with foundation models indicates that there is between 10x and 100x decrease in labeling requirements and a 6x decrease in training time (versus the use of traditional AI training methods).</p>



<p>To achieve digital transformation with AI, insurance companies need to get a good understanding of structured and unstructured data, organize it, manage it in a secure manner (while complying with industry regulations) and enable instant access to the “right” data. This capability is fundamental to providing superior customer experience, attracting new customers, retaining existing customers and getting the deep insights that can lead to new innovative products. It also helps improve underwriting decisions, reduce fraud and control costs. Leading insurers in all geographies are implementing IBM’s data architectures and automation software on cloud.</p>



<p>Generative AI capabilities that enable today’s digital transformation can be placed in five domains:</p>



 
 Summarization: Transform text in large documents, voice conversations and recordings with domain-specific content into personalized overviews that capture key points (such as insurance contracts, policy and coverage documents, and responses on customer FAQs). 



 Classification: Read and classify written input with as few as zero examples (such as classifying claims requests, sorting customer complaints, analyzing customer sentiment, classifying risk during insurance underwriting and analyzing customer segmentation for insurance product development). 



 Generation: Generate text content for a specific purpose (for example, marketing campaigns with a focus on specific insurance products, blog posts and articles for various insurance-related topics, personalized customer email drafting support and code generation for use by insurance technology systems). 



 Extraction: Analyze and extract essential information from unstructured text (such as extracting information from insurance agent-filed reports, extracting medical diagnosis from physician or clinical reports for use in insurance underwriting and evaluating risk). 



 Question-answering: Create a question-answering feature grounded on specific data (for example, build policy and coverage-specific Q&amp;A resource for customer service agents). 
 



<p>As insurance companies start using generative AI for digital transformation of their insurance business processes, there are many opportunities to unlock value.</p>



<p>IBM’s work with clients shows significant productivity gains when using generative AI, including improving HR processes to streamline tasks such as talent acquisition and managing employee performance; making customer care agents more productive by enabling them to focus on higher value interactions with customers (while digital channel virtual assistants using generative AI handle simpler inquiries); and saving time and effort in modernizing legacy code by using generative AI to help with code refactoring and conversion.</p>

 Change announcements 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in November 2023, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">announced</a> the auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies to automatically protect tenants based on risk signals, licensing, and usage. This is to remind you that Microsoft will begin automatically protecting customers with Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies. These are policies that Microsoft creates and enables in customer tenants. The following policies will be rolled out to all eligible tenants:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Policy&nbsp;</p>


<p>Who it’s for&nbsp;</p>


<p>What it does&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for admin portals&nbsp;</p>


<p>All customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers privileged admin roles and requires multifactor authentication when an admin signs into a Microsoft admin portal.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users&nbsp;</p>


<p>Existing per-user multifactor authentication customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy applies to users with per-user multifactor authentication and requires multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It helps organizations transition to Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for high-risk sign-ins&nbsp;</p>


<p>Microsoft Entra ID Premium Plan 2 customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers all users and requires multifactor authentication and reauthentication during high-risk sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll begin a gradual rollout of these policies to all eligible tenants and notify in advance. Once the policies are visible in your tenant, you’ll have 90 days to review and customize or disable them before we turn them on. For those 90 days, the policies will be in report-only mode, which means Conditional Access will log the policy results without enforcing them. For more information refer to the blog, “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.”  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update on Azure AD Graph Retirement&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June of 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> that described the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will be done with incremental steps. We’re committed to supporting our customers through this retirement and migration to Microsoft Graph, and we’re committed to increased transparency and communication as we work through this change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Retirement: Stage One &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement will begin later in 2024. We’ll share a specific date in a subsequent update, with a minimum of three months of advance notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we enter this first stage, applications that are created after a specific date will encounter an error for requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net/">https://graph.windows.net</a>). We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph at this point, and we’ll provide an optional configuration to allow applications created after this point to resume use of Azure AD Graph APIs for an extended period. If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must begin planning to avoid interruption. This optional configuration can be set on an application after it is created, and the configuration change will be done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll provide more detailed guidance on the timeline for this plan and on configuring the optional configuration in our next update.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I find Applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re working to deliver a new experience to help our customers identify applications in their tenant that are using Azure AD Graph APIs. This will be enabled through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-use-recommendations">Microsoft Entra Recommendations</a> experience. We’re expecting to enable this experience in the first months of 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to audit logs behavior for custom security attributes&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning in October 2023, changes were made to custom security attribute audit logs for general availability that might impact your daily operations. If you’ve been using custom security attribute audit logs during the preview, here are the actions you must take before February 2024 to ensure your audit log operations aren't disrupted:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use new audit logs location.&nbsp; 
 Assign Attribute Log roles to view audit logs. &nbsp; 
 Create new diagnostic settings to export audit logs.&nbsp;

<p>Changing sign-in audience for new applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will change the default value of 'signInAudience' property in app registration from 'AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount' to 'AzureADMyOrg'. Our analysis shows that most new applications do not ever support users outside the application tenant. This will improve latency and security of apps. For more information on application sign-in audience, refer to the documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0#signinaudience-values">application resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling app instance lock by default&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will have “App instance lock” enabled by default. The capability called App instance lock for workload identities was launched in September 2023. This feature allows app developers to protect their multi-tenant apps from attackers tampering with critical properties. Applications created using Entra ID portal already have the setting enabled by default, and going forward, it will be enabled for other app creation surface areas such as MS Graph, PowerShell, and SDKs. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-configure-app-instance-property-locks">How to configure app instance property lock in your applications | Microsoft Learn</a>.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>My Account is replacing legacy profile page&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-new-feature-and-change-announcements/ba-p/3796396">announced</a> the legacy profile page will be replaced with a new, modernized experience. This is a reminder that My Account (<a href="https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com/">https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com</a>) will replace the existing Profile page (<a href="https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile">https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile</a>) by January 2024. My Account enables customers to manage account details, language and privacy settings, security information, and more. My Account has been around for several years and has all the functionality of the legacy profile page. This deprecation is moving customers to a better and more modern experience. No actions are required by the customers, as customers will be automatically directed to the new My Account experience. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever since the pandemic changed the corporate world, organizations have <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/covid-19-and-the-employee-experience-how-leaders-can-seize-the-moment">rededicated themselves</a> to excelling at employee experience strategy. A successful <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/employee-experience">employee experience</a> strategy (EX strategy) is the best way to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/employee-experience-still-matters-talent-retention-at-gccs">recruit and retain top talent</a>, as employees increasingly make decisions on where to work based on how they respond to employee needs.</p>



<p>Organizations can prioritize overall employee experience by being thoughtful about how to serve their workers during all stages of the employee journey, from the hiring process to the onboarding process to the employees’ work at the company to the exit interview.</p>



<p>It usually involves executives and HR leaders producing a strong and employee-centric company culture, employee engagement and performance management in coordination with each other. Each one contributes something unique to the overall employee experience, as detailed below:</p>



 
 Company culture: Building a corporate mission and values that puts employees first and creating mechanisms to put those into action. 



 Employee engagement: Creating programs and initiatives that ensure employees feel connected to their employer and comfortable and content in their jobs. 



 Performance management: Analyzing workplace performance through the use of insights and tools, which can identify ways to improve workplace performance. 
 



<p>During the early phases of the employee lifecycle, such as the onboarding experience, human resources leaders should convey to recruits and new hires the organization’s mission and how they can contribute while staying true to their authentic selves. For example, converting prospective hires to new employees can hinge on whether the organization demonstrates it will provide a positive employee experience.</p>



<p>While employees benefit from organizations prioritizing a great employee experience, their employers benefit as well, as it is likely to produce several key business benefits that impact the bottom line, including increased profitability, lower employee turnover and enhanced customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>As such, employers are incentivized to invest in the employee experience and communicate it to the overall business community as part of their company’s mission.</p>



 Five ways to improve your employee experience strategy 



<p>Focusing on providing a positive employee experience is the first responsibility. But how do you affect change?</p>



 1. Prioritize empathy 



<p>Organizations that are truly interested in creating an effective employee experience strategy should demonstrate that they care about their employee’s lives and overall health. In return, those organizations are likely to get dedicated, happy employees who want to help their organization thrive. But <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/themes/how-to-improve-the-employee-experience">empathy cannot be faked or applied in half measures</a>. The organization and its executives must make day-to-day caring for employees a key mission or value and put in the work to demonstrate they care about their employees’ well-being. They can show that by how they assign work, how they prioritize employee recognition, how they allow employees to take care of their out-of-work needs and how they communicate how an employee can maintain a strong work-life balance. To produce empathy, the organization must invest in workplace culture so their approaches feel genuine.</p>



 2. Customize initiatives 



<p>While every organization has certain foundational approaches to the employee experience that it wants to create for every employee, it may choose to customize certain elements for individual employees. One way to do this is to create employee personas, where, like customers, you put employees into groups and identify ways to appeal to them.</p>



<p>For example, some employees may have extenuating circumstances requiring them to work from home more than other employees. Some employees respond to different incentives than others. For instance, one employee may want the flexibility of working from home, while others care more about wellness benefits like better healthcare or paying for gym memberships.</p>



 3. Encourage employees to speak up 



<p>Employees want to feel included in the organization’s decisions in the work environment, especially if those decisions directly affect their lives. Encouraging employee feedback is the best way to identify new ways to improve employee satisfaction.</p>



<p>Organizations can solicit employee feedback through official employee surveys, such as engagement surveys, and other day-to-day touch points like weekly one-on-ones and creating an open door policy for direct reports. Encouraging employees to speak up when they’re unhappy or they see a way the organization can better serve their workers will improve the overall employee experience, help discover issues, and create a better employer-employee relationship. Asking employees to submit ideas for how the organization could improve is a great win-win, where employees know they’re being listened to and the organization benefits from fresh thinking.</p>



 4. Celebrate accomplishments 



<p>There are plenty of opportunities for an organization to recognize its employees. Organizations can acknowledge milestones like anniversaries or completing a large project and talk about how important that employee has been to the business. Celebrate ways the organization is succeeding as well. Track metrics like overall job satisfaction derived from surveys and honor the HR team and other stakeholders who are creating positive experiences for employees and the overall organization. Organizations can do this through traditional communication channels like email and the intranet and in small groups and individual meetings.</p>



 5. Empower middle managers 



<p>The more managers feel trusted to make important decisions, the better they will feel about their jobs. And this also improves their direct reports’ employee experience as well because they directly know and work with the people making decisions that most directly influence their jobs. Middle managers can have a huge influence on career development, employee retention and identifying and nurturing high-performing talent.</p>



<p>HR departments can work directly with managers to help them identify development opportunities they can either discuss with their direct reports in an informal capacity or turn into formal development training.</p>



<p>They also are key stewards of:</p>



 
 Pointing out how much their team members’ work has meant to the business and how appreciative the organization is for their contribution. 



 Checking in to ensure they have everything they need to accomplish their activities. 



 Asking team members how they are feeling and if there are any work-related stressors that the organization could improve or fix. 
 



 Fulfilled employees: An organization’s superpower 



<p>Creating a strong employee experience is a win-win for employers and employees. Employees are more likely to stay at organizations that prioritize their needs, and they’re also more likely to create a positive customer experience because they are happy and fulfilled at work.</p>



<p>Equip your workforce with the skills of the future. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/talent-acquisition-strategy">Transform your talent acquisition</a> and skills strategies and processes with the right balance of people, AI and data.

<p>As part of ongoing support, we are releasing two service patches against SSO 9.2 and SSO 9.3. Found within both of these patches are several corrections against SAML authentication-related issues. The SAML authentication issue has existed for a number of years, but was uncovered with improvements to SSO cacheing performed in SSO 9.2. Specifically, the Microsoft service SignIn with SAML, has permitted non-uniqued entityIDs to exist. Our improvement to caching uncovered this potential minor configuration issue, which is fully corrected in the patches.</p>
<p>Additionally, for SSO 9.2.1, we have included the recent update of OpenLDAP 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 libraries. For any customers using LDAPS, we encourage you to install one of these latest service patchs.</p>

<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) is stepping up its game in the crypto space. With its <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Consultations/2024/Consultation%20on%20Guidelines%20on%20preventing%20the%20abuse%20of%20funds%20and%20certain%20crypto-assets%20transfers%20for%20ML-TF%20%28Travel%20rule%20Guidelines%29/1063898/Consultation%20paper%20on%20draft%20travel%20rule%20Guidelines%20under%20Regulation%20%28EU%29%202023_1113.pdf">new Regulation (EU) 2023/1113</a>, open for feedback until February 26, 2024, the EBA is extending its regulatory reach, which initially kicked off in 2015, to include certain crypto-assets. This move is all about getting a better handle on tracing crypto transactions and reducing risks like money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>Here’s what’s on the&nbsp;table:</p><p>Filling in the Blanks: The guidelines zoom in on spotting and fixing missing or incomplete info in crypto transactions.</p><p>Tailored Procedures: They’re setting up ways to deal with transfers that are missing key&nbsp;details.</p><p>Risk-Based Approach: This is a big one. The guidelines give Payment Service Providers (PSPs), their intermediaries, and Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) some room to align their compliance efforts with their operational scale and risk exposure.</p><p>In this article, we dive into these guidelines, explore how they might impact various players in the crypto scene, and see how they stack up against broader EU regulations and global standards.</p> Breaking Down the New&nbsp;Rules <p>The EBA isn’t just throwing rules at the wall to see what sticks. They’ve thought this through, addressing complex tech issues&nbsp;like:</p>  Figuring out if a card or device is just for buying goods and services.  Handling tech limitations in the transfer&nbsp;process.  Dealing with different tech protocols and their compatibility (or lack thereof).  Pinpointing the exact info needed for a crypto transfer.  Managing self-hosted wallets.  Laying out duties for different PSPs in direct debit transfers.   Impact Analysis: What Does This Mean for&nbsp;Crypto? <p>If the proposed guidelines become official, the workload for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) is set to increase dramatically.</p><p>To illustrate, under the new regulations, CASPs will have to dive deeper into data collection. This includes classifying customer transactions by the types of goods or services, identifying the nature of the transaction — whether it’s for personal or business purposes, and scrutinizing transaction patterns to figure out the reasons behind payments and receipts.</p><p>The complexity doesn’t end there. CASPs must navigate the diverse protocols in the crypto and blockchain arena — some are open-network, some are closed-network, and others don’t favor any particular network. Not all of these protocols work well together, so CASPs will find themselves juggling multiple protocols to facilitate smooth transactions with each party involved. This juggling act is crucial to meet the EBA’s Travel Rule requirements, which aim to prevent data integration snags and compliance slip-ups.</p><p>Moreover, CASPs are expected to up their game in ensuring seamless and compatible information transfer in line with the heightened data requirements. They’ll need to accurately convey extensive details, including names, addresses, countries, personal document numbers, customer IDs, and even birth dates and places of the parties in the transaction.</p><p>The scenario gets even more intricate with self-hosted wallets. Previously, CASPs only needed to record wallet addresses and verify ownership for transactions above 1,000 Euros. Now, they have to individually track each transfer, whether it’s to or from a self-hosted wallet, identify the parties involved, prove ownership, and implement necessary safeguards.</p><p>Overall, CASPs are looking at a significant ramp-up in responsibilities. This necessitates more advanced technological solutions and a more thorough approach to gathering and transmitting information. They’ll have to be extra vigilant in their operations, as every aspect will demand closer attention. These enhanced obligations could lead to higher compliance costs and potential delays, especially initially due to the complexity and newness of these requirements.</p> Impact on Crypto Transactions Between an EU and non-EU Crypto&nbsp;Firm <p>Under the potential new rules, non-EU parties involved in transactions with EU-based counterparts would face broader data disclosure requirements.</p><p>This involves providing basic location information like the country name, postal codes, cities, states, provinces, and even down to the level of municipalities, street names, building numbers, and&nbsp;names.</p><p>In instances where the provided name, account number, address, and other official documents don’t clearly identify the parties involved, an extra layer of information would be necessary. This means that Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) would also need to gather and disclose personal details like the date and place of birth of the individuals participating in the transaction.</p><p>So, any non-EU crypto firms doing business with EU counterparts will need to be ready to share a lot more&nbsp;data.</p> Final Thoughts <p>As we’re in the consultation phase, it’s a waiting game to see if these guidelines strike the right balance between tight security and fostering innovation in blockchain technology. For now, it’s a matter of watching and waiting as the situation unfolds.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Keeping up with the latest security challenges can feel like you are running a race that has endless hurdles. From rapid advancements in technology – rendering old hardware obsolete – to increasingly stringent requirements and regulations, the time and costs can quickly become enormous.</p>
<p>Many of these challenges are related to the migration of compute, storage, and backup services to cloud services. Picture this, you have moved your databases to the cloud. But are you in control of your encryption keys? Do you know who has a copy or could access a copy?</p>
<p>Today’s solutions offer your organization a choice of how to most effectively secure your encryption keys. You can select a solution that allows your organization to secure your keys in an on-premise HSM or one that allows your organization to protect your keys via a secure connection to a cloud-based HSM with an HSM-as-a-Service (HSMaaS) offering such as Entrust’s nShield-as-a-Service solution.</p>
<p>Entrust recently partnered with TechValidate to conduct a survey to understand how companies view and are implementing HSMaaS solutions.</p>
<p>From On-Premise to the Cloud</p>
<p>For years, the best practice was to use an HSM deployed on-premise. Concerns about security of software based key storage, separation of keys, and sovereignty requirements made it the only viable option. Over time, as-a-service HSM offerings appeared in the market offering lower costs, and a level of security comparable to on-premise HSMs, with more flexibility and quicker implementation.</p>
<p>The Survey Says</p>
<p>Today’s organizations are looking to save time and money. The survey showed that 57% of organizations said a key reason for considering subscribing to an HSMaaS offering is to reduce IT management costs. Further, 69% of respondents said that their organizations would realize reduced spend on physical infrastructure. The next closest benefit noted was improved efficiency with 46% of the respondents selecting that benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus on saving time and reducing expenses has also been a significant driver of cloud adoption. With the rise of cloud service providers, as-a-service-HSM offerings evolved even further. Leading cloud service providers offer their own unique approach to securing your encryption keys. While these offerings provide convenience and cost-effective solutions, they do not always meet internal security requirements set by some organizations adding further to the complexity involved when deciding how to store your encryption keys.</p>
<p>In addition to saving time and money, HSMaaS solutions like Entrust nShield-as-a-Service provide the same level of support for a wide range of applications. This is something that was also reflected in the survey results. Respondents indicated that once onboarded, they would leverage an HSMaaS solution for a variety of functions.</p>
<p>The top functions ranked were public key infrastructure (PKI), which was mentioned by 60% of respondents followed by key management which was selected by 57% of respondents. Data encryption/decryption and digital signatures were also mentioned by nearly half of the respondents (49%). These results reinforce the similarities in functionality between on-premise HSM and HSMaaS offerings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Important Cloud Key Management Considerations</p>
<p>Saving time and money are necessary criteria when considering implementing an HSMaaS solution. However, they are not the only considerations you should have when deciding what as-a-service HSM offering to use when storing your encryption keys. It is important to also consider:</p>
 
 Security – Make sure you understand how the HSMaaS offering works. Are you sharing the cloud-based HSM with other users or is it for your exclusive use? This is often referred to as single-tenancy vs multi-tenancy. You must ensure that you chose the right solution to match your risk profile and requirements. 
 Sovereignty of keys. Can the HSMaaS provider guarantee what country or region your keys will physically stored in? Will you be compliant with the regulations affecting your organization? 
 Integrations and the compatibility of the key management software with other vendors. Does it integrate with the other products and services used by your organization? 
 Ease of comprehensive key management for the entire organization. Does the solution give you the ability to rotate, generate, discard, and easily access information required during an audit? 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>When evaluating these considerations and HSMaaS solutions, partnering with a company that understands your holistic security and encryption needs will simplify this process. While cost is always a driving factor, ensuring you are in control of your keys is the most important. Ensuring where your keys are stored for key sovereignty requirements, the available integrations and the key management capabilities need to be carefully reviewed. The right keys need to be stored in the right places, using a solution that will protect your business and significantly enhance your organization’s security.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Heather Flanagan, Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and David Birch, Principal at 15 Mb, author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. 
<p>This is the 100th episode of Let’s Talk about Digital Identity – in this special episode two of our most popular guests, Heather Flanagan and David Birch, rejoined the podcast to explore what is exciting them in passwordless, identity wallets and digital money.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“Passwords have got to go. As we’re moving to passkeys, I think there’s always room for improvement on – even on them. If nothing else, focusing a little bit more on the user experience so that people will have a better understanding of what this means.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Heather Flanagan, Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and choreographer for Identity Flash Mob, comes from a position that the Internet is led by people, powered by words, and inspired by technology. She has been involved in leadership roles with some of the most technical, volunteer-driven organisations on the Internet, including IDPro as Principal Editor, the IETF, the IAB, and the IRTF as RFC Series Editor, ICANN as Technical Writer, and REFEDS as Coordinator, just to name a few. If there is work going on to develop new Internet standards, or discussions around the future of digital identity, she is interested in engaging in that work.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This is episode number 100 of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And for this special occasion, we have invited back Heather Flanagan, and David Birch.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>We have invited back to the show two of our most popular guests. So, these two guests, let me introduce them is Heather Flanagan. She is Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and Acting Executive Director for IDPro. Hello, Heather.</p>
<p>Heather Flanagan: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Nice having you back.</p>
<p>And our second guest is David Birch. David Birch is an author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. He is Principal at 15 Mb, his advisory company. Hello, David.</p>
<p>David Birch: Hi. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a real pleasure having you both for this special episode, a bit different style, so being out of our usual script. But yeah, hearing a little bit more about yourselves.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to hear something in particular, because we want to hear something – a moment in your lives. So, what I want to hear – think of one specific moment in your career in which you told yourself, “Yes, this is why I love working in the identity industry.” Which moment would it be? Who wants to start?</p>
<p>David: Well, and it’s a bit self-centred, but probably when my publisher agreed to publish my first book. I thought I had some interesting ideas about identity – I mean you always think that your ideas are – but when you get that kind of validation that your ideas actually are interesting to other people. That really did change my career. Yeah, otherwise, I probably would have just carried on being a pretty average consultant and carried on in payments and banking. So yeah, it’s – but I put it all down to my publisher.</p>
<p>Oscar: Which one was this book? Tell us which book was this.</p>
<p>David: Identity is the New Money. It was Diane Coyle, the Economist, who encouraged me to publish it. So yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t have anything. I’ve been actually thinking about this question for a while, and it’s really hard to point to any one thing, because there were no lightning from the sky moments. It’s just, it’s always been such a foundational aspect of everything that I’ve ever done since I started in tech in the mid ‘90s. Where the first question was always – when you’re taking over something from a bulletin board system to an email server, “Who can access this? What permissions do they need to have? How do you set up accounts for them?” That was where everything always started. So, no one moment, it’s all of the moments.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, that’s great that there are several exciting moments. I’m sure for all of us, it’s been like that. Several moments in which we feel that this is exciting to be in this industry. But thank you for sharing that with us.</p>
<p>Being already towards the end of this year 2023 – so there are some keywords which were buzzing in the last years. But some of these buzzwords today are more reality, we have access to those. What do you think, what you feel about these technologies or techniques. And let’s get started with passwordless. So, if I ask Heather, what excites you today about passwordless?</p>
<p>Heather: I’m really excited about the fact that the technology itself is solid, the standards themselves are really, really well-done. But as excited as I am, I am concerned. Like at all the new modern technologies, I look at them and go, “Wow, that’s really cool.” and little anxiety making because for passwordless, what I observe is when you actually get out of the tech field and talk to my mother, she doesn’t trust it because it’s too easy.</p>
<p>And so, I do wonder about as bad as passwords are, the friction that they add, it’s something that people can wrap their heads around. Whereas they don’t understand the magic that’s happening behind the scenes that makes passkeys better. And if they don’t trust it, they won’t use it. And if they don’t use it, we lose out on all the benefits. So, one of the things I’ve been trying to think about for you know, the future is OK passkeys are amazing, but how can we make them less magic scary?</p>
<p>David: I’m a bit frustrated with it really, because I’m extremely lazy. And so, you know, like eBay, for example, uses passkeys, the whole thing works perfectly. So as soon as I go to a site, as in fact I just did 10 minutes ago to look at something and it’s log back in. I’m like, “What I have an account? I didn’t even know I had the account.” And then I had to remember the password. And of course, I didn’t get it. So, I had to click on, I forgot my password, and then I got the password reset. And then I put in the new password. And it said, “You can’t have a new password that’s the same as the old password.” And we just go around in this loop. And it drives me crazy. I’m like, “Why can’t you just all implement this?” Despite the fears of your mom, which I mean I can’t discount those because they’re real. The sooner we make people stop using passwords, the better.</p>
<p>I was reading a fantastic story in the Insider this morning. Did you see this story about the Zelle fraud on Insider? It’s typical kind of thing, you know, guys getting some work done by a contractor. The hackers get into the contractor’s email account, they send him a thing to send money to a different account, which is the hackers’ account. And they make off with all of the money. And so, they go and talk to the contractor and said to him, “You know, did you know that your email has been compromised, you should change your email password.”</p>
<p>And the guy, it says in the article, “We may as well have been speaking Romanian.” The guy had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. Because he’s a normal person. He doesn’t care about all of this stuff. You don’t say to people, “Oh, here’s a car, would you like a seat belt with it? Or would you like a piece of string that you could attach in, you know, particularly opt in place.” You know, as a society, it comes to a point where you say, “I’m sorry, not wearing seatbelts, there’s just too many people dying. So, cars have to have seatbelts. And you have to put the damn things on. End of story.”</p>
<p>And I sort of feel we’re getting to that point. Fraud and scam, it’s just so completely out of control. And this thing about whether you know, you need to put people in charge of their own data and so on. I just don’t believe that for a moment. I just don’t. Most people don’t have the persistent competence that – including me, by the way, I’m not casting the first stone, I’m one of those people that lacks the persistent competence to make this happen. There are reservations but passkeys are a billion times better than passwords, and we should make people use them. I’m sorry, you got to stop pandering to populism.</p>
<p>Heather: No two ways about it – Passwords have got to go. As we’re moving to passkeys, I think there’s always room for improvement on – even on them. If nothing else, focusing a little bit more on the user experience so that people will have a better understanding of what this means. And when they click this button, why would they click this as opposed to clicking something else that might be a phishing site that they wouldn’t recognise. So, it’s an ongoing education.</p>
<p>David: Then you sort of think of contactless as the, you know, in the early days of contactless people, “Oh, it’s too scary.” And in some parts of the world, it appears to be witchcraft, that you can pay for things by not touching it with your card and this, people are going to come and steal all the cards. And there are going to be people of Eastern European origin on the subway system, putting their hands inside your clothes to read your cards and all this. Remember all of this stuff that was going on?</p>
<p>And now, you walk into a store, anywhere in the world. I’m not talking America, I’m talking about developed countries, of course. You walk into a store anywhere in the world, and there’s that little contactless symbol and you pay, and you go, and no one thinks anything about it anymore. It’s a bit different in America. In America, you have to look for the till and where’s the sign? And then you have to press some buttons. And then sometimes you have to sign something as well. It’s baffling. I don’t understand any of it.</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, the day you understand what happens in the United States will be a marvellous day. Because nobody understands what happens.</p>
<p>David: No, it’s mysterious. But the point is, generally speaking, you know, we came up with this symbol, and everybody knows, you tap your card there, and it works. And guess what? All of your money isn’t stolen by Eastern European fraudsters. So, they’re not all Eastern European, obviously, other fraudsters are available. Because the corollary is going to be basically, people like us will start using passkeys, and so all the fraud will transfer onto people like your mom. That seems a little unfair to me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, seeing that you are excited indeed with passwordless. But of course, there are some concerns and some things to improve. Absolutely. Interesting what Heather said that, yeah, some people have been using password for so long, but that anything else feels like how do you say the…</p>
<p>David: An improvement? Real security? System-wide integrity? I don’t know, what’s the word you’re searching for there? I don’t know.</p>
<p>Oscar: How you say the…</p>
<p>Heather: Magic.</p>
<p>Oscar: Magic. Yeah, magic.</p>
<p>David: So, I’m excited as Heather is, I’m probably just a bit more militant on how quickly we should be pushing it out.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we’ll see what comes in the next year as how it really rolls out. But the next one is about identity wallets. So, what excites you today about identity wallets?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, I have a list on that one. I’m particularly excited over how – as much as I worry about people not understanding the magic, they do understand the concept of flipping through a wallet to get to the right card, the right credential, the right thing they need and then using it and giving them that level of control is a vast improvement, I think over some of the other technology has been going on today.</p>
<p>I’m watching what’s happening in Europe quite closely because I think that – how the governments are handling digital wallets and digital identity is a very interesting model. I will be curious to see how other countries do it. How they do it well, how they do it poorly. And if there’s some way we can actually – I’d love to standardise ‘what’s a wallet’, you know. That’s one of my little pet peeves, there is no standard for a wallet. There’s standard for credentials, but there’s not a standard for ‘what is a wallet’.</p>
<p>David: I mean, it’s interesting to see what the Open Wallet initiative and various other people are doing in this space. I agree with Heather. I think as much as the technology is important, and certainly, in technological terms, the wallet is the sort of crucial pivot between the kind of online and offline world. It’s very central to the next phase of evolution of commerce. A lot of it has to do with – in fact, we won’t even call our wallets now identity wallets, we just call them wallets. But if you actually open up my wallet, I mean, I won’t do it over there. If you open up my wallet, it has no money in it. Everything is in my wallet, it has to do with identity, driver’s licenses and loyalty cards. And my wallet is already an identity wallet, we just don’t call it that.</p>
<p>So, extending that wallet across sort of virtual and real world seems to me, pretty straightforward. But of course, that does rather interestingly open up what I think will be quite a vicious battle about who’s actually going to control those wallets. Because certainly, Heather mentioned kind of the European approach. They’re very, very unhappy with the idea of big tech controlling those wallets. We’re very unhappy with the big tech or big government controlling the wallets. People like me will prefer that it was regulated institutions – banks primarily, that control those wallets. Other people think banks should be absolutely the last people to have any sort of control over those wallets. So really, I’m not smart enough to figure out like the end dimensional gameplay as to how this is going to work out. But it’s pretty serious. It’s pretty serious.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, people understand the concept of a wallet. But what we’re talking about in today’s world is that, you know, “how many wallets are you going to have to carry?” Because there may be one that’s issued by big tech, perhaps via your browser or via your mobile device. But then, you know, as governments are saying, “No, we’re going to issue something that’s completely separate and have its own app, and what is that going to look like. And then how are people supposed to be able to find the credential they need across 2, 3, 5 different wallets?</p>
<p>David: No, I agree with you completely on that, Heather. But I think there’s another level of complexity there as well, which is – because is the wallet going to be like if you imagine there’s some kind of standard wallet, is that wallet the app? Or is that wallet, essentially the underlying SDK the apps plug into?</p>
<p>So, my British Airways app and my Barclays Bank app, they’re all actually the same wallet underneath. They’re all plugging into the same wallet. But is it going to be like that? Is there going to be like a travel industry wallet? Or is British Airways going to have its own wallet? That’s really hard to know. I would think, and this comes from kind of what I think is a reasonably rational calculus. The credentials that are going to be in those wallets are the embodiment of individual reputations.</p>
<p>My British Airways credential is the embodiment of my relationship with British Airways, that I want to take and show to other people. It’s not obvious to me that British Airways would benefit from owning the wallet, because they’d have to maintain it and upgrade it and whatever. They’re having enough trouble just with their own website to do that. On the other hand, I can see why they’d be nervous about just handing the whole thing over to Apple and Google, because then they’ll end up paying a tax, which I’m pretty sure they don’t want to do. So, I don’t know how that’s going to work out. But I listen to a lot of smart people about this. It’s a very fascinating topic to me.</p>
<p>Heather: I talked to Don Thibeau and Juliana Cafik and a couple others about “what was the Open Wallet Foundation trying to do?” And they’re trying to work towards interoperability in code and maybe a standard will come out of that someday when they see what works and what doesn’t work. But at the moment, they are not standardising wallets. They’re just…</p>
<p>David: No, that’s true. There’s…</p>
<p>Heather: They’re just putting together a platform to try and make it work together.</p>
<p>David: But as you pointed out earlier on, some of the components are standardised. We have VCs, we have MDL. We’ve got MDL 7 and 9 coming in a few months, a year or something. So I mean, there is some pretty useful standardisation going on anyway.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, more in the credential format space.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That might give us enough interoperability to get started.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. Indeed, it sounds like it’s…</p>
<p>David: I’m a naturally simple and optimistic person. Heather’s looking at all the nuances here. And that’s why she’s so, that’s why my superficial, cheery approach to this – it’s not washing with her I can see it from her face.</p>
<p>Oscar: You seem to be both excited about identity wallets, I think.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I think wallets are really interesting topic for the coming year.</p>
<p>Heather: Huge potential.</p>
<p>Oscar: You, David, mentioned that as far as I understood, you don’t carry cash anymore, that was my understanding how you have your wallet, your real wallet without cash.</p>
<p>David: No, actually, I mean I don’t carry my real wallet, it’s in the drawer over there. So, I had an interesting conversation with somebody last week about premium cards. That’s how interesting my life is, Heather. I just, I benchmark, I had an interesting discussion with someone else last week about premium cards. This is a tragic trajectory of my life.</p>
<p>But I have this fancy new American Express Platinum Card, which is made out of some sort of metal. I don’t know if it’s actually platinum, but it’s sort of metal. And it’s really fancy and heavy and solid and whatever. And I couldn’t even tell you where it is. It’s in the house somewhere. I haven’t the slightest idea.</p>
<p>Oscar: Don’t activate it.</p>
<p>David: No, no, because as soon as I got it, it’s on my phone. I only ever use it on my phone. I don’t know where the actual card is, I have no interest in that. I’m going into London in a minute, I have a ring. So, the ring I use for getting on the subway and bus because I don’t always want to take my phone out. But if I’m paying in a restaurant so I got to use my phone. I think the days of physical wallets, I mean, lots of people keep saying, well, there’s going to be a backlash at some point, and people are going to want to use cash, sort of the way they want to use vinyl records, I suppose. But I think that will just be like a few hipsters. I don’t think it’ll be the rest of us.</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t trust having network access consistently enough to go without some kind of physical something. Do I use my wallet on my watch and my phone more often than not? Well, when I’m in Europe, yes. When I’m in the US, maybe. I don’t count on it. I don’t think I can count on it yet. So, there’s always the physical components that I think I have to have.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I would say that’s an interesting argument in favour of using offline verifiable credentials. And it’s also a crucial argument in favour as to why Central Bank Digital Currency should operate offline. So, I mean, I agree with you about that. As to the state of things at the moment, well, if the transit gates fail and can’t go online, they have to fail open, it’s a public safety issue. You can’t fail transit gate shut. So, they have to, they should have – I can always get home, you know, but it’s never happened. But when push comes to shove, I’ll get home, so I’m fine.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and that related to my last question, but just to hear what you liked the most. So, what excites you about this digital money that we were already starting to discuss?</p>
<p>David: I’d say there’s probably three things. I mean, Heather’s going to disagree with me on every single one of them, which is why it makes for an interesting conversation. But I’d say there’s probably three things.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is digital money, well, certainly digital currency is the subject of irrational delusional comment by conspiracy theorists, which makes for entertainment. So, I get emails, “oh, you know, Central Bank Digital Currency is the mark of the devil. And we know this because Bill Gates implanted microchips in us through the vaccine, and the microchips are going to steal the digital currency from unvaccinated people and send it through the 5g towers to Satan.” Or somebody, I can’t remember exactly, I don’t remember. But you get emails like this, which add to the gaiety of the nation.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is, there are parts of America where non-existent digital currency is already being banned. So, this is all getting a bit, sort of witch trail-y, so that’s quite entertaining.</p>
<p>The second thing is, and I wasn’t joking about that offline point, which is any scale digital currency in any developed country, even where you have networks and infrastructure has to work offline. It’s the crucial design requirement of it. If you’re going to have a cash substitute, it has to work offline. And that, for me, poses very interesting technological problems, all of which I think, have already been solved. But nonetheless, it’s really intellectually interesting, so I sort of like that.</p>
<p>And the third thing is, I think a lot of people look at digital currency as ‘the thing’. Like, you know, we need digital currency. And that’s it. I mean, what we need is a platform for innovation and development. Digital currency in itself is sort of not that interesting. As we’ve just established, I can already buy milk in the supermarket without using physical cash. So that’s not, but this idea of permissionless innovation that you could bring into our space from the cryp– because digital it doesn’t involve any credit risk, you see. So, you could imagine a situation where as long as you’ve got an approved chip in your iPhone, or something, they’re certified as being capable of storing digital dollars or something like that, then you can use the API to do whatever you like, there’s no credit risk involved. So, allowing people to experiment with interesting new things – micro payments, and Escrow and blah, blah, blah. On top of it is really where it’s at. And that’s why, you know, I get it a bit when people say, “Well, what are the sort of key uses?” Well, I don’t know, I’m too old. Give it to some kids in a garage and let them come up with something.</p>
<p>Heather: OK. So, for one thing, I really want to see your emails about this because they sound hilarious. I admit, I’m absolutely a digital currency sceptic. For one thing, as David has said, right, you don’t generally need to carry cash now anyway, so what is it getting you? And everything I understand about it is like, “Well, yes, but then you’ll be able to transfer money quickly without the bank getting in the way.” And I’m like, “Hmm, you say the bank getting in the way and verifying the transaction is a bad thing.” “Oh, but it’s expensive.” And I’m like, “Well, that’s a different problem, not just because the banks are charging a lot.” So that’s like a completely different problem to solve that it’s not a technology problem at all.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’m definitely not convinced. Having the permission to innovate and work with this kind of currency, to me in a way, that’s like saying, “Yup, let’s turn this into a barter system, except you’re bartering these digital currency components.” “OK. Go for it, go to town.” That’s just people agreeing with each other. And it’s a completely different system in the same way that a barter system is completely different with my cash system.</p>
<p>David: That’s a really interesting point. And I don’t mean that in any sort of patronising sense, I really mean that because you’re right, of course. And what that means is, if this stuff worked, then downstream you could imagine an environment where if you and I engage in some sort of transaction, right, I’m going to pay you to write something or you’re going to pay me to come and speak or something like that. My, you know, supercomputer at the end of a wire, it can be a through my mobile phone, my giant killer robot artificially intelligent wallet will negotiate with your super intelligent giant killer robot Terminator wallet to exchange baskets of tokens to an agreed –</p>
<p>The idea that you would need money as an intermediary when you have that kind of barter that works. I think that’s really, that’s as a very interesting point. So, if our super computers could agree on these baskets of assets to exchange, which sounds weird when its people talking about it, but it’s a few nanoseconds for super computers. Why would you turn those assets into dollars or something in the first place? Why wouldn’t you just swap the assets around?</p>
<p>So, I actually rather agree with that point. But I think that’s much further downstream. I think, in the short term, you see the demand for dollar stable coins in particular, as an indication to me that a lot of people around the world and in America, for that matter, wants to hold digital dollars. They would find digital dollars useful to do things with that you can’t do with regular dollars, and I sort of agree.</p>
<p>So, I can see sort of both things. But to me, the short term and the long term are quite different there. Because I probably do drink my Kool Aid, and I’d probably do think that that’s kind of a stupid expression actually it’s, don’t drink that Kool Aid because everybody that drank the Kool Aid died, didn’t they? Or am I getting the stories mixed up?</p>
<p>Heather: I wasn’t going to say it.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, no, I think they did. OK, that’s a bad example. But the point is, I think in the long run, you might well be right. I think in the short term, digital currencies, I think would add to the net welfare. I mean, I can imagine, you and I agreeing to something, and the money just goes from my digital wallet to your digital wallet. It never goes anywhere near the banking system. It just goes over Bluetooth or whatever but yes. It is exciting. That’s true.</p>
<p>Oscar: Heather, what’s not so exciting to digital money?</p>
<p>Heather: We’ll see.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. We’ll see. Anything else that it’s for you is exciting?</p>
<p>David: What’s not working digital money, you know, these answers are intertwined, because the thing that’s broken in digital money at the moment, is identity, not the payment bit. Like the reason why you’ve got Zelle frauds and authorised push payment frauds and these massive crypto scams going on all the time. It’s because nobody knows who anybody is. It’s not because the payments don’t work properly. It’s because identity doesn’t work properly.</p>
<p>If the identity, you know, I’m going to sound like a broken record on this one for the teenagers there. I’m going to sound like a vinyl implement that used to go around whether it has a scratch in it. So, this sort of needle would prompt up, down and come back to this, I have to talk them through this metaphor. But I’m going to sound like a broken record on this. Because if you fix the identity problem, payments are easy.</p>
<p>If you know the reputation of all of the counterparties in a transaction, then pricing the risk in that transaction is easy. And that’s kind of what we should be aiming for. The next phase of evolution is really about identity. It happens that I think, and I can’t prove this with any kind of actual analysis, this is just my sort of crackpot theory about this. But actually, if central banks do drive forward with digital currency, digital currency doesn’t work unless you have digital identity. You can’t give people wallets unless you know who those people are. You can’t maintain limits on personal holdings unless you know who’s got the wallets. There must be an identity system for the currency system to work. So it could be that Central Bank Digital Currency actually turns out to be a vector for people like Heather to actually get something done about wallets and digital identity. So, there’s an interesting interrelationship there.</p>
<p>Heather: They are certainly tied together. There’s no two questions about that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Anything else that you think that is exciting today in the identity world that we have not covered?</p>
<p>David: Well, there’s two things I’m excited about today. I can tell you what I was doing before I came on this call. So, one is – I’m very excited about only because I’m not a normal person. I’m very excited about ultra-wideband technology. So, all iPhones for a while, you know some of the top end Samsung’s you know Apple Air Tags, things like this, they all have this thing in them called you UWB, Ultra-Wideband which a lot of people kind of overlook a little bit because we focus everything on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. But when Bluetooth and Wi Fi came out there were actually three wireless standards. There was Bluetooth, UWB and Wi-Fi. And UWB never really got used because the Wi-Fi chips got cheaper much quicker, and everybody just started building Wi-Fi into things. And meanwhile Bluetooth ranges went up.</p>
<p>But ultra-wideband, which is short range, medium speed that uses this pulsed radio. Because of the way it works, it can only tell where things are, this is how Air Tags work. But it can also tell whether you’re moving towards something or away from it. So, this idea of having a phone that knows you’re walking up to the point-of-sale terminal or knows you’re walking up to a door. And the way that Apple are part of this digital car keys alliance, which I’m very interested in with Google, and I think BMW and people like that.</p>
<p>So, this idea that you have one technology like this, which locates you, you’re walking towards the POS terminal, and then it flips to Bluetooth to execute an actually secure transaction with real cryptography, and real keys. I’m really interested in that at the moment for a variety of different ways. So that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>And the second thing is, and I think we have touched on this before, we think of identity as being about people. But actually, everything needs identity. And when everything has an identity, working out how to get both privacy and security in that environment is really rather complicated. It’s very intellectually challenging. And that’s what I’m spending the rest of my time on with another startup at the moment. So yeah, there’s no end of things to be excited about in this space, honestly. And frankly, figuring out how people can log into their bank account without password is the least interesting of the things that’s going on at the moment.</p>
<p>Heather: Probably the most interesting thing that I’m trying to stay on top of right now is watching the standards development space, because that is like one of my favourite things to do. Because I might also be a little bit of a strange person. So, standards development space, seeing how ISO, the IETF, the W3C, as well as some of the smaller standard’s organisations like the OpenID Foundation, the Decentralised Identity Foundation, Trust Over IP, how they’re all circling closer and closer to each other and sometimes hitting each other, bouncing off.</p>
<p>You know, it’s becoming a really dense space to try and follow and understand what’s happening with W3C verifiable credentials? How do those relate to the ISO MDOC standards, and what’s happening with the IETF’s OAuth and CBOR and you know, all of these different standard’s groups are all starting to get closer and closer at nibbling down this problem. And they’re never going to succeed because they’re reaching the point where it’s not a technical problem anymore. It’s a societal problem. And the regulators are starting to move ahead of them and saying, “No, this is what, you know, we need to happen. And it’s not about technology, as much as it is sometimes about the society and the cultural requirements.” So, seeing these organisations tighten up, it’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>David: I was just going to ask you, because I’ve sort of lost the thread on this a little bit, because unless you follow it with minute detail every day, you don’t. I wonder if the whole kind of MDOC thing doesn’t have its own momentum. So, in other words, in a lot of circumstances, you can see why people are going to go to MDOC and MDL part 5, even for something that’s not a driving license, just because. It reminds me a little bit, and here’s another one of the teenagers, it reminds me of X.500. Because having spent part of my young life, she doesn’t even know what X.500 is, how he’s been part of my – X.400 was the ISO messaging standard that existed before the internet and that no longer exists. And X.500 was the directory standard for that. And that no longer exists. An X.509 was the standard for exchanging public keys in that directory. And X.509 version 3 is how everything works on the internet.</p>
<p>So, the whole of X.400 has disappeared, the whole of X.500 disappeared. And I just wonder if MDL isn’t going to be in the same place, like people are going to end up using MDL just because it exists. It may not be the optimum for a lot of the appli– but it doesn’t matter. The format exists. Wallets can understand it. Apple and Google Wallets can understand it. The MDOC stuff will carry on standardising, and I think maybe a lot of stuff will just get sucked into that.</p>
<p>Heather: What’s getting complicated about it – is the MDL standards. They are in their own way the X.509 to the modern world. They’re specifying a credential. This is a discrete concrete, and this is what this is supposed to be used for. It is your driver’s license. It is your identifier. Verifiable credentials using W3 capital V, capital C verifiable credentials. That’s not what they are really, those are much more generic thing that’s actually more an authentication thing. So, the fact that they’re hitting each other in the ways that they are is very interesting and a little disturbing. And the fact that the browser vendors are debating within themselves, which one they’re going to support when ultimately, they serve different purposes, I worry that we’re going to be driven towards…</p>
<p>David: No, no, I… your analysis is spot on. I agree with you completely Heather. I’m just saying that in practice, what seems to be happening is like people like me would say, “Well, actually…” you know, use the canonical example going into the bar, you know, people like me would say, “Well, you should be presenting an ISO W3C verifiable credential that says that you’re over 18 or over 21. So, I’m going…” But that doesn’t exist. The standard for the credential exists, but the contents, whereas on MDL, OK, that’s not really what it was meant for. But actually, demanding to see your MDL driver’s license, I can do because the standard exists. And I, you know, so I agree with your analysis. I’m just saying I wonder if actually, well, Trust Over IP and all these other things are kind of circling around, bumping into each other. MDOC is just steadily progressing, you know.</p>
<p>Heather: Told you Oscar, I told you, you’re going to have all sorts of fun things to talk about.</p>
<p>David: He’s going to get very bored on our – just our island, Heather. Like after the plane crashes, we’re going to be fine. He’s going to be, I don’t know what he’s going to do all day, making those little token at men or something.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fantastic. Hearing all this from you. You’re definitely super passionate about – many of these things that you’re talking about, frustrated about some of them, but yes, super excited about most of them. So, thank you very much for joining us in very special episode for us. So, thank you very much. And please tell us how people can learn more about you, Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, easiest thing is – go to LinkedIn and find me there. I check it every day. It’s one of my major social media accounts.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I spend more time on LinkedIn now since Twitter kind of went all weird. So, I mean, I’m on LinkedIn too. But it also you can just look up www.dgwbirch.com.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, thank you very much. So, let’s see how exciting comes the next coming months, years and yeah, how all the things we were discussing today will roll out. So, again, thanks a lot and all the best.</p>
<p>Heather: Great. Bye</p>

   Evaluate your access management (AM) strategy with guidance from Gartner 

<p>Access management (AM) has become instrumental in fueling business growth while protecting against modern attacks. Today's economic environment makes AM even more critical, with enterprises seeking a converged access management solution that can address myriad use cases for multiple populations. But what capabilities should you prioritize for your organization?</p>

<p>The 2023 Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Access Management report is a technical companion to the Gartner Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management. While the Magic Quadrant provides an overview of a vendor including its market share, Critical Capabilities is purely a technical analysis of a vendor's products and services.</p>

<p>This year Gartner scored 11 vendors against four common use cases, including workforce access management, business-to-consumer access management (B2C), business-to-business access management (B2B), and application development.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce that ForgeRock received the highest scores in two of these use cases, namely B2C and B2B customer access management.</p>

 11 critical capabilities to consider for your 2024 roadmap 

<p>In addition to the four use cases, Gartner outlines a set of critical capabilities essential for any organization's access management strategy:</p>

  Core Access Management 
	 User Authentication 
	 Authorization and Adaptive Access 
	 Portable Identity Integration 
	 Business to Business 
	 Business to Consumer 
	 Customization and Extensibility 
	 API Access Control 
	 Threat Reporting and ITDR 
	 Resilience 
	 Ease of Deployment 
  ForgeRock understands your business to the core 

<p>Our commitment to simplifying complex user journeys can be a differentiator for your business. We support various delegated administration approaches for B2B capabilities, all orchestrated seamlessly through <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, our comprehensive catalog of global and regional cloud identity provider connectors, integrations with government IDs, customizable consent flows, self-service social identity registration, and a <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/marketplace/">marketplace</a> featuring a wide array of identity verification providers and wallets make us a solid choice.</p>

 We give you ultimate control 

<p>Customizability and extensibility are paramount for large enterprises and their unique use cases. Our solutions offer the flexibility and power required for different <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">deployment models</a>, while our Intelligent Access orchestration (“Trees”) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/sdk">SDKs</a> simplify integrations for developers. We also provide robust support for integrations with both our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">identity gateway</a> and third-party API gateways.</p>

 Deploy identity your way 

<p>ForgeRock embraces flexibility when it comes to identity deployment. Whether you prefer a fully cloud-based approach, on-premises solution, or a hybrid environment for gradual migration, we've got you covered. Recognizing the challenges of migration from legacy solutions, we've introduced <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">pre-configured accelerators</a> to facilitate co-existence with, and migration from, Oracle Access Manager and Broadcom CA SiteMinder to the ForgeRock Identity Cloud.</p>

 Ultimate security without sacrifice 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">ForgeRock Autonomous Access</a> employs a unique blend of AI, machine learning, and pattern recognition to detect threats at the identity perimeter. Notably, we've addressed the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-attackers-are-circumventing-mfa-and-how-stop-them">rising challenges in MFA</a> with features such as MFA push authentication with context and push authentication with number matching, enhancing both security and user experience. ForgeRock also supports <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> capabilities through FIDO2 WebAuthn standards and passkeys within the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a>.</p>

 ForgeRock and Ping Identity: A Winning Combination 

<p>I'm thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html">Ping Identity</a> received the highest scores in one use case and the second highest in the three other use cases in the Gartner Critical Capabilities for Access Management research. To us, this recognition underscores Ping Identity's excellence and deep understanding of the AM market. Read more on Ping's performance <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2023/ping-identity-leader-gartner-critical-capabilities-access-management-2023.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The results of the Gartner research speak for themselves. And now, by uniting together as <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/lp/pingandforgerock.html?utm_source=forgerock&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=forgerock">one company</a>, we are able to offer customers greater choice and flexibility to address their unique use cases for all identity types. We're confident that with our strong product offerings reinforced by our years of experience, we can help you become better positioned to innovate your identity roadmap today and well into the future.</p>

<p>I invite you to download the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-gartner-critical-capabilities-access-management">Gartner Critical Capabilities report</a> to gain deeper insights into access management capabilities and how you can elevate your IAM strategy.</p>

 The future of digital finance is evolving, and it’s happening just in time 



<p>Over the last few years, the move to digital finance has accelerated. Consumers are adopting emerging financial apps and services, empowering them to take control of their financial health. The same technological leaps that are enhancing payments, financial management and banking are also changing lending for the better, and they couldn’t have come at a more opportune time. </p>



<p>That’s because consumers are feeling the impact of economic uncertainty and worry about the effect that it may have on them. In a 2023 survey, Mastercard spoke to 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the U.K., Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences. &nbsp;</p>



<p> Over 89% of respondents say that they’ve been negatively affected by economic uncertainty. &nbsp;</p>







<p>At the same time, whether they’re making big purchases like homes or handling everyday needs like transportation or food, consumers worry that they won’t be able to borrow what they need. &nbsp;</p>







<p>Open banking data can help consumers get to the bottom of these challenges.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, open banking allows consumers to permission access to their bank account, allowing lenders to augment their credit decisioning models with real time information that gives a better view of the consumer’s ability to repay a loan.&nbsp;That’s important because 95% of those who have been denied a loan in the past two years want more insights into the lending process. People are willing to share secure access to their bank account data, if it means better interest rates, instant approval for a loan, improved chances of being approved for a credit card or to secure an increase in the limit on a credit card.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenders benefit, too. By augmenting traditional credit models with open banking, they can improve operational efficiencies, lower costs and create innovative new lending models that can give consumers the credit they deserve, when they need it.  &nbsp;</p>



 The world is going digital 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report <a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

				  Decentralized identity technology is increasingly being adopted to quickly and securely share data in the private and public sectors. With widespread interest in the technology’s ability to create verifiable data and streamline processes, the question of how you create a solution has never been more important.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>More people are interested in verifiable credentials and decentralized ecosystems than ever— which is awesome to see! But as new people enter this space the amount of information and the options available can be complicated and overwhelming. For those seeking to learn about the technology, the fundamental concepts, and how it works, Indicio recommends this quick, but comprehensive, <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/beginners-guide-decentralized-identity/">Beginner’s Guide</a>. But once you have decided that a decentralized solution is what you want for your organization, there are several things to consider when it comes to actually making a purchase.</p>
<p>Vendor / Platform lock-in</p>
<p>Being locked into one vendor or platform can have downstream consequences: surprise costs, slow responses to adding new competitive features, and the risk that should something happen to the vendor, your platform suddenly becomes unsupported. In today’s business world, vendor lock-in is often seen as unavoidable for some things; for example, many companies are reliant on Microsoft for their entire office suite and the licenses they can provide. But it simply doesn’t need to be like this for your decentralized identity solution — and shouldn’t be. The space is new and growing so fast that it doesn’t make sense to tie your hands to a proprietary solution from a particular provider.</p>
<p>Instead, do as we do: Indicio builds on open-source technologies whenever possible. For example the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven™</a> line of products are built on the open-source <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy">Hypereledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries</a> codebases. Open source gives you freedom: freedom to build what you need to succeed, freedom to add what you need when you need it to meet opportunities, and most importantly — freedom to walk away.</p>
<p>Open source codebases incubate innovation and resilience: the more people using the code, the more it is tested, the better it becomes, and the quicker it evolves. However, do note that open source comes in two flavors: free and supported. Many companies opt for a supported solution (e.g., the Red Hat model), which saves their developer teams from having to climb the learning curve of unfamiliar codebases and frees them to focus on business solutions. Indicio provides supported open-source product solutions, both pre-designed and customized, so that you get to implementation as quickly as possible and have all the technical support you need to grow.</p>
<p>Do they sell all the pieces you need?</p>
<p>There are four major pieces of technology that form a working decentralized ecosystem for the secure exchange of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<p>Issuer agent— for creating and issuing a credential</p>
<p>Mobile wallet — for holding and presenting a credential</p>
<p>Mediator — coordinates messages between wallets on mobile devices and verifiers / issuers</p>
<p>Verifier agent — for verifying the credential</p>
<p>Not all vendors sell these as a package. Some only have one or some of the parts to create the functionality you want. It is important to understand exactly what it is that you’re getting. Just being able to download a mobile wallet will not give you the ability to create your own credentials.</p>
<p>Indicio offers each of these components separately if you want, (learn more about our mobile wallet <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, or play with <a href="https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/">one of our mediators</a>), but if you are seeking to implement a complete ecosystem, it is better to buy a complete ecosystem. That way, you get everything “in the box,” so to speak, and you know that everything will work together smoothly. This was the impetus for Indicio to create Proven as a complete, off-the-shelf ecosystem.</p>
<p>Interoperability</p>
<p>The world will never operate completely on one system. The more credential formats your decentralized solution supports, the more people will be able to use and benefit from it. Building this kind of support into solutions takes time and money, so not all vendors provide it or plan to do so, and instead pick a format in hope that it will become the format that catches on and everyone uses.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how this can go wrong, building special integrations for Internet Explorer would have looked like the smart move in 2009 when it had <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/worldwide/2009">65% of internet browser market share</a>, but today, even after a rebrand to Edge, it is now <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">hovering at just over 5%</a>, and only 5% of customers being able to use your integration would be severely limiting to your business.</p>
<p>Indicio is committed to building as much interoperability into our solutions as possible, commonly using a variety of verifiable credential formats including Anoncreds, SD JWTs, JSON-LD, JSON-LD BBS+, Open Badges 3.0, W3C, and Mobile Drivers Licence. Our team has years of experience implementing successful solutions, and we can advise you on the credential types that best meet your use case’s requirements, or help build a custom solution using an additional credential type your organization needs.</p>
<p>Network</p>
<p>You’ll need to host your verifiable credential solution on a blockchain-based distributed ledger network — or have someone else take responsibility for writing credential data to the ledger. Either way, you’ll want to make sure that the network supporting your solution meets your needs.</p>
<p>A distributed ledger network, typically, consists of several networks: one for developing and testing a solution, one for demonstrating a solution, and a main or production network to support your finished product. There may also be a temp network for stress testing, which gives you the freedom to push your solution to breaking point and easily reset, something better done before going to market.</p>
<p>In all cases, there are several important questions: how much does it cost to use each of these networks (singly or bundled), including how much does it cost to write credentials to the main or production network and, if necessary, revoke them? How much will it cost to scale your solution, and whether “all-you-can-write” packages can simplify payments and deliver significant cost savings in the medium and long term.</p>
<p>Second, what kind of technical support or support packages are provided? If you are new to verifiable credential technology, is there full customer onboarding and operational support for each network? What kind of engineering support is there for solutions that are mission-critical?</p>
<p>You’ll also want to assess the network’s performance by asking for uptime metrics and ask how the network is monitored to ensure that any problems can be quickly addressed. (For example Indicio’s network has a 99.97% uptime)</p>
<p>In terms of resilience, you’ll need to know how many nodes support the network and how extensive their geographic distribution, as some customers, particularly governments, have regulations on where nodes can be hosted.</p>
<p>Governance</p>
<p>What rules will be in place for your decentralized ecosystem? Who will implement these rules and how will they be integrated into the system? While your solution might function from a technical standpoint, its usability in the field depends on governance. When considering a solution or provider, examine how rules such as trust lists for approved credential issuers are implemented. How are credentials verified in near-offline or offline conditions? Governance in decentralized identity often seems complex. It doesn’t need to be.</p>
<p>Indicio developed machine-readable governance to deliver this simplicity. This enables governance rules to be published in a machine-readable format (currently in development as a specification at the Decentralized Identity Foundation), propagated to all participants in a decentralized identity ecosystem, and cached in their software. This enables the governance authority responsible for the use case to quickly implement system-wide rules and rule changes, manage trust lists and provide offline verification. Indicio developed a <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">Governance Editor</a> to simplify creating the governance files. You can try it out <a href="https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/Indicio-tech/governance-editor/tree/main">here.</a></p>
<p>We hope this article gives you a decent starting place when evaluating your options for a decentralized solution. You can never ask too many questions, especially when building something to last. If you have an idea for a decentralized identity ecosystem the Indicio team is ready to answer any questions or help you get started, you can <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out here.</a></p>

<p>Use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/certificate-solutions/learn/certification-authority-authorization">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)</a> was mandated for TLS certificates in September 2017. The primary purpose of CAA is to allow the domain owner to authorize specific CA(s) to issue TLS certificates for their domains. It also prevents other CAs from issuing TLS certificates for those domains. CAA limits the risk and scope of certificate issuance to only approved CAs.</p>
<p>When the Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) Requirements were introduced in July 2021, CAA was included with the “issuevmc” record. It was important to have a new record, so TLS CA authorizations would not impact VMC issuance.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/smime-br/">S/MIME Baseline Requirements</a>, there is now a place to provide standard requirements for S/MIME certificate issuance. One goal was to extend CAA to email addresses for the issuance of S/MIME certificates. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9495.html">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Processing for Email Addresses- RFC 9495</a> has just been published to support this requirement and provide the “issuemail” record to permit CAs to issue S/MIME certificates.</p>
<p>The standard CAA record form for email addresses would look like this:</p>
 
 mail.client.example &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAA 0 issuemail “authority.example” 
 
<p>The “authority.example” identifying domain value would be provided by the CA in their CPS. The Entrust CAA identifying domain is “entrust.net”.</p>
<p>Domain owners are encouraged to use CAA to streamline the CAs that can issue TLS, VMC, or S/MIME certificates for domains. From a risk mitigation point of view, this stops CAs from issuing requests that have not been approved. An unapproved CA request could come from an attacker or could also come from a colleague who is not familiar with your CA selection process.</p>
<p>Note; There has been no CA/Browser Forum ballot to date, so the S/MIME Baseline Requirements have not been updated to require CAA to be checked before issuing S/MIME email certificates. We expect a CAA checking requirement to be added to the S/MIME BRs within the next year.</p>

<p>In brief, the Client Credential Grant permits an application (or client) the ability to request an access token. This token is used instead of having the application configured with an administrator password, thus being more secure.</p>
<p>Ubisecure’s <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9138405377/Client+Credentials+Grant+reference+-+SSO">Client Credentials Grant</a> implementation supports two key use cases for the flow.</p>
 
 Authorised Access use case, also known as Common flow – the Client’s access token is used to impersonate the client and request resources from other servers or applications. 
 A lessor used, but available within the specification, configuration method is the Single application use case. In this flow a server is using its own credentials to access local resources on the same server, requiring user’s access rights. 
 
 Improved Stability 
<p>Also found in this development cycle are several smaller stability improvements. Memory and cache cleaning improvements will help environments with very long uptimes or very high utilisation for SSO. For CustomerID we have resolved a number of registration work-flow errors that could result in additional manual clean-up requirements of the LDAP directory.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>With the CI running updates continuously for many of the utilised third-party libraries, we have been able to focus on additional security items. We have updated OpenLDAP MDB to 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 – an essential update as OpenSSL v1 is no longer being maintained. This OpenLDAP update has been backported to IDS 2023.1 release (SSO 9.3, in SSO 9.2.3).</p>
 Improved Information 
<p>Addressing a concern raised by a number of customers, we’ve also reorganised the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9103376399/Change+Log+-+Identity+Platform">Change Log for Identity Server</a>.&nbsp;With this new format, you can quickly see which version of SSO should be grouped with which version of CustomerID and if there have been essential patches to each core application.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>Over the coming winter, we will be focusing on essential improvements around Swedish BankID, namely the support of the required animated QR codes. We’ll also be performing essential life-cycle management updates – we expect you to be able to see these clearly on a new area of the Developer Portal that will help to illustrate the overall system requirements and maintenance for your on-premise environment; note that using our Identity Cloud will ensure that all of the life-cycle management and upgrade requirements are fully managed by Ubisecure’s Operations Team.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>In my presentation at the KuppingerCole's <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution 2023 conference</a> in Frankfurt, entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/beware-of-easy-paths-cre23">"Beware of Easy Paths: The Journey Towards NIS2 Compliance",</a> I focused on the complexities of the revised Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2) issued by the European Union. While I am neither a lawyer nor an auditor (so they might be important peers to talk to on your NIS2-journey), my focus is on the practical implications of this crucial piece of cybersecurity legislation. As a critical component of the EU's cybersecurity strategy, NIS2 extends its influence across various essential sectors, encompassing energy, transport, banking, and health. This directive marks a significant shift in the cybersecurity landscape, setting forth new challenges and requirements for organizations, particularly for medium-sized and large companies, as they strive to align with these evolving regulations.</p>
 Understanding NIS2 
<p>NIS2 is a pivotal piece of legislation issued by the European Union, aimed at fortifying cybersecurity measures across its member states. This directive serves as a cornerstone in the EU's strategy to enhance resilience and response capabilities in the face of growing cyber threats. NIS2 applies broadly within the EU, encompassing a variety of sectors deemed critical for the economy and society. These sectors include energy, transport, banking, health, digital infrastructure, and public administration, among others.</p>
<p>Crucially, NIS2 came into force on January 16, 2023. However, its practical application involves a multi-stage process. First, member states are required to transpose the directive into national law. This aspect underscores the need for harmonization of cybersecurity standards across different jurisdictions while allowing for some degree of customization to address national specifics. Second, the organizations within the scope of NIS2, particularly those categorized under <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80065/kritis-understanding-and-protecting-critical-infrastructure">KRITIS</a> (Critical Infrastructures), are mandated to comply within a 21-month period. This staged approach aims to provide a structured and feasible pathway for entities to adapt and align with the directive's requirements.</p>
 The Scope and Impact of NIS2 
<p>NIS2 significantly expands the framework of cybersecurity obligations compared with its predecessor. It encompasses a wider range of organizations by categorizing them as either "essential" or "important" entities. This distinction is critical, as it brings a greater number of companies under the purview of NIS2, particularly those that were not previously subject to such stringent cybersecurity regulations.</p>
<p>For essential facilities, the level of criticality and obligations is higher. Important institutions, although new to this level of regulatory scrutiny, now also fall under the ambit of NIS2. This expansion significantly broadens the range of affected companies and organizations, moving beyond the traditional sectors of critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Moreover, NIS2 introduces specific thresholds for determining which companies are considered medium-sized or large, making many more companies subject to these regulations. &nbsp;Medium-sized companies are defined as having 50-250 employees and a turnover of €10-50m and/or a balance sheet of less than €43m.&nbsp; Large companies are those with more than 250 employees and a turnover of €50m and/or a balance sheet of €43m. The implications of these thresholds are substantial, especially for medium-sized companies, which may find themselves grappling with a massive tightening of cybersecurity requirements.</p>
 Requirements and Enforcement under NIS2 
<p>NIS2 introduces a blend of specific and generic requirements to ensure comprehensive cybersecurity across various sectors. Article 21 of NIS2, for instance, lists several specific mandates, particularly focusing on risk management, incident response, authentication, and other measures. However, NIS2 also emphasizes adherence to current best practices, certifications, and a generally high and appropriate level of security. This dual approach allows for flexibility while maintaining a baseline of cybersecurity standards.</p>
<p>The enforcement of NIS2 is marked by firm oversight and significant sanctioning power. Supervisory bodies are designated at the national level to monitor and enforce compliance. This includes strengthened supervisory measures ensuring entities' adherence to cybersecurity protocols and the introduction of severe penalties for non-compliance. Cross-border collaboration is a key feature, enhancing cooperation between member states for consistent enforcement. And requirements for transparency and disclosure are stipulated, mandating clear communication regarding cybersecurity incidents and measures. NIS2 encourages initiatives exceeding minimum requirements, fostering a culture of cybersecurity excellence, and promotes public-private partnerships to enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
 Focusing on Compliance: A Tailored Approach 
<p>From KuppingerCole’s perspective, a key aspect of complying with NIS2 is recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, no matter what vendors, consultancies or whoever tells you. Each organization must define and implement NIS2 compliance in a manner that reflects its unique context and challenges. This tailored approach is crucial, considering the diverse range of sectors and company sizes affected by the directive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image: NIS2 - From Initial Assessment to Continual Implementation</p>
<p>Organizations should prioritize a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, as advocated by NIS2. This involves not only identifying and assessing cyber risks unique to their operations but also developing bespoke strategies to mitigate these risks. Compliance, therefore, becomes a dynamic and continuous process, necessitating ongoing adjustments and improvements in line with the evolving cyber threat landscape and organizational changes.</p>
<p>Key areas of focus include risk management, incident reporting, supply chain protection, and cyber hygiene. Each of these areas requires a detailed and customized strategy, taking into account the specific needs and capabilities of the organization. For instance, incident reporting protocols must be efficient yet sensitive to the particular operational context of the business.</p>
 Practical Implementation Strategies 
<p>For practical implementation, especially for SMEs, the focus should be on developing manageable and cost-effective cybersecurity strategies. SMEs often face resource constraints and skill gaps, making it imperative to find solutions that balance cost with effectiveness. Simplifying compliance processes and tailoring strategies to the operational realities of SMEs can significantly aid in meeting NIS2 requirements. Collaboration and community initiatives can also play a pivotal role, allowing SMEs to pool resources and share knowledge to enhance their cybersecurity posture collectively.</p>
<p>In summary, the implementation of NIS2 demands a thoughtful, customized approach, particularly for smaller organizations facing unique challenges in their compliance journey.</p>
 Navigating NIS2 Compliance 
<p>NIS2 marks a significant shift from the conventional checkbox compliance to a more integrated approach, embedding cybersecurity, compliance, and resilience into the very fabric of organizational processes. It prompts a departure from the simplistic, procedural adherence to regulations, focusing instead on a comprehensive assessment of risks. The directive advocates for a customized journey to compliance, one that is not generic but tailored to the specific needs and risk profiles of individual organizations, underscoring the need for a strategic and nuanced application of its mandates.</p>
<p>In addressing NIS2 compliance, it is clear that a uniform solution is not feasible. Each organization must approach compliance in a manner tailored to its unique context. Seeking assistance from a range of professionals, including peers, consultants, analysts, lawyers, and the enforcing bodies is advisable for navigating this complex regulation. Collaboration with these experts can provide the necessary insights for effective compliance strategies.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole Analysts, we focus on offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-nis2-directive-who-what-and-how">realistic strategies for NIS2 compliance</a>. We understand the challenges involved and aim to provide pragmatic solutions, recognizing that each organization's journey towards compliance is distinct.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the path to NIS2 compliance is intricate and requires a bespoke approach, there are <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/advisory">resources</a> available to guide organizations through this process, ensuring a secure and compliant digital environment.</p>

 Sudo digital identities sit at the heart of Sudo Platform 



<p>To empower users to better protect their personal identity online, we’ve created the Sudo digital identity, also simply called a <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>. A Sudo lets your customers interact with other people and organizations while protecting their personal data.</p>



<p>Sudos are at the heart of Sudo Platform, and most Sudo Platform features are built around the Sudo. Your customers can create multiple Sudos by leveraging our Sudo Platform products, protecting them from inadvertently disclosing their personal details.</p>



<p>People already know not to mix their work and personal identities. Sudos take this approach one step further, allowing users to create a different identity for every activity they do. This is called <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a> and it’s a great way to improve safety and security online.</p>



 Sudo Platform offers privacy as a service 



<p>Sudo Platform is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform with a unique focus on privacy.</p>



<p>Your organization can leverage Sudo Platform to rapidly develop and deploy easy-to-use, privacy-first products that interoperate seamlessly and intuitively. Sudo platform capabilities include:</p>



 
 Safe and private browsing including ad and tracker blocking and site reputation services 



 Virtual private network 



 Password management, security, and automation 



 Online commerce protection through virtual cards and compartmentalization 



 Open and encrypted communications including voice/video, messaging, and email 



 Decentralized identity services including identity wallets, verifiable credential services, and passwordless authentication. 
 



<p>We take a privacy-first stance to architecture, design, development and deployment of our products and services to deliver immediate value to organizations that seek to sell privacy and online security to their customers, either as new products or as enhancements to existing offerings.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform is a continually evolving offering as we develop new products and enhance existing services. Common services such as accounts, entitlements and profile management, underpin our offerings.</p>

 <br>Sudo Platform combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of SDKs 



Figure 1: Sudo Platform



<p>Sudo Platform is built for developers by developers.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Sudo Platform is a set of scalable hosted services that provide the capabilities to an enterprise developer. You can integrate these hosted services with your systems to provide entitlement, federated single sign-on, and other integrations that allow your existing customers to seamlessly access the Sudo Platform services you want.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform hosted services are also integrated into various third party systems such as cloud providers, telephony carriers, banks, payment processors, blockchains, and more. These hosted services are deployed individually for each of Anonyome’s consumer-facing customers/partners, completely separating them from other customer/partners’ data and services and providing the ability to customize that environment for the individual organization.</p>



<p>Above the hosted services sit SDKs, documentation and sample apps distributed through GitHub which allow Sudo Platform customers to quickly develop applications using Sudo Platform services. This software is open source so you can quickly become productive. All Sudo Platform SDKs are offered in Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript, which means you can freely enhance any of your web, mobile or desktop products that make up your full software suite.</p>



<p>If you’d prefer a faster route to market or lack the internal expertise or capacity to create and deploy applications to end users, we also publish UI kits that enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications that can be quickly branded and delivered to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms. This rapid white label offering is very attractive to organizations that want or need to move quickly.</p>



<p>A UI kit gives you access to libraries of advanced software modules with complex data and graphical flows that go beyond basic Sudo Platform service access. The first library contained in a UI kit is the core library, which provides complex business logic for data management and functional utilities that span one or more of the Sudo Platform services. The second library contained in a UI kit is the UI library, which has widgets, screens and minor user flows that give recommended user experiences for a feature and can be integrated into your application. UI kits are supported across Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>



<p>An unbranded application (or white label application) allows you to take advantage of fully developed and supported applications for web, mobile and desktop platforms. Our unbranded apps deliver an optimal user experience of Sudo Platform services, and you can add your logo, color palette and other branding requirements. Once complete, you simply add your new apps to your product portfolio for fast deployment and integrate them with your user management and accounting systems.</p>



 Sudo Platform keeps up with the privacy landscape 



<p>We can only achieve privacy if Sudo Platform products and services adapt to the ever-evolving data surveillance landscape. We have built Sudo Platform offerings against enhancement roadmaps and with a philosophy of continuous development so it stays abreast of user needs. Each release incorporates the latest support for all mobile, web and desktop platforms and features regular security updates for packaged software dependencies.</p>



<p>The Sudo Platform GitHub site is shown below. We include our SDKs and sample apps (including source code) to make it easy to leverage the capabilities into your applications.</p>



Figure 2: Sudo Platform GitHub site



<p>The instructions for how to build Sudo Platform capabilities into your applications are included in our documentation site:</p>



Figure 3: Sudo Platform documentation



<p>You can find more information about Sudo Platform in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">documentation</a>, open source <a href="https://github.com/sudoplatform">SDKs</a> for mobile, web and desktop, and official <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asudoplatform+sample">sample applications</a>.</p>



 Getting started takes just 4 simple steps 



 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create an account 



<p>Start by creating an account so you can access, configure and integrate Sudo Platform services into your products.</p>



<p>Creating an account is simple. Each Sudo Platform account has two key characteristics:</p>



 
 complete account isolation 



 feature service customization. 
 



<p>Unlike accounts with traditional multi-tenant SaaS companies, Sudo Platform accounts are individual and isolated from others within the system so that core services and data are unique to each deployment. In real terms, this helps to eliminate any risk of information cross-contamination within our internal systems.</p>



<p>Each Sudo Platform account is unique for each customer based on individual need. When you create a Sudo Platform account, your selection of features and any subsequent configuration makes your deployment different from other customers’ deployments on Sudo Platform. This means:</p>



 
 You only pay for what you need. 



 The deployment is implemented against your compliance, data and location requirements. 



 You have clear visibility into what you are developing against. 



 Manage your account with the Sudo Platform management console<br><br>The management console lets you manage your administrative and end users, gain critical insight into the analytics underlying your deployment, and explore ways to enhance your Sudo Platform experience. 
 



<p>Your Sudo Platform management console is a real-time reflection of your deployment. It lets you view and alter the features that back the integrated products and affects how your services interact with Sudo Platform. This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>

This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>



 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start with a sample app or go straight to SDKs 



<p>Once you have your Sudo Platform account, why not check out what it can do? You can do this via a sample app or jump right into integration with our SDKs.</p>



<p>Using a sample app is the fastest way to see how the Sudo Platform services work and the value they can provide. You can easily explore the technology and imagine the potential for your products, either as an enhancement or brand new offering.</p>



<p>If you dive right into integration with our SDKs, you’ll find they are designed for seamless integration with all your existing and new applications. Each SDK is built to run natively on all supported platforms, so they have the highest chance of compatibility with your applications, independent of the frameworks and architecture you employ.</p>



<p>To integrate with the platform you’re developing on, simply use the appropriate package manager (see table below) and add a dependency to the Sudo Platform SDKs you need for your project. If you need help using one of the listed package managers, refer to its documentation.</p>



PlatformPackage manageriOS (Swift)Cocoapods: https://cocoapods.org/Android (Kotlin)Maven Central: https://search.maven.org/Javascript/Typescriptnpmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/



<p>See our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started">documentation</a> for more information.</p>



 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain your Sudo Platform application 



<p>Maintaining a Sudo Platform application is an important exercise once you have integrated our SDKs. Everything you need to know each release to plan or automate how you pull in fixes, updates and new features is available in GitHub and the Sudo Platform documentation.</p>



 Changelogs 



<p>Changelogs for all Sudo Platform SDK releases are available in the associated GitHub repository. Within these changelogs there is information about each release, including:</p>



 
 a description of changes that are newly available 



 an indication of SDK versions that are compatibility breaking 



 a description of fixes that are available 



 assets associated with a release. 
 



<p>To access this changelog information for each release, simply go to the appropriate GitHub repository and click the ‘Releases’ link in the right pane:</p>







<p>The next page gives you access to the changelogs associated with each release of the SDK:</p>







 Versioning 



 Rules 



<p>Our versioning adheres to semantic versioning-like rules so integrating up-to-date releases into your CI/CD development pipelines is easy. Introducing Sudo Platform products from official release repositories into your dependency pipeline and adhering to versioning rules ensures constant compatibility with the services in your Sudo Platform deployment.</p>



<p>The rules in Sudo Platform versioning are:</p>



 
 MAJOR version when incompatible API changes are released 



 MINOR version when backwards compatible functionality is released 



 PATCH version when backwards compatible bug fixes are released. 
 



<p>If we deviate from these rules, we will let you know in the documentation as soon as possible so you can adapt.</p>



 Compatibility 



<p>Another important consideration is the compatibility of the version of the SDKs your application uses and the version of the SDKs supported by the services within your Sudo Platform deployment. Ignoring the compatibility of your application’s SDK versions can cause your application to stop functioning correctly or completely.</p>



<p>We have an API that lets you verify the general compatibility of your application against your deployed instance. This API gives you information about the compatibility status of your application and any features that are incompatible. As a result, you can design your application to appropriately respond to this API based on your needs and the overall scenario:</p>



 
 understand the compatibility of an application during development 



 inform a user about the need to update their application installation to a compatible version 



 gracefully disable select functionality of the application based on the nature of the compatibility issue. 
 



<p>You can find specific guidance on each platform’s implementation of this API and some sample code in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started#verifying-the-app-compatibility-with-backend-services">documentation</a>.</p>



 Those 4 simple steps achieve 3 big rewards 



 
 You access a unique, comprehensive, performant, scalable, and secure way of introducing privacy-first services and paradigms into your products.<br><br> 



 You get the services and development building blocks you need to build solutions that meet your users’ demands quickly, seamlessly and with future vision.<br><br> 



 You deploy cutting-edge capabilities across communication, collaboration and commerce, and integrate them into your products and processes so you can:
 
 enhance your users’ privacy 



 fill gaps in your product portfolio 



 help mitigate the ever-increasing threat of data surveillance.

<p>To act in the world we must first make sense of it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the world is complex, containing an amount of information exceeding the processing capacity of any individual or group. Adequate sensemaking in the context of complexity and info-abundance therefore requires the ability to process and analyse data. </p><p>We refer to this capability as data-driven sensemaking.</p><p>Yet, today the means for data-driven sensemaking are unevenly distributed. In our essay, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/issues/issue-02-territories-of-transition/data-commoning-as-a-territory-of-transition/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Politics of Data: Data Commoning as a Territory of Transition</a>, we described how data is shaping the landscape of power, perpetuating and amplifying asymmetries. Unsurprisingly, the principal beneficiaries are large corporations and state actors with the financial and technical resources required to undertake data collection, processing and analysis at scale. As with ‘natural resources’ and ‘labour’, the dominant economic and cultural logics of today regard data as another resource to be extracted, siloed and abused in service of narrow objectives and/or for the benefit of a few.</p><p>While data alone cannot orient us, it can help to reveal new possibilities and trajectories. Yet, data only realises its potential as a coordinative aid if it is able to flow freely through our digital territories. Practices of data sharing are important — surely — but data must also be capable of transmutation; of undergoing a kind of alchemical process of reconfiguration and recombination in the midst of varying contexts. This conception regards data — or information — as a living process rather than a static object or resource. Data is made more contextually relevant when the logics and infrastructure we employ to generate, channel and transform data support these kinds of evolutionary dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this series of posts and the technical interventions described, we are seeking to understand and embody this conception of data as a living process, and to articulate interventions intended to help unlock data toward greater service to life. In other words, like many in the Holochain ecosystem, we are endeavouring to engage in data commoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we will introduce the technical stack for a data commons, discussing data collection, discovery, and analysis; considering distributed computing and large language models; and proposing an algorithm library for analytic tools. We then go on to discuss the social effects of narrative and to think about how data and sensemaking could be reframed to support a generative future. Finally, in part two of this article series we will dive deeper into knowledge graphs, so don’t forget to read that article as well.</p> The Data Commons Stack <p>The capacity for commoning derives in part from maintained symmetry in power dynamics preventing data from becoming a source of extraction, enclosure, and ultimately tragedy. Consider that, the moment we click 'send' or 'save', our tweets, notes, and messages are expedited to a remote data warehouse controlled by the respective platform provider. Here our data becomes a means by which platforms increase revenue and market dominance rather than as a means for collective sensemaking. The digital spaces where we gather, lauded as the 21st century ‘town squares’ are, in truth, more like vast feudal estates. The conversations occurring within are, in many respects, the property of our digital usurpers rather than the domain of public knowledge.</p><p>Yet we remain hopeful that these power asymmetries can be mitigated — even corrected — given the right cultural and technological conditions. We’ll begin by addressing the technological dimension and speak to the cultural dimension toward the end of this post.&nbsp;</p> Layer Zero <p>Agent-centric, peer-to-peer (P2P) frameworks like <a href="https://holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> support data commoning by providing certain assurances with respect to access, control, and provenance of the data we collectively generate. On the one hand, local-first storage affords us privacy and control with respect to our personal data whilst distributing and validating shared data among peers allows more flexible, selective means of data access. Here, data can be stewarded and evolved in a cooperative manner with reduced risk of extraction and exploitation. With these foundations, it becomes possible to support what we call 'generative information ecosystems': spaces in which information evolves toward greater complexity, relevance, and integration.&nbsp;</p><p>While Holochain's agent-centric architecture and data integrity mechanisms provide essential ingredients toward data sovereignty, it does not automatically grant the capability to discover and derive insights from data. Hence, an initial focus for our team at Arkology Studio is developing a suite of modules for data discovery and analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>For us, important sensemaking occurs in the context of our lived realities; human beings embedded in community and specific bioregions, rather than just the halls of academia and research laboratories.&nbsp;Hence, the hope is that the affordances of open, data-driven sensemaking tools can be matched with the orienting/decision-making capacities of grassroots organisations and communities attending to local challenges. By empowering local actors to share, discover, and draw insights from data, we may see connective tissues expand, and local solutions spread and adapt to new contexts.&nbsp;</p><p>The following diagram offers an initial high-level overview of a ‘data commons stack’, indicating the five functional categories or ‘layers’: collection, storage, discovery, analysis, and knowledge. </p>Figure 1: high-level systems overview of the ‘data commons’ stack<p>While the diagram above depicts a linear progression for illustrative simplicity, in actuality there exists a variety of feedback loops between the many subsystems. Note, for example, that published insights at the knowledge layer may themselves become data points in the data storage layer, to be included in later analyses (this unlocks, for example, interesting possibilities for narrative analysis, which we investigate in part two of this article series). Furthermore, there exists a feedback loop between our understanding of the world and our behaviour in the world. In other words, knowledge can engender change in material reality, which in turn may affect our understanding of said material reality. It is these sorts of feedback loops which reveal the complex, dynamical nature of a data commons and, if supported, enable it to adapt to evolving contexts.</p> Collection <p>Since data-driven sensemaking is impractical without a diversity of data, methods for channelling and/or exposing data from a multitude of sources is paramount. On the one hand, this involves developing standardised, consensual methods for data collection from applications, including IoT devices, traditional web apps, and other Holochain apps: what we term ‘data channels’. Data entering the ecosystem from the ‘outside’ (i.e beyond the data-sovereign membrane) is always mediated through an agent (e.g. a human or IoT device), who submits the contents along with a record containing metadata that can be recognised and validated by other agents (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s validation rules</a>). In other words, we record the provenance and context associated with any data point. Since other Holochain apps are already operating within their respective data-sovereign membrane, and self-host their own data, participants in those networks may reveal relevant data to the data commons ecosystem for query. As for storing all this data, Holochain already provides us with mechanisms for distributed data storage (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s DHT</a>), with capacity scaling linearly with the number of peers.&nbsp;</p> Discovery <p>With a data commons, one is presented with the challenge of effective data discovery. Since those who control the map control the territory, it is important to mitigate against monopolies on discovery mechanisms. Google’s search engine dominance engenders a kind of monoculture with respect to the very way we discover new information. Since search/discovery algorithms privilege certain data over others by design, it may be necessary to mitigate against algorithmic monopolies by encouraging a multiplicity of discovery services. Since the data commons is essentially a giant peer-to-peer (P2P) network composed of human and non-human agents, it may be useful to conceptualise these services as ‘personal agents’ who crawl the data commons on our behalf, surfacing data relevant to our needs. Imagine, for example, that you are undertaking interdisciplinary research on a controversial topic and are aware of potential biases. Here, you may be inclined to engage a search agent proficient at discovering diverse/divergent viewpoints. Furthermore, agents may operate on our behalf even when we are not actively engaged in search/discovery. For example, you may initiate an agent to notify you of regional climate events or the latest research results in cancer treatments. Since the way we acquire data is an essential step in data-driven sensemaking, it is important that we have the means to parameterize and personalise data discovery in accordance with our intentions and aspirations.</p> Analysis <p>One of the first and most exciting mechanisms for sense-making that becomes available to participants of the data commons can be conceived as similar to both <a href="https://openpds.media.mit.edu/?ref=blog.holochain.org">SafeAnswers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation?ref=blog.holochain.org">secure-multiparty computation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, ‘safe answers’ refers to the ability to perform computation on user data without revealing the raw data itself. The analyst is responsible for sending an inspectable analysis algorithm to the agent whose data is being processed for insight. This way, all computation is performed locally on the machines where the data is stored (the machine of the agent on a Holochain network). The analyst receives only the return of the algorithm and has no access to the raw data itself.&nbsp;</p><p>One can imagine the unlocking potential of this type of distributed computation when it comes to personal or sensitive data. This is demonstrated by an example pertaining to personal health data. On the one hand, it can be very useful to understand, say, the amount of people in a given area who are predisposed to cancer. The disposition may be informed by genetics, lifestyle, and other factors. In a traditional data relationship between an app user and a company stewarding their data, there is no assurance that the company will not use/sell their data in a compromising way, such as to an insurance firm that may increase the excesses to the user given their predisposition. By running an algorithm on the devices of the users who are being considered in the analysis, it becomes possible to undertake sensitive and important investigations without creating a honeypot of compromising data.&nbsp;</p> Algorithm Library&nbsp; <p>A library of datasets alone is necessary yet insufficient for effective sense-making. Tools are required to effectively traverse and distil the meanings and implications contained within the datasets in order for the data to affect meaningful change in the world. In order to unlock the agentic capacities of groups endeavouring to common around data towards data-driven sensemaking we are proposing a library of open-source algorithms aimed at crowd-sourcing data-science expertise in order to make data-driven sensemaking more accessible to less data-literate folk. By introducing algorithms into the data commons ecosystem, our intuition is that a data commons is not just informed by inert data points, but rather is the interaction of these data points and the actors that engage with them towards distilling an understanding of reality. In this way, it can be useful to think of this project as a praxis for data commoning, more than simply a 'data commons'.</p> Large Language Models <p>The speed of Large Language Model (LLM) development is overwhelming, with a multitude of new tools being released that are changing everything from education, to search engines, to AI assistants. Without dedicating too much of this text to this topic, it is important to indicate the possibilities for organisations and communities to develop specialised agents fine-tuned on the capacities of the data that they are commoning around. In some ways, a generative model trained on a given set of data is a codified narrative; an artificial agent acting on behalf of the semantic patterns that inform it.&nbsp;</p> Narrative Ecosystems &amp; Cultural Evolution <p>The transformative potential of a given technological ecosystem is <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">limited by the values and ontologies</a> associated with the dominant cultural environment in which their activity is based. Hence, while we think tools that improve our capacities for sensemaking are important — especially when grounded in data-sovereign infrastructure like Holochain — they are not panaceas. Responding to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">poly/metacrisis</a> requires a transformation of the dominant culture, not merely technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In light of this, Arkology Studio has been collaborating with <a href="https://culturehack.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Culture Hack Labs</a> to advance a set of tools for narrative research. For Culture Hack Labs, effective system change necessitates understanding the narrative forms and narrative ecologies that perpetuate social and ecological breakdown. Here, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/curriculum/curriculum/introduction-to-narratives/module-2-introduction-to-narratives-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">narratives can be understood</a> as “interpretive social structures that frame our experience and function to bring meaning to our everyday reality, guiding our actions and decisions.” In other words, one can transform culture by intervening at the level of narratives.&nbsp;</p><p>The narrative, ‘data as resource’, reflects the tendency of modern, industrialised societies to regard nature — including her living creatures and material output — as something to be exploited for human benefit (or, rather, for those with the means to exploit her first). Through this framing, data is something to accumulate (‘big data’), gatekeep (e.g. academic journals), and exploit (e.g. behaviour profiling to sell ads). Contrast this narrative with ‘data in service to life’ or ‘data as living process’, which invites us to consider data and its associated processes as a fundamentally cooperative dynamic.&nbsp;</p><p>In recognising the power of narratives to guide cultural evolution, we have begun to explore what meaningful narrative interventions could look like in the context of a data commons. In particular, what would it mean to meaningfully shift narrative ecosystems toward more life-affirming frames without necessarily prescribing, in a top-down manner, the frames themselves? Is it conceivable, in other words, that the very insights generated within a data commons might help steer society toward a more generative future?&nbsp;</p> What’s Next? <p>In part two of this series, we investigate this question through a speculative discussion on the ‘knowledge’ layer of the Data Commons Stack. Specifically, we explore how to represent knowledge in a manner that is pluralistic rather than homogenising, and how we may more readily perceive the influence and evolutionary potential of the narratives that live within and amongst us. We propose a toolkit that draws from the knowledge emerging out of cooperative communities and allows the construction of agent/community-centric knowledge graphs; networks of insights built upon a shared node library and structurally arranged to represent the epistemic geometries of their ontological framing.&nbsp;</p><p>Our inquiry also leads us into a discussion on knowledge discovery and the risks of epistemic pluralism; in particular, how we might use open discovery patterns and quantitative measures from Integrated Information Theory to move us toward more integrative frames.</p> Guest Authors <p>This guest post, the first of two articles on data commoning, was written by Ché Coelho and Ross Eyre of Arkology Studio.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arkology/about/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Arkology Studio</a> (‘architecture’ + ‘ecology’) is a transdisciplinary design and software engineering studio whose mission is to support the development of commons-oriented socio-technical interventions for systems change. </p>

 Verida and zkPass collaborate to bring privacy-preserving data verification to web3 users with Polygon ID zk&nbsp;Proofs Verida and zkPass collaborate to bring privacy-preserving data verification to web3 users with Polygon ID zk&nbsp;Proofs<p>We are thrilled to welcome <a href="https://zkpass.org/">zkPass</a> to the <a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem">Verida ecosystem</a>, marking a significant stride towards privacy-preserving data verification in web3. This collaboration harnesses the power of <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-id">Polygon ID</a> zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized technology to put users in control of their personal information.</p> Empowering Users Through Decentralized Identity <p>With zkPass and Verida technologies, users are empowered to take the reins of their personal information. Decentralized identity eliminates the need for central authorities to manage and store sensitive data, placing users firmly in the driver’s seat. In addition to enhancing privacy, decentralized identity enables users to decide when and how their information is&nbsp;shared.</p> Enhanced Security with Polygon ID Zero Knowledge Proofs <p>The use of <a href="https://news.verida.io/polygon-id-and-verida-make-zero-knowledge-credentials-accessible-to-all-fc0ac17538c9">Polygon ID zero-knowledge proofs</a> adds an extra layer of security to the verification process. This cryptographic approach allows users to authenticate their information without revealing unnecessary details. It establishes a new standard for security in web3, where privacy and trust are not negotiable but fundamental.</p><blockquote>“We’re delighted to team up with Verida in our shared vision to enhance private data verification. Our technology, designed to offer secure and private authentication through cryptography technologies, complements Verida’s commitment to privacy and decentralization. Together, we aim to redefine user experience in the digital space, where privacy and trust is not a choice but a standard.” <a href="https://twitter.com/zk_Bing">Bing Jiang</a>, Tech Lead of&nbsp;<a href="https://zkpass.org/">zkPass</a>.</blockquote> zkPass and Verida in Action: Real-world Examples <p>zkPass allows individuals to prove and verify some private information about themselves without revealing unnecessary details, across a range of industries</p><p>Here are some examples:</p>  Web Banking: Prove you have over $10,000 in your bank&nbsp;account.  Gaming: Prove you control and own a particular gaming&nbsp;account.  Government: Verify you are a resident of a particular country without revealing personal information,which can help prevent identity theft and protect&nbsp;privacy.  Decentralized Finance: Verify identities and credentials for DeFi applications, ensuring that only authorized parties have access to sensitive financial data.  Job Applications: Verify your qualifications, education, and experience for a job application without revealing personal information.  <p>These verifications are generated directly on the user’s local device. Once a user generates a zkPass proof, it is securely sent to the user’s Verida Wallet, stored on the privacy-preserving Verida Network as a Polygon ID credential. This credential can be leveraged with a zero-knowledge proof, both on and off-chain.</p>Verida Wallet supports zero-knowledge credentials on Polygon&nbsp;ID An Integrated Solution: Building the Future with a Privacy-First Technology Stack <p>This end-to-end solution demonstrates the software architecture of the future. Decentralized identity, private storage, zero knowledge proofs, credentials and blockchain, all working together to provide an incredibly secure and private technology stack.</p><blockquote>“From the outset, Verida has been focused on providing the necessary infrastructure to build a privacy preserving, decentralized technology stack. zkPass’ zero-knowledge proof technology is another example of the innovation happening in this space and we are thrilled to welcome them to the Verida ecosystem.” <a href="https://twitter.com/tahpot">Chris Were</a>, CEO and co-founder of&nbsp;Verida.</blockquote><p>Stay tuned for updates as we further our partnership with zkPass and provide new opportunities for you to be part of the data ownership revolution with <a href="http://missions.verida.network">Verida Missions.</a></p><p>Developer Resources</p>  <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">Verida Documentation</a>  <a href="https://zkpass.gitbook.io/">zkPass Documentation</a>   About zkPass <p>zkPass is a private data protocol that enables privacy-preserving verification. It primarily employs technologies such as Three-Party TLS (3P-TLS), Multi-party Computation (MPC), and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). It allows the conversion of private data from HTTPS websites into zk proofs without needing API authorization. This approach not only safeguards privacy but also protects against data forgery by malicious actors.</p><p><a href="https://zkpass.org">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/zkPass">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/zkPass">Medium</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/zkpass">Discord</a></p> About Verida <p>The <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida Wallet</a> is a self-custody web3 mobile wallet and a gateway for decentralized identities.

 Navigating the Complexities of the FATF and FinCEN Crypto Travel Rule: Your Questions Answered — Part&nbsp;3 <p>Building on the insights from <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/demystifying-the-fatf-travel-rule-your-most-googled-questions-answered-part-2">Part 2</a> of our comprehensive series of articles on the most asked questions around the FATF Travel Rule, we delve deeper into the complexities of these regulations, focusing on their global implementation, specific targets, direct impact on cryptocurrency transactions, and the challenges faced by Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) in this third installment of the series. Let’s dive into&nbsp;it.</p> Which Countries Have Implemented the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>As of November 23, 2023, the countries that have implemented the Travel Rule are Canada, Estonia, Germany, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Japan, Liechtenstein, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, The Philippines, The United States, and the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p><p>The United States has been enforcing the Travel Rule <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-fincen-idINKBN1XP1ZO/">since March 13, 2013</a>. Several years after the US, Switzerland implemented the rule <a href="https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2019/08/20190826-mm-kryptogwg/">on January 1, 2020</a>. Singapore’s implementation came into effect <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2020/payment-services-act-comes-into-force">on January 28, 2020</a>, whereas the Philippines began enforcing the Travel Rule on <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Regulations/Issuances/2021/1108.pdf">February 5,&nbsp;2021</a>.</p><p>Germany’s adoption of the Travel Rule <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1auLvlIOx2zJb8i2CSe9lFEStzlC3BP3zvSKhkejF-jo/edit?usp=sharing">dates back to October 1, 2021</a>, followed by Gibraltar’s enforcement, which began on March 22, 2022. Canada joined in <a href="https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/travel-acheminement/1-eng">on March 31, 2022</a>. <a href="https://www.fma-li.li/files/list/fma-wegleitung-2021-18-travel-rule.pdf">Liechtenstein</a> and <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/api/documentms/download.ashx?id=b682d829-38bc-4827-b48d-022726d75a17">Malaysia</a> joined next, as they both implemented the crypto Travel Rule on April 1,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>South Korea’s implementation date was <a href="https://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/pr010101/75410">March 25, 2022</a>, and both<a href="https://www.cr.gov.hk/en/publications/docs/es32022262516-e.pdf"> Hong Kong</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan</a> started enforcing the rule on June 1, 2023. Finally, Estonia began enforcing the Travel Rule <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/515042021009/consolide/current">on June 15, 2022</a>, with the United Kingdom implementing it on <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1082704/MLRs_SI_2022_-_Consultation_Response.pdf">September 1,&nbsp;2023</a>.</p> Who Does the FATF Crypto Travel Rule Apply&nbsp;to <p>The FATF Crypto Travel Rule applies to a wide range of entities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Primarily, it targets virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallet providers, and other financial services dealing with virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The rule requires these entities to collect and share personal data during transactions. This includes the name, account number, physical address, national identity number, or date and place of birth of both the sender and the recipient for transfers exceeding a certain threshold.</p> What is the FinCEN Travel Rule Crypto; How Does it Affect Cryptocurrency Transactions <p>The “FinCEN Travel Rule Crypto” refers to a regulatory framework originally established by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for fiat currencies and later extended to include cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Targeting virtual asset service providers (VASPs) like cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallet providers, and other financial services dealing with virtual assets, the FinCEN Travel Rule Crypto requires these entities to collect and share key personal data during transactions. This data includes the sender and receiver’s names, account numbers, physical addresses, national identity numbers, or their dates and places of birth for transactions that exceed&nbsp;$3000.</p><p>This adaptation of the rule to cryptocurrencies aims to enhance transparency in digital currency transactions and combat money laundering and terrorism financing. It aligns the regulatory requirements of the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies with those of traditional banking, posing new challenges and compliance requirements for businesses in the virtual currency&nbsp;space.</p> What Challenges Do VASPs Face During Travel Rule Compliance <p>VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) face several challenges during Travel Rule compliance, including data privacy concerns, varying international regulations, technology integration issues, and the risk of non-compliance penalties.</p><p>Data Privacy Concerns: Ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive customer data while complying with the Travel Rule is a significant challenge. VASPs need to strike a balance between adhering to regulatory requirements and protecting client information against unauthorized access and data breaches.</p><p>Varying International Regulations: The Travel Rule requirements vary across different jurisdictions, making it difficult for VASPs to develop a uniform compliance strategy. This lack of standardization requires VASPs to adapt their compliance processes according to the regulations of each country they operate&nbsp;in.</p><p>Furthermore, since many countries have not yet enforced the Travel Rule, VASPs operating in jurisdictions where the rule is implemented face challenges when dealing with transactions from countries that are non-compliant. This is known as the Sunrise&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Technology Integration Issues: Implementing the necessary technology to comply with the Travel Rule often involves significant investment and integration challenges. VASPs need to upgrade their systems to handle additional data requirements and ensure interoperability with other service providers.</p><p>Risk of Non-Compliance Penalties: Failure to comply with the Travel Rule can lead to hefty fines and legal penalties. This risk puts pressure on VASPs to ensure strict adherence to regulatory requirements, which can be resource-intensive and&nbsp;costly.</p><p>Veriscope effectively addresses these challenges. Its decentralized framework enhances data integrity and reduces risks, while the absence of centralized PII storage boosts data security.</p><p>An open-source platform, Veriscope fosters transparency and continual improvement. Key features like automatic counterparty VASP discovery, secure P2P PII transmission, and robust due diligence streamline the compliance process.</p><p>Additionally, its pay-as-you-go model, interoperability with various platforms, and unique features like historic transaction lookback and user signing for wallets, position Veriscope as a versatile and comprehensive solution for Travel Rule compliance.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>As we conclude the third part of our series on the FATF Travel Rule, we have navigated through the essential aspects of its global implementation, targeted entities, and the profound impact on cryptocurrency transactions. This analysis has also shed light on the multifaceted challenges VASPs encounter in complying with these regulations.</p><p>Our journey through these complexities underscores the importance of continual adaptation and informed compliance within the evolving crypto landscape, ensuring that stakeholders in the cryptocurrency domain remain aligned with international regulatory standards.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

			 Gonzalo García Arahuetes is a Back-End Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-garcia-arahuetes/">Gonzalo García Arahuetes</a>, and I was born in Segovia, Spain. I work as a Back-end Developer at Tokeny, although it would have been crazy for me to think of such a job some years ago, since my initial formation had nothing to do with computers. I started Law and Business Administration studies in Madrid but soon changed it for Humanities and moved to Barcelona for my master’s degree. Although I did a lot of research on Literature and Philosophy, I eventually started some courses on Digital Humanities, focused on database maintenance and data management, and this is how I became more and more curious about technology and its ethical and political implications. With that in mind, I started another master’s degree in Web Development and began to study the consequences of blockchain for economies and individuals.</p>
<p>I love keeping those two paths alive, as I regard them as complementary. While my professional career is devoted to web development and tech-related issues, I am still working on a Ph.D. thesis on Peter Sloterdijk’s early work, and I dedicate a great deal of my free time to books, writing, and research.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>I was working for a small start-up as a Full-Stack developer. One day, I saw a job offer from Tokeny for senior developers. I applied, specifying that I was not a senior at all but that I had plenty of curiosity for the blockchain world and was eager for an opportunity like this. Of course, I expected no response, but Luc himself, the CEO, replied! We had a very pleasant meeting, and he told me that all he wanted were ‘smart and motivated people.’ The process took some time because Tokeny was opening its Spanish office in Barcelona, but joining this team was the perfect decision for me.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Luc wanted a team of ‘smart and motivated people,’ and I think that is what he got! Working at Tokeny means sharing time and goals with some of the most fun, skilled, and professional people I have met. On top of that, it is a company committed to remote work, which makes life so much easier for all of us in terms of schedule and location. In a few words, I would say that Tokeny always considers the workers’ necessities in the first place.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life?  
<p>My family is at the top: my wife Yaos and my little Lila, who was born in June. Other than that, I am very passionate about many things: books, films, my guitars, my friends, cooking, sports… In this regard, being passionate about something reveals its ambiguity (for the word ‘passion’ has a very ancient origin, always related to suffering): I love all these things, but often, it is demanding to keep up with them and not end up frustrated or exhausted.</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I am rather cautious when it comes to making long-term plans for my life, not to mention having big dreams about changing the world. I always remember Walt Whitman’s beautiful verses: “The Earth, that is sufficient, I do not want the constellations any nearer, I know they are very well where they are, I know they suffice for those who belong to them.” In my opinion, being focused on big dreams and aims keeps us from noticing that sometimes we are just carried away. Knowing that the tide is dragging you may or may not make a better swimmer out of you, but at least you will take it easy and stop worrying about reaching a certain place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>My personal view is that we are on the verge of mass adoption for blockchain technology. Given that scenario, being part of a company so involved in the transformation of the entire financial industry is a thrilling and adventurous experience. There is so much yet to learn and to witness!</p>

<p><br>
Northern Block Product Update: Supporting Mote Credential Exchange Protocols and Credential Formats<br><br></p>
 
<p>We’re excited to announce that Northern Block products now support two credential exchange protocols – DIDComm/Aries-based protocol implementations and the newly added OpenID4VC. Additionally, we’ve expanded our support to three credential formats: AnonCreds, JWT, and JSON-LD.</p>
<p>As staunch advocates for open agent technology, which is crucial for digital wallets and achieving digital trust, we’ve consistently integrated DIDComm and various Aries-based implementations (such as ACA-Py, AFJ) into our products. The recent focus on the European Union’s Architectural Reference Framework (ARF) has highlighted the importance of the Open ID for verifiable credential specifications. We’ve embraced these specifications in response to feedback from issuers who appreciate the protocol’s simplicity and the widespread availability of OpenID/oAuth resources, making the issuance of verifiable credentials more streamlined.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide our customers with the flexibility to receive and store their preferred credential format via any protocol. We also strive to enable verifiers to accept a diverse range of credentials and protocols available in the market. Looking ahead, we plan to support the mobile driving license (mDL) standard.</p>
<p>Here’s what we now offer:</p>
 
 
 For Issuers: Our platform now allows issuers to use either DIDComm/Aries or our OpenID4VCI issuer to issue an AnonCred, JWT, or JSON-LD credentials. (Note: our issuance service allows users to issue AnonCreds and JSON-LD through DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT through OpenID4VCI) 
 For Holders: Customers using our wallet or wallet SDK can now receive and store in any of the three formats over DIDComm/Aries or OpenID4VC implementations. 
 For Verifiers: Our verifier customers can now consume credentials in their preferred combination of formats and protocols. (Note: our verifier toolkit allows for presentations of AnonCreds and JSON-LD over DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT over OpenID4VP) 
 
 
<p>We’re excited to see how these enhancements will empower our users and pave the way for more innovative uses of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Here’s a short video showcasing how our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet can now receive credentials from various protocols:<br><br></p>
 
 
    
 
 
<p><br>Contact us for a demo/conversation – or feel free to test it out yourself. We’re happy to chat with anyone 🙂 –&gt; info@northernblock.io</p>

Join this insightful conversation as they unpack the significance of 1Kosmos’ recent certification by the Kantara Initiative for the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. Watch now:<p></p>
  
<p></p>
 
 
 Robert MacDonald:<p></p>
 
<p>Hi, Rob MacDonald here, vice president of product marketing at 1Kosmos, and welcome to our vlog.</p>
<p>Today, I’ve got Huzefa with us, our co-founder and COO. How you doing today, Huzefa?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Very good, Robert. Very good to see you. It’s been a while.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>It has been a while. I guess the unfortunate thing of working remotely, we don’t get to see each other more often. But, welcome.</p>
<p>Today, we want to talk a little bit about one of our latest announcements. So we just announced a new certification by the Kantara Initiative and it’s for the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. So for those of you that know the acronym, that’s UK D-I-A-T-F. I know you had a lot to do with that so why don’t you tell me a little bit about what that framework, the UK Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework is all about?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>No, absolutely. So the UK Digital Identity Attribute Trust Framework came into existence a few years back and it was a standard that has been designed by the UK government, primarily designed that’s just not for corporations, but for regular citizens where any time if you want to hire somebody, if you’re renting an individual or any kind of a background service they’re providing, which requires a user to be proofed, how do you do it based on standards?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Okay, right.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>This is a very good development in general because traditionally we’ve all been used to the NIST standard here in the United States. I know it’s been more widely being adopted as well.</p>
<p>Now local governments are creating their own standard for identity proofing. Yeah. So we saw that, we said, you know, our friends at Kantara were the ones who were reviewing and approving vendors who wanted to sign up for the standards. So we went through that process and came through it.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. So are there specific specifications that we’re certified to against that framework?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yes. So there are specifications around how you would proof an individual, what are the different levels that would go with respect to it. And we have subscribed to a level which will require a user to scan one of their digital documents, take a live selfie, and prove that cryptographically that we have a secure credential for a specific user.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Okay, cool.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>And since UK, how do you make sure that you are keeping the data very secure on our end as well?</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Great. Fair enough. So what does that certification in general say about our platform?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>This is something that we have looked at it just from the inception of the company. Don’t just build technologies, but do it based on standards as well.</p>
<p>I believe our first certification that we signed up for was for the NIST 800-63-3. We are very much into the weeds of the revision four, which is coming out, too. We saw the UK standard that was developed and then we signed up for it. And I don’t want to peel the curtain a lot, but we are involved in a lot of new standards that are coming across the globe as well, right?</p>
<p>So at 1Kosmos, we want to prove that who the individual is behind the device. To do that, you have to effectively proof a user and you have to do that based on standards as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. So we continue to add a lot of certifications to our list. We’ve got a whole webpage dedicated to it on our website. We’ve got corporate certifications like ISO and SOC 2. We’ve got product certifications like NIST, FIDO, and iBeta. What does this certification mean to us as an organization?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, we love certifications. We have a lot of time to go through the certifications.</p>
<p>I mean that’s important, right? It’s important because have different geographies, you want to make sure that those users understand that what we are providing, that this particular technology has been vetted, vetted by their local government based on their standards as well. So I think it’s extremely important, specifically in this case for the UK market, that we are providing a digital identity platform that has been proofed, verified and not just a set of capabilities that are available for them to use.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Fair enough. And that kind of leads into my next question. It is probably more important than the last, but what do these certifications mean to our partners? What does it mean to our customers and even future partners and customers of 1Kosmos?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So anybody, so I’m talking specifically with respect to the UK certification that we have, right? If you are an entity in UK, especially if you are in the public service area, and if you have citizens that need to be proofed or even if you’re in the private sector and you are looking to hire individuals and you want to do that based on a company that is subscribing to these standards, a company that can prove those individual users and securely have them provide access to whatever service that they would like, they can sign up with us.</p>
<p>And what we would then allow to do is these individuals have been proved, have been verified based on this particular standard, this is a result of what the proofing is, we would then provide it to that particular service as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Cool. So what is it about our platform that enables us to meet these seemingly pretty stringent guidelines in your opinion?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>I would say that our platform has been very, very modular, right? So anybody who’s new to this particular podcast, we provide a set of different capabilities, identity proofing, using that particular identity to give secure access to a variety of different systems by using user’s biometrics. And the third aspect of it is to create a digital identity wallet, which will allow a user to be in control of their identity and share their attributes to whatever service that they would like.</p>
<p>What this has allowed us to do is that every specific capability, we have pretty modular where if there are certain standards, if there are certain capabilities that we need to prescribe to, it’s fairly easy for us to make that available as well.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Cool. Okay. So thank you for all that, by the way.</p>
<p>What’s next for 1Kosmos? I mean, like I said earlier, we kind of touched on it briefly, some of the other certifications we have, but what’s next in line for us?</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>More certifications.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Continue to update the website, Rob, okay.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>We’re going through FedRAMP right now. Hopefully we will go through that process fairly soon.</p>
<p>I alluded to this earlier, but there are more government-based standards that are coming up and we are looking to prescribe to that. We are looking to get certified against them as well, not just in US and North America or in UK, but we’re talking about Asia and other parts of Europe as well. So just stay tuned, right? These are developments that are happening and we’ll be looking forward to announce them soon.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. Listen, Huzefa, thank you for taking the time to talk to us about the certification today. This is pretty awesome news and I look forward to talking to you about the next one.</p>
 
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Wonderful. Good catching up with you as well, Rob. Thanks.</p>
 
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
 
<p>Talk to you again.</p>

				  Indicio’s Digital Travel Credential streamlines identity verification at border crossing points for a faster and more secure journey.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>Never would I have thought I’d use the word ‘beautiful’ to describe my experience passing through immigration when traveling internationally, but that’s exactly how it felt last week in Aruba. The reason? <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-301989815.html">Aruba’s Happy One Pass (AHOP).</a> I was able to walk through border control without having to take my passport out of my pocket. It was so quick and smooth that I didn’t realize it happened.</p>
<p>With this system, you can actually go from the airplane to the beach in just 30 minutes, completely transforming the typical airport and arrival experience. And lucky travelers to Aruba will begin using the same technology to enter and depart the island nation in March 2024. This is not a federated system that sends information to other third parties and is held by others. Travelers hold their digital passport data just like they hold their physical passports — and there is full consent for data sharing at each step of the process.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Every traveler must apply for an Embarkation Debarkation card (ED card) to enter Aruba. The night before flying to Aruba, I downloaded the AHOP app on my personal mobile phone using a special invitation sent by the Government of Aruba. Then I used my mobile phone camera to scan my passport and the RFID scanner to collect the information from the chip inside, allowing me to create a Digital Travel Credential (DTC). After taking a selfie, my face was matched and liveness was checked to ensure the passport was actually mine. Then, I sent my DTC, directly to the government of Aruba during my ED Card application process. They used my biometrics and personal information to process my application and send me my approved digital ED card. In other words, the Government of Aruba was able to check my passport and clear me for arrival all while I sat on my couch.</p>
<p>The next day when I landed in Aruba, instead of standing in a long line in the immigration terminal to get my paper documents and passports visually inspected, I headed toward the “AHOP” line, where I was presented with a camera that took my photo. Within seconds, the system had matched my face with the photo I’d sent the night before, verified my immigration status, showed the security officer the match, the green light flashed and I went on my way. It was the easiest immigration system I’d ever encountered.</p>
<p>In adopting this technology, Aruba isn’t just positioning itself as a global leader in digital travel, it is extending the seamless digital experience to everything a tourist might need or want when they visit the island, from hotel check in to booking activities with approved tour operators.</p>
<p>This seamless approach to guest services fully aligns with consumer expectations that anything and everything digital should be quick, contactless, and frictionless. The bonus with the technology used by Aruba is that it does all this while providing travelers with state-of-the-art data privacy and protection.</p>
<p>While this technology will change the experience of travel and tourism, the underlying technological accomplishment — the ability to verify the source of any data and that the data hasn’t been altered — will transform every facet of digital interaction across every sector.</p>
<p>AHOP is a milestone for Indicio, its partner in the air travel sector, SITA, and Aruba. Next stop, the world.</p>

<p>Ensuring the safety of sensitive data and privacy shifts from just a priority to an absolute necessity. Authentication, the gatekeeper of these digital resources, is crucial in this fight against cybercrime.&nbsp; In this article, you will learn what it is, why it’s helpful, how it differs from other types of authentication, and how you could implement it in your organization.</p>
 What is Step-Up Authentication? 
<p>Step Up Authentication is a dynamic form of multi-factor authentication. It works by adjusting the level of security and user verification based on the associated risk of a specific action, transaction, or mobile account.</p>
<p>Different triggers can prompt Step Up Authentication’s activation, like irregular user behavior, access requests from unfamiliar locations or devices, or high-risk transactions accessing sensitive data. Users may initially authenticate via traditional methods (username/password), but Step Up Authentication comes into play as the perceived risk escalates, demanding additional login credentials.</p>
<p>Step Up Authentication uses a hierarchical model adaptive authentication scheme, scaling from simple to complex; it provides the flexibility to apply the optimal level of security based on the perceived threat or the user’s risk profile.</p>
 The Anatomy of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes operation of Step Up Authentication is a balance between risk assessment and corresponding adjustments to the step up authentication work up level. Each transaction or request initiates a process where the system evaluates the risk level and prompts the user for a related step up authentication.</p>
<p>To make these decisions, the system utilizes various risk assessment metrics. These include factors such as the sensitivity of the requested data, the location of the user’s location request, the behavior of the user, and even the time of the request.</p>
<p>Policy management plays a big role here, as it sets the rules and parameters for when and how the system should step up the authentication process. These policies, dictated by the nature of the business and its unique security requirements, ensure that the system remains secure and user-friendly.</p>
 The Evolution of Authentication 
<p>The progression of authentication techniques paints an interesting picture of human ingenuity in the face of evolving threats. Beginning with the humble password, these techniques have developed in response to escalating risks and more sophisticated threat actors.</p>
<p>The initial stage was dominated by password-based authentication systems, a straightforward and user-friendly method, yet not without its weaknesses. Passwords, being susceptible to breaches via techniques like brute-force attacks and phishing, necessitated a more robust system.</p>
<p>Subsequently, security tokens emerged as a new layer of protection. Yet, their physical nature introduced inconvenience and added risk of loss or theft. Later, the advent of biometric authentication marked a significant stride forward against identity theft, tying access to unique human characteristics such as fingerprints or retinal patterns.</p>
<p>The most significant leap in this evolutionary process was the introduction of multi-factor authentication, combining multiple layers of security to create a formidable barrier to unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
 How Step-Up Authentication Differs from Multi-Factor Authentication&nbsp; &amp; Adaptive Authentication 
<p>While both Step-Up Authentication,&nbsp; Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Adaptive Authentication serve the goal of improved security, they differ significantly in their approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MFA involves presenting two or more independent credentials at every step up authentication vs. event. This could include something the user knows (password), something the user has (token), or something the user is (biometrics). MFA’s strength lies in its layered defense, using multiple authentication factors and making it challenging for unauthorized users to gain access even if they compromise one aspect.</p>
<p>Adaptive Authentication employs real-time risk assessments, considering many factors such as device reputation, IP reputation, geolocation, and behavior anomalies. Based on these assessments, Adaptive Authentication may permit, or deny authentication apps, or step up the authentication process.</p>
<p>Step-Up Authentication adjusts its various authentication factors and requirements based on the perceived risk level of a transaction or request. It might begin with a simple or two-factor authentication, such as a password, and add more layers as risk escalates. It offers the flexibility of user-friendly authentication for low-risk actions and robust security for higher-risk operations.</p>
 Viewing vs. Editing Data 
<p>One of the significant features of Step-Up Authentication is its ability to adapt to the nature of the user’s actions. For instance, when a user views data, the authentication process might require only the user’s password or a simple username and password in/password combination. This allows users to perform low-risk actions with minimal friction.</p>
<p>However, when the same user attempts to edit or export sensitive data, the system recognizes the higher risk and steps up the authentication process. This could involve using additional authentication credentials, such as a one-time password, biometric verification, or answering security questions. This dynamic response to requires users based on the action type underlines the adaptability and intelligence of Step-Up Authentication.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication in Practice 
<p>In practice, you’ll encounter Step Up Authentication in different scenarios, Financial institutions often apply it during high-value transactions. Cloud services employ it when users request access to susceptible information. It’s becoming increasingly ubiquitous across digital platforms, from email services to social media networks.</p>
<p>Sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and corporate entities, utilize Step Up Authentication as an essential tool in their security arsenal. It is increasingly recognized as a powerful means to secure sensitive data, protect user identities and stolen credentials, and maintain system integrity.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication Use Cases 
<p>Step-Up Authentication is not just a theory but a reality with practical applications across various digital platforms. For example, take a standard action like transferring funds from a banking app. Users might log in to the app using a username/password or biometric authentication. However, when the user initiates a high-value transfer, the system might request additional identity verification as a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user’s registered mobile number or email.</p>
<p>Another use case can be found within corporate systems; an employee may be able to access common, low-sensitivity resources using a simple password. Still, when attempting to access further sensitive resources, more sensitive information, or administrative controls, the system prompts them to undergo further authentication, such as answering security questions or presenting a physical token.</p>
 The Strengths of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>By assessing its impact, the merits of Step Up Authentication become abundantly clear. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to bolster security, creating a robust defense against a wide array of cyber threats.</p>
<p>But its benefits extend beyond security; it contributes significantly to improving user experience, as the need for rigorous additional authentication factors and measures only arises under elevated risk conditions. This reduces friction and potential frustration in day-to-day user interactions.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, Step Up Authentication also aids in meeting regulatory requirements for data breach protection. Moreover, it has become a potent tool in the risk management arsenal, offering an adaptive and responsive approach to data breaches and threat mitigation.</p>
 Pitfalls and Proactive Measures 
<p>Like any system, Step Up Authentication has its potential pitfalls. These include technical implementation challenges, user acceptance, and the ever-present struggle to balance security with ease of use. However, with a strategic approach, these obstacles can be navigated effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proactive problem-solving measures, such as comprehensive user education programs, policy optimization, and ongoing system monitoring and updating, are key to addressing these challenges.&nbsp;</p>
 Security Implications and Concerns in Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Though a significant security improvement, step-Up Authentication has potential risks and vulnerabilities. Understanding these security implications and how they can be mitigated is essential to ensure robust protection against cyber threats.</p>
<p>One potential concern is user acceptance and cooperation. Given its nature, users may need clarification on the changing requirements for authentication. This issue is not just a usability concern but also a security concern, as user non-compliance or bypass attempts can introduce vulnerabilities into the system.</p>
<p>Another concern revolves around the accuracy of risk assessment. The effectiveness of Step-Up Authentication depends primarily on correctly identifying and responding to potential risks. Inaccurate risk assessments can lead to security breaches if high-risk actions are not identified correctly and high-risk resources don’t trigger a step-up in authentication.</p>
<p>The additional security measures used in Step-Up Authentication, like biometrics or security questions, bring potential vulnerabilities. For instance, biometric data can be spoofed, and security questions can often be guessed or discovered through social engineering.</p>
 Mitigation Practices for Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Mitigating these concerns involves several strategies:</p>
 
 Clear communication about how the system works and its necessity can be beneficial to increase user acceptance.&nbsp; 
 User training can also help ensure that users understand the authentication requirements. 
 Refinement of the risk assessment algorithm and learning from past mistakes are critical for improving risk assessment accuracy.&nbsp; 
 Regular auditing and testing can help identify potential weaknesses in the risk assessment process. 
 
<p>As for the vulnerabilities related to additional security measures, it is key to ensure these are implemented with their own security best practices. For instance, biometric data should be stored securely, and liveness detection tools, like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/contact/">BlockID,</a> should be used to prevent spoofing.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Within an organization, inactive user accounts can persist for various reasons, including former employees, service providers, and service accounts associated with products or services. These accounts may remain inactive temporarily or for extended periods. If an account remains inactive for 90 days or more, it is more likely to remain inactive. It’s crucial to periodically review these inactive accounts and eliminate any that are unnecessary. Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews now offers the capability to detect inactive accounts effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Entra ID Governance Access Review feature, it’s possible to identify accounts that have not been actively used to sign into Entra ID, either interactively or non-interactively, for up to 720 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounts that are left inactive are susceptible to being targeted by cybercriminals for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inactive accounts may still use well-known passwords or credentials that have been compromised.&nbsp; 
 Inactive accounts are less likely to have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.&nbsp; 
 Due to their inactivity, these accounts may go unnoticed by advanced security controls in place.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While organizations with a formal JML (Joiners, Movers, and Leavers) process in place can mitigate some of these risks, regular reviews are still essential to ensure that security measures are effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding the standards for monitoring accounts&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator">CIS Control V8 Safe guard 5.3</a> it’s recommended to delete or disable any dormant accounts after a period of 45 days of inactivity, where supported. This is also aligned with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-privileged-access#pa-4-review-and-reconcile-user-access-regularly">Azure Security Benchmark v3 PA-4 Control</a> - Review and reconcile user access regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yuting and Nico are the founders of ZKorum. Yuting earned her Bachelor's degree at NYU Abu Dhabi and her Master's at ESSEC Business School. Nico is a Software Engineer and previously worked on projects that utilized Filecoin. </p><p>Nico is passionate about self-sovereign identity, and when he and Yuting joined forces, they started building this vision of a social network that runs on verifiable and anonymous data. </p><p>They both recognized a big problem with social media today. It's incredibly invasive and full of bots, scams, and disinformation. We cannot trust anyone online, and we have no way to prove that we are who we say we are unless we trust a third party to verify our identities. For example, some apps require you to verify your identity by uploading your ID. But this is very invasive. </p><p>Furthermore, our personal information is being collected and sold online every day by data brokers. In fact, the global data broker market was valued at <a href="https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/global-data-broker-market#:~:text=The%20global%20data%20broker%20market,US%24545.431%20billion%20in%202028.">$319 billion</a> in 2021. According to the <a href="https://epic.org/issues/consumer-privacy/data-brokers/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a>, data brokers collect and aggregate numerous types of personal information, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, gender, age, marital status, children, education, profession, income, political preferences, cars, and real estate owned. </p><p>Is there a better solution? How can we verify ourselves without trusting the third-party verifier and keeping our personal information safe?</p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs! A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method or protocol used to demonstrate the authenticity of a statement or the possession of certain knowledge without revealing the actual information or knowledge itself. </p><p>Currently, ZKorum uses zero-knowledge proofs by acting as both the issuer and the verifier of Verifiable Credentials. Most large organizations already own a domain name and distribute unique email addresses to their members. Using this infrastructure, ZKorum can issue the user corresponding Verifiable Credentials, such as "female employee of XYZ Company." In this way, the user can prove her eligibility without revealing any unique identifier. ZKorum's closed-source competitors also rely on email addresses to verify that users indeed belong to those companies, but by being 100% open-source, ZKorum minimizes the trust that users need to put in them. In other words, "Don't trust, verify." Even in the event of a security breach, data would already be anonymized and unlikable to user profiles. &nbsp;</p> ZKorum as a Social Site <p>Yuting and Nico wanted to build an online forum where communities and verified members could create and participate in anonymous polls, surveys, discussions, and votes - a progressive web app where anyone can browse the existing public surveys and view their results.</p>Example Poll (Source: ZKorum)<p>ZKorum strives to create a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels secure and comfortable sharing their experiences and exchanging opinions without fearing backlash. That is why privacy-preserving technology is so important!</p> How is ZKorum using Fission Tech? <p>ZKorum is using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> for passwordless authentication between the client and the server. Since ZKorum took a DID-centric authentication approach using a wallet, they needed cryptographic keys.</p><p>However, ZKorum innovated even further by taking the security and seamlessness of UCAN authentication and combining it with the ease of use of email address verification. A one-time code is used to register a new user and their device, and then every request is signed using the device’s DID. Currently, ZKorum is utilizing the WebCrypto API to store cryptographic secrets in the browser, but eventually, it will switch to passkeys. ZKorum opted to hide the UCAN authentication behind the email address login flow because users are used to it, and they did want to overwhelm folks with technical jargon or multiple steps. ZKorum's end users are not expected to be highly technical users. They might be, but there is no assumption there. The idea is that anyone who can answer surveys on a computer will be able to understand how to use the ZKorum web app.</p> Future Plans <p>Yuting and Nico see ZKorum as a powerful way to protect people's privacy by separating a user's profile from their actions, also known as unlinkability. They want to build an open-source library providing this core feature of unlinkability, making it available for other developers to use across different products of their own.</p><p>ZKorum also actively provides feedback to the EU regulators and builders working on the EU ID Wallet. ZKorum aims to be compatible with official Verifiable Credentials, such as the European Digital Identity.</p><p>Yuting and Nico are also working with the Master's Program at ESSEC Business School in France to issue Verifiable Credentials, which would be a novel way to engage the student body and gather their opinion.</p> <p>If you want to learn more about Zkorum, please visit their <a href="https://zkorum.notion.site/9c3e955c69204a2a82d23dd2e2621a30?v=1d312aa5f20b43a09f95a94ca98b75ac">website</a>.</p>

A 3-way points tie for 3rd place brought 5 participants to the podium in this data challenge. Overview <p>This data challenge leaped into the fascinating world of automobile reviews with the “AutoInsight Challenge.” This challenge invited participants to delve deep into Doug DeMuro’s car review score. Here data scientists could explore, analyze, and uncover the data’s myriad stories and insights directly from Doug’s scoring metrics. Participants were able to navigate various aspects of the car reviews, from understanding correlations between different scoring categories to exploring how these scores might influence car prices. This data challenge received the most amount of submissions to date in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Program</a> and as a result, this experiment produced some of the highest-quality reports recorded to date. Enough high-quality reports to grant a 3-way tie for a 3rd-place finish on the&nbsp;podium.</p><p>The dataset, pulled from <a href="https://www.dougdemuro.com/">https://www.dougdemuro.com/</a> comprises 585 car reviews, revealing a balanced representation between weekend and daily scores across 80 car&nbsp;brands.</p> Objectives <p>The challenge embraced several data analysis dimensions: from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to insightful data visualization and predictive modeling. Participants unraveled the data, made it clean and coherent for analysis then subsequently explored it to uncover insights, correlations, and patterns within the data. The key purpose for participants in this challenge was to Submit a comprehensive report synthesizing their findings from the data analysis in a format that is accessible and engaging for a non-technical audience, such as car enthusiasts or prospective car buyers; or even Doug DeMuro&nbsp;himself.</p><p>The winning reports for this challenge are as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st place — Luca Ordronneau <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:8883bc816cea8651382e83caa1193a1c7ac3fbe7ef0ad4abaca3415c21d2677b">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:8883bc816cea8651382e83caa1193a1c7ac3fbe7ef0ad4abaca3415c21d2677b</a></p><p>Due to an emphasis on the business readiness objective of this challenge and reporting structure, the review committee agreed that the report entered by Luca Ordronneau included the most precise, clean, and thorough information about the data and challenge at hand. Luca’s report efficiently demonstrated relationship analysis in the data, a complete understanding of the dataset, and business-ready formatting in this winning&nbsp;entry.</p><p>A snippet above shows a slide from Luca’s report that tells an audience the top 20 cars with the highest Doug score. Further data organization leads readers to learn that Doug often favors German vehicles, and as the year of the car model increases, so does the average score that Doug gives to the given car make &amp;&nbsp;model.</p> 2nd Place — FonkMasterFlexr <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:858bb213650fe33e086560e7743c52ff2ba37817a8678dad5ca1c43cc26c4141">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:858bb213650fe33e086560e7743c52ff2ba37817a8678dad5ca1c43cc26c4141</a></p><p>The 2nd place finish in this challenge includes a high-speed and high-impact approach to navigating through Doug’s car scores. FonkMasterFlexr, in this exercise, displayed great execution in delivering clear-cut and direct findings from the dataset and recommendations to prospective luxury car buyers whilst leveraging data science&nbsp;tools.</p><p>The above shares a snippet from FonkMasterFlexr report: here the Fonk Master shows readers a dual nature between the weekend score and daily score. If you know Doug’s brand and channel, you know there are different sides to not only the personalities of weekday and weekend vibes of classic cars but also the personalities of the people driving said&nbsp;cars.</p><p>This data challenge received a record-high 18 qualifying submissions. After scoring and review, the calculations for podium finishes and prizes resulted in a 3-way tie for 3rd place. To accompany so many high-value reports, the Ocean Data Challenge team approved allowing all 5 submissions to enter the podium finish. The 3-way tie for 3rd place includes the following:</p> 3rd — Haumea <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:969d503eb93dbe852748159ce9422f3eb99670f02bf80ad6432e1f20973730ad">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:969d503eb93dbe852748159ce9422f3eb99670f02bf80ad6432e1f20973730ad</a></p><p>The report “The World of Cars through Doug DeMuro’s Eyes” by Haumea analyzes Doug DeMuro’s car review dataset to understand how various factors influence a car’s overall rating. Relevant findings include a negative correlation between Practicality and Fun Factor, with Practicality scoring negatively influencing the overall DougScore, and a strong positive correlation between Acceleration and Handling, suggesting sportier cars excel in both, though at a cost to Comfort, especially for cars with Acceleration ratings above 6. The report also identifies a weak correlation between Styling and Quality, indicating that a car’s aesthetic appeal doesn’t always match its build&nbsp;quality.</p><p>The analysis shows that sport-oriented brands like Lamborghini and Ferrari typically score higher on Weekend Scores, while family-oriented brands like Lexus and Hyundai excel in Daily Scores. The study also reveals non-linear relationships and interaction effects between scoring components, such as high Acceleration and Handling scores disproportionately boosting the overall DougScore, while improvements in Styling or Comfort have diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds. The report’s insights provide a nuanced understanding of Doug DeMuro’s scoring system and offer valuable perspectives for automotive industry professionals and car&nbsp;buyers.</p> 3rd — Nicolas&nbsp;Landry <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:b1eee66c360e73b45844689f05614260bf3e285748fe57d2f9d53a6fbcb4ebad">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:b1eee66c360e73b45844689f05614260bf3e285748fe57d2f9d53a6fbcb4ebad</a></p><p>A standout finding is a negative correlation between Practicality and Fun Factor, with vehicles like the Rivian R1T and GMC Hummer EV Pickup ranking high in these categories, but Value remains a distinctly independent factor. The analysis also uncovers a strong positive correlation between Handling and Acceleration, indicating that cars that accelerate faster generally handle better. However, this comes at the expense of Comfort, especially for cars with an acceleration rating above&nbsp;6.</p>The image above shows a heat map of interaction effects found between DougScore indicators.<p>Further, the report explores the nuanced relationship between Styling, Quality, and Cool Factor, with a subtle positive correlation between Styling and Cool Factor, but a weak negative correlation with Quality. Brand-wise, sports brands like Lamborghini, McLaren, and Ferrari focus on Weekend Scores, contrasting with family-oriented brands like Lexus and Hyundai, which excel in Daily Scores. The report is insightful for its exploration of how different scoring components interact, particularly highlighting the disproportionate impact of high acceleration and handling scores on the overall DougScore and the diminishing returns in areas like styling or comfort beyond certain thresholds. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable perspectives for both the automotive industry and potential car buyers, dissecting the nuances that make a car stand out in Doug DeMuro’s&nbsp;reviews.</p> 3rd — Philip&nbsp;Roman <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0cf0fbd28a359ce8ff06c5f1bab47f2e70a4e25f6e0c51fd7dd110890fec04b3">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0cf0fbd28a359ce8ff06c5f1bab47f2e70a4e25f6e0c51fd7dd110890fec04b3</a></p><p>Key findings in this 3rd place tying report include strong correlations between score categories, such as the negative correlation between Fun Factor and Practicality, and the positive correlation between Acceleration and Handling. It reveals the interaction effects of score components and their non-linear influence on the final DougScore. The report also explores relationships between car origins and scores, indicating higher average DougScores for cars from Germany, Italy, and the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>Notably, this report uncovered diminishing returns in the DougScore for cars with very high ratings in specific categories. Overall, the report highlights the complexity of the DougScore, emphasizing the importance of a balanced car profile in achieving high&nbsp;ratings.</p>Here Philips report compares fun factor and practicability scores.

<p>In a previous blog we introduced <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/digital-certificate-linting/">Digital Certificate Linting</a>. It is interesting how certification authorities (CAs) have deployed certificate linting of public trust certificates without policy requirements from the browsers or the CA/Browser Forum. Linting does not need to be mandated as it naturally helps CAs to be compliant by limiting certificate miss-issuance. This also increases customer service as certificates do not need to be revoked and reissued.</p>
<p>Over a number of years, Entrust has slowly deployed linting. Our first goal was to ensure the linters were not developed by the same team which developed our products. The thought was to minimize the duplication of errors in the policy software and the linting software. We focused on using third party linters for TLS certificates such as cablint and <a href="https://github.com/zmap/zlint">zlint</a>.</p>
<p>Entrust first ran linting against all of our active TLS certificates to find issues and remove errors. We ran post-issuance linting to detect errors, which do not interfere with certificate issuance. When we were happy with the results, we implemented pre-issuance linting.</p>
<p>With pre-issuance linting, if there is a linting error detected a certificate should not be issued. When a pre-certificate is issued for certificate transparency (CT) logging, then the pre-certificate with a linting error will be revoked. The goal of pre-issuance linting is to not miss-issue certificates and provide the details of the error to the team in order to correct the issue.</p>
<p>Although the public certificate linters were designed for TLS certificates, we expanded post-issuance linting to all certificate types. This was done first by only using the non-TLS components of the linters, plus adding other specific components. For each issuing CA, we created a certificate profile, which the CA could issue. This would separate each CA to its certificate type and would narrow down the CA scope to its key usage, extended key usage, permitted key size, hash algorithm, certificate policy, CRL link, etc. We also added in weak key checking, CT logging requirements, and ensured the subject name met the requirements which were validated.</p>
<p>Certificate linting can support the three per cent self-audit requirement from the CA/Browser Forum baseline requirement documents. In fact, since linting is done in an automated fashion, it can be extended to 100 per cent of the certificates. The result is the most extensive and non-subjective self-audit methodology, which may be the primary source of detecting certificate miss-issuance. In the case where a CA miss-issues a certificate which is not detected by linting, the CA may consider updating the linting software to better detect the error in the future. In addition, the linting results and actions can also be provided to the compliance auditor, which shows extensive monitoring and actions when an error is detected.</p>
<p>All CAs issuing publicly trusted certificates should consider certificate linting. Also, CAs which perform linting, but have miss-issued certificates should consider whether linting can be updated to detect the error in the future. Updates to shared linting software will reduce the risk to browser users and the inconvenience to secure server operators.</p>

To us, this recognition is an acknowledgement to our deep understanding of the market, our teams of innovators, and our close collaboration with customers, partners, and industry experts to deliver the products and services needed in the dynamic, digital economy.</p>

<p>We take pride in our history of providing simple and safe access experiences for all identities across any environment and we're thrilled to be recognized as a Leader in this space. And now that ForgeRock has joined forces with Ping Identity — another recognized Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Access Management — we anticipate even greater opportunities to serve customers' needs through broader and deeper product capabilities.</p>

<p>For more information, please download the full <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2023">2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management report</a>.</p>

<p>Ping Identity's PingOne Cloud Platform and ForgeRock Identity Cloud were both named as a Leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management. The two solutions were evaluated independently before Ping Identity and ForgeRock were combined on August 23, 2023.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRock Product Capabilities 

<p>ForgeRock Access Management capabilities come together seamlessly through identity administration and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">access orchestration</a>.</p>
	
<p>ForgeRock's identity administration capabilities help our customers connect and manage their identity data in ways that align with their business objectives. For example, our customers can create organizational hierarchies that represent the reality of their specific customers, brands, partners, suppliers, and more. Next, customers can create relationships between users and organizations to best manage different experience and security requirements for each different user population. At runtime, this data is provided as an input to the orchestration flow, which delivers personalized user journeys based on the dynamic data inputs — all from a single platform.</p>
	
<p>Recent <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> enhancements noted by Gartner include:</p>

  <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">New signals for threat detection</a>: Our AI/ML-powered big data architecture ingests data from various sources and converts that data into signals, giving customers fine-grained control over how the signals are weighted for risk, synthesized, and interpreted. Out-of-the-box signals detect anomalous user behavior, suspicious IP addresses, credential stuffing and brute-force attacks, impossible traveler scenarios, and bots. We are bringing rich signals and prevention from the endpoint to the application and building practical features around those signals to ensure they are explainable and usable in real-world scenarios. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration/capabilities">New flows and connectors to orchestration trees</a>: Intelligent Access (“Trees”) gives customers ultimate control of their user identity experiences through the use of low-code orchestrated identity journeys. We continue to evolve this capability, providing new journeys and nodes (the building blocks of journeys) for common use cases. We also have extended our cloud solution to include Trust Network marketplace nodes for common partner integrations. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passkeys compatibility</a>: We have always been a leader in the passwordless space with early adoption and support of FIDO standards, including WebAuthn. This year, we added support for passkeys, further strengthening our ability to support CIAM and workforce use cases looking to go truly passwordless. 
  ForgeRock and Ping Identity: A Winning Combination 

<p>As we look into the next year, the combination of ForgeRock and Ping Identity will drive further innovation and greater customer value in the access management space. I believe having a unified vision and strategy is a winning combination for customers seeking the best solutions for their often complex needs — and our collective team has years of expertise and diverse backgrounds to help on that journey.</p>

<p>To learn more about the access management market, I'd encourage you to read this latest version of the Gartner Magic Quadrant and check Ping Identity's positioning. I believe analysis by Gartner can help you select a partner that can support your enterprise's need for a modern access management solution.</p>

<p>In the digital age, the symbiotic relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity is undeniable. As AI technologies advance, so do the methods and tactics employed by malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. The intersection of AI and cybersecurity creates a dynamic landscape where innovation and risk coexist. As AI becomes increasingly embedded at every level of our daily lives, it’s important to understand not just the risks from AI, but also the risks to AI.</p>
 Identifying the Threats 
<p>Let’s start with one of the most direct threats to AI, which is what is commonly referred to as data poisoning – the idea of corrupting the data that the AI model learns from. These alterations are strategically crafted to manipulate the behavior of the AI system, causing them to produce unintended outputs or become biased. This could lead to several threats, including propagation of false information, generation of malicious content such as spam, phishing emails, and even flawed code. Data-poisoning attacks can have dire and harmful consequences. For instance, an image recognition system might misclassify a stop sign as a yield sign in real-world applications like autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Even if not directly and deliberately poisoned, it’s also important to consider what data a given AI platform is being trained on. At the moment, there is something of a free-for-all when it comes to scraping data for input for many of the popular generative AI platforms and other large language models. This is undergoing something of a backlash, both technological and legal. Where an AI application gets the data it learns from has implications for bias and hallucination, but also potentially opens the door for proprietary information getting out.</p>
<p>On a related note, with so many vendors trying to jump on the proverbial AI bandwagon and add AI capabilities to their applications, it’s right to be concerned about the levels of robust design, learning, and testing being implemented in the rush. This is a complex domain and is rapidly becoming not just a new tool but also a new attack surface.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ethical implications of AI pose a unique set of cybersecurity challenges. Issues such as biased algorithms and the misuse of AI for malicious purposes raise concerns about the potential for discrimination and privacy violations. Cybersecurity measures must not only focus on protecting AI systems from external threats but also address internal risks related to the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.</p>
 Mitigating Risks 
<p>A bit like Isaac Asimov’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">three laws of robotics</a>, we have the three Hs to manage the potential risks due to advanced AI systems – to be Helpful, Harmless, and Honest. For an enterprise looking to implement business, security, or automation AI-enhanced tools within their business, this boils down to asking where, in all of the interactions with the AI tool, can verification steps be added and what assurances can the vendor provide.</p>
<p>To mitigate these cybersecurity threats, organizations must adopt a multi-faceted approach based in the same core principles of Zero Trust, treating output from AIs as “Never Trust, Always Verify.” Establishing standardized best practices, sharing threat intelligence, and fostering an environment of continuous learning are essential components of a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem. Additionally, robust encryption and authentication mechanisms are essential to secure the communication channels between AI systems and prevent unauthorized access. Regular audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to identify and address potential weaknesses in AI infrastructure.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing the ethics side, collaboration between the cybersecurity community, industry stakeholders, and policymakers is crucial to developing and implementing effective strategies against AI-related threats.</p>
<p>As AI continues to revolutionize industries and reshape the technological landscape, the importance of safeguarding these powerful systems from cybersecurity threats cannot be overstated. By maintaining core development principles and fostering collaboration, we can navigate the nexus of AI and cybersecurity to harness the full potential of artificial intelligence while minimizing the associated risks.</p>

<p>The European Digital Identity (EUDI), a cornerstone of the eIDAS regulation, represents a cross-border digital identity initiative set to revolutionise electronic identification in the EU. Available to all EU citizens, residents, and organisations, EUDI is designed to offer a unified, secure, and efficient method for online identity verification. Central to its functionality is the innovative EUDI Wallet, a sophisticated platform for electronic identification that digitally encapsulates individual identities. This wallet integrates various attributes and credentials, ensuring they are stored and managed with utmost security and respect for privacy. As an integral part of the EU digital identity and trust services framework, EUDI extends beyond the wallet, offering a comprehensive solution for digital identity management across the European Union.</p>
 Why is EUDI Needed? 
<p>Although the majority of countries within the EU have some form of national digital identity solution or eID, only 60% of citizens from 14 member states are able to use their eID in another state (cross-border). That leaves over 150 million people in the EU alone without access to strong cross-border authentication, and with only 14% of public service providers allowing cross-border authentication. Yet, 63% of EU citizens want a single eID for online services across the EU according to the Eurobarometer survey (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU Commission</a>). The EUDI will provide an EU-wide digital identity that will allow for cross-border trust service usage.</p>
 Key features of EUDI 
 User-Centric Control: 
<p>At the heart of the EUDI’s design is user-centric control, aligning with eIDAS principles. It empowers both individuals and businesses to manage their electronic identification and digital identity with autonomy. Users have the discretion to select the information they share, the entities they share it with, and the purposes for which it is used. This feature not only enhances user autonomy but also bolsters privacy protection within the digital ecosystem.</p>
 Interoperability: 
<p>EUDI exemplifies interoperability as envisaged in the EU digital identity framework. It offers a harmonised solution across the EU, enabling seamless cross-border access to digital services. An EUDI issued in any member state is recognised across all others, facilitating service access without the need for redundant verification. This interoperability is a significant step towards realising a cohesive digital Europe.</p>
 Security: 
<p>Security is a paramount feature of the EUDI, incorporating state-of-the-art encryption and authentication mechanisms. These technologies protect against identity theft, fraud, and other cyber threats, making EUDI a reliable and secure tool for electronic identification and online transactions.</p>
 Accessibility: 
<p>The EUDI champions digital inclusion, crafted to be accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities or limited access to technology. This inclusive approach is integral to the EU digital identity and trust services ethos, ensuring equal access to online services across all member states.</p>
 Expandability: 
<p>Designed to be versatile, the EUDI supports a wide array of applications, from basic online authentication to more complex uses like digital licenses and insurance. It even facilitates instant payments using the digital Euro, showcasing its adaptability to various digital identity needs and trust services within the EU framework.</p>
 Benefits of EUDI 
<p>The EUDI will be available for all EU citizens that are eligible for a national ID card and will be recognised across the EU. It will be a secure way to share information with services, allowing users to control how much information they want to share. The EUDI will be operated via digital wallets on mobile phones and other devices and will enable users to identify themselves both online and offline. The EUDI wallets will allow users to store and exchange government-provided data (i.e. name, date of birth and nationality), information provided by trusted private sources, and to use the information as confirmation of the right to reside, work, or study in a certain member state. It ultimately provides a cross-border digital identity that will benefit citizens across the EU.</p>
 Practical Uses of EUDI 
<p>There are a variety of key use cases that the EUDI can be used for, including public service applications and requests, opening bank accounts, tax returns and applications to universities, alongside proof of identity, storing medical prescriptions, and securing transactions. There are some use cases that underpin the development of the EUDI Wallet, to support meeting objectives.</p>
 Practical Example of EUDI Usage 
<p>Currently, opening a bank account involves multiple steps that may involve in-person meetings, signing paperwork and a tedious back and forth if any documents are missing. In addition, any cross-border banking is hampered by the lack of standard document formats, document coverage/accuracy and even simple language barriers. However, with the introduction of the EUDI a user would simply be able to respond to the bank’s request by selecting the required documents that are stored on their EUDI wallet, already in a standard format. These documents will then be sent securely to the bank as verifiable digital documents, for the bank to process and continue with the application.</p>
 The interplay between EUDI pilots and eIDAS Regulation 
<p>After a six-month delay, the EUDI pilots are now starting and will continue well into 2024. Unusually, the actual eIDAS legislation is still being developed at the same time, even as the pilots are running. In addition, there are two further parallel streams: writing of the standards and documenting the reference implementation. All four of these elements: legislation, standards, reference implementation and the pilots, are dependent on each other. The standards must comply with the law, the reference implementation needs to implement the standards, and the pilots should utilise the reference implementation. Ideally, feedback from the pilots should in turn guide the legislative process, closing the circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loop of interdependencies is caused both by the repeated delays in defining the base architecture and by the aggressive “Swiss knife” approach to the EUDI by the European Commission. What is often missed, however, is that the main hurdles regarding the whole EUDI project are not technical, or legal framework but political. The EUDI is designed to be much more than a simple mobile authenticator and therefore it must forge a compromise between 27 nation states from minute technical details to very profound decisions potentially affecting hundreds of millions of people – for example, whether to force every resident to adopt a persistent unique identifier.</p>
 The road to hell is paved with eternal secrets 
<p>When we think of strong digital identities, likely the first thing that we visualise is a unique identifier or a “name tag” that is then linked to a natural person for life. That is indeed one possible solution, but perhaps surprisingly there are alternative designs as well. The 27 EU member states have widely varying approaches. In some member states, one is automatically assigned a persistent unique identifier before leaving the maternity hospital. Elsewhere one will be assigned only in specific circumstances, while finally some member states do not assign such identifiers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On paper, having an identifier can simplify many governmental processes and ease digitalisation. However, its unchanging nature makes it very unwieldy in practice. The identifier will continue to exist, unchanged, for the lifetime of an individual. As the end users are required to use it to identify themselves in both on- and offline transactions, it becomes very challenging to simultaneously keep it secret for their entire lifetimes. The same applies to every private and public organisation who stores or processes it, and sadly it takes just a single data breach to lose control of it forever. In the age of pen and paper perhaps this was deemed a not so omnipresent threat. But as digitalisation marches on and KYC legislation spreads from finance to the hospitality industry and beyond, having copies made of one’s personal documents is turning from an exception to a standard policy. As it stands, the persistence and omnipresent use of the unique identifier leaves the unfortunate victims of identity theft with only bad options: either be on constant lookout for any misuse for life or go through the massive process of changing the identifier (if allowed by national legislation) and then getting every single document from one’s birth certificate to school records to work contracts changed to reflect the new identity.</p>
<p>Nothing is certain until the legislation is finalised, but currently it seems likely that the EUDI will controversially force everyone to adopt such an identifier yet seeks to bypass some of the shortcomings both via the magic of public key cryptography and by optionally allowing the creation of pseudonyms – aliases that only officials are able to link to an individual. For example, there could be a ‘healthcare me’, distinct from a ‘banking me’ and a ‘social media me’. Officials would be able to link all three together, but a cybercriminal or a data breach would be (hopefully) limited to an identity affecting a single sector. Of course, this is not a perfect solution, but it certainly is better than no solution.</p>
<p>Once again it should be emphasised that the 27 member nations have very differing opinions on how to best proceed and marking features as optional – like the pseudonyms mentioned above – is a well-known compromise when the standardising body cannot gather enough support to either include or exclude it from the core standards. Optional features rarely become universal, and worryingly it seems likely that any optional features of the EUDI will not be exceptions to this rule. Any optional features will be adopted by some of the member states, while others will decline to take them into use. This threatens the fragmentation of the whole European digital market from day one… which is exactly how the situation stands after eIDAS version 1, and what the EUDI is seeking to solve.</p>
<p>Controversies around the fundamental design principles highlight both the importance of the whole EUDI project, as well as how politically influenced or even driven any cross-border effort can be. It is wrong to say that international projects would be generally disadvantaged from intense debate though, as having over two dozen interest group opinions and different viewpoints is a tremendous advantage to any undertaking. The varied features and pilots of EUDI would not be possible if a single member state would have to carry all the burden by themselves.</p>

             November 2023   
	 
		 
			 Navigating the Booming Trend of Tokenized T-Bills&nbsp; 
 
<p>In recent weeks, the tokenization of Treasury bills (T-bills) has become a trending and popular topic, with on-chain data from our friends from RWA.xyz (see the chart below) revealing a total value of approximately $750 million and an average yield of 5.24%.&nbsp;This marks a remarkable 700% increase for the year, sparking market enthusiasm. However, it’s worth noting that the actual aggregate value of tokenized real-world assets, including T-bills, exceeds reported figures due to traditional players withholding on-chain data, indicating&nbsp;a larger market size than apparent.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>While it is fascinating to see the surging assets brought on-chain, a fundamental question arises:&nbsp;‘Why tokenize?’&nbsp;If the motivation behind tokenizing T-bills is solely market-driven, without added value, it won’t succeed in attracting traditional issuers and investors into the market.&nbsp;Traditional T-bills are already extremely accessible and liquid&nbsp;for US citizens. Individuals outside the US can easily purchase and sell T-bills ETF via fintechs or distributors.</p>
<p>The true value proposition of tokenized T-bills lies in transferability and interoperability,&nbsp;providing holders with unique utilities and automation beyond the scope of traditional forms. This encompasses the capacity for peer-to-peer transfers with eligible counterparts, trading across diverse platforms, utilizing them as collateral for borrowing, and staking to earn additional yields.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>To access these advantages,&nbsp;issuers need control to enforce compliance at the token level, requiring sophisticated smart contracts. Basic standards like ERC20 and ERC721 (NFT) are inadequate, as they are inherently permissionless, allowing unrestricted transfers. This limits issuers to conducting KYC only during the onboarding and redeeming process, with intermittent actions going uncontrollable by issuers.</p>
<p>Hence, the issuance of tokenized T-bills must adopt&nbsp;permissioned token standards such as ERC3643. This enables tokens to embed data and compliance rules&nbsp;to ensure compliant automation, transfers, and interactions throughout the entire token lifecycle while enabling issuers to obtain controls.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Having successfully supported clients in tokenizing T-bills and money market funds through the ERC3643 standard, we’re here to assist if you’re contemplating a similar issuance with a turnkey and white-label solution.</p>

<p></p><p>It was Friday night in New Orleans, and I was ready to kick off the weekend in true local style with a drink. I ordered my favorite wine on a food delivery app, but before the sale could be finalized, the wine store needed to verify my age. Seamlessly, they connected to my digital <a href="https://lawallet.com/">LA Wallet</a>, and without sharing any extra details, my wallet confirmed I was 21+. Within 30 minutes, I was sipping my wine, in awe of the blend of tradition and cutting-edge technology - technology that I'm fortunate to work on, and also enjoy the convenience of.</p> LA Wallet<a title="Direct link to LA Wallet">​</a> <p>Louisiana leads the way with its fully operational mobile driver's license (mDL) system. In the Big Easy, where I live, we go with the flow - meaning you never know what your day may entail. In such a culture, I've really enjoyed the convience of having things like my driver's license and COVID vaccination cards readily available on a mobile app for whenever I may need them.</p><p>Recognized legally as an equalivalent to physical identification, LA Wallet is my go-to for age-restricted purchases/entry, voting, and (heaven forbid) police encounters.  Because of this, the mDL ensures legal compliance and security while leveraging the convenience and accessibility of mobile technology. They accomplish this by using Verifiable Credentials.</p> Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to Verifiable Credentials">​</a> <p>In the simplest terms, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> are digital versions of traditional documents like driver's licenses, passports, or university degrees. But they're more than just digital copies; they're secured with encryption, making them tamper-evident and instantly verifiable.</p><p>When the store connected to my LA Wallet, it wasn't just pulling up a digital version of my driver's license. Instead, the app used a Verifiable Credential – a piece of digital data that proves certain information about me without revealing everything. In this case, it confirmed that I am over the age of 21. The beauty of this system is in its respect for privacy; it didn't disclose my exact age, or any other personal detail that would be available had I shared my full driver's license.</p><p>Once my age was verified, the vendor allowed the purchase, and the delivery proceeded as planned. The entire process was seamless, fast, and respectful of my privacy. This is particularly interesting in my scenario where there's likely legal responsibilities for the delivery company as well as the wine vendor to verify my age. My mDL is a trusted source that can provide this proof to all of the involved parties without sharing all of my details.</p><p>This experience is a prime example of how Verifiable Credentials can simplify and secure everyday transactions. As we move more into the digital realm, the need for secure, private, and efficient verification methods becomes increasingly crucial. Verifiable Credentials meet these needs by offering a way to share necessary information without over-sharing.</p><p>The use of Verifiable Credentials is set to expand in various sectors, from healthcare to finance. As technology continues to evolve, it's exciting to see how innovations like Verifiable Credentials are making our digital lives more convenient and secure. It's not just about the technology; it's about how it enhances our daily experiences, one verification at a time.</p>

   The blog post discusses Federated Identity and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), comparing the two architectures. Functionally, there's a lot in common. Technically, not so much. Read on to learn more!

<p>Understanding federated identity and how it compares to self-sovereign identity (SSI) requires a basic understanding of when, where, and how digital identities are used online today. There is no “one size fits all,” though passionate proponents of various technologies may beg to differ. Alas, the world is not that simple: Different use cases drive different architectures and prioritize different technologies. That makes for quite a bit of confusion and a rather long blog post.</p>



 Why the confusion? 



<p>One question you might ask is, why is there so much confusion, anyway? The terms don’t look anything alike, so surely they must be entirely different things! Well, no, not at a functional level. (The technology stacks used to support that functionality differ, but we’ll discuss that later.)</p>



<p>First, let’s recognize that not everyone even likes the term SSI. It’s unclear whether digital wallet technologies fall under this category; some people say they do, others don’t. Other people are immediately turned off by how early proponents of SSI focused almost exclusively on blockchain technology. For the sake of this post, know that I’m coming at this from the perspective of SSI as an architecture that encompasses a user-centric focus for digital identity credentials. YMMV.</p>



<p>Both Federated Identity and SSI models support similar (but not wholly overlapping) use cases. For example, both models can support remote identification, authentication, and/or authorization to online services. Both require an entity that holds the source records, issues credentials, and supports the possibility of a third party using those credentials. It’s also possible (but rarely implemented in the Federated Identity model) that the person engaged in the transaction has some control over what exactly is shared with the third party requesting the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more!&nbsp;</p>



 Discovery 



<p>In both models, there is also the requirement that an individual be able to make some choices about what credential they want to use. Within Federated Identity, that means being able to pick the identity provider (IdP) from a list or type an identifier for it into a dialog box. In the SSI model, that means being able to pick from a list of locally stored credentials OR picking the correct container (aka, the digital wallet) used to store the appropriate credentials.</p>



<p>If this sounds like a UX nightmare, it is. Federated identity has been used in production environments for decades, and they still haven’t definitively solved what’s referred to as “the discovery problem.” In the research and education sector, for example, a single relying party (RP) might need to offer a choice of nearly 6,000 IdPs for the user to select from. The SSI model is realizing the same pain now, exacerbated by the desire not to let any third party know more information than they absolutely have to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there is just enough functional similarity to make things interesting when talking about these two architectures. Some might even say that SSI is just another flavor of Federated Identity (note: that way lies madness). Now, let’s talk about some of the differences.</p>



 Federated Identity 



<p>What use cases drive decisions toward one model and not the other? Well, for one thing, it provides the company that operates the IdP control over the authentication process and the information shared during the transaction. In the case of an enterprise organization, that makes a lot of sense. Authentication and authorization in this use case is by, for, and about an individual as they relate to a company. It’s not about the individual’s private information; it’s the data about them as associated with and owned by the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all a question of functional requirements. The technology stacks, however, are quite different. When talking about federated identity models, protocols like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml">Security Assertion Markup Language</a>&nbsp;(SAML),&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol">OpenID Connect</a>&nbsp;are what describe (and constrain) everything including the claims, the assertions used, the structure of the attributes shared, the way identity provider discovery is handled, and more. A great deal of control is given to both the RP and the IdP, and there is a coarse level of control for the individual (generally in the form of “you can either choose to log in or not, but you aren’t guaranteed control over what information is shared as a result”).</p>



 SSI 



<p>The SSI model is a very different beast in the underlying assumptions, protocols, and architecture used. The most important entity involved in any transaction is the individual, aka the user (not my favorite term, but it’s pretty common in the documentation). The individual decides what information is shared and with whom. In a typical use case, when an individual uses a credential in an SSI model, nothing reports back to the issuing authority that lets them track what the individual is doing with their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, the individual has discrete control over every bit of information in their credential. In fact, the protocols are being designed to ensure a minimum of information is shared in an identity transaction. For example, when a third party asks for verification that the individual is over 55, all they should get in return is a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ They should not get the date of birth, home address, a photo, and whether the individual has chosen to donate organs upon death: the information shared when presenting a physical US driver’s license to verify age. Another name for this is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dock.io/post/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a>.</p>



<p>When considering the protocols, SAML (as far as I know) will never properly fit in an SSI world. OAuth and OpenID Connect may, and there’s work in progress to make that happen (check out&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;if you want to know more). Work is also underway regarding the credential itself, most notably the W3C’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/">Verifiable Credential</a>&nbsp;efforts, the&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT specification</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ul.com/resources/new-isoiec-standard-electronic-credentials">ISO’s mdocs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 New Solutions 



<p>The good news is that, as one likes to see when it comes to evolving technologies, SSI is helping solve some of the challenges that traditional Federated Identity models weren’t able (or chose not to for reasons that made sense at the time) to support. I already mentioned selective disclosure. SSI models have this as a fundamental requirement of the technology, not just something that an IdP might implement on behalf of its users but rarely under the control of its users. Big privacy win here!</p>



<p>Another possibility in this brave new world is cross-device support. Rather than a password that has to be memorized and/or copied over to multiple devices (for example), a credential that lives on one mobile device can be used in an authentication or authorization process on another device, like a desktop or tablet. (I will note that this may fall under the category of “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” There will be a LOT of different types of credentials, even identity-focused ones, available to the individual. They are not all designed with authentication in mind.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, when a credential is designed for authentication and authorization AND moves us away from relying on passwords, it is really a Very Good Thing.&nbsp;</p>



 New Problems 



<p>Sign me up! Let’s do it! Rah Rah, go, team!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or, maybe not quite yet, because new challenges must be addressed before people decide to jump on the SSI bandwagon.</p>



<p>For one thing, the UX challenges are pretty significant. The technologies under development to move ahead in an SSI model support more than just identity. They also support payment systems, transportation tickets, library cards, insurance cards, hotel keys, car keys – the list goes on. It’s one thing to compare this model as similar to having all these cards in a physical wallet, but there comes the point where there are too many cards for me to find the right one when I need it. Surely, a computer can search for the one I need, right? Right?</p>



<p>Well, not yet. This is where the privacy considerations make usability that much harder. Credentials are often stored in a digital wallet, and that wallet protects the credentials from any random request. Arguably, the wallet shouldn’t have anything to do with the credentials it holds any more than a physical wallet has anything to do with the cards it holds. Just to make sure we’re maxing out on the potential for complexity here, there may be more than one wallet holding various credentials!&nbsp;</p>



 More New Problems 



<p>Not everyone wants to live in a paternalistic nation-state that assumes people are unlikely to make good choices and protects their population by restricting various freedoms and technical innovations. That said, not everyone wants to live in a completely libertarian environment that leaves individuals responsible for their actions, whether or not the ramifications of those actions are clear. Trying to find the compromise in the middle usually involves some level of transparency and accountability so that it’s possible to verify all parties did the right thing as defined by contract or law.</p>



<p>That’s not too hard in a traditional Federated Identity system. The IdP has logs of transactions. The RP has logs, too. The only entity that (probably) doesn’t have logs is the individual (although the IdP and the RP sometimes make their logs visible to the user). With two out of three parties having info on what happened, cross-checking becomes possible if something goes to court.</p>



<p>However, In an SSI model, the entity that issues the credential knows that it issued it. When it comes to the credentials being used, however, they (in some implementations) don’t know anything – on purpose. The RP (aka, the Verifier) may only know a potentially small subset of information that doesn’t identify the individual at all. Whether the individual (or the device or application holding their credential) has a transaction log is still under debate and may be an implementation detail. Some developers may implement one (and get yelled at regarding the privacy implications), and some may not (and get yelled at for not supporting accountability and transparency).&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>The functionality of Federated Identity and SSI architectures is similar if you tilt your head just right. Both serve to support remote authentication and authorization. Both have one party responsible for creating the digital identity credential, another party expected to consume it, and an individual (and their devices) instigating the transaction in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technical decisions that inform the protocols and subsequent implementations, however, are where the designs quickly divide. While no one wants to support more identity systems than is necessary; the traditional Federated Identity model and the newer SSI architecture are not mutually exclusive. They just focus on solving different problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t help that SSI technologies are very young and under active debate and development. The technology you see right now is not fully baked, and it still needs to grow to solve everything technologists hope it will. Of course, you can wait for that and ask someone to let you know when it’s all resolved. Or, as always, my preferred option: you can get involved in the discussions to ensure you help guide these technologies’ development and deployment.</p>

 Although financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK’s financial services industry, when it comes to crypto, there appears to be confusion over what is and what isn’t allowed, and who the new rules actually apply to. Our Global Head of Crypto and FinTech, Jason Tucker-Feltham explains all. 



 



<p><br>Within just 24 hours of the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA) releasing its<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-issues-146-alerts-first-24-hours-new-crypto-marketing-regime#"> financial promotions regime</a> for the crypto industry, it had issued 146 alerts of unregulated crypto firms illegally promoting crypto assets in the UK.</p>



<p>While these startling high numbers could be interpreted as a reflection of the FCA’s commitment to safeguarding consumers and fostering a responsible crypto industry amidst ongoing regulatory developments, it also showcases how unprepared the UK’s crypto industry is. Or, at the very least, how difficult the FCA registration process for crypto firms can be.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a financial promotion? 



<p>According to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/21">Section 21</a> of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, a financial promotion refers to “an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, communicated by a person in the course of business.”</p>



<p>In other words, financial promotions are advertisements or other promotional materials used by financial firms to market their products to consumers. Financial promotions can be disseminated via newspapers, mailings, product brochures, social media platforms (remember the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183/"> Kim Kardashian scandal for touting crypto in 2022?</a>), websites, in fact, any medium if they include an invitation or incentive targeting consumer credit activity.</p>



<p>The FCA regulates the conduct of nearly 50,000 firms to ensure the fairness, honesty, and competitiveness of the UK’s financial markets. According to the <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/">FCA Handbook</a>, all financial promotions must be clearly identifiable, accurate, balanced, and not misleading. Promotions must explicitly mention prominent risk warnings and must not contain inappropriate incentives. Since financial promotions by firms can influence a consumer’s decision when choosing a financial product or service, they must comply with specific FCA rules. Firms must also, of course, be registered with the FCA.</p>



<p>The fact that the FCA had to issue so many alerts on the first day of the new regime emphasizes its vigilant approach to crypto asset promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s not only the UK that has measures in place to protect consumers from unregulated entities. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) regulates financial promotions in the US, while in Canada, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency.html">Financial Consumer Agency of Canada</a> protects the rights of consumers of financial products and services.&nbsp;</p>



 Financial promotion punishments. 



<p>So, what punishment awaits the 146 companies that broke the rules on the very first day of the regime? Well, as per the FCA Handbook, anyone committing a financial promotion criminal offense may face up to two years of imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The FCA will assess the severity of the breach to determine the appropriate penalty level, which ranges from Level 1 to Level 5.</p>



<p>Crypto firms in the UK have been aware of the upcoming rules, and the potential repercussions of sending out financial promotions for quite a while. In 2022, there were <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/annual-reports/annual-report-2022-23.pdf">1,882 warnings issued</a>, marking a 34% increase from the previous year. As a result, 8,582 financial promotions were amended or withdrawn, which was 14x more than observed in 2021. Financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK financial services industry.</p>



 Riding the wave of crypto. 



<p>The rise of crypto and <a href="https://crypto.com/university/bull-vs-bear-market-difference">extreme market cycles</a> have resulted in many wondering if they too could benefit financially from investing in crypto assets. Recent reports suggest there are as many as <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/crypto-wealth-report-2023#:~:text=There%20are%2088%2C200%20crypto%20millionaires,investment%20migration%20specialists%20Henley%20%26%20Partners.">88,200 crypto millionaires</a>, including some fairytale stories of people amassing their wealth by investing very small amounts. However, the sheer number of <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/heres-how-many-crypto-coins-failed-last-year/#:~:text=How%20many%20cryptocurrencies%20have%20failed,to%20fail%20than%20new%20ones.">cryptocurrencies that have ceased to exist</a> is less highlighted, and as a result, many people’s investments have just been completely wiped out. As such, the financial promotions regulation seeks to protect the most vulnerable, especially from influential celebrity endorsements.</p>



<p>In March 2023, the SEC charged eight celebrities, with some of the most notable examples including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/22/sec-sues-celebrities-cryptocurrencies-lindsay-lohan-tron">Lindsay Lohan and Jake Paul</a>, for failing to mention that they were partaking in a paid promotion.</p>



 UK’s proposed crypto regime. 



<p>The addition of crypto to the UK’s financial promotion regime marks a step toward a full <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">crypto regulatory framework</a>. Much like its European equivalent, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> (Markets in Crypto Assets), a core aim of the UK’s proposed crypto regime will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>The UK’s proposed crypto regime is expected to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">take effect</a> in 2024, and crypto firms wishing to operate in the UK must register with the FCA and adhere to its regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government’s proposed <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">changes</a> for crypto firms include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/britain-sets-out-plans-to-regulate-crypto-industry-in-wake-of-ftx-collapse.html">Establishing</a> a world-first system for crypto lending<br>  Introducing new regulations to safeguard consumers from market manipulation<br>  Enforcing a market abuse system for cryptocurrency trading<br>  Requiring crypto exchanges to have clear and detailed requirements for admission criteria<br>  Mandating disclosures for new crypto assets<br>  Offering a 24-hour <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/letter-to-cryptoasset-firms-financial-promotions-regime.pdf">cooling-off</a> period for new investors<br>  Banning referral bonuses  



<p>The FCA will regulate crypto firms under the current <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/finalised-guidance/fg23-3.pdf">promotions</a> law, which is expected to protect consumers from misleading or inappropriate crypto <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/cryptoasset-registration-flowchart.pdf">promotions</a>. The FCA’s rules for marketing crypto assets include the following:</p>



  Advertisements must be transparent, fair, not misleading  



  Crypto asset firms must ensure consumers have the necessary understanding and expertise to invest in crypto<br>  Crypto promotions must establish clear risk warnings  



 Weighing the benefits and drawbacks of the new regulations. 



<p>These new crypto regulations will prevent users from being exposed to unregulated platforms and crypto scams like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/09/ftx-takes-its-place-among-historys-most-infamous-financial-scandals/">FTX scandal</a>, which involved the collapse of a crypto exchange, in November 2022. The collapse was due to a liquidity crisis that revealed an US$8 billion hole in company accounts.</p>



<p>Of course, a potential drawback of the financial promotions regime is that only firms registered with the FCA or partnered with someone registered by the FCA will be able to operate in the UK, which may pose a barrier to entry for firms. This is because becoming FCA-<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/registering">registered</a> in order to comply with the financial promotions regime could prove costly, not to mention time-consuming. Registering as a crypto asset firm falls into <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/FEES/3/Annex1A.html">Category 6</a> of the FCA’s pricing categories, meaning that firms currently have to pay at least £10,000 to register. The FCA also imposes an annual fee following authorization.</p>



 Promoting crypto in the UK? 



<p>The recent publication of the UK’s revised ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets</a>’ marks a crucial advancement in the nation’s journey towards cryptocurrency regulation. The document, released by HM Treasury, outlines the present regulatory framework for crypto assets, definitions of different kinds of crypto assets, and a proposed policy approach to introducing crypto asset activities under the UK’s regulatory boundaries. As of April 2023, the FCA had registered just <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/business-plans/2023-24">41</a> crypto asset firms under its AML regime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balanced regulation that ensures consumer safety while maintaining an attractive marketplace for crypto firms is crucial, especially to fully realize the UK government’s aims to become a major crypto hub.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also a requirement to be able to comply with FCA requirements. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>We often think about our personal identities when we think of verifiable identifiers and verifiable credentials. We think of things like personal credentials, mobile driver’s licenses, or professional accreditations. But what about using the same tools and principles when it comes to managing the identity of an organization? How do the same tools and principles apply when managing the identity of an organization? Is it easier or more challenging to implement these concepts for organizational identities compared to personal ones? And importantly, what are the implications and impacts of effectively managing organizational identity?</p>
<p>In this podcast conversation with Lance Byrd, we delve into these questions, exploring the nuances and potential of organizational identity in the digital age.</p>
<p>Lance has been closely involved with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/">GLEIF</a>), an initiative born out of the 2008 financial crisis. GLEIF’s primary mission is to foster a transparent global system for identifying legal entities, known as the Legal Entity Identifier (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">LEI</a>). This system is crucial for enhancing transparency in organizational identities, which is essential for effective regulation and risk assessment. More recently, GLEIF has focused on expanding the LEI’s utility by transforming it into a verifiable credential, termed the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">vLEI</a>. This discussion with Lance taps into various use cases, frameworks, and insights from GLEIF, providing a deeper understanding of the complexities and significance of organisational identity.</p>
<p>In our conversation, I was particularly intrigued by Lance’s insights on the contrast between administrative and cryptographic trust. Administrative roots of trust, which are widespread in our daily lives, often lead to persistent cybersecurity challenges. Lance elaborated on how cryptographic roots of trust offer more secure and dependable methods for identity verification. We delved into real-world scenarios, including the recent MGM/Okta cyberattack, to illustrate these concepts.</p>
<p>This discussion was enlightening, and it felt like we could easily spend many more hours exploring this topic. There might be more on this in 2024! I hope you find this podcast episode as engaging and informative as I did.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Lance and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 Differences Between Personal and Organizational Identity: We explored the unique challenges and political concerns surrounding personal identity, contrasting them with the complexities yet seemingly smoother processes in organizational identity. 
 Legal and Privacy Concerns in Identity Management: The discussion highlighted how legal structures and privacy concerns shape the management of both personal and organizational identities, with a special focus on GDPR and its implications. 
 Governance and Trust in Organizational Identity: The conversation shifted to the role of governance and trust in shaping organizational identity, using examples like the EU Banking Authority to illustrate these concepts. 
 Integrity of Signatures and Cybersecurity: We discussed the critical importance of signature integrity in preventing cybersecurity attacks, examining recent incidents like the MGM Okta attack. 
 Security Mechanisms and Key Rotation: The podcast touched upon the importance of security mechanisms like key rotation in enhancing digital security, differentiating it from traditional password changes. 
 The Interplay of Security Features and User Experience: We delved into how user experience and design play a crucial role in the adoption of security technologies, balancing ease of use with robust security measures. 
 Differences in UX Between Consumer and Organizational Contexts: The discussion concluded with an examination of the varying approaches to user experience in consumer versus organizational settings, and the challenges in changing consumer behaviour regarding privacy and security.

<p>We frequently use the word “identity” when we don’t really mean it. We frame digital identity solutions around proving who you are or proving who someone is.</p>
<p>But IRL we rarely want to know who someone else really is (and from the personal perspective, we rarely want to reveal who we really are).</p>
<p>The fact is, we do not routinely ask “Who are you?” not with any seriousness anyway. “Who you are” is just vernacular, or shorthand. And it stands for something that is very different from identity.</p>
<p>In business and administration, we are always much more precise about what we really want to know about the other party.</p>
<p>Two parties always go into a transaction with a clear idea of what they need to know about each other and what they are going to have to prove about themselves.</p>
<p>These are known unknowns. In the case of business applications, the unknowns are defined when the systems are designed (typical examples are usernames, legal names, account numbers, licence numbers, government IDs and device serial numbers). And there are recognised sources or systems from which pertinent information originates, together with conventions and mechanisms for telling if the information is reliable.</p>
<p>In general, “digital identity” should not be the question. When we design a transaction system, we should start by asking What Do We Really Need To Know about each party. And the answer should include the all-important metadata that confirms the information is fit for purpose.</p>

<p>If you were present for CEO Boris Mann's presentation at the PL Summit, you heard the alpha on Everywhere Computer. Yes, that's right. After several years of being deep in the protocol mines, Fission is thrilled to launch our first product! </p>IPVM Protocol | Everywhere Computer | Homestar Mascot<p>We've shared several exciting announcements over the past few months, so let's break them down in full context now.</p><p>IPVM is the open source protocol that powers Everywhere Computer.</p><p>Homestar is the individual node that makes up the network (similar to how IPFS Kubo, Iroh, Nabu, or other implementation nodes make up the IPFS network). It's written in Rust, and is designed for performance and composability.</p><p>Everywhere Computer is Fission's platform: a branded and supported distribution that bundles Homestar + control panel, a function &amp; workflow marketplace, and managed compute resources.</p>Slide from Boris Mann's PL Summit 2023 Presentation Writing Wasm Functions  <p>Today we've got a few sample functions to test the network, with Rust → Wasm being the happy path. We'll have some tooling and examples for JavaScript → Wasm soon.</p><p>Like NPM providing a library of functions that developers use to quickly write applications, Everywhere Computer's directory will lead to re-use of serverless functions. UCAN can be used to gate access to functions, or specific communities or companies can federate their own set of functions for internal usage only, or to share with everyone.</p> Goodbye Cloud, Hello Crowd <p>As an application developer you can take advantage of Everywhere Computer's Wasm functions to replace backend functions in a serverless style. You're not locked into any one cloud provider's serverless stack, and can pick functions from the directory rather than needing to write them from scratch.</p><p>Additionally, not every job needs to go to the cloud. Many jobs can be done locally on an application's clients desktops and browsers. Every compute cycle that gets done locally is one that you don't need to pay for in the cloud.</p><p>When it's time to scale up, you can utilize Everywhere Computer's distributed network to orchestrate jobs along the parameters you've set, allowing it to utilize whichever platforms are most efficient. Everywhere Computer never locks you into any subscription. You pay when you compute, so you never worry about getting locked into one provider. </p><p>This means your job could run on your desktop, Homestar nodes in your community network, or managed compute services from Fission and other compute providers.</p> What's Coming Next - Future Plans <p>Speaking of writing functions and workflows, one of the things we'll be exploring is to fix some of the issues with directories where developers don't get directly compensated even though potentially 10s of millions of applications use their libraries. We will look to support development of high quality, performant, and maintained functions by having compute providers pay the developers who write them.</p><p>Don't have a Wasm-compatible function but still want to connect to Everywhere Computer, taking advantage of its distributed and interoperable network? If your service is <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a>-enabled, you will soon be able to plug it in, introducing new functionality to the entire network. As has always been the plan, UCAN's capabilities model provides a flexible IAM-like backbone that can connect the open web, rather than locked to one cloud provider.</p> <p>We are so excited to share <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> with you. If you'd like to join the early access beta, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfREjmoTBOW2gyUSFypn3omifibvptH0K_IQwtFWiGORU5vAQ/viewform">complete this form</a>. We're looking for enthusiast hackers &amp; node hosts, function writers, and compute providers.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about the underlying IPVM protocol, you can join the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM Working Group</a>.</p>

 <p>Een consument doet op de website een aanvraag voor een lening, en krijgt direct uitsluitsel of de aanvraag geaccepteerd wordt of (nog) niet. Oftewel; volledig STP (Straight Through Processing) accepteren, het kan!</p> 
 <p>Dat was de afdronk van de rondetafel die we organiseerden in samenwerking met iLoan. Het onderwerp: "STP Acceptatie: Hoe bereik je dit in overeenstemming met de regels".</p> 
 <p>In de consumptief krediet sector worden daar snel grote stappen gezet. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van het Keurmerk Private Lease en de VFN gedragscode.</p> 
 <p>Tijdens de rondetafel deelden we met 20+ experts van de grootste consumptief krediet- en private lease-organisaties in Nederland tips, ervaringen en inzichten die we samen met <a href="https://www.iloan.nl/">iLoan</a> en klanten zoals <a href="https://ockto.eu/kennisbank/praktijkcase-toyota-louwman-financial-services">Toyota Louwman Financial Services</a> hebben opgedaan.</p> 
  10 inzichten over STP accepteren  
 <br> 
   
   Volledig STP werken is mogelijk - voor zowel private lease als huurkoop/consumptief krediet.<br><br>  
   100% STP betekent ruim 300 businessrules die akkoord zijn; op basis van Keurmerk Private Lease of de VFN leennormen.<br><br>  
   Een lager percentage STP betekent nog steeds veel efficiency omdat de Loan Officer/Acceptant nog maar op enkel van de ruim 300 checks een oordeel hoeft te geven (in plaats van op allemaal).  
   De normen geven nog een behoorlijke interpretatieruimte; enerzijds een kans, anderzijds ook onderwerp van in- en externe discussie.<br><br>  
   Zorg dat je 'audit trail' op orde is: doe A/B-testing met een x-aantal dossiers waarbij je de consument eerst accepteert op basis van documenten, en vervolgens met (enkel) brondata &amp; banktransacties.<br><br>  
   Gebruik die testen om business rules te finetunen, om interne goedkeuring te krijgen én een goedkeurend knikje van de toezichthouder.<br><br>  
   Volume en continue verbeteren is key: dit spel krijg je niet op orde met tientallen dossiers. Er moet veel volume/data door het proces omdat je dan onderscheid zult zien in de verscheidene 'persona's': een groep die makkelijk als STP is te definiëren, kansrijke 'oranje' aanvragen en de 'hard-rode' gevallen. Met continu verbeteren stel je doorlopend de engine bij, en zorg je ook voor draagvalk bij de loan officers/acceptanten.<br><br>  
   De loan officers/acceptanten zijn wellicht wel de belangrijkste stakeholders: zij moeten vertrouwen krijgen in het digitale proces en ook vertrouwen dat (bijvoorbeeld) 296 businessrules al automatisch gecontroleerd zijn en zij enkel de nog resterende 4 oranje velden checken. Bezuinigen op FTE kan een doel zijn, maar veel partijen focussen juist op STP van de massa om de loan officers/acceptanten vooral in te zetten op enkel de oranje posten én om meer volume aan te kunnen zonder afhankelijkheid van meer handen.<br><br>  
   Er is sterke behoefte aan een ketenoplossing zoals bijvoorbeeld gebruikt wordt in de hypotheeksector (<a href="https://ockto.eu/ockto-brondata-service">Ockto Brondata Service</a>): adviseur/dealer laat een Ockto sessie doen, Ockto slaat deze max. 90 dagen op, kredietverstrekker krijgt sleutel mee bij de aanvraag en kan met eigen datafilter toegang krijgen tot de initiële brondataset van de betreffende consument. <br>Er zijn ontwikkelingen op dit gebied met diverse partijen.<br><br>  
   En last but not least: er blijkt veel behoefte te zijn om periodiek gezamenlijk te sparren over dit onderwerp. Als ketenpartners gezamenlijk tot oplossingen komen op gedeelde uitdagingen, dan is dat winst voor iedereen én hoeft het concurrentieel voor- en nadeel daar niet meer over te gaan. Plus kunnen er in de normenkaders ook sneller verbeteringen worden doorgevoerd.

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees to your IT systems is like an intricate dance — it can either be a graceful waltz or an out-of-sync electric slide. In this post, we’ll talk about four potential trip-ups when thinking about employee access management. We’ll also show you practical steps you can take today to streamline onboarding and offboarding. Let’s take it for a spin!&nbsp;</p>
 Using a tool that’s too big (or too small) 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Imagine trying to dance the tango in tap shoes or attempting a waltz in hiking boots. Similarly, using tools that are either too complex or too basic can throw off the entire rhythm of your onboarding and offboarding dance.</p>
<p>With advanced providers like Okta, for example, you have to configure SAML, SCIM, and JIT to authenticate and manage users. This is known as <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">the SSO tax</a> and can mean a lot of work on technology that you might not really need yet. On the other hand, people who try to manage the process with Jira tickets or Notion/Docs, often forget to track and update things.</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Find a tool that’s your perfect dance partner — one that adapts to your rhythm by helping you accomplish what you need to get done today and grows with you. Instead of taking an over-comprehensive approach to SSO that may overwhelm customers and inflate costs, focus on the tasks you face today — the stuff you just need to work and to be secure. And with the right tool, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>, which will help you scale as your business expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. It’s also free for now (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">find out why</a>).</p>
 Trying to do it all yourself 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Picture a solo dancer trying to cover the entire stage – it might look impressive, but the risk of exhaustion and missteps is high. If you’re the Google Admin for your small startup or company, odds are you’re an overachiever, but stretching yourself too thin can have negative effects on your work and your health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Enter your dance ensemble – your application administrators. Delegating tasks during the onboarding and offboarding performance lightens the load and ensures a smoother routine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Onboard, you can assign an admin to each app your company uses, then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper admins. We also help you empower employees to initiate requests for new application access, which can also be routed to the proper application administrator.</p>
<p>In this way, automation becomes your dance partner, stepping in to handle repetitive tasks while you take center stage. Things like customizable templates, task assignments, and email notification not only help you save time but also minimize the chances of errors.&nbsp;</p>
 Putting off best practices until “later”&nbsp; 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Delaying the incorporation of best practices is akin to attempting a complicated dance routine without rehearsal – it leads to chaos and missteps. Maybe it’s too expensive to manage right now — time or budget wise — but what you end up with is a messy company footprint and opening yourself to security risks.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/right-sized-onboarding-and-offboarding-free-for-the-first-100-signups/">Onboarding and offboarding tools have overlooked the middle of the marke</a>t. There are plenty of smaller businesses that want to easily manage their processes now while setting up good practices for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>We created YeshID Onboard because we saw that gap. Specifically for 50-250 people, Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 Only focusing on onboarding, not offboarding 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. And focusing solely on onboarding is like nailing the first half of a dance and forgetting the finale. Onboarding is about efficiency, but offboarding is both a security and compliance requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. This is another area where your Product Administrators can play back-up dancers, ensuring a seamless transition.&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s dance 
<p>In the dance of onboarding and offboarding, perfecting each step is essential for a harmonious performance. Choose tools that dance to your rhythm, build a team of Product Administrators as your dance ensemble, kick off best practices from the first note, and never forget the importance of the grand finale – offboarding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID Onboard is your dance instructor for small to medium-sized businesses, offering a strategic approach to identity and access management.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: On this episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity we are joined by Gautam Hazari, from Sekura.ID as we discuss what is the missing Identity layer of the Internet. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello and thank you for joining us, a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Today’s guest is Gautam Hazari. He is a mobile identity guru, a technology enthusiast, artificial intelligence expert and futurist. And he is the CTO of Sekura.id, the global leader in mobile identity services. Gautam led the implementation of the mobile identity initiative Mobile Connect for around 60 mobile operators across 30 countries. He has also been an advisor to startups in Digital Identity, healthcare, the Internet of Things and fraud and security management. Hello, Gautam.</p>
<p>Gautam Hazari: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good, happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Gautam: My pleasure. Thanks.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s going to be super interesting. Now, we are focusing on mobile – mobile initiatives, like the one you are working with, can help us to solve the identity problems we usually discuss in this show.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself. So, if you can tell us your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. Thanks, Oscar. I have been in the identity space for quite some time now. And it started in the telecom world and that’s why I talk about mobile identity a lot. So I spent many years of my life in the telecom, so I worked with the Vodafone group for nearly 14, 15 years. What I realised is that there is one thing that the mobile operators have done quite efficiently is solving what I call the identity crisis of the internet. I started to talk about it quite passionately in different forms.</p>
<p>And in 2013, end of 2013, GSMA approached me. GSMA as you know is the GSM Association which is the trade organisation for the mobile operators. So the GSMA board was discussing that there were some assets within the mobile operators which can actually help in solving the identity crisis in the internet. Then they approached me that, “Hey, you were talking about this identity thing for quite some time, do you want to come and join?” And that’s when I joined GSMA to do the initiative for mobile operators to solve the identity crisis of the internet.</p>
<p>Then I led the technology for what was known and still known as Mobile Connect Initiative. I was the Chief Architect for Mobile Connect. And then me and my team created the reference architecture, the specification. And then of course, that’s not enough, so I went around the world, worked with the mobile operators to implement it as well. You know, at that time, there were around 62 mobile operators around the world who implemented it. And they did very passionately and this is where I met some of the founders, Mark and Keiron, in GSMA, working with the same team. And then I’m taking that journey forward in a much more accelerated and commercial way in Sekura.id.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Well, definitely a lot of your journey is in identity already and mostly in mobile, as you said. Before we start going to what you are doing in Sekura.id and we definitely want to hear more about that. I know that you have a special experience which is you have even a TEDx talk. So if you can tell us a bit of that experience.</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah. Thanks, Oscar. It has been a fascinating experience actually, while preparing for the TEDx talk and also after that. So I was invited to do this TEDx talk to share my vision and dream of a world without passwords. I have been talking about these things passionately and that’s kind of my personal journey has been as well.</p>
<p>So, I had a lot of learning, you have to compact all that you want to talk within 18 minutes and that’s very interesting, right? If you have a free floating, I mean I’m really, really passionate about this identity thing, I can keep talking for days. But if you need to give your message within 18 minutes that’s quite interesting. So I learned how to deliver the message in that concise way.</p>
<p>And after delivering that, and once the TED organisation published the video in their YouTube. Interestingly, they didn’t actually remove any part of that, generally they do some editing but they didn’t do that for me. I’m really thankful to TED on that. So it happened end of last year. It’s been just one year completed and it has been viewed more than 157,000 times. And I have been receiving some very, very interesting messages from all around the world. From identity enthusiasts to security specialist, and also, from general public as well, saying that awareness is important. And we are having some inertia, right? We have been using passwords since, you know, 1961 actually, even before the internet was invented in 1989. But we don’t actually think that we are actually using it, and the complication that it brings too. I have been fortunate enough to hear lots of personal stories as well. These viewers, they have been sharing their personal stories related to passwords, and discussing what is the solution that can actually solve this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it has been a fascinating experience and I’m really, really thankful for all the viewers who have been watching it and also most importantly, interacting with it and sharing their stories.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Yeah, I also watched and as you said, the way you explained also definitely appeals to the general audience which is of course what mostly TEDx is about, reaching wider audiences. So it’s definitely a good job you have done there. And I am happy to hear also that there have been a lot of conversation because that’s also important that people not only hear the stories or the ideas but also get involved in, spreading those problems, sharing their own pains, et cetera.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: I also know that you have written, of course, you write blogs, particularly, I read the you talk about the missing identity layer of the internet, missing identity layer of the internet. Could you tell us what is that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. I mean it’s extremely important that we acknowledge and realise that. Let me go back to when the internet was invented, right? Let’s face it, the internet was never designed to identify the human users. It was designed to identify the computers, right? That’s why there are IP addresses. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we humans don’t have IP addresses.</p>
<p>So, in the initial days of the internet, if you remember, all we used to do in the internet was browsing, right? We used to browse AOL, we used to browse Yahoo, different stories within Yahoo. So, it did not matter if for me, Gautam, is browsing AOL or Yahoo, or it’s Oscar browsing, or there’s fraudster who is browsing, right?&nbsp; Because all we did was browsing the internet. Yes, the returning user needed to be identified, not as Oscar or Gautam but whoever was browsing, right? So that’s why cookies were invented just to provide a continuity of the experience, right?</p>
<p>But then we started to do interesting things on the internet. We started to do commerce on the internet. We started to look for things on eBay and started to pay for those things. We started to do banking on the internet. We started to interact in the social media in the internet. And then it did matter whether it’s me, Gautam, doing that commerce transaction, whether it’s me, Gautam, who is doing that banking transaction or it’s you, Oscar, or it’s the fraudster. Or, in the current days, if it is that AI chatbot who is doing that transaction, right?</p>
<p>Internet was not designed to do that. Internet did not have that identity layer. So what did we do? We created a trustless model. So, if I want to pay for some things that I found on eBay, or if I want to do a banking transaction, my bank will say, “Hey, you cannot do that, because I don’t trust you. First, I’m challenging you to prove that you are Gautam.” That’s what we created, because the internet didn’t have that identity layer.</p>
<p>So how did that challenge happen? And they initially did this, this challenge happened in the form of user ID and password, right? And again, we all aware of all the complications related to password from convenience to security, right? Then we said, “Hey, passwords are not enough. Let’s add other things.” So, we started to talk about MFA, Multi-factor authentication, we added SMS OTP, right? And again, OTP, the last P is about password, right? Just changing the acronym doesn’t change the problem.</p>
<p>But then again, they said, “OK, maybe that’s not enough. Let’s add the biometrics on top.” But again conceptually what we are doing is, we are creating a trustless model where these services are challenging me and the human user to identify myself, right? And whenever the human user is involving in providing a response to the challenge, for example in form of I need to type back the password, or I need to provide back the OTP, however I give, whether by typing back the OTP or some auto read happens. Or even if I do this, let’s say, biometrics in the form of facial recognition and so on, I, as a user, is the weakest link in the chain. I do something wrong, which is perfectly fine because me, as a user, is not a security architect. As a normal user, I am not aware of all those security complications that can go away, right? And that’s where all the problems that you have seen and again, why? Because the internet was not designed to identify this human user. Internet never have the identity layer. It still doesn’t have.</p>
<p>But we almost ignored the fact that almost at a similar time, there was a parallel internet that was getting created. So, as you know, I’m actually using the world wide web as synonym to internet, so when I say internet, it’s actually the world wide web, right? So, 1989, this wed, world wide web or internet as we call it was invented. In 1991, there was a parallel internet that was created. And we never call it the internet, we call it the mobile network, right? The first SIM-based GSM mobile network was used in 1991. And that parallel internet worked completely differently.</p>
<p>So, as we discussed, in the traditional internet, if I want to do any interaction, where I, as a human user, needs to be identified, I’ll be challenged, right? My bank will challenge me, my social media will challenge me, my e-commerce provider will challenge me, even my grocery store, online store will challenge me, right? But this parallel internet, which we call mobile network, worked completely differently, still works differently.</p>
<p>If I need to make a phone call, receive a phone call, send an SMS, receive an SMS, it doesn’t challenge me. My mobile network doesn’t say that “Hey, I don’t trust you. First, you prove that you are Gautam, then only you can make a phone call.” It doesn’t work that way. It just knows that it’s me, who is Gautam. So how did they do that? They actually created this identity layer. They actually created a mechanism which identifies this human user from day one, since 1991.</p>
<p>But we know this. How did they do that? They did that using this small gadget that we always carry in our mobile phone, this is the SIM. We almost forget that I, in the SIM, stands for identity. It’s Subscriber Identity Module. SIM was created to solve this identity problem in that parallel internet, which we call the mobile network, right?</p>
<p>So, isn’t that a solution? We were just ignoring it and also, just unfortunately, these mobile operators knowingly or unknowingly, kept this with themselves, right? What we are doing at Sekura.id, I’ll just mention here, that we are bringing in that identity layer from this parallel internet which we call the mobile network into this traditional internet so that we actually solve the fundamental problem rather than keep creating technologies on top like password, like SMS OTPs, like biometrics. And that is what will solve the problem from its root and bringing in an identity layer from this parallel internet to the traditional internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for the explanation, of the lacking, missing identity layer of the internet. And then you put a parallel, I haven’t thought of it in that way, the parallel of the mobile network which always had this identifier of the subscriber. As you say, even in the term it’s subscribe, the SIM card. So, I understand that Sekura.id solution is primarily based on the SIM card. Tell us a bit more how it works and if you can give also how it works, Sekura.id besides being based on the SIM card.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. So, GSMA doing this Mobile Connect, the conceptual idea was very similar, right? It’s to utilise the assets from the mobile operators, not just the SIM card. SIM card is a cryptographic engine. But there’s a lot of data available with the mobile operators which can help to identify the human user without challenging them. &nbsp;And also, protect them without putting a hurdle for the user, like what user ID, password, OTPs or biometrics are. They are hurdles, right? They are actually saying, “Hey, you cannot access the service until you pass that hurdle.”</p>
<p>This is where Mobile Connect started and this is the journey that we are continuing in Sekular.id as well. So, in Sekular.id, what we do is, as I say, the SIM is a cryptographic engine. And now, in the digital world, there is realisation that all the different, let’s say, identification and authentication methods where the user is actively involved, which means the user is challenged to prove who they are, or authenticate themselves, that is a limitation. A limitation in the form of that you know, if let’s say the user has got an OTP they have received, these fraudsters will always call this user and say, “Hey, I’m calling from your bank, or I’m calling from the government, you have received an OTP, can you hand it over, right?” If the user is not involved, right, these fraudsters can call the user but they have nothing to handover. So in that case, we solved this problem of all the fraudulent activities that’s going on.</p>
<p>So now, there is a realisation in the digital world as I was seeing that we need to avoid involving the user. So we need to do passive authentication. And how do we do that? Cryptographic authentication is one way to do. So, Apple last year in WWDC announced these passkeys which is basically based on the FIDO, the Fast Identity Online mechanism, where this is reliance on cryptography and cryptographic key on the device. And then that’s how we identify the user, right?</p>
<p>But exactly same mechanism is what happens in the SIM. And it is happening for the last 30 years. There is a cryptographic key which sits in the SIM which the user is not even aware of. And that’s an important thing. The user is not aware. As soon as the user is aware, or the user is involved in that awareness, OK, all these problems will happen because these fraudsters will approach the user and try to do some funny things, right?</p>
<p>And that’s another aspect that we say that here, this cryptography is humanised. If the user is not involved, it just happens behind the scene. In that case, this technology is humanised. Invisibility is more humanised. Steve Jobs used to say that technology should either be beautiful or it should be invisible. So here, this technology is invisible so that makes it much more humanised, right?</p>
<p>So, at Sekura, we’re utilising this cryptography in the SIM to seamlessly, invisibly authenticate this user. At the same time, there are a lot of what we call signals associated with the SIM which can help protect the user, at the same time, identify the user. For example, one of the largest fraud happening in the digital space right now is SIM swap fraud, right?</p>
<p>If we can identify that hey, is there a recent SIM swap happen? By recent, I mean in the last few hours, for example, to one day. If there is a SIM swap happen, in that case, that’s a red flag, that might mean that the user who is in the transaction process, who is interacting with the digital service may not be the genuine user, it could be a fraudster who have got access to the phone number of the user and using their own SIM. That’s one data signal that’s there in the mobile, with the mobile operator, that doesn’t need to involve the user to ask if something has happened or not.</p>
<p>Similarly, setting up a call redirect, right? The fraudsters can actually setup a call redirect for my number calling up the operator, doing some mechanism, some process there where they can say, “Hey, I have lost my phone, or I left my phone at my home and I’m expecting an urgent call from my family who is in the hospital. Can you please redirect all the calls to my number to this?” If I can convince the operator, in that case what will happen is, all calls, SMSs will be redirected or forwarded to me as a fraudster, right? So, if we can actually identify, is their call forward active for this number? That data itself can protect the user, again, without involving the user. So, we have identified 66 such potential data signals which can invisibly protect the user and their identity. And that’s what we do at Sekura, working primarily with the mobile operators.</p>
<p>Oscar: I like the idea of this invisibility because from the beginning you started that the human side is going to make security fail, right? But if the human doesn’t have to be involved, yeah, I’m sure, there will be less hacking. So that is definitely the concept, it’s very interesting.</p>
<p>Gautam: And just to add there, Oscar, you know, of course, there is this identity protection, there is this authentication without involving the user. That element is there. At the same time, it is allowing these good guys to access the service, right? So, as I was giving that example, it’s me, right? I’m not the fraudster. It’s me who wants to pay a particular merchant online, right? And I’m assuming I’m the good guy, right? And I want to pay. In that case, there shouldn’t be a barrier for me, right? And it’s good for the business because the business will get me to pay them. That’s what they want, right? So, in that case, it’s important that the good guys should sail through, right? For them, there is no barrier.</p>
<p>If we make it invisible for the user, in that case, these good guys can actually access, you know, without any trouble. At the same time, because it’s invisible, we can actually protect this user behind the scene as well. What does that mean is – it’s not just helping out with the identity verification, security and authentication, it’s also getting better business. Because if we put barrier to the good customers, good users, in that case, there are dropouts happen.</p>
<p>We have been told by our clients all around the world that on an average globally 20% of the users dropout due to all these, let’s say, challenges. They say, “Hey, I’m not going to use it.” SMS OTP is needed to do our transaction or to pay and OTP doesn’t get delivered or it is delayed, the user say, “Hey, I’m not going to pay now, right?” So that will direct 20% on an average globally, dropouts happen.</p>
<p>Here, if you make it invisible, you don’t have any dropouts, right? Because there are no barriers. There is no door which is closed that needs to be opened. So, in that case, the businesses get 20% more conversion, so that’s more business, more revenue. So that element is also there, if you make is invisible using the mobile operator’s asset like the SIM and all the data. That needs to be considered as well alongside security.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what if, myself as a normal user, I want to try Sekura.id, how can I use it already? There might be some services which is already available?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. So one element here is you know as you can understand, this is B2B service, right? So the businesses are using us. Businesses are protecting that. All our services are, you know, they go through one single API, right? So, it’s not the user who is accessing our services directly. As I was giving the example, I, as a user, accessing my banking service, right? And my banking service is using the Sekura.id services through the API, right? So that’s how I, as a user, as a consumer use it. Not directly through Sekura, through my services. And then again, I may not be even aware that that service is getting used, right? Because this service, as I said, for the human user it’s invisible.</p>
<p>So majority of our clients right now are mostly from the financial services, so the major banks in the UK, they are using our one or more of the services like Barclays is using our services, Virgin Money is using our services. In the US as well, Morgan Stanley, they are using our services, Flora Bank, they are using our services.</p>
<p>But again, just to reiterate, it’s not a B2C service, right? So it’s not that me, as a consumer, is using the Sekular.id services. It’s my business who is using the service to help me as a user getting protected. And at the same time, no buyer has been put by the businesses to access it. And we are actually expanding globally. As I mentioned to you earlier, I was in India, I came back yesterday, we are actually launching in there. We have some very, very exciting discussions happened across the use cases there, not just in the financial sector, beyond as well. And then we will be announcing those pretty soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK,as soon as they are launched, it will be interesting to know what are these use cases. So, very interesting initiative that you have in Sekura.id. So what happens for instance if – because this depends on people having good mobile networks and good phones, so what happens if that’s not available in some regions in the world?</p>
<p>Gautam: That’s a very important question you ask, right? And there are two elements you said, one is good mobile phone. One of the thing that we really passionately believe in Sekura is inclusiveness. And that’s very important for us. We have a mission statement for identity for all and everything. So no one should be excluded from identity protection, right? And this is why we tackle it from multiple angles.</p>
<p>So for example, we have platform that we have created from ground up based on all our learning from the GSMA and also my learning from Vodafone. That platform can integrate with any mobile operator in the world, right? Because all mobile operators are different. There are 700 plus mobile operators there. Right now, we are connected to around 75 mobile operators globally and we want to connect to all. Why? Because we don’t want any operators to be excluded because if we exclude that, their consumers or their users will be excluded.</p>
<p>So, one example is in India, one of the phone smallest operator is BSNL, right? It’s government-owned operator. They are quite small. They don’t have platform. And they were actually not included in this identity space. So what we have done is we have provided our platform to them so that, that platform can actually connect to that mobile operator and then it can actually expose their services, right? So that we don’t want to exclude their users.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important, as you rightly asked. What happens if I don’t have a good phone? So, this is where the principle that we use in all our services has got two major aspects. One, I already talked about – not involving the user because if you don’t involve the user, we increase the security, because user is the weakest link, right? And rightly so. And the second thing is not depending on the mobile device, because that’s extremely critical. Because let’s say, if the user can afford an iPhone 15 right? Of course, that’s extremely secure. The key chain there where the keys are stored is a hardware, right? That’s an HSN. So, it will be extremely secure.</p>
<p>But what about the user in let’s say Southeast Asia or in Sub-Saharan Africa where it’s a sub $10 phone? That may not have that much security. So, it’s unfair on the user because they cannot be pay for that advanced phone, they are getting excluded from security and identity verification. At the same time, it is unfair on the businesses, they cannot rely on a security because the user cannot afford that high end phone.</p>
<p>That’s why that’s the principle we use. We don’t rely on the mobile device. What do we rely on? The SIM. The exact same SIM is in the iPhone 15 or any of the high-end devices or in the low-end, not so expensive phone and provides the exact same security, right? The cryptographic security that I talked about doesn’t differentiate whether it’s a very high-end, expensive phone or not so expensive, much simpler phone. So that’s an important element here, right? So, our services don’t rely on the device. It doesn’t matter what device the user is using.</p>
<p>Secondly, all the data elements that I talked about is in the mobile network. This is completely independent of what device it is. So that way as well, all those data elements that I talked about, all those 66 potential data elements are independent of the device. So, that’s how we use the service and then make it inclusive end to end, for any user, right?</p>
<p>The other thing you asked about is what if there is no mobile network? It doesn’t really matter. So, the way to look into this thing is, we are relying on the mobile network. But the user doesn’t have to use the mobile device even at that moment of time for majority of the services. For the authentication services, the mobile device need to be in the network. But again, if the mobile device is not in the mobile network, it is connected to Wi-Fi or any other networks, in that case, we have fall back mechanism because we cannot really, rely on the mobile network because the device is connected to Wi-Fi, still we have a fallback mechanism.</p>
<p>And in some regions, like in US, we have worked with one of the large mobile operator there. Where we have worked with them to utilise the SIM, even if the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Because even if the mobile device is not connected to the mobile network, still there is a SIM there, right? If you can reach out to the SIM, we protect the device anyway.</p>
<p>And the other thing I was talking about, all these 66 potential data signals, they are available at the mobile operator’s secure CRMs, CVM and all the OSS, BSS system, right? So they don’t need the user to be using the mobile device at that moment of time. For example, if there is a SIM swap that has happened in the last few hours, the mobile operators databases, they already are aware of that even if there is no network. So, all our services other than the authentication service which we call SAFr Auth, all our services are data-related or signal-related services where these businesses, let’s say, this is a bank or an e-commerce provider or even a social media provider, their server makes the API call to our platform to get this data signal. So the mobile device is not involved, mobile network is not also involved there. Because again, we want that inclusivity for every user to be involved in there.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Well, definitely very novel way of addressing these problems. So I’d like to ask you one final question, Gautam, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot Oscar for asking that. The most important thing to add into their agenda is an acknowledgement that the internet doesn’t have that identity layer. Because that’s a fundamental problem. Because if we start to add technologies on top to fill the gap, that will not solve the problem. And we have seen over the years, right? We have seen user ID password, they didn’t solve that, SMS OTP or any form of OTP, they didn’t solve that. Then we added all sorts of other OTPs, right? TOTPs, authenticated apps, we even used those RSA tokens that we used to carry on. Then we evolved into biometrics. And by the way, biometrics, I’m sure your audience is aware of this, after Generative AI, every form of biometrics is challenged.</p>
<p>And then actually, you know, interestingly, LexisNexis, which is one of the largest fraud management provider on app based in US, their CEO of the government affairs came to the press. This person gave an interview to Fox News in June, saying that we are so much relying on these biometrics and after Generative AI revolution, there is a financial impact in the industry and then that impact is around 1 Trillion USD because every form of biometric is challenged through this Generative AI. Not just through deep fake, through all sorts of mechanism. I mean you can actually search the internet on those kind of fraudulent activities happening on almost a weekly basis.</p>
<p>So, let’s acknowledge that there is a fundamental issue with the internet and that’s no one’s fault because internet was not designed for that. If you acknowledge that, then we can solve the fundamental problem, right? And that can be done through the already existing identity layer which is existing in the mobile operators. Let’s work through that and solve the problem forever.</p>
<p>So, basically, what I am saying is, let’s bring in that identity layer from that parallel internet which we call mobile internet into the traditional internet. And let’s solve that problem at the root. And that’s what we are doing in Sekura.id. And that’s what we would invite all the leaders in the digital space to look into and solve the problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you very much, Gautam, for this very insightful conversation. And let us know if people would like to find more about you on the net, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me. I am on LinkedIn. Please connect to me. It’s Gautam Hazari, G-A-U-T-A-M H-A-Z-A-R-I. If you Google me, you will find me there as well. And also, please visit Sekura.id, S-E-K-U-R-A.ID. You will find insightful solutions there and also we post lots of insightful stories, articles, blogs and what the future is looking like. Recently, one of my article is published in Forbes, I’m calling it Internet of Thoughts, where the future is coming and where, if you don’t solve this identity crisis in the internet it may create more issues. So, please reach out. Please look into Sekura.id and let’s solve this identity crisis together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, of course. Again, thank you very much Gautam for this conversation, and all the best.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thank you very much Oscar for having me.</p>

   Crypto exchanges and wallets are required to carry out KYC on their users as part of their compliance obligations. Automated KYC solutions make carrying out the process effectively at scale both possible and simple.  
 In this article, we explore what KYC / AML involves for crypto firms — and how adopting automated KYC can improve their security, compliance and the industry at large.

  One year ago, the first post on Bluesky was created. Now, we're working toward federation and a truly open network.

<p>Exactly one year ago, on November 16, 2022, the first post on Bluesky was created:</p>

The first post on Bluesky.
<p>Fast forward a year later, and we’ve just crossed two million users after opening the app to users around February. We’re excited to continue growing a truly open social network.</p>
 Toward Federation 
<p>Imagine you’ve just spent 10 years building your audience and making friends on a social platform, only to decide that it’s no longer for you. When you leave this platform, you’re essentially leaving behind all of your relationships, your saved posts, and more.</p>
<p>We’ve been there too, and we’re similarly tired of packing our bags each time another platform winds down and everyone collectively moves to the next big thing. Signing up for a new social network every few years and losing all our data on former ones shouldn’t be the price that we have to pay in order to keep our relationships online.</p>
<p>That’s why our biggest priority right now is launching federation, which is <a href="https://atproto.com/blog/2023-protocol-roadmap">timelined</a> for early next year. This is one of the core features of Bluesky that makes it “billionaire-proof” — you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.</p>
 A Public Network 

<p>More exciting news: around the end of this month, we’ll release a public web interface. With this, you’ll be able to view posts on Bluesky without being logged in on an account.</p>
<p>This will make posts on Bluesky much more accessible, which will be especially useful for real-time commentary and breaking news.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Bluesky is a public social network, so your posts, likes, etc. have always been publicly accessible through the API. We designed Bluesky with the openness of the internet in mind, and you can think of your profile as a blog on the internet. To read more about data privacy on Bluesky, here’s our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/5-19-2023-user-faq">user FAQ</a>.</p>
 Other Updates 
<p>In between all of the above, we’ve also shipped some much-requested features, including:</p>
 
 Mobile push notifications: receive notifications on your phone 
 General user lists: add users to shareable lists and see their posts in one feed 
 Email verification: verify your account email for added security 
 Advanced feed and thread preferences: sort replies by time, likes, or randomly; see replies from your follows first; show/hide replies or quote posts in your feeds, and more 
 Media tab for user profiles: easily find and see the photos that a user has posted 
 A Likes tab on your own profile: see all your liked posts in one place 
 Improved startup and loading time: reduces the time spent loading the app 
 Suggested follows: get recommended follows based on each user 
 Accessibility improvements: improvements to alt text, component labels, screen flashing, and more 
 
<p>And there’s much more to come — join us for the ride! See you on <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>!</p>

  <p>Fraud is a major cost to businesses worldwide. Banking, finance, payment services, and retail are some of the most frequent targets of fraudsters. However, insurance, gaming, telecommunications, health care, cryptocurrency exchanges, government assistance agencies, travel and hospitality, and real estate are increasingly targeted as cybercriminals have realized that most online services trade in monetary equivalents. After years of being the focus of cybercriminals, banking and financial institutions are more likely to be better secured than other industries, meaning that fraudsters are increasingly likely to attack any potentially lucrative target if given the opportunity. Fraud perpetrators are continually diversifying and innovating their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>The most prevalent types of fraud businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies experience today are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Takeover (ATO) Fraud - occurs when fraudsters use breached passwords, phishing, social engineering and credential stuffing attacks to execute unauthorized transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Opening (AO) Fraud – also called New Account Fraud or Synthetic Fraud, often happens as a result of using stolen identities or assemblages of personal information to create synthetic digital IDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session we will provide an overview of Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms and show the highlights of our latest research in this area.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/technology-powers-fraud-prevention-cre23"></a>

  <p>Most contemporary digital identity discussions deserve another label: They are mostly about electronic trust ecosystems, considering all kinds of attributes beyond just pure identity. Additionally, nowadays they include natural persons, legal entities and (internet of) things. Everyone seems to agree the future is decentralized and all this only works with these curious wallets. Andre Kudra takes us on a journey through electronic trust ecosystems, diving into questions like: Which ones do we already have today? Some are successful, others not – why? Regulators are on it, too: What will eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDIW bring? What’s in the pipeline in other parts of the world? Will organizational digital identity (ODI) now invoke the breakthrough of decentralized identity overall? Why is decentralized identity the only way for Zero Trust Architectures which deserve the name?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/electronic-trust-ecosystems-cre23"></a>

  <p>Zero trust is being embedded into law across the world enforcing privacy, data residency and consent. How do companies and governments share patient data global during a pandemic to measure the efficacy of a vaccine? How do financial services organisations share intelligence on suspected terrorist funding, money laundry or sanctions evasion? How is this achieved in the emerging world of data nationalism?</p>
<p>Developing a secure data sharing service is a complex proposition that need to embed change into operations.</p>

  <p>The realm of cloud security has been extensively covered in books and articles, yet a crucial aspect remains ripe for exploration. It revolves around the fundamental understanding of what your cloud service provider offers and, equally vital, where your responsibilities lie in the realm of cloud security.</p>
<p><br> When embarking on the journey of adopting a cloud service, the foremost question to answer is, "What aspects of security do I need to oversee?" In a traditional on-premises setting, roles are distinct: IT manages infrastructure, information and cybersecurity handles security, and application developers bear the responsibility for code integrity. However, the landscape is evolving, with many organizations embracing DevOps, where these responsibilities are often shared, and the lines between development and operations blur or vanish.</p>
<p>Regardless of organizational structure, the majority of security obligations reside within your company's domain when you use an on-prem environment. Transitioning from an on-premises environment to a cloud environment presents one of the most intricate challenges—a more intricate shared responsibility model for security.</p>
<p>In the context of cloud security, two paramount concerns need close attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is the risk of misconfiguration. In a cloud environment, misconfigurations can inadvertently expose sensitive data and vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical importance of ensuring that cloud services and resources are set up correctly to mitigate such risks.</p>
<p>The second concern is insider attacks. Cloud users often lack influence over the staff of cloud service providers, making it essential to consider the possibility of insider threats. While cloud service providers typically promise robust security measures in place, it's crucial for organizations to implement their own layers of security to safeguard against insider attacks and unauthorized access, fortifying the shared responsibility model in the cloud.</p>
<p>In my presentation, I will delve into these intricacies, providing valuable insights and real-world examples of what your cloud service provider can do, irrespective of your specific needs and/or preferences.</p>

  <p>Paul Fisher delves into the multifaceted approach required to foster trustworthiness within complex software supply chains. This discussion begins by delineating the critical components of software supply chains and the potential risks associated with each link—from development and deployment to maintenance and decommissioning.</p>
<p>Key to establishing a chain of confidence is the adoption of transparent processes and tools that provide verifiable evidence of security at each step. The audience will be introduced to Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), cryptographic signing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines fortified with automated security checks.</p>
<p>The talk will also consider the human aspect, emphasizing the need for cultivating a culture of security awareness and collaboration among stakeholders.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>A couple of years ago, I published a blog post <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/11/aes-turns-20/">AES Turns 20</a>, celebrating the 20th year since the trusted symmetric algorithm was approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the article, I dug into post-quantum and how Lov Grover’s quadratic speed-up algorithm might be applied to brute force attacks on symmetric algorithms. NIST’s position on this remains unchanged; symmetric algorithms such as AES 192 and AES 256 bit are good for the next couple of decades. The general recommendation persists: Anything with less than 112 bits of classical security should not be used. If there are any doubts, consider doubling the key length if you are using shorter bit lengths.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about the post-quantum threats being discussed and the Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attack frequently mentioned on technology websites and cited by some of my colleagues. I decided a blog post was in order to investigate a bit further. My colleague Dave Butcher, Technical Sales Consultant, is as passionate about PQ as I am, and I enlisted him to discuss the topic in more detail and exchange ideas.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap on what is meant by Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. The attack assumes that classical encryption techniques applied to data today, to make it unreadable and unusable, will in the future be vulnerable to attack from post-quantum computers. They will be able to crack the hard math problems that today’s computers would take in some cases hundreds and even thousands of years to solve. So, the idea is bad actors and nation-states will intercept and steal (harvest) data. They’ll then store it and wait until quantum computers are capable of crunching the numbers and decrypting the data to make it readable.</p>
 Data In Motion With TLS 
<p>Some of you might be thinking that most data at rest is encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES, so surely we are in decent shape and this isn’t a real threat? I initially jumped to the same conclusion and then realized it is a bit more nuanced. Data at rest is typically encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES and should be resilient to Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attacks. However, data is typically transported to a location before it comes to rest using network switches, routers, load balancers, etc. And this is where is gets a bit more nuanced. As data is moved around on the internet, a range of communication protocols are in play. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the de facto protocol in use on the Internet securing HTTPS web pages, email, WhatsApp, and a myriad of other applications. To establish a secure connection between a client and server the TLS handshake is invoked:</p>
 
 The client sends a Hello message detailing the TLS version being used and available cipher suite. 
 The server responds back with their Hello message confirming TLS version and cipher suite followed by the server’s certificate, which includes the public key of the server’s asymmetric key pair. 
 This is then used in a key exchange where a symmetric-based session key is encrypted and sent to the server using the server’s public key. 
 
<p>The server now has the same symmetric encryption key as the client – this is a pre-requisite for symmetric encryption. A secure bi-direction channel is now established between client and server and data can be efficiently encrypted, transported, and stored at its final destination.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main takeaway here is the session key is based on a symmetric algorithm, which is the most efficient way to encrypt bulk data – asymmetric algorithms are not efficient at<br>
encrypting bulk data. Based on current NIST recommendations, as long as the symmetric key is a decent length of bits it’ll be resistant to a PQ attack. However, the asymmetric public/private keys used in the key exchange step are most likely using RSA- or elliptic-curve-based cryptography. These are the classical asymmetric algorithms that Peter Shor identified in the late 1990s as being vulnerable to being compromised by a quantum computer. It is unlikely that state-sponsored actors will be targeting data stored at rest; instead they’ll be targeting data in transit armed with the knowledge that asymmetric keys are used in the key exchange process. If they can intercept that transaction and store it away while biding their time, then in the future they’ll be able to use a quantum computer to factorize the asymmetric key pair, allowing them to expose the symmetric key and thus decrypt the data. Voila!</p>
 Actionable Steps to Mitigate Against Harvest Now, Decrypt Later 
<p>So, Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is a valid concern for organizations who store long-term encrypted data. What steps should you be taking to mitigate such attacks?</p>
 
 Start using longer symmetric key lengths. This is likely an easy change as AES with a 256-bit key has been part of the AES standard from the beginning. Most TLS services rely on standard TLS implementations that include configurable cipher suites. Changing to a longer key length is likely as easy as updating a configuration file and restarting a service. Many other tools you are using may also have this option. 
 Consider adding protection to communication paths that move high-value data to prevent Harvest Now, Decrypt Later later attacks. For example, there are VPN implementations (e.g. Open Quantum Safe’s OpenVPN project) that have been built using newer quantum-resistant cryptography. These are not fully standardized, but when you control both ends of a communication path (for example, between a branch location and headquarters) utilizing a non-standard protocol is not an issue. 
 Think about using pre-shared keys for certain interactions where you share symmetric encryption keys out of band, such as by exchanging physical media. This eliminates the asymmetric key exchange that is vulnerable to quantum computers. 
 Understand if there are already quantum-resistant versions of the protocol that you are using that you could migrate to today. For example, the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/#introduction">Signal messaging protocol</a> has been updated to be quantum-resistant. Consider becoming a first adopter. 
 Prioritize crypto-agility within your organization. Planning and building crypto-agility are going to be key to adopting quantum-safe cryptography. While this does not fix the problem today, it puts your organization in the best position to quickly adopt post-quantum cryptography as it becomes available and minimize the vulnerability window for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. 
 
<p>One of the tools that can help you plan is Mosca’s Theorem. Understanding how long your data needs to be secure is key to prioritizing projects to mitigate Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data that has fleeting value is probably not at high risk for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data whose value remains high even as time begins to approach the advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers needs to be a priority for secondary protection. Mosca’s Theorem is discussed in more detail in an earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/07/a-bridge-to-post-quantum-cryptography/">A Bridge to Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>.</p>
 The PQC Elephant in the Room 
<p>The elephant in the room when post-quantum cryptography is being discussed is “when”? When is this going to happen? The answer is of course we don’t really know. It could be five years away. It could also be 10 or 20+ years away. However, to play devil’s advocate, what if nation-state actors already have quantum computers with sufficient processing capability running in their labs? It’s not quite apples to apples, but there are some precedents. Public key cryptography was first postulated by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 and its implementation as RSA announced in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. At least that is what was understood to be the case until in 1997 some UK secrets held by Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) became declassified, revealing that British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Cocks">Clifford Cocks</a>, working for the&nbsp;intelligence agency, described an equivalent public/private key system in an internal document in 1973. Whether it was ever used is pure speculation, but it does illustrate the art of the possible. With that we will leave you to ponder, but at least you should now be clear that Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is real.</p>

<p>In late October, Ocean Protocol sponsored a General &amp; DeFi theme hackathon at ETHMiami. Participants could select a technology stack to build upon in teams, creating a tool, business case, proof of concept, or other applications using the chosen technology stack.</p><p>Approximately 17% of the teams at the hackathon opted into taking the Ocean Protocol track. The top 3 projects, as scored by the protocol and hackathon organizers, received prizes for their execution, creativity, and technology implementation.</p><p>Three distinctive projects applied blockchain and Ocean technologies to niche mini-product and platform offerings, which led to increased use and flexibility of the Ocean Protocol. Their product abstracts and information were as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st — xTRUST — Decentralized Trust&nbsp;Fund <p>The team behind xTRUST aimed to build a service with privacy-preserving data sharing through smart contracts. This allowed a guarantor to fund a contract, designate a beneficiary, set a time interval, and define the conditions for the transfer of ownership. Beneficiaries could redeem and allow access through the Ocean Protocol’s access control mechanisms within the limits set by the guarantor. xTRUST targeted a traditional financial wealth and data ownership management gap, offering a digital asset transfer solution. The team was inspired by Ocean Protocol’s initiatives in safe AI, finance, and data sharing, focusing on democratizing access to opportunities. They demonstrated their application using the Ocean <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">Smart Contract</a> libraries for various functions and hosted the dApp on&nbsp;AWS.</p><p>This niche financial mini-product targets a demand in traditional financial wealth management and data ownership management does not equate to support: Digital Assets and ownership transfers.</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s mission statement and value proposition inspired the team to ensure safe AI, Finance, and data sharing globally while preserving privacy.</p><p>View xTrust <a href="https://github.com/Jacob8765/eth-miami-hackathon">Github Repository</a>.</p><p>In this short concept and idea definition, the repository above shows the team’s basic attempt to launch a full-stack DeFi dApp for initiating trust funds and enabling a beneficiary to redeem them. In the hackathon, they were able&nbsp;to:</p><p>- Develop a minimum solidity&nbsp;contract</p><p>- Sketch out the UI in&nbsp;Figma</p><p>- Begin implementation of the front-end UX/UI</p><p>- Set up AWS infrastructure to host the&nbsp;dApp</p> 2nd — Data Sea — Data Access &amp; Ownership <p>Data Sea was on a mission to revolutionize data access and ownership. They addressed the problem of accessing niche and consistent datasets, which is incredibly challenging in the real estate, finance, and healthcare sectors. Data Sea’s solution included features like encrypted data streaming, consumer data ownership, dynamic NFTs, ERC-20 access tokens for secure data transfer, and robust data storage using Ocean’s technology. They also provided an automated AI integration for property data and a mechanism for data reselling. Data Sea outlined simple steps for uploading data, controlling access with tokens, reselling data, and integrating AI.</p><p>DataSea took a mission statement to ‘Revolutionizing Data Access &amp; Ownership’</p><p>This team diagnosed features used to offer solutions to the problem statement above:</p>  Encrypted Data Streaming: DataSea allows providers to stream waves of encrypted datasets and AI models to buyers, ensuring security and authenticity.  Consumer Data Ownership: Empower users with the ability to securely sell their data, fostering a new age of data sovereignty.  Dynamic NFTs: Utilization of Ocean Protocol to create dynamic NFTs that store encrypted user data, combining data innovation with blockchain integrity.  ERC20 Access Tokens: Facilitating the secure access and transfer of data ownership.  ERC 725 Data Storage: Leveraging Ocean’s key-value pairing, DataSea provides a robust data storage mechanism, ensuring consistency and reliability.  Reselling Mechanism: Owners can monetize their data by reselling the ownership and tokenized data through the dispensary.  Automated AI Integration: Streamlining property data to seamlessly integrate into AI or predictive models, paving the way for cutting-edge analytics.  <p>Knowing the relevant features above, we can showcase Ocean Protocol tools to execute full capability interactions with smart contracts for both NFT and access token creation.</p><p>Further, this concept proves an alternative use of various core Ocean Technologies including <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge">Barge</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius">Aquarius</a>, &amp; <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider">Provider</a>: Here, these tools are responsible for storing and encrypting data tied to&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Data Sea <a href="https://github.com/imatomster/DataSea">Github Repository</a>.</p><p>Congratulations to the team for an excellent hackathon sprint!</p> 3rd — FINZA — Crypto-backed Mortgages <p>FINZA aimed to connect dream homes with crypto-backed mortgages. They tackled issues such as high down payments, complex mortgage approvals, and traditional barriers to entry. Before the hackathon, FINZA had already partnered with <a href="https://propy.com/home/">PROPY</a> to leverage blockchain technology for real estate transactions. They developed a Smart Contract-Based DeFi Mortgage Platform that allowed crypto assets to be used as collateral and offered opportunities for liquidity provision.</p>A simple hand-drawn sketch acts as a title slide for the FINZA startup&nbsp;vision<p>The startup is actively exploring technology to implement in its journey. For this hackathon track, Ocean Protocol access control, signature, and data sharing capabilities were put to exploration.</p><p>FINZA has already developed a pioneering, Smart Contract based, DeFi Mortgage Platform that not only lets you use your crypto assets as collateral but also offers a chance for others to earn by providing liquidity to our decentralized pool.</p><p>A brief <a href="https://photos.onedrive.com/share/8E5666391FA96D03!160770?cid=8E5666391FA96D03&amp;resId=8E5666391FA96D03!160770&amp;authkey=!ALLEYOQyLlv7P_U&amp;ithint=video&amp;e=wsnW9V">Demonstration Video</a> details the service’s function and user&nbsp;journey.</p><p>View Finza <a href="https://github.com/Jacob8765/eth-miami-hackathon">Github Repository</a>.</p> Summary <p>Ocean Protocol was able to form a strategic partnership with the organizers of ETH Miami for recurring participation of Ocean Technology up for grabs at the annual hackathon. For the development of Ocean, a Miami-based hackathon provided valuable insights on how everyday people were able to pick up and build on ocean technology, understand the tools, and apply them to business applications and software tools of their choosing. Hats off to all those who chose the Ocean Protocol track to compete in. Lastly, warm praise to the top 3 projects!</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable people to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume&nbsp;data.</p><p>Follow Ocean on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter</a> or<a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a> to keep up to date.

 Protect access to all applications and resources with Security Service Edge 
<p><br>Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution, <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">now in preview</a>, includes Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access, and secures access to any app or resource for users and devices connecting from anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integrations across Microsoft’s SSE solution and the Microsoft Entra portfolio make it possible to enforce unified Conditional Access policies that consider identity, device, application, and now network conditions before granting access to any application or website. This works no matter which identity provider the application uses—without requiring any changes to the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of you are testing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access?rtc=1">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a>, our identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG), to secure access for Microsoft 365 traffic. We are expanding the public preview to include all internet apps and resources by the end of 2023 with new core capabilities:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Context-aware SWG with web content filtering to restrict end user access to unsafe and non-compliant content.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Universal Conditional Access to extend adaptive access controls to any network destination, such as an external website or a non-federated SaaS application.  &nbsp; 
 Compliant Network Check,&nbsp;an easy-to-manage construct within Conditional Access. With this control, you can protect Microsoft Entra integrated cloud applications against token theft and ensure users do not bypass network security policies specific to their tenant while accessing critical cloud services.&nbsp; 
 Source IP restoration in ID Protection and Conditional Access location policies that maintains each user’s original source IP to enable backward compatibility of trusted location checks and continuous access evaluation, identity risk detection, and logging.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> is our identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) for any private app or resource. New capabilities in private preview include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for more protocols in addition to TCP, including UDP and private DNS, so you’ll be able to transition from your traditional Virtual Private Network (VPN) to a modern ZTNA solution. 
 Conditional Access controls and modern authentication methods, such as multifactor authentication (MFA), to secure access to all private applications and resources for remote and on-premises users. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our SSE solution works with your existing security and network solutions through integrations across Microsoft’s security stack and open partner ecosystem. We’re partnering with other vendors in this space, starting with <a href="https://docs.netskope.com/en/netskope-help/integrations-439794/solution-guides/microsoft-security-and-netskope-integration-solution-guide/microsoft-and-netskope-sse-coexistence/">Netskope</a>, to demonstrate seamless side-by-side operation in the same environment. We’re committed to giving you the flexibility to choose the SSE solution that best fits the network traffic in your environment. For both Internet Access and Private Access, we’re also announcing cross-OS client support for Windows and Android in public preview, and for MacOS and iOS in private preview.

 Auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies and more 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, we turned on security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/new-name">Azure Active Directory</a>) for almost seven million existing tenants, which cut the number of compromises in those tenants by 80 percent. Based on the positive customer feedback, we’re helping more Microsoft Entra ID customers protect themselves by automatically enrolling eligible tenants into Conditional Access policies based on customer risk signals, current usage, and licensing. Microsoft-managed conditional access policies&nbsp;will start with three policies that enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) in high-risk scenarios. You can learn more details in Alex Weinert’s recent blog post, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant with Microsoft managed Conditional Access policies. The policy details are shown in a context pane to the right, indicating that the selected policy requires certain administrator roles to perform multifactor authentication when accessing the Microsoft admin portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But not all MFA methods offer equal protection. The more effective MFA methods, such as FIDO2 Security keys, Windows Hello, Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA), and passkeys, use cryptographic techniques to make authentication phishing-resistant. The preview of Microsoft Entra CBA allows you to tailor authentication policies by certificate, resource type, and user group. All these phishing-resistant authentication methods make it possible to eliminate passwords altogether, so they can’t be guessed, intercepted, or phished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is committed to supporting passkeys across our ecosystem, starting with Windows 11. Once you create a passkey for a website, application, or service using Windows Hello, you can sign in from your device using your face, fingerprint, or device PIN. This gives enterprises and government customers an additional, phishing-resistant alternative to physical FIDO2 security keys. Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to sign in using passkeys managed from the Microsoft Authenticator app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-protection">Microsoft Entra ID Protection</a> now detects anomalies such as an unusual token lifetime or a token played from an unfamiliar location. When a trigger is alerted, Conditional Access can immediately expire the token and force reauthentication along with other measures, such as a password reset or step-up MFA, without requiring manual intervention. If a user makes a password change on-premises, Entra ID Protection can now <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/remediate-user-risks-in-microsoft-entra-id-protection-through-on/ba-p/3773129">automatically remediate their risk</a>. This makes it easier for hybrid organizations to take advantage of user risk policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Integrations for more robust Permissions Management 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Microsoft Entra Permissions Management</a> has two significant integrations that will give you insights on permission risks so you can improve your security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/PermissionsManagementDefenderForCloud">Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) integration</a> preview consolidates identity and access permission insights with other cloud security information in a single interface. This view will display actionable recommendations for addressing permissions risks, as well as the Permissions Creep Index, and make it easier to enforce least privilege access for cloud resources across Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Permissions Management integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC), which is now in public preview, provides and efficient way to consolidate insights into other cloud security posture information on a single interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/ServiceNowPoD">second integration</a>, now generally available, allows ServiceNow&nbsp;customers to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) via the ServiceNow portal. This popular IT service management (ITSM) solution strengthens your Zero Trust posture by adding access permission requests to existing approval workflows in ServiceNow. Now when a user requests access approvals, the ServiceNow Plugin fetches the latest data from Permissions Management, then sends the requested user permissions, along with time-bound approval based on the requestor’s roles, back to ServiceNow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Evolving secure identity and network access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopting a single integrated solution with comprehensive capabilities with Microsoft Entra will simplify access security for your admins and give your end users a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra portfolio works together to help you secure identities, devices, networks, and workloads. It extends to any user type, including customers, partners, and digital workloads. And now, with our SSE solution, Microsoft Entra is converging identity and network access controls into a single policy engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the latest innovations in Microsoft Entra will make it easier for you to secure access to everything for everyone.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland – November 15, 2023 – <a href="https://appruvr.co.uk/?ref=blog.dock.io">Appruvr</a>, a platform that automates the qualification verification process for employers and candidates, announced the integration of <a href="http://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a>’s Verifiable Credential technology. Using Verifiable Credentials, Appruvr makes it easy for organizations to verify credentials instantly without contacting the issuing party or checking physical documents while enabling individuals to control their own data.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credential</a> is a fraud-proof digital document that proves something about an individual or entity, such as someone’s identity or qualification. Verifiable Credentials are instantly verifiable and enable users to present information in a privacy-preserving way.&nbsp; </p> Problems: Credential Fraud and Unnecessarily Long Verification Processes  <p>Delaney Millward, Founder of Apprurvr, started the company because he had first-hand experience of seeing how many job applicants embellished their credentials. He relied on websites including LinkedIn and recruitment agencies but found many people didn’t fit what they were looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with the traditional recruitment processes is that the information relies solely on what candidates claim they are qualified for. This experience started his journey to find a solution where an organization could quickly and efficiently verify the credentials. At the time, the solution didn’t exist.</p><p>Credential fraud is a huge global problem:&nbsp;</p>  83% of employers believe their hires have lied about qualifications  1 in 5 employers admit to not verifying graduate qualifications  47% of job applicants admit to inflating grades  Fake diplomas and degrees make 7 billion dollars a year worldwide  Credential fraud costs UK businesses £23 billion pounds every year  <p>Credential fraud has financial consequences and affects public safety, particularly when fraudsters work in high-stakes jobs like surgeons, nurses, or construction workers. Many people around the world have died or been injured by unqualified people working in jobs that they got as a result of fake credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Credential verification is still generally slow, complex and expensive. To illustrate, even the fastest verification times are approximately 3.8 days, which is cumbersome when we consider the speed of the job market in many sectors. Employers don’t have the capacity to verify all of these credentials, particularly when they need to hire many people in a short period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Appruvr is at the forefront of harnessing verifiable credential technology to solve credential fraud issues and give organizations the solutions to make credential verification easier and faster.</p> How Dock's Technology Enables Appruvr to Fast-Track the Credential Verification Process <p>When Appruvr was building their solution and researching Verifiable Credential providers, they felt that Dock could meet their technological needs and shared the same goals of empowering both organizations and individuals with tools to make the journey from education to employment more seamless and efficient.</p><p>These are some of the key benefits of Verifiable Credentials in the education and workforce sectors:&nbsp;</p>  Employers can hire candidates faster because they can check the authenticity of credentials instantly.&nbsp;  Organizations can verify credentials without storing that data because individuals hold and control the data on their mobile identity wallet app.  Graduates can conveniently and efficiently prove their credentials in a way that preserves their privacy without relying on a third party.  Job applicants can prove their credentials anywhere in the world at any time in an era where remote and gig work is growing.  <p>By integrating Dock’s <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credentials Platform</a>, Appruvr seamlessly transforms education and workforce credentials into fraud-proof and instantly Verifiable Credentials. Verifiable Credentials leverage cutting-edge cryptography, ensuring strong data integrity and protection against tampering.</p><p>“Dock’s partnership with Appruvr will lead the way in introducing new and innovative technology that will have significant benefits for the background screening industry, and support the drive towards true digital hiring whilst removing the pain felt by all who utilize current screening methods. We are very excited through this partnership to bring verifiable digital credentials to the mainstream, creating an ecosystem where individuals are back in control of their data and employers can verify a candidate's credentials in a matter of moments.” said Delaney Millward, Appruvr’s CEO.</p><p>"Our collaboration with Appruvr is more than just a technology partnership; it's a shared vision to transform how credentials are verified and combat pervasive credential fraud. We're uniting our strengths to make credential verification seamless and secure by providing organizations with the tools to verify credentials instantly while placing data control back into the hands of individuals," said Nick Lambert, Dock's CEO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> About Appruvr <p>Appruvr simplifies credential sharing between learning providers, candidates, and employers. Using blockchain technology, the verification is not only quick, the results are 100% reliable and secure. Appruvr's solution has been specifically designed to improve the recruitment journey for employers, institutions and candidates. Bringing qualification checks into the 21st century to stop recruitment fraud and the reliance on outdated and inefficient processes.</p> About Dock <p>Dock’s Verifiable Credential platform makes any data fraud-proof and instantly verifiable. It comprises the Certs API, the Certs no-code web app, an ID wallet and a dedicated blockchain. Using Dock, organizations reduce data verification costs while increasing the operational efficiency of verifying and issuing digital credentials. Individuals can fully control their data to access products and services more conveniently in a privacy-preserving way. Dock has been a leader in decentralized digital identity technology since 2017 and trusted by organizations in diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and education.</p>

Given the increasing hyper-connectivity of everything and our growing online presence, the significance of cybersecurity cannot be overstated. We are constantly coming across new cyber threats and attacks, novel avenues are opening for adversaries, emerging technologies are changing the paradigm and cyber affairs are more and more linked to physical ones, leading to the notion of hybrid threats. ENISA, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, has been monitoring the cybersecurity threat landscape for more than 10 years.

  <p>AI actors are poised to eclipse the number of human users on the internet. Many industry observers have decried such growth, pointing to the immense risks that such a brave new world poses. How can security systems even keep up with the rate of expansion in AI technologies? How can enterprises hope to compete with the vast amounts of money, time, and resources that AI companies use to train their models? Such questions presage a significant evolution in the way the tech industry envisions, develops, and deploys security systems.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a way forward, but it requires the cybersecurity market to shift toward a pattern that follows what AI vendors have done: make the science of biological systems the template for cybersecurity. Breakthroughs in social science, political science, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience demonstrate that our focus should be on establishing trustful relationships rather than a direct reliance on structural interventions such as identity management, attack surface management, and zero trust practices. The pathways that enable biological entities to come to trust and successfully collaborate with each other are known to science. In this presentation, Global Head of Research Mike Neuenschwander will delve into what changes are coming to the security market in order to achieve such levels of trust online.&nbsp; The presentation will provide a market roadmap for vendors, enterprises, governments, and standards organizations alike to create a security model that is highly collaborative and ultimately highly trustworthy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-future-of-security-is-collaborative-cre23"></a>

  <p>How can I effectively address cybersecurity vulnerabilities within my organization? Also, what are the implications of the Cyberresilience Act for this? EDITH, the European Digital Innovation Hub for Hesse, has extended an invitation to Dr. Steven Arzt, a cybersecurity expert from the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT, for a #DigiTalk session discussing best practices for Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure.</p>
<p>Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is the process with which ethical hackers report vulnerabilities in software and systems to manufacturers and system operators. Researchers commonly often assess the security status of a system or product independently, i.e., without a formal invitation, contract or integration into a company’s strategy. While these unasked-for vulnerability reports are still considered an insult by some companies, others openly embrace their value for strengthening the company’s IT security by interacting with the hacking and research communities. In his talk, Dr. Arzt shows how a proper CVD process can greatly benefit companies and the wider IT security community at the same time. It is shown how CVD can not only help identify and fix vulnerabilities, but also send a strong positive message about a company’s attitude towards IT security.</p>

Large IT companies have been promising us a password-free future for a long time. Is it really that easy to finally turn your back on passwords? The fact is that we have to deal with a large number of passwords every day in order to complete our professional and private tasks. Every password should be unique, highly complex and as long as possible.

  <p>The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which entered into force on 16 January 2023 and will apply from 17 January 2025, aims to enhance the digital operational resilience of entities across the EU financial sector and to further harmonise key digital operational resilience requirements for all EU financial entities. DORA sets out uniform requirements for the security of network and information systems of companies and organisations operating in the financial sector as well as critical third parties which provide ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) services to them, such as cloud computing or data analytics services. DORA creates a regulatory framework on digital operational resilience, whereby all financial entities need to make sure they can withstand, respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats. These requirements are homogenous across the EU, with the core aim to prevent and mitigate cyber threats. DORA is complemented with several “regulatory technical standards (‘RTS’)” which give more details on requirements for cyber security.</p>
<p>As the whole DORA legislation cannot be presented in a short timeframe, I will focus on the part that is most important to ensure cybersecurity and the part that is the most interesting one for the audience, the RTS on ICT Risk Management Framework. I will give a quick overview and highlight the topics, which will bring the most workload to the industry. The biggest challenges will be in the areas of Asset Management, Operations Security, Network Security and Encryption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/what-are-the-main-challenges-cre23"></a>

What if an isolated space could still function in a disconnected state and still have powerful security properties? What if these isolated spaces could reconnect to the network and provide audit capabilities and security signaling to other components throughout the wide ecosystem?

  <p>Vulnerability Management is more then ever an important building block when it comes to early detection of issues to allow a proactive counter measure. This is only possible if various organizational areas work hand in hand starting from the information security strategy, over architecture, engineering, operations and the business side. This needs to be embedded in an according information security framework that defines the rules and requirements based on which the vulnerability management service is operated. However, this approach is only complete with an according target operating model that defines the various building blocks that contribute to a successful end-to-end service.</p>

  <p>Automated Threats to web applications are according to the Open Web Applications Project (OWASP) a misuse of their inherent valid functionality by applying automated means. Usually, those automations are referred to as `bots´. The attackers usually reverse engineer the web application, e.g. an e-commerce platform, and based on their discovery, craft bots to exploit vulnerabilities or gaps that allow them to pursue their goal on the platform in an undesirable way. A famous example are sneaker bots, whose goal is to obtain a competitive advantage over human clients in purchasing hyped articles like sneakers. Addressing automated threats is a company-wide effort and requires to tackle the problem from many angles reaching from DevSecOps, architectural changes, raising awareness, establishing transparency in the business, implementing preventive controls, to detective controls. In the first phase of our research, we tackled the problem in a big e-commerce company on this entire spectrum of challenges and are now at the position to enhance our approach in a second phase. In the second phase, we aim for an approach to harden a web-application platform with existing detective and reactive controls using aspects of generative approaches and adversarial attacks while also considering explainability.</p>
<p>In the talk, we are going to explain and motivate the problem space, explain the insights from the first phase and outline the goals of the second phase of our research.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enhancing-web-application-security-cre23"></a>

  <p>In today's digital age, traditional security models are no longer sufficient to protect against sophisticated cyber threats. That's where Zero Trust comes in – a security model that assumes that every user, device, and application is a potential threat until proven otherwise.<br><br>In this session, we will go through the criticality of the IAM in a zero trust security model. How by leveraging and implementing core IAM Technologies (IGA, Identity Federation and PAM) organisations can effectively manage identities, devices, enforcing access control principals like least privilege, continuous authentication, user behaviour analytics and can ensure that only authorised users have access to sensitive data and mission critical resources.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-guardian-angel-of-zero-trust-cre23"></a>

				  What sets one digital wallet apart from another and what are the key features you should look for before starting to store your personal data? Here, we discuss the three that we find the most important and explain why.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Between Apple Pay, Cash App, Google Pay and others, the number of digital wallets has exploded in recent years, with Capital One reporting there were <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/digital-wallet-statistics/#:~:text=Digital%20Wallet%20User%20Statistics&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%203.4%20billion%20digital%20wallet%20users%20in,60%25%20of%20the%20global%20population.">roughly 3.4 billion users</a> worldwide in 2022. As more consumers familiarize themselves with wallet apps, using them for moving money or purchasing goods or services has become commonplace.</p>
<p>If identity verification is to emulate the convenience of digital payments, the wallets we use need to offer more functionality than just the ability to accept, hold, and present a verifiable credential, they need to have the tools to fully manage your digital identity and data sharing.</p>
<p>The first additional feature to look for in a digital identity wallet is process management. Sometimes the process for being issued with a verifiable credential is simple: you fill out a few forms from the issuing party, which are confirmed by the issuing party, and then you are issued with a credential. For example, when applying for a mobile driver’s license there are several attribute fields to fill out, such as name, height, weight, eye color, etc. These allow the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to confirm that you are the correct person to issue the license to.</p>
<p>But what if the DMV decides it needs more information? Does the wallet notify you? Does the DMV have a procedure in place to notify you? Often services like this simply don’t have the time or processes in place to inform you of the need for more information, and the onus is on you to follow up. By having process management built into the wallet it would be able to easily notify you that the process is stalled and explain why.</p>
<p>The second feature to look for is the ability to act as a verifier and be able to read credentials. Every identity wallet by default is designed to hold credentials and create presentations of the information they contain; this allows you to share your mobile driver’s license or a proof of your age. But before you share this information, it would be ideal to be able to verify for yourself who you’re sharing this information with. For example, if you were pulled over by someone dressed as a police officer, this functionality could confirm that they actually are a police officer, and even provide you with important information such as their jurisdiction, name, and badge number. Similarly, this function would also allow two people to simply verify each other, for example when meeting someone for the first time: if a person comes to your door claiming to be from the gas company you could verify their credentials before letting them in to your house, and they could verify that you are the correct customer they are supposed to be helping, providing an additional layer of security and confidence.</p>
<p>The third feature we recommend is the ability to offer mutually authenticated two-way messaging. This allows you to cryptographically validate the identity of who you are interacting with (and they, you), and is a powerful way to deter fraud. (To learn more about how this works, <a href="https://indicio.tech/secure-two-way-communication-is-decentralized-identitys-secret-sauce-to-stopping-financial-scams/">read our recent article.</a>)</p>
<p>But besides stopping fraud, this feature also changes the way businesses and individuals can interact: instead of getting a letter or email from your bank, it can ping you to ask questions or start a conversation. Unlike email, this is a direct, encrypted communication that you know is coming from your bank. You can also easily sever this connection, and while you probably don’t want to do this with your bank, you may want to remove the ability for other parties to contact you.</p>
<p>In sum, we see identity wallets as building the foundation for digital relationships and these features provide powerful ways to build trusted digital relationships that are more richly interactive.</p>
<p>***</p>

<p>Passwords, while integral to security measures, can pose significant threats due to their inherent vulnerabilities. Weak or reused passwords, susceptibility to phishing and brute-force attacks, and potential insider threats all make passwords a weak link in your security posture.</p>
<p>Although ubiquitous and seemingly secure, passwords can pose a significant threat to organizations for various reasons. Common issues include the use of weak or easily guessable passwords and password reuse across multiple accounts, making it easier for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, the prevalence of phishing scams and brute-force attacks means that even the most careful users can become victims. Lastly, the risk of insider threats, where employees with compromised credentials can exploit their access, is an ever-present concern.</p>
<p>To effectively counter these risks, organizations need to look beyond passwords and embrace robust security measures such as multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implementing MFA introduces an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional authentication factors. It not only validates user identities using their passwords but also involves a second form of verification like a one-time code sent to the user’s mobile device. However, while MFA provides additional security over passwords, it is still susceptible to MFA bypass attacks such as SIM swap, MFA prompt bombing, and more.</p>
<p>For these reasons, organizations must explore comprehensive security solutions beyond just passwords and traditional MFA and look to phishing-resistant MFA such as certificate-based authentication.</p>
 The Entrust Solution 
<p>Entrust Desktop Credential Provider for Microsoft Windows, which provides robust passwordless and multi-factor authentication for Windows desktop login, is one such solution. It integrates with Entrust Identity Enterprise (IdE) and Identity as a Service (IDaaS), allowing comprehensive user authentication and management. Entrust Desktop responds to various use cases like workstation login, password change, and unlock, thereby enhancing security and providing better access controls.</p>
<p>Using MFA with Entrust Desktop Credential Provider increases organizational security, provides better control over system access, offers various choices to meet specific security needs, and helps meet regulatory requirements.</p>
 MFA Methods Supported by Entrust Desktop: 
 
 Passwordless Authentication: This method eliminates the need for users to remember and input a password for subsequent logins after their initial setup. Instead of the traditional password-based approach, it relies solely on Entrust’s second-factor authentication mechanisms. This not only simplifies the user’s experience but also offers a secure way to verify their identity, given the robustness of the second-factor authentication techniques involved. 
 OTP (One-Time Password) Authentication: A unique, time-sensitive password is dispatched to the user’s registered contact details – either their email address or phone number. Since the PIN is valid for only a short duration and can’t be used more than once, it reduces the chances of unauthorized access. 
 Token Authentication: Here, users authenticate themselves using secure tokens, which can be either hardware devices or software-based. These tokens can originate from Entrust or other reputable vendors in the cybersecurity realm. Entrust provides support for two main types of tokens:
 
 Response-Only Tokens: Provide authentication through a simple response mechanism 
 Challenge-response Tokens: Engage users in an interactive authentication process, where the system sends a challenge and awaits a correct response 
 
 
 
 
 Mobile Soft Token Authentication: In this approach, users receive an out-of-band authentication challenge directly on their mobile devices. These challenges can range from simple prompts to more interactive mechanisms, making the process both user-friendly and secure. 
 Grid Authentication: A unique method that presents users with a grid filled with an assortment of characters organized in rows and columns. During the login process, users are asked to provide specific characters from predetermined coordinates on the grid. Given its unconventional nature, this method offers an extra layer of security against automated bot attacks. 
 Knowledge-Based Q&amp;A Authentication: Here, users respond to a set of personalized questions either online or offline. These questions are typically formulated during the user’s initial setup and are based on information only the user is likely to know. The Q&amp;A mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into the Entrust Identity Enterprise platform, specifically via the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Server (or the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Module) or the Identity as a Service platform. This method combines the security of knowledge-based tests with the convenience of user-defined answers. 
 Mobile Smart Credentials Authentication (Certificate-based authentication): This is an advanced out-of-band authentication strategy. Users receive a challenge on their mobile devices, which is then signed by the Entrust Mobile app upon verification of the user through biometrics or a unique PIN. Once signed, the challenge is verified by the Entrust Identity Enterprise or the Identity as a Service platforms. 
 
<p>Entrust supports multiple MFA authentication mechanisms and we highly recommend using phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms.</p>

   A new study shows that organizations can enjoy a range of benefits by migrating — if they can overcome internal challenges 

<p>In the early days of cloud adoption, organizations were understandably apprehensive. Many of the early adopters were particularly concerned about security, and tested the waters with non-essential apps that were easy to migrate and presented minimal risk. In the years since, with most organizations well into their cloud journeys, cloud migration has proven its value in material ways, enabling greater productivity, better customer engagement, lower costs, and improved efficiency. And it's strengthened security by moving visibility and control to anywhere users and data happen to be.</p>

<p>Most would agree that identity and access management (IAM) is a critical component of a robust security ecosystem. So, it only makes sense that organizations would look to move IAM to the cloud as part of their overall digital transformation initiatives. Yet, many organizations remain hesitant to jump in and begin the process of migrating IAM systems to the cloud, despite its potential benefits.</p>

<p>We set out to find out why with the help of Forrester.</p>

<p>The result of this work is a custom study by Forrester Consulting in November 2023, commissioned by ForgeRock and Ping Identity and titled, "<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/cloud-migration-optimizes-identity-and-access-management">Cloud Migration Optimizes Identity and Access Management</a>."</p>

<p>The study's purpose was to investigate the challenges that are holding organizations back from migrating IAM to the cloud. The survey also explored the benefits and opportunities awaiting those that embrace cloud IAM.</p>

 About the study 

<p>The commissioned study queried organizations around the world with at least 5,000 employees to explore their concerns about migrating IAM systems and solutions to the cloud. It also sought to understand the perceptions of IAM administrators and security leaders about cloud migration, the potential benefits of embracing a move to the cloud, and how cloud migration impacts their success. Ultimately, it looked to help guide organizations considering a move to the cloud to create a plan for IAM cloud migration.</p>

 Cloud IAM can help organizations achieve their objectives, so why aren't more adopting it? 

<p>Organizations in all sectors face challenges related to demands for stronger security and better experiences for customers and employees. They're fielding requests for multi-factor authentication (MFA), including passwordless authentication, while navigating a complex web of regulations that vary by region.</p>

<p>For most, the answer may be cloud IAM. According to the survey, 86% of respondents indicate that fully migrating IAM to the cloud is important to their success. That number jumps to ninety-two percent for organizations using both workforce IAM and customer IAM (CIAM).</p>

<p>But despite broad interest in its benefits, organizations have been slow to make the move. According to Forrester, only 12% of organizations are fully embracing identity in the cloud.<a>1</a></p>

 For many organizations, the culprit is internal 

<p>The survey showed that organizations are having trouble overcoming the challenges with cloud migration, primarily in two areas: organizational barriers and complexity.</p>

<p>One of the great advantages of cloud IAM technology is that it enables enterprises to transition from an on-premises IAM system to the cloud to deliver the agility, reliability, and scalability commonly associated with cloud technologies and services. But the complexity of legacy IAM ecosystems creates barriers to success.</p>

<p>Assessing and managing existing infrastructure, including highly distributed identities, identifying integrations and incompatibilities between apps and cloud solutions, and realigning internal technologies to facilitate a move to the cloud represent arduous but critical tasks. Add to that organizational silos, including siloed IAM, and a lack of leadership support at the highest levels, and it's no wonder that the journey to the cloud for many organizations is an uphill battle.</p>

 What benefits await? 

<p>Although the challenges can be intimidating, the journey to the cloud offers a bounty of rewards that make the endeavor worthwhile. More than 60% of survey respondents indicate that successful migration can enhance security, including improving password security and enforcing Zero Trust security.</p>

<p>Cloud IAM also helps businesses deliver the kind of frictionless user experiences that attract, engage, and retain customers, and enhance employee engagement and productivity. Equally significant are the operational improvements offered by cloud migration, including reduced complexity in governance and management, improved agility to comply with regulations, and the freeing of resources normally burdened with these tasks — many of the manual — to focus on other activities that deliver greater business value.</p>

 How can you move forward? 

<p>Are you investigating a move to cloud IAM?

<p>Driver’s licenses serve more use cases for us than simply proving our capability to operate a vehicle–many people use their driver’s license as their primary form of identification. As we shift to a digital-first world, people will need credentials to represent all facets of their identity digitally in a secure way. Whether it be proving identity to apply for a loan or purchasing a controlled substance online, it’s becoming increasingly important and necessary for entities to offer people the option to present a digitally issued ID document remotely.</p><p>This means that it is critical to build mobile driver’s license (mDL) solutions using standardized data formats, so verifiers across different geographies and industries can use a consistent framework to confirm a person’s identity. To ensure the secure and interoperable use of these digital credentials, international standards are being developed and tested. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event, organized by SpruceID, was a significant milestone in this ongoing journey.</p><p>We’re delighted to have hosted a successful, fully-remote, and asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations. Read on to learn more about ISO/IEC 18013-7, a recap of the interoperability event, and how the results and findings are being used to drive the digital identity industry forward.</p> A Brief Introduction to ISO/IEC 18013-7 <p>ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 is the working group that defines standards for motor vehicle driver’s licenses and related documents, to provide a common technical framework and promote the safe and secure use of this technology. The 18013-5 standard specified by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 defines requirements for the security, data elements, and information exchange of mobile driving licenses (mDL) between the mobile device and authorized parties while upholding user data protection and safeguarding driver privacy.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 focuses on attended in-person use cases where parties are in close proximity during the presentation of a digitally issued ID document. After introducing the ISO/IEC 18013-5 standard, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC17 took another step forward by publishing a Committee Draft consultation of ISO/IEC 18013-7, a draft technical specification that focuses on unattended or fully online use cases of mDL where parties are remotely connected at the time of presentation.</p><p>The objective of our interoperability event was to provide a collaboration forum for implementers of ISO/IEC 18013-7 to come together and test their respective solutions to drive forward cross-industry interoperability and adoption while accelerating feedback and clarity for implementations of the standards.</p> Joining Forces for Testing <p>The Interoperability Event was hosted remotely, with an asynchronous testing window spanning three weeks. This allowed participants enough time to actively test and collaborate iteratively with other implementers to optimize their own implementations and use cases.</p><p>The event was open for all implementers of 18013-7 to participate without any restrictions regarding organization size or any particular working group membership. Participants came from a variety of backgrounds, including both public and private sectors, across multiple geographies. Any observers interested in understanding the maturity and adoption of the draft standard were also welcome to join and listen in.</p><p>The participating mDL reader implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Credence ID, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Okta, OneProof, Panasonic, Ping Identity, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID, and Thales.</p><p>The participating mDL implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, NEC, OneProof, Panasonic, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID (jointly with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles), and Thales.</p><p>Testing participants were encouraged to test both Rest API and OpenID4VP implementations to inform recommendations for refining the clarity of the technical specification related to both protocols.</p> Results and Reflections <p>There were many takeaways and learnings from the test event that will ultimately help to inform both the standard and interoperability moving forward. Notably, the draft specifications were found to have no major issues necessitating normative changes. Most interoperability challenges were largely a result of updates to the draft documents in advance of the interoperability event, which some participants did not have sufficient time or resources to address. However, the successful resolution of these issues demonstrated a shared commitment to fostering interoperability and will help improve this documentation in the future.</p><p>Feedback from the event, along with preliminary aggregate, anonymized test results, and troubleshooting, was presented to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 WG10 in Singapore. The findings and resolutions were documented as N2349 in the ISO Global Directory. So far, these insights have been incorporated into the latest version of ISO/IEC 18013-7, submitted as N2356. N2356 is the first draft of a Technical Specification, which includes all the improvements and insights we've gathered during our test event to enhance the specification for better interoperability.</p><p>If you’re interested in taking a deeper dive into these findings, a comprehensive event results publication can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=114730549750609434292&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">be found here</a>. </p> Onwards and Upwards for 18013-7 <p>We look forward to continuing to play a role in advancing the 18013-7 standard and other digital identity standards. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event was a testament to the collective effort to advance standards for mobile driver's licenses, and how much progress we can make together to eventually bring this standard to life for public use. The successful interoperability demonstrations of mobile driver’s licenses that can be presented and verified remotely over the internet will introduce a new class of use cases for verifiable digital identity and evolve the way we use mobile driver’s licenses today.</p><p>At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. As digital identity technologies, such as mobile driver's licenses, become more pervasive and usable for online user experiences, it is important to be mindful of introducing privacy-preserving capabilities from their inception. To that end, we think carefully about technology mitigations for privacy risks and concerns raised by civil liberties organizations, such as "phoning home," in the mDL implementations that SpruceID works on. You can learn more in our <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/existing-critiques?ref=blog.spruceid.com">knowledge base</a>.</p><p>We’d like to thank all implementers for taking the time to participate in the test event. This event marked a crucial step towards creating a digital identification landscape that is secure, interoperable, and universally accessible. As we continue our journey towards fully realizing the potential of mDLs, collaborative, open events like these play a vital role in shaping the future of digital identification.</p>  📄  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Read the Event Results Publication</a>   <p>About SpruceID: At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. </p>

 The Brazilian gambling industry is about to become regulated. IDnow investigates how the grey market currently works, and some of the dangers of using unregulated gambling platforms. 



 



<p>Brazil effectively banned gambling in 1946; a more-or-less all-encompassing restriction that remained largely in place until 2018, when sports betting was legalized. However, as virtually no regulation was ever implemented, Brazilian players and international gambling platforms have been operating in a somewhat grey area ever since. This is all due to change once Brazilian online gambling regulation is formally approved in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The limbo appears to work, at least on the face of it. And at least for international operators. Surprisingly, despite the lack of clear regulation, Brazil still manages to generate over<a href="https://denmark.net/top-countries-online-gambling-traffic/?expand_article=1"> 20% of all global online gambling</a> traffic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is for this reason that the Brazilian authorities have introduced new regulations to help the Brazilian gambling market capture what is viewed as lost revenue (<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">a projected $1.5 billion in 2023</a>) and bring it back within the fold of the Brazilian economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the projected numbers are likely to be even larger when regulation finally passes, as there are vast swathes of the Brazilian would-be gambling community that are not currently gambling, despite wanting to.</p>



 To gamble or not to gamble? That is the Brazilian question. 



<p>In 2021, a survey on Brazilian attitudes toward gambling discovered that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/o-desafio-da-preven%C3%A7%C3%A3o-%C3%A0-lavagem-de-dinheiro-nos-jogos-odilon-dutra/?originalSubdomain=pt">39% of Brazilian participants said they didn’t gamble</a> because they felt uncertain of the safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just over half of all potential players said they would feel more confident playing online if they had more information about the companies. This is understandable as many gambling operators are not very clear about who their owners are, or even the location of their headquarters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same survey, 51% of participants said they would like to see more player protection mechanisms put in place. Read more opinions from the Brazilian betting community in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">blog, ‘How does the Brazilian betting community really feel about upcoming regulations.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite operating in the grey, international gambling operators have achieved considerable visibility through advertising on television and the internet, and through sponsorship of Brazilian football clubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the wave of publicity and ensuing popularity <a href="https://mundorubronegro.com/apostas-brasil/casas-apostas-ilegais">has raised concerns</a> about the impact of gambling addiction, the growth of scams, and the threat of money laundering.</p>



 Wait, so is online gambling legal or illegal in Brazil? 



<p>The most obvious question that many have when they see adverts for online gambling platforms but find out online gambling is essentially illegal, is well, how does that work? The answer lies in <a href="https://seudireito.proteste.org.br/site-de-apostas-e-ilegal/">Law 13.756,</a> which allows operators to offer their services in Brazil if their headquarters are outside of Brazil and there are no physical points of sale. In practice, this law enables bookmakers to use websites, on the condition they are hosted internationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As these websites operate according to the rules of the countries in which they are based, such as Curaçao, the UK or Malta, they are not required to obey Brazilian laws, such as the Consumer Defence Code. This is all set to change when Brazilian regulations are formally passed and implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has meant that from 2018 until whenever the regulations finally come into force, international bookmakers have operated with a sort of impunity and without needing to implement fair gaming rules or player protection measures.</p>



 What do Brazilian players think about using unregulated gambling platforms? 



<p>The Brazilian gaming community is waking up to the realities of dealing with unregulated gambling operators. Common complaints made on social media and forums include users making deposits but being unable to withdraw them, and even stories of players who have had their accounts blocked following a good streak in sports betting or on online casinos. However, there is a growing awareness among the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">Brazilian betting community</a> that these kinds of scams are not representative of the entire gambling industry, but rather just unreliable websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An upside to the online proliferation of so many negative stories has led to <a href="https://www.extraclasse.org.br/geral/2023/03/bicheiros-e-contraventores-investem-em-cassinos-on-line-e-apostas-esportivas/">increasing numbers of Brazilian gamblers</a> actively seeking information about the risk of less reliable, unregulated online gambling sites.</p>



 Arguments for and against KYC processes in Brazil. 



<p>While the vast majority of the Brazilian betting community seem to accept the value of undergoing a KYC process, there are <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/betano/casa-de-aposta-nao-quer-pagar-meu-saque-e-fica-pedindo-fotos-de-todos-o-tip_DSBUzJ1HW0713vYD/">some who have expressed privacy concerns</a> over some operators’ requirements for players to take and send photographs of themselves holding identity documents. Many also fear that when dealing with an international operator, if there was a problem associated with sending documents, for example a data breach, then they would not be able to rely on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farialimabets/comments/11txan7/%C3%A9_seguro_enviar_meus_documentos_para_uma_casa_de/">national legal protection measures</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A common complaint among international gambling operators is on the difficulty of performing the Brazilian KYC process due to the wide variety and disparity of identity documents in Brazil. For example, each state in Brazil offers slightly different ID cards, which have dates and document numbers in different places, for example. Difficulties <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/bc-game/verificacao-kyc_OcihHkmZ_wp6BSrb/">surrounding the KYC process</a> have affected some players’ ability to <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/188bet-apostas-esportivas-online/verificacao-de-identidade-kyc-prejuizo-de-u-75_Gp8gh8oJt_YPqbvA/">transact and make withdrawals</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes the integration with the Cadastro de Pessoas Fiscias (CPF), a tax number that every Brazilian is issued with, all the more important for identity verification and KYC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brazilian industry insiders say that the implementation of KYC measures to obtain a licence (Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">‘Unpacking the complexities of the Brazilian gambling license structure’ here</a>) means more than just following a legal requirement, it will also <a href="https://g-mnews.com/pt/compliance-kyc-transparencia-que-gera-confiabilidade/">help operators prevent fraud</a>.</p>

This means, in effect, they create a synthetic jurisdiction that sits between nation states, resting on international treaties, The Mattereum model can be seen as a new form of network state itself, as well as a convenient legal tool to be used by other network states (or indeed any other individual or entity) for managing trade in physical goods. It could become a “pluggable” legal layer to support other network states, particularly the ones exporting physical goods. If a thing has a price tag, it can be part of this synthetic jurisdiction, irrespective of whether the object is land in Oregon, gold in a vault in Singapore or investment grade whisky in a barrel in Scotland, subject to the same law and the same guarantees. It is a state for physical objects, rather than a state for people, but arguably a state nonetheless. What makes it so is that it has the machinery to resolve legal disputes between people, under the rules that they opt into when they use Mattereum. It’s where your legal problems go to be resolved. Resolving trade disputes is one of the more critical aspects of a state, isn’t&nbsp;it?</p><blockquote>The innovative Mattereum Asset Passport created by my company could have an important role to play in a network state&nbsp;future</blockquote><p>This is not new to us; while network states are gaining in prominence and importance as their potential becomes clear, Mattereum has been thinking about this kind of thing from the very start. Five years ago, in the early days of our company, I wrote a speculative document about this very thing with two of my colleagues from Mattereum. Until now it has not been published outside the organisation but given its new relevance I thought I would share it. The language does not perhaps use current terminology (e.g. for Free Economic Zones read network states, for smart property register, read MAPs), but I feel the ideas are possibly even more relevant now than they were&nbsp;then.</p> “Towards a Digital&nbsp;Hansa: <p>Past Precedents as Inspiration for a Global Confederation of Free Economic Zones By James Hester, Anton Shelupanov, and Vinay&nbsp;Gupta</p><p>As Free Economic Zones (FEZs) have emerged and developed, these unique commercial entities have gradually come to share more in common with each other than with the parent nation states in which they are located. It is only natural, then, that a desire would arise to unify their efforts towards common business goals, as for example in the Eurasian belt where the Digital Silk Road initiative seeks to facilitate interaction between FEZs in the region. Since formal unification would be geopolitically disruptive, the goal should be a strong but informal confederation capable of acting on the world stage at state-like levels and capable of facilitating commerce between members. As it happens, there exists a precedent for such a vast and formidable mercantile body in Europe’s past which could provide an inspiring model for how an equivalent organisation could be formed and governed&nbsp;today.</p><p>The Hanseatic League, also known as the Hansa (Middle Low German for ‘guild’), was a confederation of trading centres in the Holy Roman Empire which, founded in the 12th century, became the dominant mercantile power in Northern Europe for the next four centuries. Composed primarily of German towns and headquartered in Lübeck, member towns worked to ensure mutual protection of trade and the smooth conduct of commerce between them. They were never formally unified, being towns under the control of the Empire or neighbouring kingdoms including Sweden, Denmark, England, and Kievan Rus. Yet all members adhered to the bonds required of them in the Hanseatic charters, and heads of state learned quickly not to antagonise them lest they risk being cut out of trade (effectively an economic death sentence). They were governed by the consensus of their members, with regular meetings of representatives from each town to decide on pressing issues. They even levied troops and ships from members for mutual protection when necessary, meaning that they were capable of amassing a respectable military presence. So although not a state, they acted with near state-like power and were regarded as such by Europe’s&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>When we consider the degree of organisation which was achieved by the Hansa with the technology at their disposal, it is easy to see how a similar institution is not only possible today, but greatly enhanced and facilitated by our current technological innovations. Near-instant communication enables unprecedented efficiency in logistics coordination and maintaining relationships with clients and partners. Containerisation has revolutionised the transport of goods through standardisation and optimal use of space. And now, blockchain technology stands poised to automate elaborate and time-consuming administrative and legal procedures, reducing once exasperating but inevitable aspects of conducting business to previously unthinkable levels of ease and straightforwardness. Not only could we establish such an institution today and reap the resulting commercial benefits, we could do it better than our ancestors ever&nbsp;dreamed.</p><p>So what would an equivalent confederation of FEZs, our Digital Hansa, look like? A single strong economic centre (Lübeck) provided the foundation on which the original Hansa was built, with all members consenting to abide by the ‘Law of Lübeck’ in governing their activities. To avoid any one member becoming overly influential, member FEZs could jointly adopt a governance framework of a neutral body such as UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). They would also agree on a means of achieving consensus on policy and activities, and commit to abide by a single set of standards and regulations. These would apply appropriately across the confederation’s three tiers: individual companies operating in an FEZ, individual FEZs, and the combined global&nbsp;network.</p><p>Members would also pledge mutual aid to one another. This aid would take several forms. Parent states would negotiate the necessary economic concessions to enable member FEZs and their component companies to conduct business among themselves in the same manner worldwide. Members would speak with a collective voice in international forums such as the UN, and organise a communal legal defence and hardship funds to be drawn upon by any member in need. It is even possible, after delicate negotiations with each parent state, to organise some form of mutual defence pact whereby member states would contribute somehow to the protection of one another in times of necessity. A useful existing model is the single market and customs union established across members of the European Union. Just as these agreements remove economic barriers and facilitate trade with EU member states, a Digital Hansa would enable unhindered commerce between FEZs regardless of their location on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>The blockchain applications developed by Mattereum are well placed to provide much of the necessary digital infrastructure for a global confederation of Free Economic Zones. The identities of member individuals and companies, the standards adhered to by all tiers of the organisation, and perhaps a complementary industry-standard accreditation such as a D-U-N-S Number, would be recorded on an immutable and accessible digital record. Consequently, external businesses engaging with members would be able to easily verify relevant details and proceed, safe in the knowledge that any company operating within a member FEZ operates under the same established regulations and practices.</p><p>The Smart Property Register operated by Mattereum would track and manage assets and resources across the confederation’s three tiers. No matter the asset’s location in the world, while in custody of a member, clients could rest assured that its storage and transport would be managed with an established standard of care. Tokenization of assets would also enable trade to be conducted without necessitating the transfer of physical goods from owner to&nbsp;owner.</p><p>Furthermore, since economic concessions from parent states would enable the transport of goods between member FEZs with reduced or eliminated tariffs and other expenses normally incurred while engaging in international trade, using member companies for transport and logistics would become particularly enticing.</p><p>For whatever governing framework member FEZs choose to jointly subscribe, Mattereum’s smart contracts could provide the means by which members commit to abide by them. This would prove especially useful in the resolution of disputes. Mattereum’s arbitration mechanisms would be in place both to resolve any claims or grievances that arise, and enable governing powers to enforce resolutions with all due authority and means. Streamlining such otherwise onerous processes will both reduce administrative and legal costs for all parties, as well as allay fears of time and resources wasted should a dispute&nbsp;arise.</p><p>The positive impacts would be considerable. Political benefits would be significant, as parent states which are not currently influential players on the world stage would gain influential partnerships in the wider international community. They would also have a greater voice in world affairs by virtue of the confederation’s collective actions. The economic benefits would be equally striking. Member companies would dramatically reduce administrative and legal costs, and would also see increased profits as clients are attracted to the reduction of costs and hassle which would come from working with members. Furthermore, the necessary digital infrastructure would already be in place within member FEZs, allowing businesses to plug into existing systems rather than building them from the ground up. Parent states would also reap commercial benefits through greater internal economic activity and increases in&nbsp;FDI.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest impact of a Digital Hansa would be the advent of a new commercial ecosystem. The confederation imagined here would create a new global standard of business conduct which would dramatically strengthen relationships between companies and clients. If a company is ‘Hansa’-backed, no matter its location or its jurisdiction, clients could know exactly what that means, and proceed with confidence. As the original Hansa ushered in a period of previously unprecedented commercial cooperation and prosperity for the Holy Roman Empire, a Digital Hansa stands ready to do the same for the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Over the last year or so, I have written pieces about how the innovation created by Mattereum, the <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> can help bring about <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/why-global-trade-needs-the-blockchain-e1a380f5df2">limitless ecommerce</a>, how it can <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/ai-oracles-super-empower-real-world-assets-on-the-blockchain-and-super-empower-ai-to-act-in-the-619aa2ba5bf1">help AI </a>revolutionise the way we do business, how it can enable not only a circular economy but the more efficient and realistic <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/making-the-spiral-economy-a-reality-8a5930cc80cd">spiral economy</a> as well as how it can transform the trade in real world assets through <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/fractional-ownership-rwa-daos-and-the-holy-grail-557b99e8e045">tokenization and fractionalization</a>, and now I am talking network state. I sometimes feel we could be seen as just jumping on the latest bandwagon to catch the eye of VCs looking for the flavour of the month, but then I realise that we are just showing different facets of the same&nbsp;thing.</p><blockquote>We are showing different facets of the same&nbsp;thing</blockquote><p>Mattereum’s innovation is deep and profound; it took six years and several million pounds to get our system to work, it was not easy, and no one else has come close to achieving the same thing, but it is working, and has been live and serving customers for over two years&nbsp;now.</p><p>By creating a connection between a token on the blockchain and a physical thing in the real world that will stand up in court in 172 jurisdictions worldwide we have made something that will provide the deep foundations for trade in the future. It really can make ecommerce faster and smoother by removing the majority of the barriers to high value transactions. The same thing makes it possible for AI to recognise that the digital twin of a physical object really does represent something in the real world and to enable the tracking of objects through their lives so they can be reused and recycled efficiently. In addition, by being able to facilitate the tokenization and fractionalization of physical assets with ownership firmly established, it does utterly change the way things like <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/revolutionising-real-estate-with-the-blockchain-a9a90afd7d3d">real estate</a> and<a href="https://mattereum.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The_Case_for_Gold_on_the_Blockchain.pdf"> gold</a> can be traded. So too, can it provide a way for network states to manage physical assets that enhances their function, and there will be other things it can revolutionise too, it’s just waiting for people to identify the potential.</p><blockquote>The MAP is deep infrastructure, like railway lines or HTML; it does the same thing, whatever the traffic you choose to run on it, and it has the potential to change the future just as&nbsp;much.</blockquote><p>If you are working on a project that you think could be enhanced by the Mattereum system get in touch with us via <a href="mailto:contact@mattereum.com">contact@mattereum.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-network-state-and-the-digital-hansa-bfccf8df0097">The Network State and the Digital Hansa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>14th November, Luxembourg – &nbsp;Today holds dual significance: not only does it mark the launch of <a href="https://www.artsgain.com/en/">Artsgain</a>‘s groundbreaking tokenized blue-chip art fund, but it’s also the birth anniversary of the legendary artist, Claude Monet. </p>
<p>A trailblazer, Monet forever changed the way we perceive art. In the same pioneering spirit, Artsgain’s tokenized fund will introduce unprecedented liquidity avenues for art investors, echoing Monet’s revolutionary essence in today’s financial world.</p>
<p>Artsgain, a Barcelona-based VC firm specializing in high-quality blue-chip investment funds featuring art, antiques, and collectibles from globally renowned artists, is excited to partner with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leading enterprise-tokenization platform, to make their vision of increasing liquidity for these one-of-a-kind assets a reality.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, art has been an exclusive asset class which can be attributed to its limited access and significant initial capital requirements, making it challenging for many to participate and even more frustrating knowing that the art market has been consistently outperforming many other asset classes.</p>
<p>In fact, since the year 2000, the art market, categorized by blue-chip artists’ performance, has statistically proven a higher return than popular indices like the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 by a multiple of 3x proving to be a great diversification strategy.</p>
<p>Artsgain is on a mission to transform the art market by offering tokenized shares, in order to improve liquidity and create a secondary market for its tokenized art securities. Their collaboration with Tokeny aims to simplify the investment process, guiding investors seamlessly into the world of blue-chip art.</p>
<p>By seamlessly integrating the open-source permissioned token standard ERC3643 via Tokeny’s platform, Artsgain not only assures regulatory compliance within the EU securities regulation framework under MiFID, but also fosters enhanced liquidity for art assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization allows for easier trading and transferability of art-related tokens, leading to improved liquidity in the market. The innovation offers new opportunities for shares in the art fund while maintaining compliance standards at the smart contract level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Artsgain emphasizes the ESG components of its operations: from transporting to managing artworks in a sustainable way, dedicated 0.3% of the funds to NGOs for disabled artists, and positive screening for women artists.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    We are excited to support Artsgain in the world of art investing with our cutting-edge software. Art, like technology, is an ever-evolving canvas of innovation and creativity. Our tokenization solution will empower them to navigate this intricate masterpiece, providing the tools they need to blend the brushstrokes of finance with the vibrant palette of the art world, creating a masterpiece of investment success.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny       Our intent is clear: we aim to be inclusive and environmentally conscious while providing unparalleled investment opportunities. The world of art has for too long been an enclave for a select few. By leveraging technology and our deep expertise in art, we are democratizing access, ensuring more people can appreciate, invest in, and benefit from these incredible assets.  Xavier OlivellaCEO of Artsgain

<p>A new study shows that organizations can enjoy a range of benefits by migrating — if they can overcome internal challenges</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early days of cloud adoption, organizations were understandably apprehensive. Many of the early adopters were particularly concerned about security, and tested the waters with non-essential apps that were easy to migrate and presented minimal risk. In the years since, with most organizations well into their cloud journeys, cloud migration has proven its value in material ways, enabling greater productivity, better customer engagement, lower costs, and improved efficiency. And it's strengthened security by moving visibility and control to anywhere users and data happen to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most would agree that identity and access management (IAM) is a critical component of a robust security ecosystem. So, it only makes sense that organizations would look to move IAM to the cloud as part of their overall digital transformation initiatives. Yet, many organizations remain hesitant to jump in and begin the process of migrating IAM systems to the cloud, despite its potential benefits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We set out to find out why with the help of Forrester.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result of this work is a custom study by Forrester Consulting in November 2023, commissioned by ForgeRock and Ping Identity and titled, "<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/cloud-migration-optimizes-identity-and-access-management">Cloud Migration Optimizes Identity and Access Management</a>."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study's purpose was to investigate the challenges that are holding organizations back from migrating IAM to the cloud. The survey also explored the benefits and opportunities awaiting those that embrace cloud IAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About the study 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The commissioned study queried organizations around the world with at least 5,000 employees to explore their concerns about migrating IAM systems and solutions to the cloud. It also sought to understand the perceptions of IAM administrators and security leaders about cloud migration, the potential benefits of embracing a move to the cloud, and how cloud migration impacts their success. Ultimately, it looked to help guide organizations considering a move to the cloud to create a plan for IAM cloud migration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Cloud IAM can help organizations achieve their objectives, so why aren't more adopting it? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations in all sectors face challenges related to demands for stronger security and better experiences for customers and employees. They're fielding requests for multi-factor authentication (MFA), including passwordless authentication, while navigating a complex web of regulations that vary by region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most, the answer may be cloud IAM. According to the survey, 86% of respondents indicate that fully migrating IAM to the cloud is important to their success. That number jumps to ninety-two percent for organizations using both workforce IAM and customer IAM (CIAM).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But despite broad interest in its benefits, organizations have been slow to make the move. According to Forrester, only 12% of organizations are fully embracing identity in the cloud.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 For many organizations, the culprit is internal 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The survey showed that organizations are having trouble overcoming the challenges with cloud migration, primarily in two areas: organizational barriers and complexity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the great advantages of cloud IAM technology is that it enables enterprises to transition from an on-premises IAM system to the cloud to deliver the agility, reliability, and scalability commonly associated with cloud technologies and services. But the complexity of legacy IAM ecosystems creates barriers to success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessing and managing existing infrastructure, including highly distributed identities, identifying integrations and incompatibilities between apps and cloud solutions, and realigning internal technologies to facilitate a move to the cloud represent arduous but critical tasks. Add to that organizational silos, including siloed IAM, and a lack of leadership support at the highest levels, and it's no wonder that the journey to the cloud for many organizations is an uphill battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What benefits await? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the challenges can be intimidating, the journey to the cloud offers a bounty of rewards that make the endeavor worthwhile. More than 60% of survey respondents indicate that successful migration can enhance security, including improving password security and enforcing Zero Trust security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud IAM also helps businesses deliver the kind of frictionless user experiences that attract, engage, and retain customers, and enhance employee engagement and productivity. Equally significant are the operational improvements offered by cloud migration, including reduced complexity in governance and management, improved agility to comply with regulations, and the freeing of resources normally burdened with these tasks — many of the manual — to focus on other activities that deliver greater business value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How can you move forward? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p></p><p>"What can you actually build with Web5?" This is one of the most common questions I've heard as I enter my two-month mark at TBD. It's one thing to discuss the theoretical aspects of Web5, with its focus on decentralization and user empowerment, but it's another to see tangible, innovative applications come to life. This is why builders, visionaries, and project maintainers at TBD are excited to showcase <a href="https://www.netonomy.io/">Netonomy</a>, a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/">Web5</a> project built by <a href="https://github.com/demattosanthony">Anthony Dimatteo</a>.</p> What is Netonomy?<a title="Direct link to What is Netonomy?">​</a> <p>Anthony describes Netonomy as "an application that allows users and organizations to own their digital identities, data, and finances." The goal is to give users a digital home for their identity, data, and assistants - all under their control and not dependent on centralized platforms. Netonomy leverages Web5 concepts for data management and storage, but it also incorporates artificial intelligence through vector databases. </p><p>Here's how it works from a user perspective: a user can upload any document, from developer documentation to rental insurance information. Then, the user asks an AI-powered chat assistant questions about details within the document, such as "When does my rental insurance expire?" Subsequently, the chat assistant would quickly search the document and respond to the user.</p> Which Web5 technologies does Netonomy use?<a title="Direct link to Which Web5 technologies does Netonomy use?">​</a> <p>Anthony used the following Web5 technologies to build Netonomy:</p>  <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> - The app generates a DID to identify you when you first launch it. This is stored in the browser and acts as your identity.  <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a> - A DWN is created in the browser to store your data encrypted securely. Anthony uses it to store uploaded files.   Future plans<a title="Direct link to Future plans">​</a> <p>There are many cool features Anthony wants to explore next, including:</p>  Decentralized vector databases - When you upload files like PDFs, the content is extracted and indexed in a vector database. Vectors allow data developers to embed data for meaning and quickly queried. The vector database is centralized, for now, hosted by Anthony. But he wants to eventually decentralize it by storing vectors directly in the DWN   Data sharing - Via protocols to share files with other DID owners  Payments - Integrate Bitcoin and blockchain payments  Contacts directory - Manage contacts via DIDs  Messages - Decentralized messaging between DWNs  Mobile app - Bundle DWN in a mobile app for access across devices   Check it out!<a title="Direct link to Check it out!">​</a> <p>To accelerate development, Anthony plans to open-source the project and invite community contributions. You can check out <a href="https://github.com/Netonomy/netonomy">Netonomy on GitHub</a>. </p> Rewatch the full episode<a title="Direct link to Rewatch the full episode">​</a> <p>Learn more about what he's building and watch the full live stream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ9Vq_Moa8I">here</a>.</p>

<p>The polarizing public discussion about ChatGPT and its siblings and the smokescreens of those responsible for technology and business behind the brands obscure a differentiated view on the non-obvious side effects of a completely overheated Chatbot rally. This makes it difficult to seriously address the partially mutually dependent side effects of the large-scale public use of this technology.</p>

<p>Employers in particular are torn between giving in to the tempting benefits of this technology while, at the same time, they have to live up to their responsibility towards the law, regulations such as ESG, their organizations and their digital assets, the society and the duty of care towards their employees. All of that without missing a beat of innovation in that field.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 31st October to 13th&nbsp;November <p>Welcome to our latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Turkey’s planned crypto regulations aimed at exiting the FATF grey list, the UK’s focus on stablecoins, New York’s task force on digital currencies, and the SEC’s call for clearer crypto rules. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> Emerging Global Trends in Crypto Regulation <p>The landscape of cryptocurrency regulation is undergoing significant changes worldwide, with countries and regulatory bodies adapting to the evolving digital asset&nbsp;market.</p><p>Turkey’s Regulatory Push: Turkey is moving towards introducing new legislation for crypto-assets. This step is aimed at strengthening anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts. The nation’s goal is to exit the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list,” indicating its commitment to addressing strategic deficiencies in its financial systems.</p><p>UK’s Stablecoin Focus: In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England are seeking public feedback on their approach to regulating stablecoins. They aim to balance the potential benefits of stablecoins for faster, cheaper payments with the need to protect consumers and maintain financial stability.</p><a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1722289568563531909?s=20">Image Source</a><p>New York’s Exploratory Task Force: New York is proposing a task force to study the impacts of digital currency and blockchain industries. This initiative aims to guide the state in addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities presented by these emerging technologies.</p><p>SEC’s Call for Clearer Crypto Rules: At the SEC Regulation Outside the United States conference, Commissioner Mart Uyeda stressed the importance of providing definitive rules and guidance for the cryptocurrency market rather than relying solely on enforcement actions. This stance highlights the ongoing debate over the classification and regulation of digital assets as securities.</p><p>These developments signify a global trend towards more structured and comprehensive cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks. As nations and regulatory bodies navigate this complex and dynamic field, the focus should remain on ensuring consumer protection, market integrity, and fostering responsible innovation within the digital asset ecosystem.</p> Turkish Government Proposes New Crypto Laws to Address FATF Compliance Gaps <p>Turkey is on a mission to revamp its stance on cryptocurrency regulation in a bid to shake off the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list” label, a designation underscoring the country’s previous shortcomings in anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) practices.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of addressing these critical areas, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has announced imminent legislative proposals targeting the crypto sector, marking a significant step towards aligning with 39 of the 40 FATF standards.</p> Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>Turkey’s push to strengthen AML and CTF regulations in the crypto sector could greatly enhance investor confidence, making the market safer and more attractive for investment. Additionally, aligning with FATF standards may ease Turkey’s integration into the global crypto economy, allowing for smoother international crypto transactions and partnerships.</p><p>On the flip side, the upcoming legislative changes could also bring a wave of uncertainty for crypto businesses operating in Turkey, as the specifics remain unclear. This could create challenges in compliance and strategic planning. Furthermore, the new laws might impose rigorous compliance requirements on crypto entities, potentially stifling innovation and adding to operational costs.</p><p>Overall, as Turkey advances toward legal reform, the global financial and crypto communities remain watchful. The outcome of these regulations will not only influence Turkey’s financial standing but also set a precedent for how emerging markets should navigate the intricate balance between innovation and regulatory compliance in the digital asset&nbsp;space.</p> New York State Senate Pushes for Crypto Task&nbsp;Force <p>In a significant move, New York State Senate Banking Committee Chair James Sanders is advocating for a proactive approach towards digital currency, cryptocurrency, and blockchain industries. Sanders proposes a 16-member task force, appointed by the governor and the Legislature, to comprehensively study these sectors. This includes examining their impacts on state tax revenues, energy consumption, and the environmental implications of digital&nbsp;mining.</p><p>Mike Lomas of the Financial Guys supports minimal regulation in general but suggests more oversight in the crypto sphere, especially for currencies not traded on public exchanges. Drawing parallels with the dot-com bubble, Lomas advocates for federal rather than state-level regulation, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding investments and banking stability.</p> Positive Aspects: <p>New York’s approach, characterized by forward-thinking, can catalyze enhanced comprehension and regulation of digital currencies. This initiative positions New York potentially as a frontrunner in the evolving crypto industry. With its balanced perspective, the Task Force strives to marry regulatory needs with the acknowledgment of the burgeoning industry’s potential, thereby nurturing responsible growth within this&nbsp;domain.</p> Negative Aspects: <p>However, the path toward new regulations may breed uncertainty among crypto businesses and investors. This could translate into a temporary deceleration in market dynamics within New York. Additionally, there lies a risk of potential overregulation.</p><p>An overly cautious regulatory approach could echo the apprehensions reminiscent of the dot-com era, inadvertently stifling innovation in the crypto sector. Such a scenario might prompt crypto businesses to migrate to jurisdictions with more accommodating regulatory landscapes.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/five-must-have-attributes-for-your-travel-rule-solution">Five Must-Have Attributes for Your Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/decoding-fatf-travel-rule-solution-pricing-your-ultimate-guide-to-compliance-costs">Decoding FATF Travel Rule Solution Pricing: Your Ultimate Guide to Compliance Costs</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p>Every organization, regardless of size or industry, needs an agile and modern Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform. As the cybersecurity threat landscape continues to evolve, so do the requirements for IAM. Managing identities and access is essential to ensure that only the right people have access to the right resources at the right time for the right reasons. However, the transition to a modern IAM solution will be smoother and more secure if the basic components of Zero Trust are implemented first, such as SSO, MFA, and dynamic authentication and authorization policies. TrustBuilder’s fine-grained access control and flexible authentication methods provide customers with a scalable solution that caters to the needs of organizations seeking to implement a Zero Trust security model.
