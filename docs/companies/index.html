Google announced plans in January 2020 to end support for third-party cookies, which fuel much of the digital advertising ecosystem, in its Chrome browser within two&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-privacy-pr-move-the-informations-tech-briefing">The Information’s briefing</a> is a bit skeptical:</p><blockquote>For one thing, there was little real “news” here. The online ad giant announced the main part of this a year ago. Today’s announcement was a follow-up, confirming that a particular kind of digital ad targeting is likely to die. More to the point, the impact of Google’s new approach is much more limited than people might realize. When you’re within Google’s walls — on search, YouTube or maps — you can still be tracked. That’s true for Apple, which helped kick off this privacy push but is also building its own ad-sales business on the App Store and Apple News, as well as other ad-based platforms like Snap or Pinterest. All of those platforms will still have detailed pictures of their users’ activities, which they can deploy in selling&nbsp;ads.</blockquote><blockquote>Yes, it will be harder for anyone to build a profile of you based on your cross-web browsing habits. So for instance, in the future your search on a recipe website may not lead to a related ad being shown to you when you’re on a news site. But Google could still use your search activity to target YouTube ads at you. Is one necessarily worse than the&nbsp;other?</blockquote><p>What’s undeniable is the impact this will have on the ad industry. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-to-stop-tracking-individuals-web-browsing-precision-ad-targeting-2021-3">BI</a>:</p><blockquote>While Google acknowledged that other providers may continue to offer advertisers the ability to track individuals across the web, its decision could still upend the digital advertising industry, which has long relied on these types of tracking technologies.</blockquote><blockquote>Temkin said that Google believes these types of tracking methods don’t “meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren’t a sustainable long term investment.”</blockquote><blockquote>The plans throw a wrench into advertising-industry efforts to create cookieless “universal identifiers” that use more privacy-conscious methods of user tracking, such as encrypted email addresses or login information. Shares in The Trade Desk, which created the Unified ID 2.0, for example, were trading down more than 7% on Wednesday morning.</blockquote><blockquote>Google’s rivals and other participants in the advertising ecosystem have been watching Google’s moves closely. The UK’s competition regulator is even investigating a complaint from an advertising-industry group alleging that Google’s decision to remove third-party cookies from Chrome and replace them with technologies from its Privacy Sandbox would limit competition in the digital ad market. Other companies have been adding feedback and discussing their own proposals for cookie alternatives in subcommittees of the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, a key web-standards group.</blockquote><p>And as <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> notes, this is awesome validation for GlobaliD’s vision:</p><blockquote>This is really big news. It’s the end of an era when it comes to monetizing with tracking. This is Google admitting they will change their model, paving the way for identities and control around your own data. Apple already won that battle with Facebook. And now Facebook will lose another fight with Google/Android.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/technology/tim-wu-white-house.html">A Leading Critic of Big Tech Will Join the White&nbsp;House</a>  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-investigates-apple-over-suspected-anti-competitive-behaviour">CMA investigates Apple over suspected anti-competitive behaviour</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-d1b78a14-7eb5-4737-9310-fd707cbf7b08.html">Arizona’s crusade against app&nbsp;stores</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-privacy-pr-move-the-informations-tech-briefing">Google’s Privacy PR Move: The Information’s Tech&nbsp;Briefing</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebooks-1-billion-kustomer-acquisition-faces-extensive-antitrust-review">Facebook’s $1 Billion Kustomer Acquisition Faces Extensive Antitrust Review</a>   3. Ripple’s latest response to the&nbsp;SEC. <p>Here’s <a href="https://ripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/51-Answer-of-Def.-Ripple-Labs-Inc.-to-Pls.-FAC.pdf">the latest</a>. Greg’s&nbsp;take:</p><blockquote>Ripple’s well reasoned response (read pg 1–8) to the SEC complaint. The logic is crystal clear: If a fiance receives a diamond ring for an engagement, they don’t mistakenly believe that their lover has given them an investment in the De Beers diamond mining company. A diamond is NOT an investment contract with De Beers. Nor is XRP an investment contract with&nbsp;Ripple.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC’s pretense that they are protecting investors or fostering capital formation by destroying the very things that Congress invoked them to defend is a caricature of what has gone amiss with the administrative state. Hopefully justice will be done with clarity for all other worthy blockchain endeavors.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchanges-discussed-xrps-status-with-sec-ahead-of-listings-ripple-says">Ripple: Exchanges Checked XRP Status With SEC Before Listing — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/ripple-wants-in-on-central-bank-digital-currencies-cbdc/">Ripple wants in on Central Bank Digital Currencies — Ledger Insights — enterprise blockchain</a>   4. What we can learn from China about the creator&nbsp;economy. <p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-china-embraced-the-creator-economy-before-the-west-did">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Executives at Facebook, Twitter and Snap recently realized that if they don’t help the people who produce videos and other content for their apps make money, these creators will take their talents, fans and potential revenue streams somewhere else.</blockquote><blockquote>In China, mobile video apps figured that out six years ago. That’s when Kuaishou, which started as an app for teenagers uploading 8-second videos to share with friends, overhauled its product so the teens could also stream themselves live and be paid directly by their fans via tips. That move propelled Kuaishou (pronounced “kwai-show”) to a public market capitalization of $170 billion after an initial public offering in Hong Kong last month. Hurst Lin, a venture capitalist who sits on Kuaishou’s board and whose firm’s early $40 million investment in the company is now worth around $15 billion, told The Information in an extended interview that Kuaishou’s move to tipping wouldn’t have happened if not for a desire for “revenge” against a&nbsp;rival.</blockquote><blockquote>Necessity also drove the direct-payment model. At the time, China’s online advertising market was still too small to support mobile video apps, let alone individual content creators. And the idea of tipping performers who stream themselves live was pioneered in China before the smartphone era by a company previously known as&nbsp;YY.</blockquote><blockquote>When Lin’s VC firm DCM first invested in Kuaishou in 2014 at a $60 million pre-money valuation, “we had no idea if Kuaishou was going to have any commercial value,” he said. The teens who used it at the time mostly hailed from China’s smaller, less affluent cities. But the app’s daily active users have since grown by at least 30 times to 300&nbsp;million.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-china-embraced-the-creator-economy-before-the-west-did">Why China Embraced the Creator Economy Before the West&nbsp;Did</a>   5.

Given that Square has a growing cryptocurrency business via Cash App, and has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into bitcoin itself. If there is space in the market for Square to bring music-based NFTs to its larger consumer user base is an interesting question. If the answer is yes, Square could now be in a leading position to create that&nbsp;market.”</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z">Jack Dorsey’s Square, Inc. is buying a majority stake in Jay-Z’s streaming service&nbsp;Tidal</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/collectibles-crypto-nfts-and-the-monetization-of-influence">Collectibles, Crypto NFTs, and the Monetization of Influence</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nyan-dogecoin-nft-foundation-chris-torres">Nyan Dogecoin NFT Fetches $69K in ETH — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/twitter-tests-new-e-commerce-features-for-tweets/">Twitter tests new e-commerce features for tweets — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/kings-of-leon-to-release-new-album-as-nft-with-tokenized-tickets-for-superfans">Kings of Leon to Release New Album as NFT With Tokenized Tickets for Superfans</a>   6.

It is hard to argue that the current day Internet isn’t the best it can be. However bad it is, we can fix it and make it a healthy digital space. That is the objective of the&nbsp;<a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/">Public Data Spaces Conference</a>: to foster cooperation between organisations and developers to tackle the task of making the Internet a better, safer and more collaborative place.




 




“<a href="https://publicspaces.net/timetable/event/building-connections/">Building Connections</a>” is one of the sessions at the conference that will explore these important themes. Given so many initiatives exist that form a part of what we need, such as Redecentralize network, MyData Global, Mozilla, CC, how do we best connect?




 




How do we create a ‘network of networks’ where people are able to find their complement and find what they need?&nbsp;<br><br>How do we evaluate what is relevant and what isn’t?&nbsp;<br><br>What are the best ways of working together and building on each other’s work?&nbsp;<br><br>A panel moderated by&nbsp;<a href="https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/speakers/sander-van-der-waal/">Sander van der Waal</a>&nbsp;(Waag) will provide the opportunity to discuss and address these important questions and will include the following:&nbsp;

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a> is also a member of the <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> Board, and active member of the community since its formation. <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is also a founding member of <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org">Data Sovereignty Now</a>, as is MyData. <br><br>As a result, Katryna brings a unique cross community perspective on how common goals and shared values bring people and organisations together.&nbsp;




 




MyData Global is an award-winning international non-profit. The purpose of MyData Global is to&nbsp;empower individuals by improving their right to self-determination regarding their personal data. It is based on the&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/declaration/">MyData Declaration</a>.




 




MyData Global&nbsp;has over 100&nbsp;<a href="https://mydata.org/list-of-organisational-members/">organisation members</a>&nbsp;and close to 400 individual members from over 40 countries, on six continents, facilitating the 2000+ strong MyData Global community working on the ethical use of personal data. MyData is both an alternate vision and guiding set of technical principles.




 




<a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org/">Data Sovereignty Now</a>&nbsp;is a relatively new initiative. It was formed in late 2020 through a coalition of leading Europe-based technology companies, research institutions and not-for-profit organisations. The goal in joining forces is to enable a more equitable digital economy. Both Meeco and MyData Global&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/new-coalition-launches-campaign-for-data-sovereignty-now/">are founding members</a>, demonstrating the power of aligned collaboration.&nbsp;

 Freedom, Privacy and the Covid Pandemic 
<blockquote><p>How do you provide your populace with freedom whilst you’re still controlling the pandemic? Well, we now have technology around for that and unfortunately still they’re absolutely right. Have you got COVID? The question is have you been in contact with someone, do you have symptoms? As easy as that, how are they doing this at the moment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Write on a piece of paper when you get to the place, use no we can’t do that, that’s not the right way todo it, let’s let’s use an app so they, belatedly a lot of countries have an app but those apps are centralised, taking data on people and they were rejected. So what we found is proliferation of those devices was especially in the UK, the centralised version the UK came out with was rejected by the public and didn’t get any uptake and it wasn’t illegal not to have it, it was seemed to be a duty but unless you’re in some of the more authoritarian countries where actually it is illegal then you must do it, otherwise wouldn’t turn you, there wasn’t that uptake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you need to do is provide technology which doesn’t infringe on the civil liberties, IE. a decentralised system but provide technology which will be give you the ability to move around, so a freedom pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now imagine the pass and this is what BLOK Solutions have been trying to provide through BLOK bias science and the and the BLOK pass, a decentralised freedom pass that you can use and say I haven’t got COVID, whether that’s a vaccination or whatever and you can use it not only to go into work you can use it also to get in to the cinema you can use it to get on the bus, you can use it if you’re a teacher to say, actually I’m free of this and I should be able to teach my children or conversely that the people around you, the teachers working around you have been scanned and they have a passporting system which is providing privacy to the individual but providing protection to the community from the pandemic and those tools are now available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				  When we eventually look back at the legacy of Covid-19, what technological change will we see? What’s happening now that will define the coming decade?&nbsp;  
			   
				
				
				 <p>When it became apparent that Covid-19 would scale to a problem of world historical proportions, speculation immediately turned to its legacy. Pandemics are agents of change, and in our mass adaptation to new challenges, we would quickly discard practices and processes whose rationale for existing conflicted with immediate needs; we would adapt new technologies to wider use; we would innovate.</p>
<p>While the legacy of Covid-19 is a work in progress, we can identify a strong signal of systemic change that the pandemic has accelerated: decentralization.</p>
<p>Decentralization was quickly normed as a logistical necessity for business, as company offices became no-go areas and workers were forced to recreate their jobs from their kitchens and spare rooms. While this created new problems—rickety VPNs were not up to the task of connecting administrators and developers to their work or providing robust network security—the big “surprise” was that productivity didn’t fall off a cliff; it turned out that many workers were more productive from home because they were spending more time working.</p>
<p>Yes, hours and hours of Zoom meetings weren’t and aren’t necessarily fun, and for some tasks being in a room with colleagues is vastly more efficient; but teleconferencing wasn’t a radically new concept that required a new set of processes to master (where failure occurred, it was more a question of forgetting to follow old norms, like putting on your pants). People had the equipment they needed—computers and phones—if not quite the network infrastructure to connect them; but they adapted to significant behavioral change because the technology made it relatively easy for them to do so. Offices will return because business has social drivers; but the future looks like it will offer far more decentralized work opportunities than before.</p>
<p>This is a massive behavioral and economic shift, at least for information workers. The commute, the clock-in, the be-seen-to-be-sitting-at-your-desk paradigm is over. It now looks unnecessary, expensive, and inefficient. It didn’t measure the right things in terms of productivity—and we have a massive natural experiment to prove that against—what?—a commonly shared intuition that if you weren’t watching your workers they would skive off. Working from home will, of course, create a new set of problems, and some will be solved by being in a social work setting some of the time. But we think differently now because different now works better.</p>
<p>These shifts in the way we live seem to happen all of a sudden and yet with little fuss, perhaps because the underlying principles, the big ideas as tectonic plates, have been grinding away beneath our feet for a long time, creating lots of small shockwaves and incrementally triggering us to do things differently. And when you start thinking about decentralization, you begin to see its inexorable force everywhere. What is a 401k except a decentralized retirement mechanism? People once relied on a single company pension; now they rely on returns from many companies. Uber decentralized taxi services; AirBnB decentralized hospitality; both decentralized trust because the aggregate rating of all or many users is more likely to be trustworthy than a single rating or small number of ratings.</p>
<p>Much as the poet Yeats wondered how to tell the dancer from the dance, it is difficult to separate the idea of decentralization from the technology to implement it. It is hard to imagine how to decentralize a currency without a blockchain. Needs drive technology—but technological innovation creates opportunities to solve problems and to do things that were once unimaginable.</p>
<p>In this, decentralization’s frontier is identity. And we have finally reached it. Decentralized identity answers the question “how can we use the many to authenticate the one?” In this case, the many is a complex stack composed of distributed ledger networks, communications protocols, cryptographic keys, and apps; the one is you or some fact about you that you want to prove to someone else, identity.</p>
<p>Online, we’ve been living with centralized identity since the birth of the Internet. We create an identity profile and a password to access it, and someone else holds that information and—to try and prevent identity fraud—other facts about you. The more valuable the service you access, the more of your identity you have to hand over to continually prove you are who you say you are. The failures of this way of doing things are legion, from data hacks to abuse of privacy.</p>
<p>But much as a company staff that doesn’t need to all show up in the same physical space to work, decentralized identity means the attributes that we use to prove our identity don’t all need to show up in a central data silo to verify that we are who we say we are. This is possible because the content of an identity (such as the personal information about you in a passport) doesn’t need to literally stand for the form of that identity (the passport itself). The technology enables the form and ownership of the passport to be verified without the need to access the content. This means that decentralized identity is able to create uniqueness out of an otherwise infinitely copyable digital world.</p>
<p>Conceptually, that’s an enormous shift—no more passwords, profiles, or third-party storage. Every interaction involving identity can be direct, unique, and verifiable. And at the front end, it requires no technological heavy lifting. It may be tough to understand at the back end, but it is experienced by the user through forms and behavior that will be familiar and intuitive to anyone who uses apps or instant messaging.</p>
<p>If Covid-19 drove the decentralization of our working selves, that work is now driving the need for decentralized identity. One of the biggest technical headaches in managing a decentralized workforce is identity management—or, “is our remote workforce really who they say they are when they log on?” This challenge is driving adoption of zero-trust security practices, which require continuous identity verification for access to a network. What makes such verification easy? Decentralized verifiable credentials (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAT85zebRLM&amp;list=LLtwBqR2xCF583_xVy4isxSQ&amp;index=2&amp;t=2202s" title="The Future of Privacy and Security: Decentralized Identity and Zero Trust">Listen</a> to Indicio.tech CEO Heather Dahl discuss decentralized identity and zero trust with Chase Cunningham, Chief Strategy Officer of Eircom Software at a recent Washington DC Hyperledger Meetup).</p>
<p>With zero trust becoming the dominant paradigm in cybersecurity (a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/insights-zero-trust-network-security/" title="Current state of Zero Trust">recent</a> Forrester survey for Cloudflare found that 80 percent of security leaders said their organizations were committed to adopting zero trust), expect to see verifiable digital credentials increasingly employed to manage workforces—and then be adapted to manage other complex processes, services, and products.</p>
<p>More obviously, expect to see decentralized identity provide a compelling solution to the current dilemma over Covid-19 test or vaccine “passes” for travel. While a specific vaccine pass raises issues over social equity and liberty, the immediate and compelling value proposition of a decentralized Covid-19 test credential is that it enables health provider information to be directly sent to and held by an individual without any need for a third party to store it or manage it.</p>
<p>This eliminates the problem of health data privacy regulation. And because the credential’s form—its specifications and the unique way it proves ownership—are written to a blockchain, it is virtually impossible to forge or tamper with the contents. The user gets to decide who they share their data with—be it a border official or an airline or a restaurant—and it can be as easy as presenting a QR code for a negative test. The back-end infrastructure does all the authentication.</p>
<p>Think about what this means: Companies don’t have to store personal data to make identity verification work. The risk for being out of compliance with GDPR and other data privacy law disappears. People have a way to prove that they have been tested or vaccinated without giving their data to a tech giant.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity will make our increasingly decentralized lives easier. Or maybe our decentralized lives will make decentralized identity easier. Or both. Either way, this big idea is happening now.</p>

<p>This is the second in a series of blogs providing edited extracts of key points made by Mydex CIC in its response to the UK Government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">consultation around a new National Data Strategy</a>. The first one addressed the question “<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">how to unleash the full potential of&nbsp;data?</a>”</p><p>To catch up on progress on our Macmillan My Data Store Pilot <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The central plank of Mydex CIC’s consultation response is that the UK needs to build a new layer of data logistics infrastructure that:</p>  Includes citizens in the workings of the data economy, empowering them with the ability to collect, store, use and share data about themselves independently of any data controllers they may have data relationships with.  To achieve this, the Government needs to ensure that every citizen is provided with their own personal data store, which enables citizens to collect, store, share and use their own data, under their own control, for their own purposes, independently of any organisation that may have collected data about&nbsp;them.  These personal data stores should be designed to act as neutral, enabling nodes in a vibrant data sharing network, whereby citizens can obtain copies of their data held by organisations and can forward relevant elements of this data (such as Verified Attributes) to other data users under their control, as and when beneficial and necessary.  <p>Such a citizen empowering data logistics infrastructure is key to enabling <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">a MUMU data economy to grow</a>: one where the right personal data can flow to and from the right parties at the right times, in ways that protects citizens’ privacy and make them active participants in service provision.</p> Benefits of the new personal data infrastructure <p>Ensuring every citizen is provided with their own personal data store would <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/killing-many-birds-with-one-stone-6dc5ae40c556">kill many birds with one stone</a>. Specifically, it&nbsp;would:</p>  Enable order of magnitude reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost for both bona fide service providers and&nbsp;citizens  Ensure built-in privacy and data protection for all processes involving the collection and use of personal&nbsp;data  Ensure built-in fair pre-distribution of power and rewards relating to the collection and use of personal data, resulting in inclusive economic growth, enabling social inclusion and helping to tackle the digital divide and ‘poverty&nbsp;premium’  Act as a platform for innovation, enhancing capabilities, capacity and flexibility   Cutting costs <p>The most compelling immediate reason to introduce personal data stores is their cost-cutting potential.</p><p>By enabling citizens to easily, safely and securely obtain electronic copies of data held about them by organisations (as per the data portability provisions of GDPR/Data Protection Act) a personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure would enable data ecosystems to move from ‘make afresh every time’ to ‘make once use many times’ modes of operation.</p><p>Under the current organisation-centric system, if an organisation needs to know something about an individual it has to obtain the necessary information for itself, even though another organisation might have already obtained the same information. Very often, organisations don’t need the actual information itself: they just need confirmation that a particular piece of information is valid, up-to-date and correct (e.g. that an individual is over 18, lives at a particular address, has a valid driving licence, has passed certain exams, is entitlement to certain benefits, etc).</p><p>Responsible organisations that have already checked information can easily and cheaply generate secure electronic tokens verifying these bits of information. These are called <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">‘Verified Attributes’</a>. Enabling this information to be ported to a personal data store and forwarded to other service providers, would eliminate vast amounts of duplicated effort for both service providers and service users, significantly reducing the time, money and effort they invest in collating and confirming the data they&nbsp;need.</p><p>The Scottish Government has already successfully conducted tests to confirm the technical viability of such a process in its <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Attribute-Prototype-Report-new.pdf">Verified Attribute prototype</a>. The prototype</p><blockquote>“enables public sector organisations to provide individuals with verified attributes, for individuals to store these attributes in their own Attribute Store, and for these individuals to be able to share these attributes with other public sector service providers as and when&nbsp;needed.”</blockquote><p>Because of the way these verified attributes work (using secure API links) other parties can rely on the accuracy and provenance of this data without having to undertake their own checking processes or asking citizens to fill out yet another form. (Some people say that such a process cannot work, asking who takes liability if a piece of shared data happens to be wrong. In fact, relying on data provided by other people happens in multiple processes all the time without any liability model. Whether to accept the information is down to the user’s own assessments of related&nbsp;risk.)</p><p>By enabling the sharing of Verified Attributes and other data, personal data stores render many previously essential data processing tasks unnecessary (thereby freeing up time and resources) while enabling service providers to access more, better quality data, more quickly. The potential power of this approach is demonstrated by the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/10/Smart-Entitlements-Research-Recommendations-and-Report-for-the-Scottish-Government-FINAL.pdf">Scottish Government’s work on ‘smart entitlements’</a> which examines just how big the opportunity is and how to realise&nbsp;it.</p><p>The sharing of verified attributes also cracks the problem of online identity: an ‘identity’ is simply an accepted collection of verified attributes.</p> Built-in privacy and data protection <p>It is now universally accepted that citizens should be able to assert more control over how their data is collected and used. Compliance with new data protection regulations remains a major challenge. By creating mechanisms that ensure that personal data is shared and used by the citizens whose data it is, a new personal data store based data logistics infrastructure would ensure privacy and data protection by&nbsp;default.</p><p>A failure to build such citizen empowering personal data infrastructure can only result in ‘more of the same’ problems.</p> Rebalancing the workings of the data&nbsp;economy <p>It is now widely recognised that status-quo approaches to the collection and use of personal data have resulted in huge competition- and growth-restricting, unfair and socially divisive imbalances of power and reward. There is now ongoing debate as to how to ‘fix big tech’ with the UK’s Competition and Market Authority recommending the creation of a new Digital Markets Unit to curb the power of big tech data monopolies.</p><p>While regulatory intervention is part of the answer, regulation alone can not do the job. We also need to embed new, fairer ways of working into day-to-day data management practices. Providing every citizen with a personal data store achieves this, ensuring fair pre-distribution of power over personal data and resulting rewards.</p><p>The Financial Times recently observed much effort is now going into ‘fixing big tech’.&nbsp;But:</p><blockquote>“The real game-changer would be if Europe could pioneer the creation of a radically different and more decentralised data economy.”</blockquote><p>A personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure would achieve this decentralisation.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1N9kVpPWT48YZFFx3uBEU_xcrt20YLaFi">The Future of Citizen Data Systems</a> report by the Government Office for Science, notes research that using such an approach may be closest to economically optimal, citing an economic modelling study&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>“investigated how different models of data control could affect how far data is shared when consumers prioritise both their privacy and gains from use of their data. A scenario where consumers control their use of data was closest to optimal, with maximised benefits from data sharing and privacy. Consumers kept some data private, but shared other data with many more organisations and companies, compared to a scenario where firms controlled data.”</blockquote><p>One important aspect of this rebalancing is tackling the poverty premium. Currently, data exclusion is a major cause of social exclusion. Those with the greatest needs for access to services are also those who have to spend the greatest amounts of time, effort and money filling in application forms, trying to find data and prove credentials. By enabling individuals to build up banks of pre-verified facts about themselves — facts that they can reuse when applying for services — the new data infrastructure would go a long way to enabling social inclusion.</p> A platform for innovation <p>Organisations use data for many different purposes e.g. for the purposes of measurement, analysis, decision-making, operations planning, coordination and implementation, and administration to manage their operations better. Enabling individuals to do the same with their own data would open up a tidal wave of innovation.</p><p>Individuals should be able to collect, store and use their own data for the same purposes (of measurement, analysis, decision-making, operations planning, coordination and implementation, and administration) in order to manage their lives better. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-practical-vision-for-personal-data-empowerment-1d366ed792f">This applies across all ‘life departments’</a> whether it is managing a home and dealing with suppliers, making big financial decisions such as planning for retirement, coping with long-term illnesses such as diabetes or cancer, or advancing their education and&nbsp;careers.</p><p>Personal data stores enable service innovation in such areas by enabling citizens to safely and efficiently combine data from many sources, and to add extra information about themselves (e.g. plans, preferences, goals) to build rich new-to-the-world person-centric data assets that weren’t possible before (because previously the data was dispersed across many different organisations).</p><p>The Government has already recognised some of this innovation potential with its Open Banking initiative. However, with Open Banking, data is ported from one organisation to another and never back to the individual whose data it is. This is a very restricted form of data portability which requires costly and heavy regulatory oversight and risks creating a complexity catastrophe as it tries to scale. It also actually reduces individuals’ control over their data. As individuals’ data gets spread across an increasing number of different organisations, it gets more and more difficult for individuals to keep tabs on their&nbsp;data.</p><p>In contrast, personal data stores allow a person’s data to be aggregated around that person, making it possible for service providers to gain permissioned access enhanced, enriched data sets to provide enhanced, enriched, personalised services. Given that this information is critical to service provision across every major sector of the economy including financial services, health, public administration, transport, education/skills development, housing and leisure, this has the potential to become a significant driver of innovation and economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Once every citizen has been provided with their own personal data store, the Government will have created personal data infrastructure with near infinite flexibility: the ability to handle any data for any purpose. With the infrastructure in place for example, when the Government introduces a new policy requiring access to data (as happened with the Covid pandemic) it can use the infrastructure to enable the right information to get to and from the right people at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>Given that companies like Mydex CIC have already built the infrastructure that is needed to achieve all the above, there is now no good reason why the UK Government cannot implement provision of this new infrastructure at&nbsp;speed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-we-need-new-nationwide-personal-data-infrastructure-56513fb6daf4">Why we need new, nationwide personal data infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology Monthly Report — February&nbsp;2021 <p>An Update from&nbsp;Ontology</p><p>February 2021</p><p>As interest in sustainable investing continues to surge, the risk of privacy and data breaches grows higher, as these relatively nascent investments may not have effective data management protocols in place. It is for this reason that the next big trend in sustainable investing will be data privacy and data management.

The integration of Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Solution into the Binance Smart Chain is the latest in our collaborative efforts. The symbiotic relationship sees Ontology and ONT ID as the sole partner for BSC in terms of providing a truly decentralized identity option and KYC user verification. Recently, Binance launched its “BSC” dashboard, which lists&nbsp;ONT.    Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was interviewed by CointelegraphCN and shared his thoughts on blockchain’s globalization. He was invited to speak at “Web 3.0 TALKS”, on the topic of Decentralized Identity. The discussion touched upon how Ontology is developing the building blocks for a better&nbsp;web.  Li Jun had two opinion articles published. See links&nbsp;below:  <p>— Global Banking and Finance: ‘<a href="https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/why-privacy-should-be-esg-investors-next-big-priority/">Why Privacy Should Be ESG Investors’ Next Big Priority</a>’</p><p>— Nasdaq: ‘<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/data-regulation-in-2021%3A-more-small-steps-or-a-giant-leap-2021-02-04">Data Regulation In 2021: More Small Steps Or A Giant&nbsp;Leap?</a>’.</p>  An original video called “Decoded Decentralized Identity” was uploaded by Ontology, to share our opinions about data and identity.  Our “ONTO Red Packets For You &amp; Me” campaign launched, which allowed users to send Red Packets on ONTO for a 10,000 ONG bonus. A two-week “Open ONTO with me” campaign was launched, which was a tremendous success and attracted nearly 1,000 users. ONTO supported Binance Blockchain Week’s online broadcast.

 The Basics <p>Verus is among the easiest cryptocurrencies to stake and earn rewards. Unlike many staking systems your Verus is completely accessible while it’s staking, it isn’t locked up, inaccessible, or out of your control in any way. You just have to flip a switch in your wallet to turn it on, and your Verus remains in your wallet the whole time, and can be spent at any&nbsp;time.</p><p>Verus uses a novel consensus mechanism called <a href="https://verus.io/technology/verus_proof_of_power">Proof-of-Power</a> (PoP) which is a hybrid half Proof-of-Work (PoW), half Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system. Half of the blocks are mined using VerusHash, and the other half are “minted” via staking. This means that both miners and stakers are doing the work to process transactions and secure the network, and that attackers would need BOTH a significant share of mining hash rate AND of the available supply of Verus (VRSC) to attack the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Every block has a chance of being won by staking, and over time it averages out that half of the blocks are solved by mining and half by staking. The average block time on Verus is 1 minute. If you stake a block you’ll get the block reward and any transaction fees paid by users to have their transactions processed. At the time of writing, the block reward is 12 VRSC, and there is a halving (the reward drops in half) approximately every two years, the last of which was in November&nbsp;2020.</p><p>The chances of staking and receiving a block reward for any given block are proportional to the amount of Verus you’re staking. There is no minimum amount of Verus required to stake, and any funds kept in a transparent address or a VerusID that have been there for at least 150 blocks (about 150 minutes) may be used to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Your wallet must be running, connected to the internet, and synced with the Verus blockchain with staking enabled in order to stake. Addresses/wallets should only be staked from a single computer. By default staking is disabled to prevent unintentionally staking from multiple computers or creating problems with accounting for staked funds when they’re not expected.</p> Staking Requirements <p>To stake successfully your wallet must meet these requirements:</p>  Funds held in one or more transparent addresses or VerusIDs in the&nbsp;wallet  Wallet is running, online, synced to the Verus blockchain on a system with an accurate system&nbsp;clock  Staking is enabled in the wallet&nbsp;software   Verus Desktop (GUI) Staking&nbsp;How-To <p>To enable staking in the Verus Desktop wallet you’ll open the wallet and go to the Mining tab. Here on the mining dashboard you can enable staking by clicking the icon of the dollar sign with the slash through&nbsp;it.</p><p>Or, from the mining dashboard you can click on Verus on the left side, then toggle staking on in the main interface.</p><p>That should get you staking. With staking enabled you’ll get a dashboard showing estimates for potential staking returns given the current network conditions.</p><p>You’ll know you’ve successfully staked when you see staking transactions and rewards in your transaction list, and when your balance goes up accordingly.</p> Verus Command Line (CLI) Staking&nbsp;How-To <p>You might prefer to use Verus on the command line, either to run on much lighter-weight hardware or headless systems, for the ability to script and integrate with Verus, or just for more granular control over your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>This assumes you are already familiar with the command line and have verusd running and have met the other prerequisites for being eligible to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>You can enable staking in a running wallet using this&nbsp;command:</p><blockquote>verus setgenerate true&nbsp;0</blockquote><p>This will turn your mining threads down to zero if you were mining. If you want to also re-enable solo mining you can follow this&nbsp;with:</p><blockquote>verus setgenerate true&nbsp;X</blockquote><p>where X is the number of threads you want to mine&nbsp;with.</p><p>You can disable staking AND mining&nbsp;using:</p><blockquote>verus setgenerate false</blockquote><p>You can get your current staking/mining status&nbsp;using:</p><blockquote>verus getmininginfo</blockquote><p>which will return something like&nbsp;this:</p><blockquote>{ <br> “blocks”: 1424603,<br> “currentblocksize”: 0,<br> “currentblocktx”: 0,<br> “averageblockfees”: 1.20011909,<br> “difficulty”: 1004965568496.515,<br> “stakingsupply”: 41243165.47632869,<br> “errors”: “”,<br> “genproclimit”: 0,<br> “localhashps”: 0,<br> “networkhashps”: 351834027116,<br> “pooledtx”: 1,<br> “testnet”: false,<br> “chain”: “main”,<br> “generate”: true,<br> “staking”: true,<br> “numthreads”: 0,<br> “mergemining”: 0<br>}</blockquote><p>The “stakingsupply” figure is an estimate of how much Verus has been staking on the whole network recently. Your approximate chances of staking any given block can be calculated by dividing your eligible staking balance (funds at least 150 blocks old in transparent addresses or IDs) by the staking&nbsp;supply.</p><p>To enable staking after verusd is restarted you can add the following to your VRSC.conf file:</p><blockquote>mint=1</blockquote><p>or pass -mint to verusd when launching it.</p> Enabling StakeGuard <p>StakeGuard is a system for <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e">solving the Nothing-at-Stake problem</a>. By configuring StakeGuard you have a chance of receiving the ill-gotten staking rewards from those who are trying to cheat the network (or potentially from those who make the mistake of staking their wallet from different computers at the same time, since the network can’t tell these two cases&nbsp;apart).</p><p>To enable StakeGuard on the Verus Desktop GUI go to the main wallet screen for Verus and click the green Receive button under Private Balance. Then click the copy icon for an address you’d like your StakeGuard proceeds to go to. If you don’t yet have a private address, click the “new private address”&nbsp;button.</p><p>With your private address copied, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to enter settings, then click on Coin Settings on the left. Make sure Verus(VRSC) is selected in the dropdown right below the settings icon. Then paste your private address into the StakeGuard address field and save your&nbsp;changes.</p><p>That’s it for the&nbsp;GUI.</p><p>To enable StakeGuard in the CLI wallet you’ll edit your VRSC.conf file and add a z-address in a line formatted like&nbsp;this:</p><blockquote>cheatcatcher=ZADDR</blockquote><p>or pass it as a parameter to verusd when launching using the parameter like&nbsp;so:</p><blockquote>-cheatcatcher=”ZADDR”</blockquote> UTXO Details <p>A few notes on some of the finer points of staking — you can ignore this part and do just fine with staking, but this might be useful to you if you’re looking for the slightly deeper&nbsp;dive.</p><p>The balance in your wallet is made up of the sum of the transactions that have been sent to an address or VerusID in your wallet that haven’t been spent. When you’re staking it is actually each individual unspent transaction output (UTXO) that’s eligible to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>When a UTXO stakes it is actually spent, being sent back to the same address again. This means it still shows up in your balance, but it becomes ineligible to stake again for 150 blocks. For the next 150 blocks after a stake you’ll notice that the value of the UTXO that staked will be missing from your eligible staking balance, but also notice that your other UTXOs remain eligible to stake during this&nbsp;period.</p><p>For this reason, if you’re staking a large balance you’ll likely have better staking performance by making sure your balance is split up between multiple UTXOs — by having sent it to the wallet in multiple transactions rather than a single large transaction or otherwise redistributing it within the wallet. This keeps a larger portion of your funds available for staking while the successful stakes have to wait 150 blocks to be available for staking again. There are quickly diminishing returns here though, and having too many small transactions can decrease your wallet’s efficiency in scanning all of them for eligible stakes. My recommendation is to not bother breaking up any UTXOs smaller than 5,000&nbsp;VRSC.</p><p>The odds of each individual UTXO staking are independent, and proportional to their value. This means that one 10,000VRSC UTXO has the same odds of staking as a group of ten 1,000VRSC UTXOs.</p> Verus Vault <p>Verus Vault will soon move from Testnet to the main Verus network. Verus Vault allows a VerusID to be locked and prevented from spending until it is unlocked and a specified cooldown time has passed or a specific block height is reached, or until the ID is revoked and recovered. Verus Vault allows the funds in a locked ID to stake, so users protecting their funds this way won’t miss out on staking opportunities.</p> Currencies and&nbsp;PBaaS <p>Also on the Verus Testnet right now is functionality for creating and trading using currencies. I recommend starting with this article on <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/vbasics-verus-defi-118da0b13f35">Verus DeFi</a> to understand more. It is mentioned here to make it clear that currencies on Verus will not be able to stake; only Verus can stake. Also, Verus that resides in the reserves (the liquidity pool) of a fractional currency is unable to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) chains have their own coin, which is mineable and/or stakeable on that chain, but not on the Verus network directly.</p> Fees and the Fee&nbsp;Pool <p>In addition to the block reward miners and stakers are rewarded with the fees users pay to have their transactions processed by the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Another Testnet feature that will soon migrate to the main Verus network is the fee pool. The fees that go to the miners and stakers (such as transaction fees, ID registration costs, and others) will go into the fee pool, and each miner or staker will get to take 1% of what is in the fee pool along with their block reward. This makes mining/staking proceeds from fees more stable over time, rather than having occasional blocks with high fees from high-fee events like ID registrations. It also helps align incentives by making sure no potentially malicious miner or staker might want to mine for a previous block if the fees were particularly lucrative, since those fees are averaged out over&nbsp;time.</p> Troubleshooting <p>If you believe you’re having problems with staking here are a few things to&nbsp;check:</p>  Check your eligible staking balance. Funds in a private address (z-address) aren’t eligible to stake. Also any funds received, transacted with, or staked within the last 150 blocks aren’t eligible. So keep these in mind when assessing your eligible balance. If there’s a discrepancy between your wallet balance and your eligible staking balance not explained by these considerations, there might be something to investigate with the help of the <a href="https://verus.io/discord">community-support or staking channels on the Verus&nbsp;Discord</a>.  Check to ensure that staking is enabled. If you’re using the command line wallet or if you want to look under the hood on the Verus Desktop wallet use the getmininginfo command to see that staking is enabled (“staking”:true) (on the CLI: verus getmininginfo&nbsp;; in the GUI wallet: Settings-&gt;Coin Settings, then run getmininginfo in the command&nbsp;window).  Check your system clock to make sure your time is accurate.  Check in with the community on the <a href="https://verus.io/discord">Verus Discord</a>. If you describe your issue in the community-support or staking channels they’ll be able to help, or can put your mind at&nbsp;ease.  <p>One point of confusion worth reviewing — staking on Verus doesn’t provide a steady trickle of proceeds, instead it is all-or-nothing, earning the full block reward plus fees each time, and the frequency with which you stake is based on the amount of Verus you have staking. It’s also all a matter of statistical averages, you may have lucky periods and dry spells, the specifics of when you stake and when you don’t are matters of utter randomness and should even out over long periods of time as a matter of averages. If you have a relatively small amount of Verus your staking rewards may be very infrequent, but there’s always a chance, and over a sufficiently long time there’s a good chance you’ll stake at some&nbsp;point.</p><p>Good luck and happy&nbsp;staking!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-beginners-staking-guide-efbbdc4de951">Verus Beginner’s Staking Guide</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Last month <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/2021-community-grants/">we announced</a> new community grants totaling 40 ETH toward the exploration, research and development across three important topics. We received an incredible number of submissions from our community and pored over numerous exciting and innovative ideas. While we wish we could fund all entries, after a careful review and selection process we have determined four project recipients for this year’s grants.</p><p>We are pleased to announce the following grant winners:</p> Research Grant: Token Economics <p>Award amount: 5 ETH | Winner: Omni Analytics</p><p>Omni Analytics is a data science company that performs research for several projects in the cryptocurrency industry, including the Ethereum Foundation, Numerai and Lykke Labs. They seek to link the attributes of a token’s initial distribution to their adoption as measured by on- chain metrics such as wallet total locked value and market capitalization. Utilizing data from across the blockchain they hope to find meaningful insights that can be used to guide and predict the future growth of decentralized protocols.</p><blockquote>We're excited to be partnering up with Bloom to unearth data driven insights into how a token's initial distribution will affect their market adoption in the short and medium term.</blockquote><p> - Lawrence</p> Research Grant: Token Economics <p>Award amount: 5 ETH | Winner: Square 1</p><p>Square 1 is a podcast and content series that aims to surface the design patterns present in today’s token networks, DAOs, decentralized products and communities. The platform seeks to create information that is insightful for crypto-natives and approachable for crypto-novices, alike. Square 1 has completed audits of MakerDAOs governance system and is continuing to focus on similar audits across a number of prominent platforms and DAOs within the community.</p><blockquote>I’m extremely encouraged and grateful for Bloom Network’s early support of Square 1. They’ve proven to be an amazing team to work with. </blockquote><p>– James Duncan</p> Build Grant: Unsecured Lending Vaults <p>Award amount: 20 ETH | Winner: Tilly Loan</p><p>Tilly Loan is an unsecured lending platform that leverages both on-chain and off-chain components to not only bring the value of DeFi to the real world but to democratize modern credit infrastructure for emerging markets. Tilly Loan is building an open banking platform in Africa, seeking to correct the many issues it has identified with how lending is performed throughout the region. The platform allows anyone to draw a credit line from an Aave credit delegation vault based on a risk assessment performed using the individual’s traditional financial data.</p><blockquote>The Bloom team brings a wealth of expertise in decentralized identity and credit infrastructure; the grant not only supports initial development of the platform but the mentorship and guidance is invaluable. </blockquote><p>– Victor Akinwande</p> Build Grant: Utility Experiments <p>Award amount: 10 ETH | Winner: Steven Yuan</p><p>Steven’s project aims to determine if a tokenized and decentralized identity platform like Bloom can help local governments build new tools to deter fraud and malicious actors from pushing their agenda in public meetings. As a remote-first lifestyle set about by the events related to COVID-19 allow everyday citizens to dial into government meetings, Steven’s project seeks to validate and incentivize good citizens to participate, while creating a medium to allow this at the government level.</p><blockquote>As a deep advocate for design thinking, I strongly believe that good research and critical thought into the problems that Bloom could potentially solve are the precursor to ensuring that the protocol will thrive in the future. This grant will help us thoroughly study the needs in this space, as well as set up incentivized experiments to determine if we are able to effectively address those needs. </blockquote><p>– Steven Yuan</p> Stay Tuned <p>We’re excited to see how these projects innovate in their respective fields and expand on their initial thesis. We intend to follow up and provide an update on our blog to keep our community informed on their progress and their eventual outcome. We also plan to do similar grants for other topics in the near future, especially as we see the space rapidly evolving with new and novel uses cases appearing overnight. These are exciting times for cryptocurrencies and the larger blockchain sector, and we envision the increased need for decentralized digital identity solutions in the near term and future.</p><p>Please email <a>grants@bloom.co</a> if you'd like an invite to our discord to collaborate with our community and stay up to date with the latest announcements.</p>

<p>This past Thursday March 4th we had the opportunity to hear from one of the industry’s youngest rising talents. Dylan Steck <a href="https://twitter.com/Dylan_Steck">@Dylan_Steck </a> is the creator of <a href="https://t.co/hOwfaKQ8oV?amp=1">Cortex</a>, an organization whose mission is creating what he calls valuable <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/tools-for-action-6475cf3343f1">Tools for Action</a>.</p> What are "Tools for Action"? <p>Tools for Action are implementations designed with the goal of helping people organize their thoughts, and ultimately their actions, in the same way a "Tool for Thought" does. Recently, we wrote about <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/zettelkasten-method-and-digital-notetaking/">Zettelkasten</a>, the Tool for Thought conceived by a prolific German academic that's been embraced by Roam Research enthusiasts (often dubbed the #RoamCult).</p><p>Dylan wants to take these existing Tools for Thought and build upon them to create new and effective action-oriented tools. A key part of Cortex’s mission is to prioritize the repurposing of existing tools. From the Cortex website:</p><blockquote>Cortex is a value-based technology organization. We want to reassemble tools to democratize knowledge and creation. All of the work that we do is led by a guiding thesis: we can re-purpose pre-existing tools to solve the easiest problems without starting from scratch.</blockquote><p>Between his interest in supporting portable and secure user data across the internet as well as empowering users to create without being encumbered by the burden of starting-from-scratch, Dylan is a natural friend of the Fission community. </p> Watch the video <p>Check out the video below where we hear from Dylan and get to see and hear what he’s working on first hand. There’s also a lively discussion after Dylan’s presentation where many members of the community chimed in on Dylan’s work and the future of Tools for Action. </p><p>Also be sure to stop by the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/cortex-tools-for-action-by-dylan-steck/1499">Fission forum</a> where we have a thread dedicated to the event and Dylan’s work with Cortex.</p> Weekly Fission Video Chats <p>Fission hosts weekly video chats with invited presenters. <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">View the upcoming events and register to join us »</a></p><p></p>

<p>In five minutes, anyone can have a Ghost blog up and running, with media uploads hosted on IPFS thanks to Fission.</p><p></p>
<p>Thinking of starting a Ghost blog but leaning towards "nah, too much work"?</p><p>Here's how you do it with <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/heroku-ipfs-ghost">Fission's Ghost Blog Starter</a>: click a button, choose a URL, watch a couple of spinners do their thing, and voilà: a production-ready Ghost blog instance is live on Heroku in less than 5 minutes.</p><p>Best of all? Image and video uploads—which aren't supported by default on Heroku due to its read-only filesystem—are built-in and work seamlessly. The <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/interplanetary-fission">Fission Heroku Add-on</a> takes care of everything without intervention, creating a new Fission account for your blog, handling media uploads, and serving those assets for you on HTTPS and on the peer-to-peer IPFS network.</p> Going Headless <p>Ghost is a great platform for authors, with almost a decade of accumulated improvements in user experience.</p><p>One shortcoming though is that it doesn't scale beyond a single server:</p><blockquote>Ghost doesn’t support load-balanced clustering or multi-server setups of any description, there should only be one Ghost instance per site.<br>— <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/faq/clustering-sharding-multi-server/">Ghost documentation</a></blockquote><p>Caching pages and serving them via a content delivery network (CDN) is one way to mitigate this. But if content has to be turned into static files and served from the edge anyway, why not go a step further and decouple Ghost, the authoring interface, from the code that generates those files based on the content?</p><p>That's the Headless CMS approach, where a <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generator</a> pulls the content from the content management system and builds the pages that can be served super-fast at scale at the edge. This opens up the possibility to tap into a rich ecosystem of frontend development tools and components (like React and others) for a much richer content experience, along with security and performance benefits.</p><p>On a previous post, we described how we're moving our own blog to a <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/headless-ghost-blog-fission/">Headless Ghost + Next.js</a> setup. This allows us not only to make the best out of what the frontend can do, but also to showcase how Fission enables personalization at the edge, something that used to be possible only with dynamically-rendered server-hosted websites.</p><p>By using our <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/heroku-ipfs-ghost">Ghost blog starter</a>, you can try this setup for yourself and follow along as we continue to share tools, process, and lessons on our own path to a webnative publishing experience.</p>

 Irene Adamski, Blockchain Expert at German Blockchain Association and Bundesblock, on Self-Sovereign Identity <p>In the eleventh episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we had a conversation with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ireneadamski/?originalSubdomain=de">Irene Adamski,</a> General Secretary, German Blockchain Association, Bundesblock. Irene is responsible for Partnership Development &amp; Regulatory Affairs at <a href="https://jolocom.io/about/">JOLOCOM</a>, a Berlin-based company that focuses on developing Self-Sovereign Identity solutions. During this discussion, she explains the relationship between digital identities and self-sovereign identity, how it can help citizens across the globe, and the role of big tech in creating digital identity solutions. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> What is a Digital Identity, and how can it be decentralized? <p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/digital-identification-a-key-to-inclusive-growth#">A 2019 report by</a> McKinsey states that Digital identification, or “digital ID,” can be authenticated unambiguously through a digital channel, unlocking access to banking, government benefits, education, and many other critical services. The risks and potential for misuse of digital ID are real and deserve careful attention. When well-designed, digital ID enables civic and social empowerment and makes possible real and inclusive economic gains — a less well-understood aspect of the technology.</p><p>Irene mentions that Identity is something that can go into a vast context. As a digital concept, it is a lot more about actual specificity. Everyone knows the idea: one person, one vote, and which is one of the central tenets about how we have started to arrange society and to live together with each other. But with the digital sphere, we are now in an age where you cannot be 100% certain that the person or the entities you are interacting with right now is actually:</p>  A) a&nbsp;person  B) a person distinct from the other&nbsp;one  <p>The question is, what do you want to trust? So, in the digital sphere, how can we be sure that we identify the correct person and an actual human being as a&nbsp;person?</p><p>“How do we make sure that we can stay true to this idea of one person, one voice in the internet age? Can this be decentralized? Yes, it can. And I believe it must because otherwise, it’s tough to get back to this one person, one voice, one vote, kind of idea we are striving for,” probes&nbsp;Irene.</p><p>“Digital identity is something we all have with online banking, with logging into different accounts, whether social media or via the service platform. How to decentralize is the question at the moment. We are seeing many platforms holding our account information and ensuring that data stays private and that there is no leak and that they are handling it appropriately and just be working so far, but we see more and more problems.”</p><blockquote>The idea is to have a decentralized autonomous identity where we can have our data’s power, while the data we are generating online is to basically go into something that we are also slightly familiar with from the physical world. And that is a division of power. This is where the idea of Self-Sovereign Identity comes into as a&nbsp;concept.</blockquote> Do Digital Identities solve socio-economic problems? <p>Digital identities are already helping in certain areas but are not fully decentralized. “ For example, the app I have for the train service in Germany, the Deutsche Bahn — I can get updated information about my tickets, I can make the reservation, and I can switch reservations. I am doing that because I have a digital identity account with them. In mobility sharing services such as rental bikes, I’m also using my digital identity to use their services. I have a digital ID with the tax authorities, which lets me handle my taxes from my computer’s comfort at home. All of that is already a digital identity.”</p><p>But the path to a decentralized digital identity is still far-fetched. Irene says that what has just been described as decentralized digital identities is just starting across the world. And Germany is currently beginning a pilot project in which Jolocom is taking part. “In the larger scheme, for three years, different companies and consortiums, and groups are working on providing this kind of decentralized, secure, SSI identity to citizens to help with municipal services and other things. That is something that’s going to start later this year and then go for two or three years, depending on the different projects.”</p> Are GDPR and digital identity&nbsp;friends? <p>GDPR was about privacy preservation, ensuring that control over our private personal data doesn’t go to unauthorized entities and be as beneficial or benevolent as they want to be. And there are certain data sets to which they shouldn’t have access. Because if they have access to it, it’s always possible that less than benevolent entities get access to it. GDPR is about the principle of privacy and data autonomy. And here definitely, this is in alignment with the principles of Self-sovereign identity. So one of them is autonomy, and another one is privacy. These aspects are going hand in&nbsp;hand.</p> The role of big tech in creating decentralized digital identities <p>We have millions and billions of digital identities already in place and probably multiply exponentially in the next couple of years. To handle this kind of influx of data and identity actors and entities, that is something where we need big tech, definitely just to be able to handle all of these things. They have the infrastructure in place to scale on these kinds of numbers. Understandably, big tech is going there, only because the market will be almost the same as the world’s population, if not larger because we have one person who has more devices than just one. This explains why it’s good that they are in this field and why it’s natural and understandable that they want to move into this&nbsp;field.</p><p>On the other hand, where do we need big tech? The cause for concern is, of course, the idea that if you have central authorities able to access specific data, it can quickly lead to the question of whether I want other people to have access to this data or these devices. And in some cases, we might not care, and in some cases, we might want to care very much because you always have to think about these things, especially from the regulatory point of view, from the worst-case scenario.</p> The user experience to use Digital Identities <p>Digital identity is something a lot of us already have. If we are talking about, for example, using an SSI wallet, it’s quite similar. And, of course, you need to get yourself comfortable with the entire concept. Setting up the account in your Jolocom wallet, for example, is slightly a few more steps than usual. It does not just generate a password — you are being issued a private key that you need to write down if your phone gets stolen or lost or is broken. Once you are set up after a while and have walked through the eight to 10 steps — it’s as simple as scanning and using and showing QR&nbsp;codes.</p> Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast: <p>1: 50–7.05: What is a digital identity, and how it be decentralized?</p><p>7.05–10.10: How many digital identities can one person&nbsp;have?</p><p>10.10–12.50: How can decentralized digital identities help citizens in solving socio-economic problems?</p><p>12.50–15.30: Are Digital Identities and GDPR&nbsp;friends?</p><p>15.30–20.35: The role of big tech in managing decentralized digital identities</p><p>20:35–23.20: Role of Jolocom in creating decentralized digital identities</p><p>23.20–25.00: Public sectors role in creating decentralized digital identities</p><p>25:00 onwards: The user experience of using a decentralized digital&nbsp;identity</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

					 Indicio expands decentralized identity workshops and introduces new certification program 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Responding to strong demand, Indicio now offers certification upon completion of its virtual, instructor-led decentralized identity training.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Technology provider Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation advancing decentralized identity, today announced a new professional certification program. Program participants completing Indicio’s popular instructor-led workshops, including the newest workshops on the open source Hyperledger Aries <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">Mediator Agent</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/hyperledger-aries-sees-new-coordinated-effort-to-produce-complete-mobile-agent/">Mobile Agent</a>, are awarded certificates of completion issued in the form of a verifiable credential.</p>
<p>“We first envisioned Indicio training as the gateway to understanding decentralized identity,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. ”Decentralized technology, its terminology, and its technical process can be confusing to grasp on your own, even though the actual process of issuing, holding, and verifying credentials is surprisingly easy. So our thought was that we should give people the opportunity to learn about decentralized identity through hands-on activities guided by an experienced instructor. It turned out that this delivered the ‘aha’ moment for workshop participants and inspired them to want to know more.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Building this into a certificate program recognizes the need and the demand for systematic training in our field,” says Dahl. “And it only makes sense the certificate is issued in the form of a verifiable credential, using the <a href="https://entrustient.com/">EntTrustient</a> platform, an innovator in credentials for governments, education, employment, travel, health, and finance industries.”</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to support the issuance of Indicio’s training credentials for participants who’ve successfully demonstrated skills attainment and program completion.” says Tim Dutta, Chairman, and CEO of Entrustient, “Indicio’s workshops are designed to enable the next generation of trained professionals to be fluent in decentralized identity technology. By using Entrustient’s innovative, redundant, and decentralized distributed blockchain ledger platform, recipients of these credentials will now have full agency and the ability to provide a proof presentation of their earned accomplishments, to any third-party verifying organization that relies on certifications from Indicio, the original credential issuer.”</p>
<p>Expanding decentralized identity curriculum</p>
<p>The evolution of Indicio’s training workshops comes as companies and organizations are increasingly seeing decentralized identity as the solution to the longstanding challenge of verifying identity online, a critical process that has only become more urgent with the impact of the Covid pandemic on all aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>Designed for participants ranging in technical experience, skill level, and area of specialization, Indicio’s workshops provide the groundwork needed for both business and engineering team members to build and run decentralized networks and the applications that run on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants will receive a Certification of Completion and a verifiable credential that can be shared with peers and networks across social platforms and add ‘Decentralized Identity’ to their resumes.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>Indicio’s instructor-led workshops provide:</p>
 
 Hands-on learning covering each step of decentralized identity: These courses cover topics ranging from the fundamentals to network operations and agent mediation, with more courses expected to be added throughout the year. Additionally, self-paced labs and demos are also available providing further hands-on experience. 
 Certificate of completion: The instructor-lead courses conclude with a certificate of completion and professional emblem for sharing with networks and display on social media. 
 Continuing professional development: By participating in the Indicio certification community, individuals can use their training completion certification to gain access to networking opportunities and ongoing community events within the identity community. 
 
<p>Indicio will soon be expanding its certification program with workshops on Mobile Agents, including mobile application user interface design, and user experience best practices. These listings target designers, graphics, and product teams providing the opportunity to learn more about the growing field of decentralized identity. Future planned workshops also include technical writing, communicating, and governance for decentralized identity-based products and&nbsp; networks.</p>
<p>“Since Indicio launched its training program, we continue to expand our courses to meet the demand for more and more technical knowledge, says Ken Ebert, Indicio CTO. “But people also want to&nbsp; understand the business value of decentralized identity and learn about user experience and design. We are lucky to have some of the best engineers and business experts in decentralized identity on our team. They’re actively building identity solutions for global enterprises—so who better to teach and learn from?”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ah, Multi-factor Authentication. MFA.  Pronounced “em-eff-ayyyyy”</p>
      
<p>From the admin to the end-user, everybody loves MFA. Well, not entirely.</p>
      
<p>You know who really loves MFA? The password. So much so, that the two are practically married. </p>
      
<p>Chances are your company is already using MFA. You may think it solved your password problem, but do any of these sound like pain points?</p>
      
  Password resets  User account lockouts   Credential reuse  Login friction   MITM attacks  MFA bypass   Phishing  
      
<p>So much for solving the password problem.</p>
      
<p>Despite widespread MFA adoption, password problems are at an all-time high.</p>
      
  
      
<p>The fact is, MFA didn’t replace the password. It made a huge improvement in security posture, but most MFA methods are built on top of passwords. That means most MFA is just adding one shared secret on top of another shared secret. </p>
      
<p>As more companies try to eliminate the use of passwords they come to a stark realization: that their multi-factor security products have actually married them to the use of passwords, which are an awful security foundation. </p>
      
<p>A question they ask is, “How do we move away from passwords and ensure multi-factor security?”</p>
      
<p>The short answer is <a href="https://www.hypr.com/true-passwordless-mfa/">Passwordless MFA</a>. You can just <a>skip ahead</a> to the part where you divorce the password. </p>
      
<p>If you prefer to read on, let’s look at three common authentication methods — OTP (one-time password), push, and SMS — and explore how each of these is just another iteration of a password.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 One-Time Passwords (OTP) 
      
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/time-based-time-password-totp-otp/">One-Time Passwords (OTP)</a> are a string of digits or a code that is generated on either hardware security tokens like a smart card or key fob, or as soft tokens, meaning mobile device apps that display the numbers. After a user has entered a username and password, they are prompted to input a valid OTP in an additional login field as proof of possession. If the OTPs match, the user can access the account or system.</p>
      
 OTP Password Based MFA Apps 
      
<p>How is an OTP like the password? </p>
      
<p>First, like the password, an OTP is based on the concept of a shared secret. </p>
      
<p>Second, it’s literally in the name: One-Time Password.</p>
      
<p>As the name suggests, OTPs can only be used one time and usually expire after 30-to-60 seconds. They’re certainly more secure than user-created passwords, which can be weak and/or reused across multiple accounts. However, they still rely on a user password.</p>
      
<p>OTPs are sometimes mistaken for “passwordless” authentication, but really, they’re just passwords in disguise (it’s in the name after all). They still require a password as well as a shared secret. Which means they’re still vulnerable and subject to a variety of attacks, such as MFA phishing, mobile malware, keyloggers or <a href="https://www.hypr.com/man-in-the-middle/">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 SMS 2-Factor Authentication 
      
<p>SMS text messages are the most common OTP delivery method today. With SMS, OTPs are delivered to the user’s smartphone via text message, negating the need for a separate piece of hardware. As most people have a mobile phone of some kind, avoiding the cost of a hardware token has led many service providers to adopt SMS for large-scale consumer use.</p>
      
 <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-banks-are-moving-away-from-sms-one-time-passcodes/">Source: ZDNet</a> 
      
<p>But, similar to OTP, SMS relies on a user having a password and a shared secret, making it a less than ideal method of authentication. An OTP message could be delivered to the wrong mobile phone or your mobile phone could be stolen or compromised. SMS messages can be intercepted via SS7 network attacks, or mobile malware can be used to steal an automated SMS OTP.</p>
      
<p>In fact, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://www.hypr.com/de-nistify-800-63b-aal/">stopped recommending the use of SMS</a> as a strong second factor in July 2016. In the EU, German banks have already begun <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-banks-are-moving-away-from-sms-one-time-passcodes/">phasing out the use of SMS OTP</a>.</p>
      
  
      
<p></p>
      
 Push Authentication 
      
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/push-authentication/">Push authentication</a> is another mobile-centric authentication method whereby the service provider sends the user a notification to their mobile phone. The user then only has to tap the screen to get access to the account or system. Push authentication relies on the user having possession of mobile phone and the ability to unlock the phone, with a decentralized PIN or a biometric method such as a fingerprint or face recognition.</p>
      
<p>So, it must be passwordless, right? </p>
      
  
      
<p>PUSH authentication can be used as part of a passwordless system if the solution is built upon PKI or certificate-based authentication. But in most cases today, PUSH authentication is an MFA mode layered on top of additional shared secrets including (you guessed it) a password.</p>
      
<p>PUSH notifications have also been the subject of recent attacks, with malicious hackers targeting users who may unwittingly approve a dubious PUSH notification prompt for a transaction or login request. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks/">Learn more about PUSH Attacks</a>.</p>
      
<p>In a recent <a href="https://get.hypr.com/2021-state-of-passwordless-security-report">report</a> we found that 9% of survey respondents reported a rise in PUSH attacks since they moved to a remote workforce.</p>
      
<a href="https://get.hypr.com/2021-state-of-passwordless-security-report">Source: The 2021 State of Passwordless Security</a>
      
<p></p>
      
 How to Divorce the Password 
      
<p>Companies are adopting a Passwordless approach to Multi-factor Authentication. Through what we call <a href="https://www.hypr.com/true-passwordless-mfa/">True Passwordless MFA</a>, HYPR customers are able to combine several factors:</p>
      
  Something you are: your fingerprint, face scan, or other biometric recognition.  Something you have: your smartphone, which acts as a physical FIDO token, similar to a security key or smart card.  Something you know: a decentralized PIN that’s also stored safely on your device.&nbsp;  
      
<p>Deploying True Passwordless MFA has allowed for 300% faster login speeds, a steep drop in fraud and phishing, and reduced friction across the user base.</p>
      
<p>By combining <a href="https://www.hypr.com/mobile-initiated-authentication/">mobile-initiated login</a> with a powerful FIDO-Certified architecture, the HYPR Cloud Platform is enabling IT leaders across the globe to ditch the password. The best part? It works with their existing IAM infrastructure, meaning there is no need to rip and replace what’s working for you. That makes the separation from passwords painless, less costly, and all the more amicable. </p>

<p>MicroWorkers’ integration of ONTO Wallet completes the latest phase in their joint venture with Ontology to promote users’ access to additional payment&nbsp;options</p><p>To further their mutual aim of empowering microworkers across the globe, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, public blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data, and global freelancing marketplace leader <a href="https://www.microworkers.com/">MicroWorkers</a> (MW), have announced the completion of the latest phase of their collaboration. Following the initial confirmation of the partnership in February 2020, this latest phase of the collaboration saw Ontology work closely with Microworkers to oversee the integration of its ONTO Wallet with the MicroWorkers platform, thereby enabling users to receive their rewards through methods other than PayPal and Payoneer, and increasing access to capital for many around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The global online freelancing market is growing rapidly and members of the burgeoning industry are utilizing blockchain technology to make their platform and marketplaces more efficient. Today’s announcement comes at a time of heightened interest in crypto participation and sees MicroWorkers leverage the Ontology blockchain to support its growing AI demands and enable workers and employers to use their ONTO digital wallets to receive and send crypto payments. MicroWorker users are also able to securely store and share their account history and reputation score through their <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a> on-chain, allowing for cutting-edge encryption while placing sole control of the data in the hands of the user. With the initial test phase of the integration now completed, these services will soon be available to all MicroWorkers users.</p><p>Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, stated, “We are proud that this partnership will enable the users and employers of MicroWorkers to get paid through <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a> app, showcasing Ontology’s blockchain and identity platform as a way to deliver these much-needed services at a time when micro workers most need&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Using their ONTO digital wallet, MicroWorkers users can withdraw Binance USD (BUSD) digital currency, and then deposit euros into their debit cards. This greatly expands the amount of withdrawal methods and currency types available for users of MicroWorkers, giving them greater choice over how they get paid for their work. There are also a number of other benefits for users, including a significantly lower withdrawal fee rate, which at 2% is lower than other withdrawal methods on the current MicroWorkers platform. In an effort to attract more users to participate in the initiative, a number of additional benefits will be offered, including the elimination of card opening fees and the wider availability of digital currency rewards. Finally, an income certificate can be generated on ONTO with one click, which provides convenience for users when seeking related jobs, and also makes ONTO’s functions more demonstrative.</p><p>Commenting on the integration, Nhatvi Nguyen, CEO of MicroWorkers said, “By enabling this integration with Ontology, we are making significant strides in terms of how our workers can get paid. We believe that this development will promote a new level of financial freedom among our platform users and enable them to benefit from the number of exciting new services that we have in the pipeline. We see blockchain and digital identity as hugely important, and we’re dedicated to leveraging these emerging technologies to provide micro workers around the world with the best possible experience.”</p> About MicroWorkers <p>MicroWorkers is an innovative online platform that connects employers and freelancing workers from all around the world. MicroWorkers is the #1 alternative to Amazon Mechanical Turk and is accessible to enterprises and freelancers in over 190 countries globally.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/microworkers-integrates-ontologys-onto-wallet-to-facilitate-additional-payment-options-for-workers-1163291af76c">MicroWorkers Integrates Ontology’s ONTO Wallet To Facilitate Additional Payment Options For Workers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Quantum computing is one of those topics that always seem to exist just out of our reach. Well over a decade ago we were promised that a real quantum computer will appear just in a few years, and for most people, this feeling remains the same even now. But is this assumption correct? Do we really need to wait a few years more until the fastest, biggest, and most reliable quantum computers will finally find their way into every industry? Or is it something we should already be considering today?</p>
 Understanding (or at least trying to) quantum computing 
<p>Now, I will not attempt to explain how quantum computing works in this post: in fact, we’ve already tried that in an <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/quantum_computing_threat" title="episode of the KuppingerCole podcast on this subject">episode of the KuppingerCole podcast on this subject</a>. Also, I won’t even pretend I can understand much of quantum physics and its underlying mathematics despite having a degree in it. But one crucial thing that must be reiterated is that quantum computing is based on principles fundamentally different from classical computers and thus is not meant to be a replacement for existing computer algorithms. When reliably working and sufficiently powerful quantum hardware becomes available, it will not magically make existing programs or computational methods run faster.</p>
<p>In reality, the most interesting potential applications for quantum computing are problems that are practically impossible to solve with traditional methods in any feasible amount of time. Various problems in the field of chemistry and nanotechnology are among popular goals; the so-called quantum annealing can be used for solving various optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem. Finally, the notorious integer factorization problem, if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm" title="solved with quantum algorithms">solved with quantum algorithms</a>, can undermine the reliability of public key encryption. This hypothetical advantage over classical computers is somewhat awkwardly referred to as “quantum supremacy”.</p>
 Quantum Supremacy – does it even mean anything? 
<p>Well, at least it is no longer hypothetical: back in 2019, Google has claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy by solving a problem on a quantum computer in 200 seconds, which would take a classical supercomputer 10,000 years to complete. In December 2020, Chinese scientists have performed boson sampling (I wish I could explain what it even means!) in 20 seconds, which allegedly would take 600 million years of traditional computation. So, does it mean that powerful and useful quantum computers are already a reality?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not that easy. First, demonstrating quantum supremacy does not require solving a practically useful problem. Also, real physical quantum computers are very sensitive to imperfections in the underlying hardware and the influence of the environment. Without introducing special quantum error correction methods, large-scale quantum computing is still practically impossible (think of working with a classical computer that crashes every second). Combined with the enormous difficulties of scaling quantum computers to thousands or millions of qubits needed to implement useful algorithms, it may look like the majority of organizations shouldn’t even worry about practical applications for at least another five years…</p>
 Should I start with quantum computing today? 
<p>And again, the answer is not that easy. Even if your business isn’t planning to benefit from quantum computing yet, there are some aspects of it that you have to consider anyway. The most obvious one is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/n40521" title="crypto-agility">crypto-agility</a>. Even though the currently used encryption algorithms have not been compromised yet, the chance that it can happen very shortly is high enough. Standards bodies are already working on evaluating and standardizing quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, NIST is planning to release their first standard next year already. Vendors working in this area are already implementing the necessary changes in their encryption platforms to make the migration to post-quantum cryptography easier. If your organization keeps encrypted data in the cloud, you should at least be aware of these developments.</p>
<p>But what if you want to start with quantum computing properly? Sure, the current generation of hardware isn’t yet suitable for tasks like cracking public encryption, but surely certain “less glamourous” problems like improving the efficiency of fertilizers and car batteries or modeling financial markets can already be tackled. Where do you get a quantum computer? How do you learn to operate it? Are they available as-a-service?</p>
<p>Yes, they are! In fact, quantum computing as a managed service is perhaps the only sensible option for the next few years. The actual hardware is quite complicated and delicate, requiring a team of experts to operate. Also, a substantial part of today’s quantum applications is running simulations on traditional hardware, which is only feasible at the cloud scale. It is no wonder that all major cloud service providers currently offer at least some kind of a managed environment for researching and experimenting with cloud computing. Google and IBM are perhaps the leaders in developing their own technologies, while Microsoft and AWS have open ecosystems with solutions from multiple 3rd party vendors. Smaller companies like the Canadian D-Wave might offer their own “quantum clouds” as well.</p>
 Choosing the right partner 
<p>The biggest question is thus not “should I start with quantum computing today” but rather “whom should I choose as the strategic partner”. I’m afraid nobody can currently give a definitive answer for this today as every aspiring vendor has their own advantages. <a href="https://quantumai.google/" title="Google">Google</a>, for example, was the first one to achieve quantum supremacy. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/" title="IBM">IBM</a> offers perhaps the most comprehensive long-term roadmap for a full stack of QC services. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/quantum/" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> focuses on an open ecosystem with universal high-level tools that can work on hybrid computing architectures. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/braket/" title="Amazon">Amazon</a> is attracting developers with a free tier for quantum simulation.</p>
<p>In the end, the choice is entirely yours. One thing is certain though: quantum computing is no longer science fiction. Even today, many companies can already reap tangible benefits by becoming early adopters, hiring the right talent to develop new algorithms and applications, and partnering with the right providers to get access to the actual quantum hardware. Perhaps, with more mature hardware and diverse application scenarios, we’ll end up with a “multi-quantum” reality just like we have with the cloud in general. Will this lead to an emergence of a universal framework for quantum computing similar to Kubernetes? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>Press Release:</p>



<p>UK-based consent and preference management platform, MyLife Digital will join forces with leading European consent management platform (CMP) provider Usercentrics to deliver a truly unified consent and preference management solution. The new partnership between the two industry giants will bring improved, more transparent experiences to users while also offering organisations simple integration patterns for facilitating better use of data.</p>



<p>By integrating Usercentrics CMP, MyLife Digital will provide a comprehensive consent and preferences management solution, providing one of the only platforms to simultaneously offer a consent and preference management for both valuable first-party data and cookies, pixels and other web technologies. With its Identity Access Management solution, through its partnership with Auth0, MyLife Digital will be in a unique position to offer an authenticated consent and preference management service that will provide a unified view of cookie consent and first-party consent and preferences, linked to an individual’s identity.</p>



<p>In bringing together their respective solutions, MyLife Digital and Usercentrics are striving to create greater transparency in what is currently a very opaque landscape. By introducing greater clarity and simple options for the consumer to update their consents and preferences, the two firms make it easier for individuals to understand what data is collected and held about them and why, ultimately delivering a better privacy experience and building trust.</p>



<p>J Cromack, co-founder and Managing Director of MyLife Digital, said, “It’s a very exciting time at MyLife Digital with both Forrester and Gartner predicting 2021 will be the year privacy becomes an imperative. Partnering with a best of breed provider like Usercentrics is an important part of our plan. Being able to offer an authenticated, consent and preference management service which provides a unified view of all consents and preferences linked to an individual’s identity across an organisation is a game-changer for those businesses who want to retain and build the utility in their data. Our goal has always been to help our customers deliver greater transparency and empower their consumers to make informed choices through data understanding, which builds loyalty and trust.”</p>



<p>Forrester states that privacy will be ‘an imperative’ in 2021, while Gartner believes that ‘a proactive approach to privacy and data protection’ will be essential for businesses to build consumer trust in a post-pandemic landscape.</p>



<p>According to Forrester, many organisations may be opening themselves up to risk this year as they seek rapid recovery solutions following twelve months of uncertainty and disruption. The leading market research firm predicts that businesses will demonstrate an ‘ever-increasing appetite to collect, process, and share sensitive personal data from consumers’ in a bid to make smarter, more informed, data-driven decisions to facilitate growth in the new normal.</p>



<p>However, at the same time, it is also expected that regulatory activity will increase rapidly over the next year. With the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) now being considered the global standard, many countries are beginning to build their own data privacy and protection laws, resulting in a growing need for businesses to fully understand how to remain compliant when collecting and storing data from customers across the globe.</p>



<p>Hanna Waldenmaier, Vice President of Global Partnerships at Usercentrics says, “Since the GDPR came into force, user consent has been the legal basis for data-based marketing. Without valid user consent, the use of cookies, pixels, or other technologies for marketing purposes is not permitted. At Usercentrics, we want to make it as easy as possible for customers to comply with legal requirements and continue to conduct data-driven, performance marketing. Furthermore, customers should have the possibility to not only collect consent easily but also be sure that the consent and preference status is accurate at all times in order to secure compliance. With MyLife Digital, we have now gained a partner with many years of expertise in the area of consent and preference management, and together we can offer companies the best possible support.”</p>

   Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native, Java framework for building high-performance web, serverless, and native apps. It uses Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation and aggressive optimizations like classpath scanning, configuration reloading, and application bootstrap pre-configuration during the build process. This results in impressive startup performance. In other words, a Quarkus app starts up super fast!

  <p>Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native, Java framework for building high-performance web, serverless, and native apps. It uses Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation and aggressive optimizations like classpath scanning, configuration reloading, and application bootstrap pre-configuration during the build process. This results in impressive startup performance. In other words, a Quarkus app starts up super fast!</p>

<p>Like Spring and Micronaut, Quarkus can take advantage of GraalVM to transform a JVM-based application into a native executable, improving the overall performance even more!</p>

<p>Such performance gains allow the Java platform to be competitive in serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments by building Supersonic Subatomic Java applications.</p>

<p>Quarkus uses Java standards (like <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile">MicroProfile</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jax-rs">JAX-RS</a>) and best of breed libraries (such as <a href="https://hibernate.org/">Hibernate</a> and <a href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>). It even has support for <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring</a>’s annotations.</p>

 Quarkus + JHipster = Fast Java Made Easy 

<p>Development history has demonstrated gluing components together can be challenging. Developers love when you provide them enlightened opinions, and this is where JHipster comes in.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/">JHipster</a> is a community-driven, full-stack development platform for generating, developing, and deploying modern web applications and microservice architectures.</p>

<p>The default backend framework in JHipster is Spring Boot, but more and more options are appearing. One of these options is the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-quarkus">JHipster Quarkus blueprint</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Among others, one of the key capabilities that’s determined JHipster’s success is its extensibility via blueprints. A blueprint acts as a JHipster plugin and lets you override the default behavior to produce a new “flavor.”</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin">JHipster’s Kotlin blueprint</a> is, for instance, a popular add-on that developers like to use.</p>

<p>Thanks to blueprints, the possibilities are infinite. This is why JHipster even has non-Java implementations (like <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-nodejs">Node + NestJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-dotnetcore">.NET Core</a>.</p>

<p>This post will walk you through the steps to use JHipster, the Quarkus blueprint, and OAuth to build a native and secure full stack application.</p>

 Create a Java Application with Quarkus 

<p>You’ll need to install a few things before you get started.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11+</a> 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js 12+</a> 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI 0.8.0+</a> 
 

<p>Install JHipster and its Quarkus blueprint using <code>npm</code>:</p>

   <code># Install JHipster globally
npm install -g generator-jhipster@6.10.5

# Install the JHipster Quarkus blueprint
npm install -g generator-jhipster-quarkus@1.1.1
</code>   

<p>The <code>jhipster-quarkus</code> command is now available as a shortcut for <code>jhipster --blueprints quarkus</code>. You can see all its options with the <code>--help</code> command.</p>

   <code>$ jhipster-quarkus --help
</code>   

 Generate a JHipster Quarkus Application 

<p>To begin, generate a JHipster app with a Quarkus backend. Open a terminal and create a directory for your application.</p>

   <code>mkdir okta-jhipster-quarkus-example &amp;&amp; cd okta-jhipster-quarkus-example
# oh-my-zsh users: take okta-jhipster-quarkus-example
</code>   

<p>You can invoke the <code>jhipster-quarkus</code> command to start the application creation wizard.</p>

   <code>jhipster-quarkus
</code>   

<p>For this tutorial, the key question will be the one regarding authentication.</p>

<p></p>

<p>JHipster Quarkus allows you to use JWT (with user management in the application database) or OAuth 2.0 / OIDC Authentication via identity providers like Keycloak and Okta. OIDC stands for OpenID Connect and is a thin layer on top of OAuth 2.0. Its primary purpose is to provide authentication and identify the user.</p>

<p>Below is an example of wizard answers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After you answer all the questions, JHipster will generate your application code and run <code>npm install</code>.</p>

<p>If you’d like to generate the same as I did for this tutorial, you can copy the following JSON into a <code>.yo-rc.json</code> in your <code>okta-jhipster-quarkus-example</code> directory, and run <code>jhipster-quarkus</code>.</p>

   <code>{
  "generator-jhipster": {
    "promptValues": {
      "packageName": "com.mycompany.myapp",
      "nativeLanguage": "en"
    },

      }
    ],
    "enableTranslation": true,

      {
        "name": "generator-jhipster-quarkus",
        "version": "1.1.1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This file contains all the answers to JHipster’s initial questions, and will allow you to generate your app without any prompts.</p>

 Make Sure OAuth 2.0 / OIDC with Keycloak Works 

<p>Among other files, JHipster Quarkus generates a set of Docker Compose files to help you bootstrap a dev environment tailored for your freshly generated application. It even imports Keycloak default data with users and apps, so you don’t have to.</p>

<p>Keycloak is the default OIDC engine used by JHipster, and you can run it in a Docker container.</p>

<p>Start a Keycloak container using the command below:</p>

   <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
</code>   

<p>With Keycloak up and running, you should be able to log in. Start your app using Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>You can see the app starts in <code>3.351s</code> and contains a vast list of Quarkus extensions (including <code>oidc</code>).</p>

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser and click the sign in link.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will be redirected to Keycloak to log in. Enter <code>admin/admin</code> when prompted for credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After successfully authenticating, you’ll be redirected back to your Quarkus app.</p>

<p></p>

 How JHipster Quarkus OAuth 2.0 Support Works 

<p>One of the challenges when developing a JHipster blueprint like the Quarkus is finding the sweet spot between reusing existing mechanisms and custom implementation.</p>

<p>Since Day 1, JHipster has integrated modern web application frameworks (Angular, React, or even Vue.js) with de-facto standard Java-based technologies, like Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>

<p>The JHipster Quarkus OAuth 2.0 implementation relies on a <code>login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> redirect URI, which Spring Security expects. Doing server-side authentication is highly recommended since it’s a lot more secure (because the browser does not have to manage any credentials or store any access tokens).</p>

<p>In JHipster Quarkus, to reuse the front applications as-is and implement a server-side OAuth 2.0 flow, the backend had to expose these two HTTP routes. This is why JHipster Quarkus has a <code>UserOauth2Controller</code> controller and customized Quarkus OIDC properties to make everything work properly.</p>

<p>This is the kind of integration pitfall developers don’t want to waste time on. The collective intelligence of the JHipster community converges highly-efficient opinions, which explains the platform’s popularity and quality.</p>

 Integrate JHipster Quarkus with Okta 

<p>In this section, you’ll learn how to use Okta as an OAuth 2.0 / OIDC provider. Okta has two options for configuring an OpenID Connect (OIDC) application. You can either go through the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">developer console</a> or use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>.</p>

 Use the Okta CLI to Configure JHipster 

<p>The Okta CLI automates all the JHipster + Okta configuration for you. You can install the Okta CLI using popular package managers.</p>

<p>macOS (via <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>):</p>

   <code>brew install --cask oktadeveloper/tap/okta
</code>   

<p>Linux (via Flatpak):</p>

   <code># Add Flathub repo
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

# install the package
flatpak install com.okta.developer.CLI

# add this to your appropriate dot file
alias okta="flatpak run com.okta.developer.CLI"
</code>   

<p>Windows (via Chocolatey):</p>

   <code>choco install okta -version 0.8.0

<p>You can also just pipe it to bash:</p>

   <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okta/okta-cli/master/cli/src/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
</code>   

<p>Open a terminal, navigate to your Quarkus app’s directory, and run <code>okta register</code> if you don’t have an Okta developer account. If you already have one, run <code>okta login</code>.</p>

   <code>$ okta register

</code>   

<p>If you already have an Okta developer account, run <code>okta login</code>. Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code> in your Quarkus app’s directory. Accept the defaults when prompted for redirect URIs.</p>

   <code>$ okta apps create jhipster

</code>   

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default. They aren’t necessary for this tutorial, but there’s no harm in leaving them in.</p>

<p>The Okta CLI will create an <code>.okta.env</code> in the current directory.  If you look at it, you’ll see that it contains several OIDC-related keys and values.</p>

   <code>$ cat .okta.env
export QUARKUS_OIDC_AUTH_SERVER_URL="https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export QUARKUS_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="0oa5ozjxyNQPPbKc65d6"
export QUARKUS_OIDC_CREDENTIALS_SECRET="KEJ0oNOTFEUEFHP7i1TELLING1xLm1XPRn"
export QUARKUS_OIDC_AUTHENTICATION_REDIRECT_PATH="/login/oauth2/code/oidc"
export JHIPSTER_OIDC_LOGOUT_URL="https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/logout"
</code>   

<p>Source the file to set environment variables and start your application with Maven.</p>

   <code>source .okta.env
./mvnw
</code>   

<p>Make sure to add <code>*.env</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> so you don’t commit your client secret!</p>

<p>Once it’s started, open an incognito window to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and sign in. You’ll be prompted for your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After authenticating successfully, you’ll be redirected back to your app. You should see your email address displayed on the homepage.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Okta CLI streamlines JHipster’s configuration and does several things for you:</p>

 
   It creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs 
   It makes <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   It adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   It creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>What if you dislike the command line? Don’t panic; I have your back! The Okta CLI is easy to use, but you might want to use a UI to configure things. That’s why I’ll go through each step to configure an OIDC application that works with JHipster Quarkus.</p>

 Use Okta’s Developer Console to Configure JHipster 

<p>If you don’t have an Okta developer account, you need to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">sign up</a>. It’s nothing fancy: first name, last name, email, a strong password, and you’re ready to go.</p>

<p>Once logged in, you arrive in your developer console:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Expand Applications on the left nav, then go to Applications &gt; Add Application &gt; Create New App to start the app creation wizard.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select Web and OpenID Connect. Then click Create.</p>

<p>You now need to provide some application settings.</p>

 
   Name: Whatever you want, but “JHipster Quarkus” sounds cool 😎 
   Login redirect URIs: Where Okta will redirect the user’s browser once authenticated.
Set it to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code>, as this is what’s configured by default 
   Logout redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> This is where the user will land after they log out 
   Group assignments: Which groups can use this application 
 

<p>Use the default values for the rest of the settings.</p>

<p>When you’re happy with your application, click Done. The next screen will show your application details.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The most important values are:</p>

 
   The client credentials (client id and client secret). They allow your Java application to authenticate against Okta services for user authentication and authorization flows. 
   The Okta domain from which Quarkus will derive the OAuth / OIDC endpoint URLs. 
 

 Create User Groups 

<p>Now it’s time to create user groups. Out of the box, JHipster requires two groups:</p>

 
   <code>ROLE_USER</code>: for the authenticated users 
   <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code>: for the authenticated users with administrator privileges on the application 
 

<p>In your developer console, go to Directory &gt; Groups. Click on Add Group and create the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> group.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, add the <code>ROLE_USER</code> group.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’re done with the user groups; now, let’s add users.</p>

 Create Users 

<p>To see the difference between an admin user and a regular user, create users in each group. Using the Okta developer console, go to Directory &gt; People.</p>

<p>Click on Add Person. Start by creating an <code>Administrator</code> user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The key points are to associate the <code>Administrator</code> user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> group.
For this tutorial’s sake, use the <code>Set by Admin</code> password strategy to define an initial password the user will have to change.</p>

<p>I recommend using the Set by User strategy with an activation email in a real-life context.</p>

<p>Now, add a regular user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure the <code>User</code> person is a member of the <code>ROLE_USER</code> group. It’s important to use a valid email address for password recovery purposes.</p>

<p>Go to Applications &gt; JHipster Quarkus and click on Assignments. Assign the users you just created.</p>

 Add a Groups Claim to the ID Token 

<p>The last thing you’ll need to do is configure a groups claim that includes a user’s groups in the ID token. Go to Security &gt; API and click on default. Go to Claims &gt; Add Claim. Enter the following values:</p>

 
   Name: <code>groups</code> 
   Include in token type: ID Token 
   Value type: groups 
   Filter: Matches regex with a value of <code>.*</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Create.</p>

<p>The Okta configuration for JHipster is now complete!</p>

 Configure Quarkus OIDC for Okta 

<p>At this point, you have a JHipster Quarkus Application running and configured to use Keycloak as its identity provider.</p>

<p>Let’s change it to use Okta.</p>

<p>First, you need to log out from the JHipster web application to prevent cookie collisions.
Go to Account &gt; Sign Out.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can leave the application running. Quarkus provides what they call a Dev Mode which hot reloads any source or resource file whenever they are updated. It’s super slick!</p>

<p>Edit <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> and find the following OIDC configuration section.</p>

   <code># OAuth 2.0 and OIDC
quarkus.oidc.enabled=true
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/
%dev.quarkus.oidc.client-id=web_app
%dev.quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=web_app
quarkus.oidc.application-type=hybrid
quarkus.oidc.authentication.scopes=profile,address,email,address,phone,offline_access
quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path=/
quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/login/oauth2/code/oidc
quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect=false

jhipster.oidc.logout-url=http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/logout

%test.quarkus.oidc.client-id=dummy
%test.quarkus.oidc.application-type=service
%test.jhipster.oidc.logout-url=some-dummy-logoutUrl
</code>   

<p>The above values are for Keycloak. You need to update the following properties to integrate your application with Okta.</p>

 
   <code>quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url</code>: The Okta’s API root URL derived from the OIDC application domain. 
   <code>quarkus.oidc.client-id</code>: The OIDC application’s client ID. 
   <code>quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret</code>: The OIDC application’s client secret. 
   <code>jhipster.oidc.logout-url</code>: In JHipster, the browser will initiate the logout. The backend needs to expose this information (for now, it can’t be retrieved using OIDC discovery). 
 

<p>After you update this file, your properties should look similar to the following:</p>

   <code># OAuth 2.0 and OIDC
quarkus.oidc.enabled=true
quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url=https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default
quarkus.oidc.client-id=0oaajhdr9q9jxbBM95d6
quarkus.oidc.credentials.secret=NEVERSHOWSECRETS
quarkus.oidc.application-type=hybrid
quarkus.oidc.authentication.scopes=profile,address,email,address,phone
quarkus.oidc.authentication.cookie-path=/
quarkus.oidc.authentication.redirect-path=/login/oauth2/code/oidc
quarkus.oidc.authentication.restore-path-after-redirect=false

jhipster.oidc.logout-url=https://dev-9323263.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/logout
</code>   

<p>Restart your application go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. Click on sign in, and you’ll be redirected to an Okta login page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter the <code>admin</code> username and the password you set. Okta detects it’s the first time you’ve logged in and asks you to update the password. Once done, you’ll be redirected to your Quarkus application.</p>

<p></p>

 Go Native with Quarkus and GraalVM 

<p>The final step of this tutorial is to package your Java application as a native executable. Once again, JHipster has your back, and everything is done for you.</p>

<p>Simply run Maven’s <code>package</code> command with the <code>native</code> profile:</p>

   <code>./mvnw package -Pnative -DskipTests
</code>   

<p>You know, we know, everybody knows, we skipped the tests so this demo works flawlessly. Please do NOT skip the tests in a production context. 😅</p>

<p>If you’re not using a JDK with GraalVM included, you’ll get an error:</p>

   <code>[error]: Build step io.quarkus.deployment.pkg.steps.NativeImageBuildStep#build threw an
 exception: java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot find the `native-image` in the 
 GRAALVM_HOME, JAVA_HOME and System PATH. Install it using `gu install native-image`
</code>   

<p>The easiest way to solve this is to use <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> to install Java 11 with GraalVM.</p>

   <code>sdk install java 21.0.0.2.r11-grl
</code>   

<p>Then, run <code>gu install native-image</code>:</p>

   <code>$ gu install native-image
Downloading: Component catalog from www.graalvm.org
Processing Component: Native Image
Downloading: Component native-image: Native Image  from github.com
Installing new component: Native Image (org.graalvm.native-image, version 21.0.0.2)
</code>   

<p>Once this process completes, rerun the Maven package command.</p>

   <code>./mvnw package -Pnative -DskipTests
</code>   

<p>The native compilation takes a long time. You might want to go for a walk, get a cup of coffee, or do some pushups.</p>

<p>If you’d rather stay at your computer, here are some other activities you might try:</p>

 
   Check out the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-quarkus">JHipster Quarkus Blueprint project</a> 
   Explore the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta developer site</a> 
   Go through <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/">the excellent Quarkus guides</a> 
 

<p>After roughly three minutes, the native executable should be ready:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Start it as a native executable using <code>target/*runner</code>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>💥 Boom! Your good old-fashioned Java application starts in 1 second! 🚀</p>

<p>Remember, I talked about memory gains? Below is a command to get the memory consumption in megabytes.</p>

   <code>$ ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color jhipster | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'
30951 46M ./target/jhipster-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner
31433 0M grep --color=auto --exclude-dir=.bzr --exclude-dir=CVS --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=.hg --exclude-dir=.svn --color jhipster
</code>   

<p>Your application is consuming &lt; 50MB of memory. 💃🏻</p>

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and make sure everything works. Then, enjoy your success!</p>

 Go Further with JHipster Quarkus

<p>In the last few years, headlines have blared that Bitcoin has grotesque energy costs. The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (Footnote 1) currently estimates 78 TWh a year. More importantly, in these years of climate change, which is a real, global crisis, they note a carbon footprint of 37 Mt CO2. The sensationalist headlines usually note that this is the same as New&nbsp;Zealand.</p><p>Though these numbers may be technically correct, that’s the worst type of correct, because the headlines are pure clickbait. They create outrage without offering context and in doing so create a false impression. Here’s some of what they’re&nbsp;missing.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Consumption is Nothing Compared to the Traditional Financial Industry</p><p>The US alone has 9 million people working in the financial industry(2). Compare that to the 8,000 people who work in One World Trade Center, or the 15,000 people who work in the Empire State Building, and the staggering scope of that work force becomes obvious: it’s 750 huge skyscrapers worth of energy usage. Add in every stock exchange, every computer, every router, and every credit card machine not already included in those counts. Add in some fraction of the 200,000–300,000 armored vehicles worldwide that carry cash from one location to another (whose carbon emissions are likely worse than SUVs, which created more than 700 Mt CO2 in 2018(3)). Move on to the processes that create physical financial resources: gold mining creates&nbsp;.8T of CO2 for every 1 ounce of gold mined(4). Multiply that by the 2,500 tons of gold mined each year(5), and you get another 6.4 Mt CO2. (Mind you, that doesn’t even count the millions of tons of toxic waste such as cyanide and mercury released into the environment by gold and other metal mining(6).)</p><p>Obviously, none of these comparisons are apples to apples. Not all financial offices are in skyscrapers, not all of those offices use the same amounts of energy, not all cities have the same proportion of green energy production, not all armored vehicles are used in the financial industry, not as many armored vehicles fill our roads as SUVs, and not all gold is used financially. However, the difficulty in creating a precise comparison demonstrates why those poorly considered headlines about Bitcoin are possible: Bitcoin is transparent, so it’s easy to see the costs, while the traditional financial industry is full of secret subsidies.</p><p>Still, we can see enough in these partial views to heavily imply that Bitcoin’s consumption is a bare fraction of that of the traditional financial industry. With that in mind, clickbait headlines start to look a lot like the traditional financial industry punching down at a scrappy newcomer.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Consumption is Comparative to Video Gaming and Video Streaming</p><p>Another way to look at Bitcoin’s usage is to compare it to other computer energy uses. Lawrence Berkeley National Labs estimated that video gaming in California alone used 4.1 TWh of electricity each year(7). Crypt0Events extrapolated that to estimate that video gaming energy usage was 33.5 TWh yearly in the US and 104.7 TWh worldwide: 50% higher than Bitcoin(8).</p>Bitcoin vs Video Games, Energy and Carbon Emission Comparisons<p>Streaming video is another technology that has received a lot of clickbait headlines regarding its energy usage. Some estimates have put its energy usage in the hundreds of TWh, but pushback on that has revealed deep flaws in the methodologies of studies trying to estimate this usage(10). We should be similarly leery.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Consumption is Relatively Clean</p><p>A simple count of Bitcoin’s energy usage, besides not offering meaningful comparatives, also ignores the fact that Bitcoin’s energy usage is relatively clean. The majority of Bitcoin’s energy comes from renewable hydroelectricity in China that was not otherwise being used. Ya’an in China recently demonstrated this by sending out a call for blockchain users because they had 16.3 TWh of energy that was going to waste every year(11). Their overall production is 41.5 TWh of renewable energy production in a year, which is half of Bitcoin’s consumption, just from one city. Based on areas where Bitcoin mining occurs, a 2019 report put overall renewable usage conservatively at 74.1%(12).</p><p>Not All Blockchains are&nbsp;Equal</p><p>If the general arguments about Bitcoin’s energy usage are deeply flawed for all the things they don’t say, this is even more true for arguments against other uses of blockchains, which tend to be much smaller scale. For example, Bitmark’s crypto-rights blockchain calculations are considerably easier than Bitcoin’s(13): Bitcoin currently has a difficulty of more than 21T while Bitmark has been running less than 1G: about 20,000x less. This difference comes about because of the lower total hashing power of the Bitmark network: because there are less computers, or less powerful computers, less work is needed to secure the blockchain. The amount of energy required is correspondingly lower.</p><p>Blockchain is a Tool of the&nbsp;Future</p><p>Here’s the thing: we believe that the current arguments against the energy consumption of blockchains are badly framed clickbait headlines that don’t correctly consider how the energy is generated, how it’s used, and how that compares to other usages. Maybe our references have convinced you of that, maybe&nbsp;not.</p><p>But even if those clickbait headlines were accurate, even if the usage was as horrible as they suggest, even if all blockchains used the same energy as Bitcoin, they’d still be a great&nbsp;deal.</p><p>Blockchains are a technological revolution. They give us the ability to collaborate, and permanently record that collaboration, at a global scale. They allow us to remake our world’s infrastructure to better complement the borderless internet, and to do it in a way that doesn’t give corporations all the power. They ensure that changes in political power can’t change our recorded history. They allow us to have rules without&nbsp;rulers.</p><p>At Bitmark, we use blockchains to create crypto-rights, allowing you to manage finances, health data, creative licenses, and more without requiring you to depend upon a corporation, a registrar, or even a government. Bitcoin similarly allows individuals to manage their own payments and receipts without credit card companies or online payment services getting in the way (and potentially controlling what can be bought or&nbsp;funded).</p><p>Blockchains are the future of independence on the internet, of allowing us all to work together to make a better society. We’re just seeing the leading edge of that with Bitcoin. There is so much more to come, with Bitmark’s Crypto-Rights systems being just a few ideas among&nbsp;many.</p><p>Because we’re on the cutting edge, this work is still growing. Yes, there may be inefficiencies in blockchains currently. Yes, the energy costs may be too high: in a global crisis we can’t solely say that we’re no worse than anyone else. We want to be part of the solution too. But the first cell phones were bricks, the first personal computers had 4 kB of RAM, and the first commercial solar panels were 2% efficient. Obviously, there will be improvements in blockchains too, if we support this technology and incentivize its&nbsp;growth.</p><p>We reject the clickbait framing of current arguments against the energy consumption of blockchains. We all need to, because we can’t allow this revolutionary technology to be set back by someone trying to sell ads on their&nbsp;website.</p><p>Blockchain is an essential part of the future. We need to focus on that big picture, so that we can support independence of action and the creation of new rights, so that we can match those rights with the boundary-less nature of the digital internet, so that we can collaboratively work together in new ways — so that we can remake the&nbsp;world.</p><p>by Shannon Appelcline, commissioned by&nbsp;Bitmark.</p><p>Footnotes:</p>  Digiconomist.

<p>Zero Trust is a buzzword with which cybersecurity folks are quite familiar. I understand, you’re surprised. Zero Trust has nothing to do with the Amazon packages your spouse hides from you. Rather, in 2009, John Kindervag (Forrester Research) introduced the concept of a “zero trust model,” in response to rising security challenges. Zero Trust can be summarized in four words: never trust, always verify. The main assumption Kindervag made is that traffic within an enterprise’s network cannot be more trustworthy by default than traffic coming from the outside. He was spot on, it turns out. After all, 60 percent of data breaches actually come from insiders.</p>

 February Edition <p>Welcome to our monthly roundup —February edition, as always I’m bringing you the scoop of the month. If you have been reading the regular updates we share in Telegram or Twitter, you probably already know that we’ve now got a working Elemental Chat application and that we are hard at work preparing the Holochain and Holo infrastructure so that we can release it to all hosts. We are almost&nbsp;there!</p><p>If you’re wondering what exactly we’ve been working on at Holo and Holochain this past month — the wait is over! Let’s jump right&nbsp;in.</p> Elemental Chat is&nbsp;live! <p>The first Dev Pulse of the new year is going to be a short one. That’s not because nothing’s happening — in fact, it’s partly because there’s a lot going on, and I need to get back to it. Holochain RSM is growing up, and it’s time for both veteran and new devs to start developing on it. (That means that new developer documentation is coming&nbsp;soon!)</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 90— <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/elemental-chat-is-live/">Elemental Chat is&nbsp;live!</a></p> HDK is stable (for&nbsp;now) <p>The big news is that the core team’s work on the HDK, Holochain’s standard library for building DNAs, has slowed down and shouldn’t see any big changes for a while. Work is now shifting back to core features, such as sharding the&nbsp;DHT.</p><p>In the meantime, the Holo team is getting Elemental Chat ready for Holo hosting. They’ve also enabled the Host Console on all HoloPorts (read on to find out&nbsp;why).</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 91— <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-91-hdk-stable-for-now/">HDK is stable (for&nbsp;now)</a></p> Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Yes, you read that right! We are actually ahead of where we expected to be in some ways. While it is taking a while to complete infrastructure testing because that is one of the most complex aspects of our work, we have been able to move many other activities forward. Because of that we decided to shift the HoloFuel application up in the roadmap. Here is what it looks like with the new changes. <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">Check it out on our website where you will find more&nbsp;details</a>.</p> More Dev Documents are&nbsp;out   To install the new RSM go&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/">here</a>.

<p>As more of our critical work and personal functions go online, the risk of data and security breaches continues to increase. In 2019, there were <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/">over 1400 data breaches reported</a> that exposed nearly 165 million records, many of which included passwords and personal information.</p>

<p>While security specialists bear much of the responsibility in ensuring their organizations are handling sensitive data properly, web developers at all levels must take part as well. By understanding fundamental concepts like hashing and password management, developers can help minimize security risks to their users and businesses.</p>

<p>Hashing is an important but often misunderstood concept in computer programming. In this comprehensive guide, I’ll share everything you need to know about password hashing, generating hashes and salts, storing hashed passwords, and implementing password hashing in Python. Finally, I’ll show you how you can use hashes to validate users locally or with a third-party authentication tool <a href="https://www.okta.com/">like Okta</a>.</p>

 What is a Hash? 
<p>If you’ve taken a computer science course on data types, you’ve probably heard of hash tables and hash functions. A hash table (or hash map) is a data storage pattern that maps a calculated hash index to each given key. This allows you to lookup values in a table if you know their key. Python’s dictionary data type <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2000-March/048085.html">is implemented as a hash table</a>, so you are probably already using hash tables without knowing it.</p>

<p></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">Hash functions</a> are how keys in hash tables are calculated. When hashing a piece of data, the hash function should be able to take an arbitrary length of data and map it to a fixed-length index that is unique to the value. In the context of hash table data storage, a programmer can access stored values by knowing the keys and calling the hash function.</p>

<p>In practice, hash functions are useful for a wide variety of tasks, including compression, data storage, checksums, and password storage. In the rest of this guide, I’ll focus on cryptographic hashes and their role in passwords.</p>

 Password Hashes 
<p>If you have users logging into your site, you likely ask them to create an account with a password. As a developer, you need a way to verify a user by their password later, but storing the password in plaintext <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lin.3021/file/ISPEC15.pdf">opens you up to massive problems if your database is ever compromised</a>. Attackers could use the passwords to access all the other data you store for your users or gain access to other accounts the user owns, especially <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/05/08/reuse-passwords-enterprise/">if they reuse their passwords</a>.</p>

<p>This is where cryptographic hash functions come in. If you run a plaintext password through one of these functions, it will convert the string into a unique, irreversible, fixed-size bit array. This hashed password can then be stored in your database, and even if attackers gain access to your database, they shouldn’t be able to quickly figure out your users’ passwords.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no hashing strategy is perfect. Given enough time and access, attackers can still deduce hashed passwords using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables</a> or <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/brute-force-attack">brute force attacks</a>. This is why it’s important to use the most up-to-date hashing algorithms and salt your passwords before you hash them. In the next section, I’ll cover salting, and later in this guide, you’ll learn about the various hashing algorithms available and when each might be appropriate.</p>

 Salting Hashes 
<p>If an attacker gets access to your hashed passwords and figures out which algorithm you used, they can look up the hashes in a rainbow table. If you don’t believe me, just google for a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=2c6c8ab6ba8b9c98a1939450eb4089ed">hash like this</a> and see how many results come up that reveal the password to be <code>abc123</code>. While modern hashing algorithms increase the time it takes to generate and lookup data in these tables, once attackers have your database, they can apply as much computing power as they can afford to the job.</p>

<p>Salts are long, randomly generated byte arrays added to each password before they’re hashed and stored. Salting passwords correctly makes <a href="https://www.lookingglasscyber.com/blog/thwart-rainbow-table-attack/">rainbow tables virtually useless</a> because each password will have a unique salt that the attacker does not have access to.</p>

<p>While any long, random byte array added to your passwords before hashing improves security, there are a few ways to increase the effectiveness of your salts. For example, you can add a unique salt to the front and back of each password, you can increase the length of your salt, or you can add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_(cryptography)">a separately stored “pepper”’</a> to each password.</p>

<p>Typically, salts are stored in your database alongside each user’s password. The problem with this approach is that attackers who get your database probably also get your salts. This means they can re-compute rainbow tables using the stolen salts. Even if it takes longer, an attacker might be motivated enough to do it anyway.</p>

<p>In response to this problem, you can create another long, random byte array called a “pepper” and store it in a separate location on your server (outside your database). Then, you can add this pepper to each password in addition to the salts.</p>

<p>Another way to spread out the information attackers would need to figure out your users’ passwords is to apply multiple hashing algorithms to the password. For example, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/webdev/2012/06/08/lets-talk-about-password-storage/">in 2012, Firefox wrote about its two-step hashing process</a> which uses HMAC and bcrypt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The local salt is a random value that is stored only on the server, never in the database…If an attacker steals one of our password databases, they would need to also separately attack one of our web servers to get file access in order to discover this local salt value…As a second step, this hashed value (or strengthened password, as some call it) is then hashed again with a slow hashing function called bcrypt.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Security almost always involves a risk and cost tradeoff. The important takeaway from salting is that spreading out the information attackers would need to deduce your passwords improves security but increases maintenance costs. For example, if your pepper is ever compromised, you’ll need to eventually re-hash all the passwords or ask users to change their passwords immediately.</p>

 Hashing in Python 
<p>Now that you understand what hashing is and how it is used in conjunction with salting to store passwords securely, you are ready to get specific. In this section, I’ll show you how to apply common hash functions in Python and some of the important considerations you should make when choosing a hash function.</p>

 DIY Hashing Algorithms vs. Libraries 
<p>While you might think it would be interesting to implement your own hash functions from scratch, this is not a good idea in practice. The <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet</a> summarizes the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Writing custom cryptographic code such as a hashing algorithm is really hard and should never be done outside of an academic exercise. Any potential benefit that you might have from using an unknown or bespoke algorithm will be vastly overshadowed by the weaknesses that exist in it.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Creating a modern, secure hash function requires quite a lot of esoteric code, and any small error could carry a critical security risk. If you’re curious, though, you can read the Python implementations of <a href="https://blog.jpolak.org/?p=1985">MD5 here</a> and <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/37648/python-implementation-of-sha1">SHA1 here</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Python has a robust choice of libraries available that implement cryptographically secure hash functions. In the examples below, you’ll see how two of them <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/">bcrypt</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html">hashlib</a> work. Both are open-source and widely recommended by security professionals and software developers alike. While bcrypt is a community-maintained module, hashlib is actually part of Python’s standard library.</p>

<p>I’ll share interactive examples of five of the most common password hashing algorithms in Python in the following sections. All of the Python code below is running in your browser. Feel free to edit and change the code you see! As you go through the code, you’ll see some of the pros and cons to each approach and why some of these algorithms are no longer recommended for password hashing in 2021.</p>

 MD5 
<p>Created as a general purpose cryptographic hash function, the MD5 algorithm has since been found vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance">collisions</a>, making it much easier for attackers to exploit. Because of this, MD5 is no longer recommended for password hashing.</p>

<p>That said, plenty of legacy systems still use the algorithm, so developers are likely to come across it. When you do, you’ll have to decide <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/118114/should-passwords-be-automatically-reset-when-the-underlying-method-changes">how you want to upgrade your hashing algorithm</a>, but because MD5 is still so common, I’ll show you a couple of examples here.</p>

 Hash Only 
<p>First, if you simply want to hash a password using MD5, you need to convert the password string to bytes (here I’m using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes-objects"><code>bytes</code> function for Python 3+</a>) and then pass it into the <code>md5</code> function in the <code>hashlib</code> module:</p>

import hashlib
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

hashed = hashlib.md5(bytes(password, "utf-8"))

result = {
    "algorithm": "MD5",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>Because MD5 creates a fixed-length 128-bit value, you have to convert it to a human-readable format if you want to <code>print</code> it. This example uses Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html"><code>json</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html"><code>base64</code></a> libraries to print out the hash in the format that Okta uses for loading user hashes into Okta, so you should see output that looks like this::</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "MD5",
    "value": "KqqDNf0DDgVKmOOyxYUrNA=="
}
</code>   

 With Salt 
<p>While you’ve seen that adding a salt to your passwords before hashing them theoretically increases security, it <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/a/61516">doesn’t make MD5 any more secure in practice</a>. Your salted passwords are still vulnerable to collisions, and because MD5 hashes can be generated so quickly, rainbow tables can still be used to decipher hashed passwords.</p>

<p>That said, you may see a salted MD5 hash like this in legacy code:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)
salted_password = bytes(password, "utf-8") + salt
hashed = hashlib.md5(salted_password)
result = {
    "algorithm": "MD5",
    "salt": base64.b64encode(salt).decode("ascii"),
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>This example uses the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html">secrets module</a> to generate  16 random bytes that are appended to the end of the password before it is hashed.</p>

<p>The output of this salted and hashed password will be a new 128-bit value that, when base64 encoded, will look something like the result below:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "MD5",
    "salt": "R0lGODlhAQABAAAAADs=",
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": "pqTUVToGARL1yM3/jthCHA=="
}
</code>   

<p>You’ll notice that the output from the sample code doesn’t match the example above. In fact, every time you make a change to the code, you’ll see that the output changes. This is good and exactly as expected. To get the benefits of salting your passwords, you must use a unique salt for each password!</p>

<p>That said, if you want to see how the output was generated above, you can change the salt to the same value that was used to compute the example by changing line 8 in the example above to look like this:</p>

   <code>salt = b"\x47\x49\x46\x38\x39\x61\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00;"
</code>   

 SHA-1 
<p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a> creates a slightly longer hashed output (160-bit) than MD5, it is no longer considered cryptographically secure either. It’s vulnerable to collisions, and in 2020, researchers estimated that anyone with $45,000 worth of cloud computing power <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf">could successfully break SHA-1 signatures used for validating TLS certificates</a>.</p>

<p>Like MD5, there’s still plenty of legacy systems using SHA-1 hashing algorithms, though, so you may see it in older Python code.</p>

 Hash Only 
<p>While the output is slightly longer (a 40-character hexadecimal string) than MD5, using SHA-1 involves roughly the same process:</p>

import hashlib
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

hashed = hashlib.sha1(bytes(password, 'utf-8'))
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-1",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>When hashed with SHA-1 and encoded with base64, the password <code>test password</code> will look like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-1",
    "value": "LOsCqF9tTebCiy5Z/aiG1Sba+w0="
}
</code>   

 With Salt 
<p>Not much changes when you add a salt to your password before applying SHA-1 hashing. It’s still not significantly more secure, and the process is equivalent to doing the same in MD5:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)
salted_password = bytes(password, "utf-8") + salt
hashed = hashlib.sha1(salted_password)
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-1",
    "salt": base64.b64encode(salt).decode("ascii"),
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-1",
    "salt": "R0lGODlhAQABAAAAADs=",
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": "1cijegMYbE7L/WkUxkHjQ+/p1M0="
}
</code>   

<p>As with the salted MD5 example above, the salt must be unique to each password you hash. However, if you want to get the exact same output as our example output, you can change line 8 in the example code to look like this:</p>

   <code>salt = b"\x47\x49\x46\x38\x39\x61\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00;"
</code>   

 SHA-256 
<p>As vulnerabilities in SHA-1 and MD5 became apparent in the late 1990s, researchers went to work on the next generation of cryptographic hashing functions. This effort resulted in the NSA’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">publication of the SHA-2 algorithms in 2001</a>. SHA-256 is one of these functions and is in widespread use today.</p>

<p>Since SHA-1 was proven insecure for SSL certificate validation, SHA-256 <a href="https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/difference-sha-1-sha-2-sha-256-hash-algorithms/">has been adopted</a>. SHA-256 also <a href="https://medium.com/@makhmud.islamov/use-cases-for-hash-functions-or-what-is-sha-256-83036de048b4">plays a role in blockchain technology and Bitcoin specifically</a> as a way to hash data and create Bitcoin addresses.</p>

<p>While SHA-256 has valid use cases, it is <a href="https://dusted.codes/sha-256-is-not-a-secure-password-hashing-algorithm">not really meant to be used in hashing passwords</a>. While collisions have not been proven, and unique salts can make rainbow tables ineffective, high-end hardware can still generate billions of SHA-256 hashes every minute. This allows attackers with access to your hashed passwords to use brute force to look for matches and decipher your users’ passwords.</p>

 Hash Only 
<p>Despite this inherent weakness, you are still likely to see SHA-256 used for hashing passwords. The implementation is basically the same as SHA-1 using hashlib, but the output will be a base64 encoded 256-bit object:</p>

import hashlib
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

hashed = hashlib.sha256(bytes(password, 'utf-8'))
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii")
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look like this:</p>
   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "value": "C0fGmxAzSY1fM/X32Xu2oxJhNHUWKfTQGFwRXbRMCU4="
}
</code>   

 With Salt 
<p>If you are forced to use SHA-256 for some reason, adding salt is essential. This requires attackers to have another piece of data and increases the amount of time required for brute force attacks:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)
salted_password = bytes(password, "utf-8") + salt
hashed = hashlib.sha256(salted_password)
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "salt": base64.b64encode(salt).decode("ascii"),
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "salt": "R0lGODlhAQABAAAAADs=",
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": "6ONMDzdYZltRuM8j0EaG0eUgY0ooPj/m09MqlnGJ3AQ="
}
</code>   

<p>As with the examples above, the salt must be unique to each password you hash. However, if you want to get the exact same output as our example output, you can change the line in the example code where the <code>salt</code> is defined to look like this:</p>

   <code>salt = b"\x47\x49\x46\x38\x39\x61\x01\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00;"
</code>   

 With Salt and Pepper 
<p>I mentioned “pepper” above, which adds another layer of entropy and length to your password before hashing. Typically, pepper is stored on your server, independent of your database. Something like an environment variable is common:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets
import base64
import os
import json

DEFAULT_PEPPER = "Qk0eAAAAAAAAABoAAAAMAAAAAQABAAEAGAAAAP8A"
password = "test password"

salt = secrets.token_bytes(16)
pepper = base64.b64decode(os.getenv('PEPPER', DEFAULT_PEPPER))
salted_and_peppered_password = bytes(password, "utf-8") + salt + pepper
hashed = hashlib.sha256(salted_and_peppered_password)
result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "salt": base64.b64encode(salt + pepper).decode("ascii"),
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii")
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>Example output:</p>
   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-256",
    "salt": "R0lGODlhAQABAAAAADtCTR4AAAAAAAAAGgAAAAwAAAABAAEAAQAYAAAA/wA=",
    "saltOrder": "POSTFIX",
    "value": "gWVt3W2f5I83NLwYtyf3Ac0uomcY+bymCd6IEaJoS+8="
}
</code>   

<p>Salt and pepper can be added to the beginning or end of the original password. There’s no substantive difference from a security standpoint, so pick one and obviously, be consistent.</p>

 SHA-512 
<p>SHA-512 uses the same method as SHA-256 to hash strings into fixed 512-bit objects (128 hexadecimal characters). A longer output size means an even higher resistance to collision and length extension attacks, so while both SHA-256 and SHA-512 are still not known to have any inherent security vulnerabilities when used properly, SHA-512 should, in theory, remain harder to break for longer than SHA-256.</p>

<p>Still, like SHA-256, SHA-512 is primarily meant to be used to establish file authenticity and not for password hashing. It can be done, though, so let’s take a look at the algorithm in Python.</p>

 Hash Only 
<p>Again, you can use hashlib to hash a string or password with SHA-512:</p>

import hashlib
import base64
import json

password = "test password"

hashed = hashlib.sha512(bytes(password, 'utf-8'))

result = {
    "algorithm": "SHA-512",
    "value": base64.b64encode(hashed.digest()).decode("ascii"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "SHA-512",
    "value": "Z73OpRFbwfE/zOD3C+OGmlv0j+p77N2+zBeKUgjcFzYuaji1NHGHkP7biq6h11Knn5wJqHAzLLhG+4DTEJMdBQ=="
}
</code>   

<p>One thing to think about as you use more secure hashing algorithms like SHA-512 is the length of the hashed password. While database storage is cheap (and only getting cheaper), if you put a 64 or 100-character limit on your password field for some reason, using SHA-512 will be a problem. <a href="https://www.diwebsity.com/2019/08/10/password-security-standards/">Never truncate a password</a> before or after hashing in an attempt to fit it into your database. Make your database fields appropriate for the length of text you need to store.</p>

 With Salt 
<p>Like SHA-256, if you’re using SHA-512, you should definitely add a salt to reduce the risk of rainbow table attacks. Fortunately, the process is exactly the same as it is in the cases above:</p>

import hashlib
import secrets

</code>   

 Bcrypt 
<p>The MD5 and SHA families of hash algorithms <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/46552">are meant to be fast</a>, so they’re primarily used to verify file signatures and certificates where delays would mean a poor user experience. While they’ve been used as password hashing methods in the past, this is no longer considered best practice because algorithms that can generate hashes quickly are inherently more vulnerable to hackers who calculate billions of hashes to perform brute force attacks.</p>

<p>Algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a> were purpose-built to slow down this kind of attack. Bcrypt embeds a salt into each hash and implements a “cost factor” that lets developers increase the security of their hashes (by trading off a longer hash generation time). Adding a half-second delay every time to a user’s login time probably won’t bother your users much, but a half-second delay will slow hackers down dramatically when they’re trying to generate billions of hashes.</p>

 Hash with Salt 
<p>Unlike the previous algorithms discussed, bcrypt requires a 128-bit salt (which is Radix-64 encoded as 22 characters) to hash a password, so there’s no option to hash without one. Fortunately, most bcrypt packages include helpers that will generate the salt for you.</p>

<p>Python doesn’t include a bcrypt implementation in its standard library, so you’ll need to import one. Here I’m using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/">bcrypt</a> which I installed with <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/">pip</a>:</p>

import bcrypt
import json

WORK_FACTOR = 2
DIGEST = 3
SPLIT_POSITION = 22

password = "test password"

salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
mcf_bytes = bcrypt.hashpw(bytes(password, 'utf-8'), salt)
mcf = mcf_bytes.decode("utf-8").split("$")
result = {
    "algorithm": "BCRYPT",
    "workFactor": int(mcf[WORK_FACTOR]),
    "salt": mcf[DIGEST][:SPLIT_POSITION],
    "value": mcf[DIGEST][SPLIT_POSITION:],
    # "original": mcf_bytes.decode("utf-8"),
}
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))

<p>Output:</p>

   <code></code>   

<p>The output should look something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "algorithm": "BCRYPT",
    "workFactor": 12,
    "salt": "JRTqctXrmURv1zqEjMX8Uu",
    "value": "6FU1hdF4DOr3vbwyEvx8JW9eSKUvvSO",
}
</code>   

<p>Note that <code>bcrypt</code> encourages the best practice of creating a salt for each password by giving you the <code>bcrypt.gensalt()</code> function. However, like with our other examples, if you want to see how I got the example output above, you can have bcrypt use the same salt as you see in the example.</p>

<p>As you can see, the resulting hash from bcrypt is a little different from the strings generated by previous algorithms. Bcrypt uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description">a very specific structure</a> for its hashes, which allows you to increase the work factor and define the hash algorithm in the hash itself. This can be useful if later versions of the bcrypt algorithm implement bug fixes or improvements.</p>

 Choosing a Password Hashing Algorithm 
<p>While bcrypt is a secure and appropriate option for hashing your passwords, there will always be <a href="https://pthree.org/2016/06/28/lets-talk-password-hashing/">varying opinions</a> on the “best” way to implement password security on the internet. Other viable options include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2">Argon2</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, your password hashing algorithm should:</p>

 
   Consistently produce the same hash for the same input string 
   Be unique to each possible password given 
   Work quickly enough for end-users 
   Slow down attackers who gain access to your hashed passwords 
 

<p>There may be no such thing as a “perfect” password hashing algorithm for all time, though. As computing power increases and becomes cheaper, researchers will have to continue building stronger hashing algorithms.</p>

 Using Hashed Passwords 
<p>Now that you understand how to hash a password properly in Python, it’s time to talk about how you’ll actually use these hashed passwords. In practice, there are three typical workflows you might face when dealing with hashed passwords.</p>

 Storing Hashed Passwords 
<p>When a user signs up for your service, they will typically enter a username and password in plaintext. When they click “submit,” the username and password are sent to your server (hopefully, over an encrypted SSL connection) where you should:</p>

 
   Validate that the password meets your <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/Creating-a-Password-Policy?language=en_US">password requirements</a> 
   Hash the password using your chosen algorithm 
   Save the hashed password, salt (if needed), and username to your database 
   Return a success message to the user 
   Either log the user in immediately or ask to log in using their new password 
 

<p></p>

<p>If you’re using a SQL database, you should store the hashed password as a <code>BINARY(X)</code>, where <code>X</code> is the length of the binary generated by your hashing algorithm (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5882472/977192">60 in bcrypt’s case</a>). Storing the password in binary could be important as <code>CHAR</code> fields in some character encodings do not distinguish between capital and lower-case letters.</p>

<p>It’s also important to note that if you use bcrypt, you don’t need to store your salts <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6833165/977192">as it builds them into the hash</a>.</p>

 Validating Hashed Passwords 
<p>Once you’ve stored a user’s hashed password, you are ready to validate it next time they log in. Typically, the password validation flow looks like this:</p>

 
   User enters username and password on the login page 
   The username and plaintext password is sent to your server over an encrypted SSL connection 
   You retrieve a user (with their password and salt) from your database by their unique username 
   You hash the plaintext password using the same salt 
   You compare the hashed password stored in your database with the one submitted on the login page 
   If they match exactly you can safely proceed with user authentication 
 

<p></p>

<p>Many hashing libraries take care of some of these steps for you. For example, bcyrpt includes <a href="https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt/#password-hashing">a <code>checkpw</code> function that compares a binary plaintext password to your stored hash</a>. When available, you should use these built-in functions because they’ll prevent you from making errors in your password validation logic.</p>

 Importing Users with Hashed Passwords into Okta 
<p>Finally, you may someday need to import user accounts with hashed passwords into a third-party service like <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta’s</a>. User authentication often starts relatively simply, but as you start to build more complex and secure features, you’ll realize that it takes a lot of work to maintain. Okta can handle password resets, forgotten passwords, enterprise SSO, JWTs, and much more for you, making it much easier to maintain a secure and scalable authentication process.</p>

<p>To import existing users with hashed passwords into Okta, you’ll need to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-imported-hashed-password">make a <code>POST</code> request to their <code>/users</code> endpoint</a>. The payload of your request should include the user’s email, profile information, and details about their password and the algorithm used:</p>

<p>Use this command to create a user in Okta named “Isaac Brock” that has a password with the value of “test password” - note that the value of the “hash” part of the payload exactly matches the example above!</p>

   <code>curl -v -X POST \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: SSWS ${api_token}" \
-d '{
  "profile": {
    "firstName": "Isaac",
    "lastName": "Brock",
    "email": "isaac.brock@example.com",
    "login": "isaac.brock@example.com",
    "mobilePhone": "555-415-1337"
  },
  "credentials": {
    "password" : {
      "hash": {
        "algorithm": "BCRYPT",
        "workFactor": 12,
        "salt": "HrtURKVYwHEOR/PMBBakyu",
        "value": "51qdkp4j1j0NoqwlXhHhCfiM1dqxUP2"
      }
    }
  }
}' "https://${yourOktaDomain}/api/v1/users?activate=false"
</code>   

<p>Okta’s API will return a user ID, which you can then store in your database. Now, instead of validating a user’s username and password yourself every time they log in, you can pass the request over to Okta or <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Settings/custom-okta-hosted-sign-in-page.htm">use an Okta-hosted sign-on screen</a>. Once Okta authenticates the user, you can use their user ID to look up profile data you maintain in your own database.</p>

<p>You can use this same pattern to create users with pre-existing hashed passwords. Just change the value of the “hash” portion of the payload to any password that was hashed using code as you saw in the examples above.</p>

 Learn More 
<p>While this guide takes you deep into password hashing in Python, there are still many password security topics that I haven’t covered. For example, how do you set strong password requirements? Should you validate that users aren’t reusing compromised passwords? What other password hashing algorithms are out there? Here are a few more resources you should check out:</p>

  <p>ForgeRock has a rich history of transforming the digital identity experiences for the most successful companies on the planet. The announcement of Okta’s intent to acquire Auth0 underscores the importance of this market. It’s more exciting than ever to be part of ForgeRock as we execute on our mission of helping organizations create digital identity experiences that are frictionless and intuitive while still protecting the security of the enterprise in a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a> environment.</p>

 We’re in a Better Position than Ever Before to Lead the Way 

<p>In light of the news, I was reflecting on what we hear consistently from customers. Based on research and experience, some things have become crystal clear. To support the future of work and digital transformation, ForgeRock is uniquely poised and ready to help customers meet their requirements as they embark on their modernization journey.</p>

 User Experience and Security – Without Compromise 

<p>Today’s end user won’t tolerate a poor experience, and businesses can’t risk security vulnerabilities. When you try to balance security and experience, you usually end up with an approach that’s mediocre at best. At ForgeRock, our purpose is to help users safely and simply access the connected world. We help organizations deepen their relationships with their customers and improve the productivity of their workforce – all while growing revenues and saving costs; increasing security and compliance; and reducing fraud and risk. Using our unique <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access Trees</a>, our customers can avoid compromise and deliver exceptional and secure experiences.</p>

 A Purpose-built, Enterprise-grade IAM Platform&nbsp; 

<p>This means support for any kind of identity: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">consumers</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">services, or things</a>. It means support for key functionality: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">access managemen</a>t, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a>. It means providing powerful extensibility, configurability, scalability, and performance. It means protecting applications and application programming interfaces (APIs). And it means integration support for any kind of app, whether modern microservices-based, mobile, web, or legacy. This is what you get with ForgeRock.</p>

 Cloud-based Solutions that Support Hybrid IT 

<p>According to a soon-to-be released survey of more than 300 IAM decision makers at large organizations, 98% of respondents who have adopted cloud-based IAM solutions have experienced challenges mapping and integrating them into their existing processes and legacy systems. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-your-business-transformation-catalyst">Customers want a platform</a> that they can integrate into their current reality while modernizing their infrastructure. With our simplified pricing model, ForgeRock enables customers to consume our technology as a cloud service, deploy into self-managed environments – or both. Customers can deploy identity management where and how they need it to support their hybrid architectures.&nbsp;</p>

 Control Over Data&nbsp; 

<p>To meet global security and regulatory requirements, organizations require flexibility in how they consume identity services and where their data is stored. Customers want to be sure the performance of their environment is not affected by others. They need assurance that their data is not comingled, and they want to avoid nosy and noisy neighbor problems. ForgeRock’s <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">unique cloud architecture</a> does just that, while providing customers the time to value they have come to expect from a cloud-based service.</p>

 Acceleration of Digital Transformation by Putting an End to Identity Silos&nbsp; 

<p>As customers push to modernize, they are struggling with how to manage the numerous identity silos that crop up across their organizations. We call this <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/bring-digital-identity-out-shadows-fuel-digital-transformation">Shadow Identity</a>, and it leads to poor customer experiences and increased security risks. Our industry has spent decades tearing down silos of identity in order to unify identity in customers’ environments in order to provide better experiences and reduce security risks. Understandably, these companies are moving fast, but it is imperative that they take a strategic view of identity that will support their goals today and in the future. ForgeRock enables organizations to harmonize their identity while enabling business agility to move fast.</p>

<p>No matter what the business driver is – &nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">Zero Trust</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/your-iam-future-in-the-cloud-checklist">cloud adoption</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a>, or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">modernization</a> – ForgeRock is uniquely equipped to deliver world-class business outcomes on a global scale without compromise. We believe the news this week solidifies our position as the only identity solution provider that can set the identity standard for enterprises: One platform, Any identity.</p>

   Differences, Benefits, and Disadvantages of Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud 

<p>Organizations are rapidly adopting hybrid IT and hybrid cloud architectures. In fact, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/3991263">Gartner</a> predicts that spending on public cloud services in 2021 will total more than $304 billion. And, as it pertains to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">identity and access management (IAM)</a>, <a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/global-cloud-iam-market-size-and-forecast-to-2025/">Verified Market Research</a> projects that, by 2027, the market for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud-based IAM</a> will be more than $14 billion.</p>

<p>With these significant numbers in mind, let’s review the differences between hybrid IT and hybrid cloud as well as the benefits and disadvantages of each.&nbsp;</p>

 The Difference Between Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud 

<p>Here are simple definitions of hybrid IT and hybrid cloud.</p>

  Hybrid IT: A type of IT architecture that consists of infrastructure, applications, and services located on premises within an enterprise data center, as well as one or more private cloud(s) and public cloud(s). 
	 Hybrid Cloud: A type of IT architecture that consists of applications, services, and systems located in private cloud(s) and public cloud(s). 
 <p>Put another way, <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/thomas_bittman/2012/09/24/mind-the-gap-here-comes-hybrid-cloud/">Gartner</a> defines hybrid cloud as “a cloud computing service composed of some combination of private, public, and community cloud services, from different service providers.”</p>

<p>Note that the main difference between hybrid IT and hybrid cloud is the on premises data center component. However, if an on-premises environment is running as a cloud service within an enterprise’s data center, then it would be considered private cloud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Importantly, a hybrid IT architecture is a superset of hybrid cloud. Meaning hybrid IT may contain a hybrid cloud environment(s) within it.&nbsp;</p>

 Benefits of Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud 

<p>With a hybrid IT architecture you get to choose which environment to use for specific applications. You can leverage the data residency, privacy, and control of on-premises architectures as well as the agility, flexibility, and scalability of cloud computing that best suits your organization.</p>

<p>With on-premises environments, you have complete control over data within the confines of your data center. You determine what data is private and on which physical servers it should reside. You can also parse data needed for certain applications and can even limit data to certain servers that have special cryptographic hardware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the flip side, for applications that do not need an extreme level of security and control, running them in a cloud environment is a better option. The flexibility and agility of the cloud allows you to create and use server instances dynamically as needed. This frees you from investing in large data centers, from spending money to keep excess capacity on hand for sudden growth, and from waiting for weeks and months for new hardware to start any new projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cost savings is another benefit of hybrid IT and hybrid cloud. You realize these cost savings as you reuse investments already made in your existing on-premises infrastructure, and only pay for the capacity you use with cloud.</p>

 Disadvantages of Hybrid IT and Hybrid Cloud 

<p>While the benefits above are significant enough to drive the majority of enterprise organizations to adopt hybrid IT and hybrid cloud, there are disadvantages. A major downside is that hybrid IT and hybrid cloud architectures typically consist of multiple separated environments and a combination of home-grown, legacy, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">modern IAM systems</a>. However, on-premises IAM systems don’t have the capabilities to meet cloud environment requirements, and cloud-based IAM systems don't have the capabilities required to secure on-premises environments.</p>

<p>Disjointed on-premises and cloud-based IAM results in siloed identities. This makes it difficult to identify and monitor high-risk user access enterprise-wide. Unknown risk awareness can lead to potential data breaches, fines and other financial consequences, as well as reputational damage. Additionally, multiple disjointed IAM systems can hinder the ability to provide seamless user experiences, innovate, and move at the speed of business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want your organization to be successful in today’s fast-paced, highly digital world, it’s critical to address these risks. How do you do that?</p>

<p>With hybrid IAM. Hybrid IAM is a single IAM platform capable of running, managing, and unifying digital identities across on-premises and cloud environments with hybrid IT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In our next IAM 101 Series blog post, we’ll cover the basics of hybrid IAM. Until then, learn more about how the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">ForgeRock Identity Platform can be used flexibly within any deployment model: on premises, any cloud, and as-a-service</a>.</p>

<p>On February 9th, 2021 <a href="https://coppermark.org/multi-metal-coalition-publishes-joint-standard-to-respond-to-lme-responsible-sourcing-rules/">a new due diligence standard</a> for copper, lead, nickel and zinc was released by the Copper Mark, the International Lead Association, the International Zinc Association, the Nickel Institute, the Responsible Minerals Initiative, and with financial support from the International Copper Association.</p><p>The <a href="https://coppermark.org/copper-mark-requirements/due-diligence/">new standard</a> was created to “enable responsible supply chain management in copper, lead, nickel and zinc industries.”</p><p>According to the official release “The Standard takes into account the risk profile of copper, lead, nickel and zinc (the principal covered metals) supply chains and is designed to enable effective due diligence for producers and/or traders of these metals. It intends to build on existing standards and looks to provide flexibility for multi-metal producers to include materials intended for the production of metal products other than of principal covered metals at their site(s) as&nbsp;needed.”</p><p>Producers and traders of these metals will be required to implement the five-step due diligence process defined in <a href="https://www.oecd.org/corporate/mne/mining.htm">the OECD Guidance,</a> and will have to follow principles of continual improvement, accountability, engagement, inclusivity, transparency, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This is a global standard that will impact companies extracting, producing, and trading the principal materials, and it officially comes into effect in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>While there will be challenges for those companies who need to comply with the new standard, we believe that this is a step in the right direction for the metals and minerals industry. At Peer Ledger, we support companies in responsible supply chain management and due diligence. Our <a href="https://peerledger.com/supply-chain">MIMOSI Connect</a> platform is a highly flexible blockchain traceability tool that enables companies to capture important metrics along their supply chain and comply with standards. We believe that supply chain transparency is not only good for the planet but good for business. We are excited to support more companies in their adoption of responsible supply chain management.</p> References   The Copper Mark, Multi-metal Coalition Publishes Joint Standard to Respond to LME Responsible Sourcing Rules.

<p>#ThrowbackThursday&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below is an article from 2018 highlighting the best ways for development teams to tackle GDPR compliance whilst&nbsp;minimising&nbsp;the impact on your existing processes and teams. A great summary of best practice and cultural improvements to keep yourselves protected and ethical when working with sensitive data.&nbsp;</p>



 Practical guidance for developers to shape their GDPR strategy&nbsp; 



<p>What final steps should system architects and developers take now to ensure they have all bases covered?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the huge volume of publicity there’s been around General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), there was a heightened sense of concern at a developer event I attended recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of&nbsp;the&nbsp;session,&nbsp;several people came forward, asking for clear guidance on what GDPR means at a practical level for developers and architects working with people’s personal data. Despite having made various preparations, they wanted to understand how other companies are addressing the common problems, recommended thought processes when evaluating work, and how to more fully address the risks and issues in their decision-making.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t help that this is chiefly a compliance exercise. So, while companies&nbsp;recognise&nbsp;they must put in place robust measures, they don’t really want to expend more energy or budget on this than they need to. So how can they cover themselves comprehensively, without taking too much of their resources and focus from the core functionality and differentiating qualities of their products?&nbsp;</p>



 Practising&nbsp;a duty of care&nbsp; 



<p>In my last conference&nbsp;presentation&nbsp;I threw my wallet into the audience, reeling off my expectations of the person who caught it – as its temporary custodian. Keep it within sight, don’t pass it on to anyone else, and so on. When people share personal data with us, they have similarly reasonable assumptions. That custodians of their personal assets treat them with respect and will not abuse the access privileges they’ve been given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In sharing something about themselves, individuals might hope to enjoy greater convenience and a more&nbsp;personalised&nbsp;service, for instance. If those benefits feel real, the trade is a fair one and everyone is happy. But if all they get in return is unsolicited third-party marketing or a general sense of unease that someone might hack into their personal details, people’s desire to disclose information about themselves diminishes. Empowered by the new provisions under GDPR, they may take steps to ensure their data is locked down or deleted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that becomes a hassle for everyone concerned – including the customer who receives a poorer service and the company that is forced to take a big step backwards in its customer intimacy and the sophistication of its marketing.&nbsp;</p>



 Covering the basics&nbsp; 



<p>When Uber had 57 million customer accounts stolen in a major breach of its security, it turned out to be because developers had stored customers’ passwords in GitHub, a central portal for managing version control for application source code. Although all developers know not to do this kind of thing (another common error being to use real data in testing), pressures to deliver features to deadlines can prompt development teams to cut corners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GDPR compliance at a practical level, then, isn’t about board-level box checking and a badge on the company website. It’s about understanding where and how systems and processes touch and use sensitive personal data, and then putting operational checks in to ensure that nothing is left to chance. And this must be tasked to people who know what they’re doing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good news is that there’s a lot of practical&nbsp;help out&nbsp;there if companies want to manage GDPR themselves – to ensure that suitable security and data protection is built&nbsp;into&nbsp;a development team’s pipeline of checks, before code goes live. Tools and tips include the ‘privacy by design’ protocol, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and SANS Institute vulnerability checklists.&nbsp;</p>



 Balancing innovation and housekeeping&nbsp; 



<p>The other alternative is to simplify your GDPR position by letting someone else be the keeper of people’s personal data, their permissions and how these are managed. Development communities already&nbsp;recognise&nbsp;the convenience of third-party logins for managing access to applications (‘log in using Facebook’, for example).&nbsp;So,&nbsp;one practical workaround to GDPR is to extend a similar approach to personal data management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given that no business came to dominate its market through its ‘world-beating compliance’ credentials (a condition of doing business, rather than a differentiator), it may well be better to hand the responsibility to an expert.&nbsp;Certainly,&nbsp;it would alleviate a whole heap of worry for developers who, in an agile-obsessed, fast-fail world, have enough on their plates delivering the latest service innovation.&nbsp;I’ll&nbsp;be picking up this theme at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bihlRzNIo5k">Devoxx in London, which takes place May 9-11</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MyLife&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;has a developer API&nbsp;programme. Let&nbsp;our&nbsp;platform handle key aspects of security and management of personal data and&nbsp;people’s&nbsp;rights so that you can focus development effort on customer features.

Okta’s solutions are designed for organizations that want to quickly enable cloud-delivered identity and seamlessly interoperate with other SaaS applications.</p>
<p>Auth0 had a different entry point into the realm of IAM. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80329/auth0-platform/" title="Auth0 was aimed at developers">Auth0 was aimed at developers,</a> both in functionality and their marketing approach. Auth0’s founders knew that this was an underserved market. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80111/consumer-identity-and-access-management-solution/" title="Consider a case where a company needs to expose one or two major applications to consumers">Consider a case where a company needs to expose one or two major applications to consumers.</a> They don’t think they need a full-blown Consumer IAM (CIAM) solution. They just want to wrap an identity layer around those applications and open them up for business. This is Auth0’s forte and what has driven their unicorn level success. Auth0 has been a pioneer in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lb80501" title="identity fabric architectures">identity fabric architectures</a> and a leading <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc79012/identity-api-platforms/" title="Identity API Platform">Identity API Platform</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Okta has both enterprises and SMBs as customers – those who want cloud-native, scalable, and interoperable solutions that are easy to deploy and maintain. Okta has integration, or out-of-the-box connectors, for many, many SaaS apps. For organizations moving to the cloud, they make it easy to take identity there as well.</p>
<p>Here are the strengths each has:</p>




<p>Okta</p>


<p>Auth0</p>




<p>Highly scalable, cloud-native identity services</p>


<p>Strong emphasis on cloud but with on-prem options</p>




<p>Lots of SaaS connectors in marketplace</p>


<p>Code snippets for easy custom application integration</p>




<p>Rapid onboarding of customers</p>


<p>Identity fabric architecture</p>




<p>Focused on security</p>


<p>API-first from the beginning</p>




<p></p>
<p>Okta and Auth0 have different origins and different approaches, but both have had great success in IAM. Though the stated price seems high, Okta will in time realize that their investment adds capabilities to their portfolio that will appeal to additional customer prospects, as well as add to their customer base.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/tolbert/ma-activity-in-cybersecurity-and-iam" title="Every major acquisition in IT brings the question of what happens to the purchased company and its technology">Every major acquisition in IT brings the question of what happens to the purchased company and its technology.</a> Auth0 will reportedly operate somewhat independently at first, while integration options are evaluated internally. In cases of large acquisitions in the past within this industry, some buyers make the move to pick up customers and market share only. The purchased product essentially disappears. In this case, given that Auth0’s go-to-market strategy and customer base are quite different from their own, Okta would fare best at integrating Auth0 technology and adding the GTM strategy to their own, rather than allowing those to disappear.</p>
<p>Though CIAM emerged from IAM as a result of evolving requirements, we are starting to see movement from both CIAM and IAM vendors toward offering more unified solutions, with an emphasis on cloud-delivered services. From a functionality combination perspective, this acquisition of Auth0 by Okta could be very good for customers. Time will tell how this pairing will work out.</p>
<p>This move reduces the number of large vendors in IAM markets such as IDaaS, CIAM, and Authentication Services. However, as we have seen in recent Leadership Compasses, there are new and regional vendors appearing to address emerging requirements in those specialties. For more information, see our very recent Leadership Compasses on <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80062/enterprise-authentication-solutions/" title="Enterprise Authentication">Enterprise Authentication</a>, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80257/access-management/" title="Access Management">Access Management</a>, and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80040/ciam-platforms/" title="CIAM Platforms">CIAM Platforms</a>.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole will follow this and other news in the IAM field. In fact, new reports covering vendors and cloud-delivered IAM services will soon be published.</p>

 AERGO-Xangle,’Permanent storage of public announcement records on the blockchain’… Increase transparency in information disclosure and strengthen investor protection <p>Xangle, a virtual asset information portal based on public disclosure data, announced on February 4th that it plans to record project disclosures on the public blockchain AERGO, a blockchain platform for enterprises. With this collaboration, Xangle aims to store disclosure records on the blockchain, improve transparency of disclosure services, and increase protection for investors.</p><p>Xangle plans to develop a mirroring service based on the DTT Alliance (Decentralized Trusted Timestamping), a data verification alliance, and record the disclosures on the AERGO mainnet blockchain.</p><p>This is expected to secure higher transparency and security than the existing public announcement service. It is also possible to implement a ‘blockchain native’ public announcement service that detects various on-chain activities such as token burns or large-scale movements, records it on the AERGO mainnet, and disclose&nbsp;it.</p><p>There have been many instances where investors incurred losses due to unreliable information uploaded by various projects. In certain projects, the contents of the presentation were altered or the notices deleted. Due to these reasons, it has been difficult to make investment decisions based on trust and reliability of information.</p><p>When disclosures are recorded on the AERGO mainnet, issues around deletion or manipulation of investment prospectus can be prevented. In addition, investment decisions can be better made with information that can be trusted, as the information has been recorded on the immutable trustless public blockchain. Recording on the public blockchain will alleviate concerns of monopolization of public information.</p><p>Xangle has been archiving records of project disclosures published on it’s own platform. Once archived, it was not possible to modify or delete any changes, and if there were any changes, it has been published in the form of ‘corrective disclosure’. Xangle has kept public records as transaction details are permanently recorded on the blockchain ledger.X</p><p>Xangle is the only domestic and foreign virtual asset disclosure information portal, and aims to integrate and standardize information so that information can be viewed more transparently when the value of digital assets is transacted across borders and languages. In Xangle, you can view off-chain and on-chain information of more than 2,000 blockchain projects, and about 8,000 public announcements have been published.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-xangle-permanent-storage-of-public-announcement-records-on-the-blockchain-increase-bc230d33cf0d">AERGO-Xangle,’Permanent storage of public announcement records on the blockchain’… Increase…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>…the one critical thing we are all missing is a consistent and accurate vocabulary. Throughout decades of academic work, many authors proposed definitions for IAM terms and concepts. Yet, as a discipline, as an industry, as a career specialization, and as a research field, we failed to consolidate this and build a reference IAM dictionary, allowing us to communicate with precision and clarity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session, I will present you with the TOME community project. Its goal is to become that reference dictionary. It is built as an open wiki to allow all experts to contribute. It is free of charge and licensed under Creative Commons to facilitate its widespread adoption. It is rooted in science with pervasive references from the literature to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
 Learning objectives 
 
 See how numerous, inconsistent and confusing IAM terms are in everyday usage 
 Realize how developing a clear and accurate vocabulary may contribute to the success of IAM

Banks had been issuing two-factor authenticators to their customers already in the '90s. These means of strong authentication were quickly adopted by public and private sector services that required more than passwords. Mobile network operators began to offer PKI based SIM authentication. These two solutions and their somewhat legacy protocols conquered the strong authentication market and were the de-facto methods subscribing to or accessing services. Advances in technology, eIDAS, PSD2, and user expectations required a complete overhaul of the strong authentication landscape for the whole country. What happened and why?

  <p>Leveraging what you have and extending it by new services and architectures to support today’s and tomorrow’s business demand on IAM.</p>
<p>IAM (Identity and Access Management) is no longer just an administrative tool or a solution supporting your regulatory compliance requirements. It is a business enabler, as well as an IT enabler. It is a central element of every cybersecurity strategy. It enables managing and access control for everyone from employees to consumers and everything from things to software robots. It is a foundation for your success in digital transformation. It also enables IT transformation, by managing access to all the clouds and services you have to deal with.</p>
<p>But: How to get to a modern IAM form where you may be today? What to preserve, what to extend, what to add, what to retire? And how to do such a migration in a way that you can serve the business demand rapidly, while gaining the time you need for more complex migrations – and while preserving investments in times of tight budgets?</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, will discuss these aspects and explain how the paradigm of an Identity Fabric can help you in successfully modernizing your IAM, at your own pace. He also will shed a light on the state of the market and the maturity of offerings serving the Identity Fabrics model.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-fabrics-future-proofing-iam-2021-03-03-kuppinger"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Oracle has unveiled new interesting capabilities in the Oracle database today, which they refer to as <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/database/how-to-achieve-crypto-secure-data-management">Immutable and Blockchain tables</a>. While I am not entirely convinced by the names they have chosen, I can absolutely get behind the overall Crypto-secure data management concept that has emerged along with them.</p>
<p>Whenever people discuss various applications of cryptography for information protection, they almost inevitably tend to think about encryption or, in other words, protecting the data’s confidentiality. However, while keeping the data out of reach of unauthorized persons is arguably the most important task of cybersecurity and compliance, it is not the only one. The CIA triad of information security refers to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data as the three principles that must be applied in balance to ensure full protection.</p>
<p>Oracle databases already have a multitude of security features to ensure data confidentiality including encryption and data masking, access management, and threat prevention – that’s why the company was recognized as one of the leaders in our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/report/lc80294">Leadership Compass on Database and Big Data Security</a>. The same applies to availability – the Oracle Autonomous Database was basically designed for this purpose. However, data integrity is a trickier subject. There are multiple ways malicious actors, especially company insiders or administrators, could modify corporate data stored in databases without ever tripping any security controls – after all, how would a database firewall distinguish an illegal modification of financial data from a valid transaction?</p>
<p>Blockchain has become the go-to solution for such challenges in recent years. At least in its original sense, Blockchain is just a data structure specifically designed to be resistant to modifications in its data using timestamps and cryptographic hashes of previous blocks to record new ones. Often, however, the name is associated with public distributed ledgers that were created specifically for multiple, potentially untrusted parties working without central oversight.</p>
<p>This is why, by the way, I don’t think calling the new immutable and cryptographically verified tables in the Oracle database “Blockchain tables” was such a good idea. While technically correct, it can be somewhat misleading since Oracle does not rely on distributed ledgers for this implementation. What it does is to provide additional security controls for data that by design is required to be immutable and to prevent malicious insiders from tampering with it, even if they have all the necessary access rights and encryption keys at hand.</p>
<p>Such data can be anything from financial transactions to IoT sensor measurements – but until now you would need to write it into a separate ledger, either a “proper” distributed Blockchain or a specialized database like Amazon’s Quantum Ledger DB. Of course, distributed Blockchains require a dedicated and potentially expensive infrastructure to maintain, but even in a centralized ledger, your data is still stored in a separate information silo. Oracle’s new table types however are for all intents and purposes just like other tables in a relational database, only with additional protection features. They support all kinds of operations (other than modifying existing records, obviously), can be queried using standard SQL, and do not need to be exported to yet another location to run analytic workloads.</p>
<p>In addition to making records in a table immutable and signed with cryptographic digests, functions were added to simplify data verification – both through the database engine or independently through external utilities to ensure that even hacking the database itself won’t help the malicious actors.</p>
<p>Additionally, to prevent storing falsified data in a blockchain table using stolen credentials, the database can optionally allow users to sign each record with their private keys and countersign them with Oracle’s keys to ensure that the data was not manipulated anywhere between the user and the database. Cryptographic digests can be automatically distributed when a new row is inserted – over email or an API. They can even be exported into a public distributed ledger. This ensures that even large-scale manipulations, when whole databases are replaced to hide malicious activities, can be promptly uncovered.</p>
<p>Anyway, even if the new immutable and blockchain tables have less to do with “The Blockchain” than the name implies, I would argue they come with nearly all the benefits of a distributed ledger but without its massive overhead and isolation from traditional relational databases. The new capabilities are now available both in the latest Oracle Database 21c and the previous 19c release, at no extra cost for the customers.</p>

<p>A DID Method geared for privacy, formal verification, and scaling to billions of identifiers by using off-chain updates.</p><p><a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce</a> and <a href="https://tqtezos.com/">TQ Tezos</a> are jointly releasing the <a href="https://did-tezos.spruceid.com/">draft specification</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/did-tezos">initial implementation</a> of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> based on the Tezos blockchain. We began our collaboration with TQ Tezos and the wider Tezos ecosystem <a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/announcing-decentralized-identity-on-tezos-4bf266a7af3f">in August</a> to take full advantage of Tezos’ production-tested proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, ability to perform protocol upgrades, and toolsets for formal&nbsp;methods.</p><p>We welcome review of our <a href="https://did-tezos.spruceid.com/#why-a-tezos-did-method">Tezos DID Method specification</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/-/blob/master/proposals/tzip-19/tzip-19.md">TZIP-019 companion specification</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/did-tezos">open-source implementation</a> based on <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a>. A special thank you goes to Michael Klein of TQ Tezos, a co-author of this body of work, whose contributions have made this possible.</p> Quick Feature&nbsp;Overview <p>Tezos Namespace maps directly to the Tezos DID Namespace. Tezos-based DIDs are tz1, tz2, tz3, and KT1 account addresses simply prefixed with did:tz:. For example, tz1aaYoabvj2DQtpHz74Z83fSNjY29asdBfZ just becomes did:tz:tz1aaYoabvj2DQtpHz74Z83fSNjY29asdBfZ.</p><p>Tezos DIDs can be used immediately without sending any on-chain transactions. Anyone who generates a new Tezos address can use it as a DID without owning any tez, no exchange or KYC necessary. For readers familiar with the DID ecosystem, this can be thought of as did-key or did-peer with public key hash-based identifiers and a well-defined process for on-chain grafting. In short, Tezos DIDs exist by default but their properties can be optionally updated by their controllers on the Tezos blockchain, or by using signed off-chain inputs.</p><p>On-chain data minimization. Spruce takes the position that when it comes to user data, only the absolute minimum amount necessary should be stored on public blockchains. For this reason, the initial release allows only one verification method for authentication as the DID controller, and one service endpoint for linking to a protected service directory. Off-chain rotations for the same two properties are also specified, based on <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-spec-extensions/blob/master/parameters/signed-ietf-json-patch.md">signed JSON patches</a> or Tezos transactions depending on the desired security&nbsp;model.</p><p>Support for completely off-chain trust frameworks. Off-chain rotations and authorities means that the Tezos DID method allows for complete DID usage (create, read, update, deactivate) without a single transaction being sent to any public blockchain, maximizing user privacy and reducing the attack surface area. This is a common requirement we have encountered working with our customers in enterprise environments and in the public sector, who also appreciate that tz3 accounts are based on the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/elliptic-curve-cryptography">NIST recommended P-256&nbsp;curve</a>.</p> Formal verification <p>The specification defines the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/did-tezos/tree/main/contract/taquito">DID manager smart contract</a> which handles the on-chain updates to the DID document. It rotates the verification methods and service endpoints only when signed off by the active key. Anyone can pay for and send the Tezos transaction on behalf of someone else because the signed authorization is contained in an input parameter to the smart contract, similar to a&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/tzip-17-permit-497afd9b0e9e">permit</a>.</p><p>The DID Manager, like all Tezos smart contracts, is expressed in <a href="https://tezos.gitlab.io/alpha/michelson.html">Michelson</a>, a stack-based, statically typed, and functional programming language. One crucial distinction between Michelson and other smart contract languages is its facilitation of end-to-end formal verification, which has allowed the development of supporting formal verification frameworks including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08671">Mi-Cho-Coq</a> and <a href="https://runtimeverification.com/blog/formal-verification-framework-for-michelson/">K-Michelson</a>.</p><p>We are actively working with TQ Tezos and other groups within the Tezos ecosystem to scope candidate properties and create correctness proofs for them. This can demonstrate immunity from the vulnerabilities responsible for many blockchain attack vectors, including transaction ordering attacks, reentrancy bugs, and violations of state-transition invariants. By next quarter, we expect to have preliminary results incorporated into our implementation’s continuous integration and testing&nbsp;harness.</p> Scalability and P2P Messaging <p>We believe that there will exist billions of DIDs actively used by people, IoT devices, software agents, and ephemeral identities on a per-interaction basis. It should be cheap and easy to create one or more DIDs uncorrelated with any aspects of your identity except for what you specifically choose to&nbsp;reveal.</p><p>You might want to create a new identifier to share with someone you just met at a party to allow them to securely contact you without giving out your email or phone number. A cloud-based software agent might want to do the same thing but thousands of times per day and with other software agents. Supporting these off-chain structures in a standardized, unified way via emerging P2P and scalability protocols was a central commitment of our design&nbsp;process.</p><p>Concretely, the Tezos DID Method supports off-chain updates to the DID document that can be hosted on the <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree protocol</a> based on CRDTs, on top of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02143">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a>, or using DHT approaches such as in <a href="https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/">did-orb</a>. Tezos DIDs will also be able to communicate with each other privately and securely using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap">TorGap</a> (via tz1’s ed25519 keys) or&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging">DIDComm</a>.</p> Tezos ecosystem integrations <p>Tezos wallet integrations. We are working with wallets, including <a href="https://wallet.kukai.app/">Kukai</a>, to integrate support for the Tezos DID method and W3C Verifiable Credential-enabled workflows using DIDKit. This will allow Tezos users to privately demonstrate their digital credentials as a way to securely authenticate to services (i.e., “Login with&nbsp;Tezos”).</p><p>Baker credentials. We are collaborating with organizations such as <a href="https://baking-bad.org/">Baking Bad</a> to allow Tezos bakers to receive credentials demonstrating their baking history and reputations. With the Tezos DID method, these credentials can now be issued directly for use with their baker addresses or accounts authorized by their baker addresses. Bakers will be able to use their Tezos DIDs to update their metadata in a registry.</p><p>Cross-chain credentials. Blockchain users with impressive on-chain transaction histories can’t do much with them on-chain or off-chain. By using a Tezos DID, a user can demonstrate their cross-chain activity such as participation in DeFi (trading, LP) and games in order to be eligible for rewards from services and platforms in the Tezos ecosystem.</p><p>NFT authenticity verifications. The combination of credentials issued by social proofs and Tezos DIDs can allow NFT artists to demonstrate their identity for a specific Tezos account. This ensures that an artist can endorse the authenticity of their own digital creations over time, not just at time of issuance of an NFT, and in so doing reduce the ability of fraudulent digital assets to deceive purchasers.</p> Future development <p>As the Tezos protocol upgrades and the ecosystem continues to mature, we expect to make improvements to the DID method that would be difficult to replicate in other ecosystems.</p>  We are working with engineers from TQ Tezos and the wider Tezos ecosystem to prove correctness of select properties of the DID manager smart contract as part of our integration testing.  With the recent addition of <a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/tezos-edo-upgrade-network-effects-5adc20075de4#:~:text=Edo%20is%20the%20first%20Tezos,indexers%2C%20libraries%2C%20etc.)">shielded transactions in Edo</a>, it is possible to transfer assets anonymously with DID-based peer-to-peer verifications that leave no on-chain connection strings by using service endpoints.  We are closely tracking the work of the <a href="https://github.com/simplestaking/tezedge">TezEdge</a> team to enable pure Rust transaction forging in&nbsp;DIDKit.  Based on feedback from early Tezos DID users, we will be proposing our own updates to the Tezos protocol that can specifically improve support for decentralized identity.  <p>If you would like to discuss how to use the Tezos DID Method for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to leave us a&nbsp;message.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

<p>Aperte ufficialmente le iscrizioni per partecipare a This is me Hackathon_21, iniziativa creata da &nbsp;<a href="https://www.dizme.io/">DizmeID</a> Foundation in collaborazionecon <a href="https://www.cariplofactory.it/">Cariplo Factory</a>, Algorand, Fabrick, InfoCert, Legal Hackers, Sweet Legal Tech, Ben, next generation currency, blockchain4innovation, B Holding Boost Heroes, A.P.S.P. e CRAD.</p>



<p>This is me Hackathon_21 prende le mosse da un problema molto attuale: oggi la nostra identità digitale è costituita da un volume sempre crescenti di dati e informazioni sensibili su cui spesso non esercitiamo un effettivo controllo. Azioni semplici e quotidiane, come iscriversi a una newsletter o effettuare un pagamento online, nel panorama digitale attuale si traducono nella condivisione di dati personali sensibili, di cui spesso ignoriamo l’effettiva titolarità.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://www.cariplofactory.it/?page_id=8318&amp;preview=true"></a>



<p>Sulla scia di queste tematiche This is me Hackathon 21 mira a migliorare la tutela dei nostri dati online, attraverso idee originali e soluzioni innovative, promuovendo lo sviluppo di un nuovo modello di identità per un reale controllo della nostra privacy e dati personali.</p>



 Come si svolge? 



<p>This is me Hackathon_21 si articola su cinque challenge, definite in funzione dei ruoli che ciascuna persona fisica può assumere relazionandosi con gli attori di uno specifico contesto digitale:</p>



  Government to Citizen: soluzioni per il Cittadino che si relaziona con la Pubblica Amministrazione.  Business to Consumer: soluzioni per il Consumatore che accede a servizi retail, finanziari, assicurativi, utility, telco.  Business to Employee: soluzioni per lo studente che si relaziona con enti di istruzione e formazione o per il lavoratore che interagisce con l’ecosistema aziendale.  Business to Business: soluzioni per il legale rappresentante che opera in nome e per conto di una persona giuridica.  Business to Thing: soluzioni per il controllo e la gestione di asset digitali e non.  



 A chi si rivolge This is me Hackathon_21? 



 Startup 



<p>Competizione dedicata ad aziende. Le startup e organizzazioni potranno proporre una Soluzione che estende un prodotto/servizio esistente oppure realizzare una Soluzione ex-novo. In entrambi i casi la Soluzione dovrà indirizzare uno dei casi d’uso proposti nelle varie Challenge.</p>



 Talenti 



<p>Competizione dedicata a software developer ed innovatori, sia singoli individui che team già organizzati. I Talenti proporranno una Soluzione originale in risposta ad uno dei casi d’uso proposti nelle varie Challenge.</p>



 LegalTech 



<p>Studi legali e singoli professionisti esperti di digital compliance potranno partecipare al contest scegliendo uno dei casi d’uso previsti dalle Challenge e sviluppando uno studio di fattibilità che indirizzi i vincoli normativi dello specifico contesto.</p>

 Cybersecurity Summit Live 2021 



<p>In questi tempi incerti, dovuti ai cambiamenti imposti dalla pandemia di Coronavirus, il ruolo della Cybersecurity assume un ruolo di primo piano, ma vi sono anche gli aspetti legati alla sicurezza (Safety) e alla Continuità operativa del Business da tenere in considerazione.</p>



<p>Se il primo bisogno è stato soddisfatto con un ampio ricorso allo&nbsp;Smart Working, rimane oggi il tema di&nbsp;innalzare la Resilienza&nbsp;delle infrastrutture e dei servizi per il Digitale, in uno scenario in cui i&nbsp;Rischi cyber&nbsp;diventavano giorno dopo giorno più pericolosi. Tutto questo rende sempre più sfidante garantire il Trust,&nbsp;assicurare&nbsp;la Continuità del Business,&nbsp;rispondere alla Compliance e&nbsp;abilitare una&nbsp;Trasformazione digitale&nbsp;sicura&nbsp;dell’azienda.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Durante il “CYBERSECURITY SUMMIT LIVE 2021” del prossimo 9 Marzo 2021, The Innovation Group&nbsp;commenterà il&nbsp;livello di maturità della Cybersecurity raggiunto nelle organizzazioni italiane.</p>



<p>Il&nbsp;summit, giunto alla sua nona edizione,&nbsp;sarà&nbsp;in Diretta Streaming e affronterà i seguenti temi:</p>



  Il&nbsp;Perimetro&nbsp;di Sicurezza Nazionale cibernetica: stato dell’arte del regolamento, prossimi sviluppi&nbsp;  I Rischi per la&nbsp;Privacy: cosa implicherà in futuro&nbsp;il cambio di Informativa di WhatsApp?&nbsp;  Il&nbsp;Cloud&nbsp;e la cybersecurity. Quale aiuto da&nbsp;automazione&nbsp;e intelligenza artificiale&nbsp;(AI)&nbsp;  The new&nbsp;identity. Innovare l’approccio all’Identity e Access management (IAM)&nbsp;&nbsp;  Resilienza&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Compliance&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Trasformazione digitale&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Trust:&nbsp;come bilanciare la spesa&nbsp;in cybersecurity?&nbsp;  La sicurezza della&nbsp;Supply&nbsp;Chain:&nbsp;le&nbsp;best&nbsp;practice&nbsp;per il terzo millennio&nbsp;  IoT&nbsp;security: certificazione e nuovi scenari di gestione del rischio dell’internet delle cose&nbsp;  Innovare il&nbsp;SOC&nbsp;e il&nbsp;CERT, elevare la cultura della sicurezza in azienda.&nbsp;

 The GiD Report#149 — What the future of content monetization looks&nbsp;like <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-148-a-ripple-bombshell-clubhouse-and-the-rise-of-digital-cults-68d45b0d0867">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  NFTs  It’s a good time to be a&nbsp;creator  It’s not about content, it’s about&nbsp;Groups  Tweet of the&nbsp;week  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. Three letters:&nbsp;NFTs <p>What’s an NFT? NFT stands for non-fungible token. All that really means is that it’s one of a kind. (Bitcoin, on the other hand, is fully fungible. You don’t care what bitcoin you have, as long as you have it. It’s perfectly replaceable with any other bitcoin.)</p><p>A couple quick primers on&nbsp;NFTs:</p>  <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/">OpenSea — NFTs</a> (via /junhiraga)  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/what-are-nfts">Coindesk — What are NFTs?</a> (via&nbsp;/laura)  <p>NFTs aren’t really a new thing. In the real world, you have airline tickets — the last first class window seat. And we all know about domain&nbsp;names.</p><p>What’s changed now is the introduction of blockchain — which enables qualities such as interoperability, tradeability, and provable scarcity.</p><p>When applied to the digital world, it’s no wonder that images, audio, and video clips are the most popular category for NFTs. We’ve existed in an environment where all content is easily reproducible, pigeon-holing the industry into a very narrow range of business&nbsp;models.</p><p>NFTs change everything. (Insert smart contracts. Wow!)</p><p>And so — NFTs are super hot right now. (As /j pointed out, even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dFgZwpeokk">YouTuber Logan Paul is in on&nbsp;it</a>.)</p><p>Like this 10-second video clip <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-nfts/insight-how-a-10-second-video-clip-sold-for-6-6-million-idUKL8N2KV6X9">that just sold for $6.6&nbsp;million</a>:</p><blockquote>In October 2020, Miami-based art collector Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile spent almost $67,000 on a 10-second video artwork that he could have watched for free online. Last week, he sold it for $6.6&nbsp;million.</blockquote><blockquote>The video by digital artist Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann, was authenticated by blockchain, which serves as a digital signature to certify who owns it and that it is the original&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a new type of digital asset — known as a non-fungible token (NFT) — that has exploded in popularity during the pandemic as enthusiasts and investors scramble to spend enormous sums of money on items that only exist&nbsp;online.</blockquote><blockquote>Blockchain technology allows the items to be publicly authenticated as one-of-a-kind, unlike traditional online objects which can be endlessly reproduced.</blockquote><blockquote>“You can go in the Louvre and take a picture of the Mona Lisa and you can have it there, but it doesn’t have any value because it doesn’t have the provenance or the history of the work,” said Rodriguez-Fraile, who said he first bought Beeple’s piece because of his knowledge of the U.S.-based artist’s&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>“The reality here is that this is very, very valuable because of who is behind&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p>Also:</p>Photo: YouTube  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nyan-cat-nft-ethereum-meme">Nyan Cat just sold for 300&nbsp;ETH</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/here-comes-the-virtual-real-estate-boom">Here comes the virtual real estate boom</a> (via /junhiraga)  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cult-toy-brand-superplastic-launches-nft-collection-on-nifty-gateway">Cult Toy Brand Superplastic Launches NFT</a> Collection on Nifty Gateway (via /junhiraga)  <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/video/dapper-labs-ceo-discusses-digital-182406663.html">Dapper Labs CEO discusses digital trading cards via NBA Top Shot</a> (via /junhiraga)  <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/08/06/cryptokitties-creator-dapper-labs-raises-11-4-million-for-consumer-focused-flow-blockchain/">NBA top shot raises $250M, $1.2M revenue during closed&nbsp;beta</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-3f54a3d2-5468-4731-bb6e-130e2d12d798.html">Axios on the NFT&nbsp;frenzy</a>  <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/cointelegraph.com/news/new-report-predicts-nfts-will-explode-in-popularity-during-2021/amp">New report predicts NFTs will explode in popularity during 2021</a> (via&nbsp;/j)  <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tubefilter.com/2021/02/22/logan-paul-sells-5-million-nfts-pokemon-box-break/amp/">Logan Paul Sells $5 Million Worth Of NFTs Ahead Of His Pokémon Box Break — Tubefilter</a> (via&nbsp;/j)  <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/news.artnet.com/market/nyan-cat-nft-sells-for-560000-1945679/amp-page">Is This the Next Art-Market Bubble?

It’s also a good time to be a&nbsp;creator <p><a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/creators-this-is-your-time-396411">According to Keith Teare</a> (via /gregkidd):</p><blockquote>Are you a creator? Do you produce a newsletter? Videos? Podcasts? Clubhouse meetings? A Blog? Tweets? Other posts&nbsp;online?</blockquote><blockquote>If you answer yes to any of the above you are a creator and, as the title to this week’s That Was The Week says, this is your&nbsp;time.</blockquote><blockquote>Tools for creators have evolved consistently. Blogger, WordPress, Tumblr, Podcast tools, Video making tools, live streaming tools, Newsletter Tools, and more, go back many&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>Recent increases in Podcasting and Newsletters are driving awareness that creator generated content is going through a renaissance. And now the major players have noticed. Since Spotify acquired Anchor.fm and SubStack launched to acclaim, the need to serve the creator has surfaced as a major theme of innovation.</blockquote><blockquote>Clubhouse is simply another offering into the creative content platform&nbsp;space.</blockquote><p>And here’s Packy McCormick on the burgeoning creator&nbsp;economy:</p><blockquote>If you’ve spent much time on the internet recently you might have noticed something: it’s gotten really fast-paced and really fun. It just keeps getting faster and funner. Bitcoin, Clubhouse, NFTs, unicorn startups galore, the Creator Economy. Each feels simultaneously like a potential fad and a nascent revolution.From the eye of the storm, it’s hard to tell exactly what it means. Will digital artists continue to mint millions from NFTs? Will Creator Economy startups continue to raise early stage rounds at dizzying valuations? Will consumer social apps need top-tier influencer founders to cut through the&nbsp;noise?</blockquote> 3. As someone who creates content regularly, I can tell you that it’s a grind. And that’s also why the answer to the creator economy is&nbsp;Groups. <p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/content-alone-will-kill-the-creator-economy">Here’s The Information</a> on how “content alone will kill the creator economy”:</p><blockquote>In this context, when a creator has a choice between focusing on content alone or building a community too, they should absolutely choose a community as early as possible and work to develop a network&nbsp;effect.</blockquote><blockquote>In a community, members build relationships with each other, solve problems and master skills together. They come back as much for each other as they do for the next newsletter, video or course. They may initially come for what the creator produces, but they stay to talk, explore and build things with members who are near them, similar to them and who care about the same&nbsp;topics.</blockquote><blockquote>The hints of what’s possible for Richardson’s unique take on being an American are surfacing now in the comments section of her newsletter. Users pay her $5 a month, or $50 a year, for a subscription that permits them to post comments and join her community. The desire for people to connect more deeply in a space controlled by a creator they trust and away from the war for attention on Facebook points us to a more interesting future.</blockquote><blockquote>Just ask best-selling author and blogger Luvvie Ajayi Jones, Peter Diamandis of XPRIZE fame and Adriene Mishler of Yoga with Adriene, who have all found a bigger opportunity by bringing a community to their corner of the Internet. They’re selling digital subscriptions that include content, courses, events and community, all brought together in one place under their brand for their members to build relationships with each other on topics ranging from career planning to yoga and frontier technology. The result is a better product for their members and more reasons to come&nbsp;back.</blockquote><p>So yeah, don’t just make content. Start a Group. Build a community.</p> 4.

<p>2020 accelerated the adoption of many remote and digital solutions across nearly every industry. And while mortgage lending has some catch-up to play relative to some other industries in adopting digital solutions, change is happening, and it’s happening fast. Even if you’re not adopting digital mortgage solutions, many of your competitors are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But digital adoption can certainly come with its own challenges. These barriers, however, are not impenetrable, and a targeted approach to overcoming barriers to digital adoption can set you on your way to enjoying all the benefits of a digital mortgage experience.&nbsp;</p>
 Why Adopt Digital Mortgage Solutions? 
<p>Digital adoption in mortgage lending involves integrating a digital mortgage solution, such as a digital verification of assets, or transforming a traditional workflow to a digital-first model. Digital solutions enable lenders to verify income, assets, and employment without the high-friction interactions with borrowers that were complicated by pandemic restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As digital mortgage solutions have proven during the pandemic, digital adoption enables mortgage lenders to be more nimble and adapt to unexpected disruption in the market. Digital adoption also streamlines the origination process. Fannie Mae found that digital verifications can <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty">reduce cycle time by up to 12 days</a>. And that real-time data is more accurate and helps mitigate fraud and credit risk. Digital adoption has also picked up traction as it better satisfies the expectations of today’s digital consumers.</p>
<p>So what’s keeping more mortgage lenders from adopting digital solutions?&nbsp;</p>
 Barriers to Digital Adoption 
<p>Changing a mortgage lending workflow is no light task. Even if you see the benefits to digital mortgage adoption, it’s another issue entirely to actually implement digital solutions and strategies. Understanding the barriers standing between you and a successful digital adoption is the first step toward targeting and overcoming these challenges and enjoying the many returns of a digital mortgage process. Let’s take a look at some of the most common barriers to digital adoption.</p>
 1. Apprehensive Teammates and Borrowers 
<p>Frequently, the barrier to digital adoption isn’t so much technical as it is about the apprehension of the teammates who will be using the solutions and the prospective borrowers who will give their trust to the solutions. Although many consumers already share their financial data digitally, allowing access to bank account data can be intimidating for borrowers. The fact is, loan officers, processors, underwriters, and other team members may just be more comfortable with their well-worn traditional workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overcoming this barrier will require showing teammates that the returns of digital adoption far outweigh the growing pains, and assuring borrowers that the secure consumer-permissioning process actually empowers them with greater control over their financial data. It also helps to integrate a simple-to-use verification technology like Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) that <a href="https://www.finicity.com/finicity-mvs-the-smart-simple-mortgage-verification-experience/">simplifies the entire verification process</a> into a one-touch experience.</p>
 2. Integrating Technology with Traditional Systems and Workflows 
<p>At the core of digital adoption is leveraging innovative technology and solutions that enhance the mortgage experience. Adapting to new technology, however, can become a barrier when you’ve been relying on the same traditional solutions for decades. Technology must also be able to integrate with a lender’s loan origination software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, while any adoption involves some learning curve MVS is built to be intuitive and quick to integrate. And as a one-touch solution for mortgage verifications, MVS makes adaptation easy. No more using multiple processes to get the necessary information. Everything you need is in one streamlined process.</p>
 3. Changing Trusted Processes 
<p>Trust is an integral element of mortgage lending. Borrowers trust lenders with personal information and with the hope and stress of one of the most significant decisions of their lives. And you trust your tried-and-true process to deliver a low-risk, accurate origination. Traditional processes may be out-of-date, slower, and potentially higher-risk than newer processes, but it can nonetheless be difficult to leave that familiar process behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, digital adoption doesn’t necessarily involve abandoning everything about familiar processes. Instead, adoption enhances those processes. For example, <a href="https://www.phmloans.com/">Prosperity Home Mortgage</a> has implemented a hybrid lending model. They leverage Finicity’s digital verification solutions for a streamlined, competitive experience, but they also still prioritize in-person guidance for borrowers to personalize their lending experience. Prosperity maintained trusted, familiar priorities while augmenting their overall process with digital solutions.</p>
<p>Solutions like MVS also ease the enhancement of trusted processes by enabling a single process to verify assets, income, and employment. That process is also built to satisfy and exceed the expectations of today’s digital borrowers, which means this new verification solution will feel more comfortable and seamless than traditional paper-based processes.</p>
 4. Disjointed Strategy and Poor Change Management 
<p>Some lenders may have already overcome the other adoption barriers and may be on their way to integrate digital mortgage solutions. However, a disjointed adoption strategy or poor change management can become another barrier to successful adoption. Weak buy-in to the digital adoption at different levels in the organization can slow down the adoption process and prevent proper training and effective synergy between teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cohesive digital adoption strategy and effective change management involves demonstrating the benefits of digital adoption from the top of your organization on down. Successful adoption requires commitment and coordination from all. MVS can smooth out that commitment and coordination by reducing the amount of change being instituted with a single simple process, making the overall adoption easier to manage.</p>
<p>Target these digital adoption barriers and you’ll be on your way to a successful digital adoption and all the benefits that come from digital mortgage. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Service</a> can help you do just that. </p>

<p>What does a prolific 20th-century German scholar have to do with digital note-taking? Turns out quite a bit. We're looking at the note-taking system known as "Zettlekasten," and how you can use <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/announcing-tiddlywiki-on-fission/">Fission and TiddlyWiki </a>to create your own version. </p> <p>This is Niklas Luhmann. Niklas was a prolific scholar and writer--he wrote and published more than 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles.</p>This is Niklas Luhmann<p>Niklas Luhmann was such an intellectually productive badass because of the relatively ingenious yet straightforward note-taking method he developed known as “Zettelkasten.” Like so many other German words, Zettelkasten as a word is both literal and perfectly descriptive. “Zettel” means slip or note, and “kasten” means box. In essence, the Zettelkasten method is about creating a box (or any storage receptacle) in which to keep notes.</p> How Zettelkasten works <p>To use the Zettelkasten method, you only need three simple things:</p>  A way to take notes  A system with bidirectional linking  A collection of tags  <p>That’s it! But now, let’s break down each piece a little bit.</p> A note-taking system <p>Luhmann was old school--he owned no computers and used paper, pens, and a typewriter for most of his impressive writing career. He didn’t even type very quickly--he used the hunt and peck method.</p><p>In fact, his Zettelkasten was literally a box of notes in the form of a piece of furniture--sort of like a card catalog.</p>Not Luhmann's Zettelkasten, but you get the idea<p></p><p>While Luhmann’s Zettelkasten was a piece of furniture stuffed with slips of paper, today, the concept translates very well to any of the many digital note-taking systems available. Web apps like Evernote, Notion, and Google Keep offer free or low-cost ways to take notes on desktop or mobile devices. TiddlyWiki is also a great option because of it’s bidirectional linking power, which is the next crucial ingredient of a Zettelkasten.</p> A system with bidirectional linking <p>So what is bidirectional linking? It’s exactly what it sounds like--the ability to connect ideas back and forth to each other in more than one direction. One popular option of a program with this capability is the paid product Roam Research; however, TiddlyWiki offers bidirectional linking function in its free, open-source program.</p> A collection of tags <p>The last component of a Zettelkasten is a collection of tags, or labels, for your thoughts/entries. We’re used to seeing tags used frequently with blog posts or online articles. On the Fission blog, we use categories like security, apps, open-source, or headless to help readers find relevant content. Categorizing your ideas with different tags allows you to find relevant information in a note-taking system quickly. And because one idea may have more than one tag, you can easily find the relevant idea from any number of search terms.</p> Using TiddlyWiki for Zettelkasten <p>The great thing about TiddlyWiki is that it gives us the three things we need to use the Zettelkasten system.</p>  A note-taking method.  Bidirectional linking  A system of Tags  <p>TiddlyWiki offers a note-taking method with its simple interface with entries called “Tiddlers.” A new Tiddler looks like this:</p><p><br></p><p>Tiddlers are simple to tag. In our example, I added three different tags--open source, super rad ideas, and TiddlyWiki:</p><p></p><p>Let’s create a second note. This one is titled “Even New Tiddler.” And for this one, I only added one tag--Super rad ideas:</p><p><br></p><p>Now, if you search for Tiddlers with the tag “Super rad ideas,” both of our Tiddlers come up in the search results:</p><p></p> TiddlyWiki and Fission <p>As you can see, TiddlyWiki provides a simple and effective way to organize your notes using the Zettelkasten method. And now that TiddlyWiki is building a version of the TiddlyWiki app on the Fission platform, users will have a web native option to share content across browsers and devices. You get all of the benefits of TiddlyWiki’s open-source program for note-taking, tagging, and bidirectional linking, while Fission acts as a flexible container for your Zettelkasten. And Fission’s strong encryption keeps your data secure and protected.</p><p>We are working on this project out in the open. You can check out the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">TiddlyWiki group on the Fission forum</a> to keep track of this project. You can look for the launch of TiddlyWiki for Fission later this spring!</p><p>Also, check out the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/478735028319158277">Fission Discord</a>, where we are having lots of exciting conversations with other devs about current projects and all things open source. We started a channel dedicated to the TiddlyWiki on Fission experience, so be sure to drop by.</p>

					 <p>The Trinsic Wallet is a <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) digital wallet. People use it to receive, store, and share digital credentials. The Trinsic Wallet was the first <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">SSI digital wallet</a> to prove interoperability and has become one of the most-used SSI wallets globally. Not only is the wallet easy-to-use for end users, but it is extremely functional for developers who are interacting directly with the Trinsic platform since it works seamlessly with <a href="https://trinsic.id/an-introduction-to-trinsics-apis/">Trinsic’s APIs </a>and <a href="https://trinsic.id/an-introduction-to-trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>. The following is a brief overview of what the Trinsic Wallet can do and how your organization can take advantage of it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Collect credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We all carry around a leather wallet that carries cards inside. The Trinsic Wallet does that same thing for digital cards. These digital cards, or “credentials” could be a passport, driver’s license, health insurance card, etc. But the Trinsic Wallet can store more than just the “digital versions” of the cards in your leather wallet. It can store any kind of personal data in the form of a digital credential. For example, the Trinsic Wallet could carry login credentials, vaccination and test result credentials, licensing credentials, supply chain certifications, and more. These credentials are stored on the device, so no one but the end user has access to them—not even Trinsic as the wallet provider. To learn more about these “verifiable credentials”, check out this <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">blog</a> or refer to our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">documentation</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Share credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Continuing with the leather wallet analogy, the reason people carry around wallets is so they can use the contents inside them. Usually the contents of our wallet are used to prove things about ourselves to access goods and services. The Trinsic Wallet enables end users to do the same thing, but the process is paperless and more secure for all parties involved.<br><br></p><p>When an organization requests information from an end user, the end user can decide whether to accept or reject the request. If the request is accepted, the wallet will find the relevant data from all of their credentials that is needed to fulfill the request. This means only the information that is needed is shared with the organization and nothing more. For example, the end user might share their birth date from their driver’s license but not their driver’s license number or address. The end user has full control over what kind of information they share and with whom. Best of all, the information that is shared can be instantly authenticated.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Connect with others 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Finally, the wallet enables end users “to connect” with others. Connections are super-private, securely-encrypted communication channels used between two parties. You can share credentials and messages through this channel with a high degree of trust. Connections are super helpful when parties need to interact frequently, but if the relationship isn’t long-term, <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">connectionless credential exchange</a>&nbsp;is sometimes a faster, more convenient way to interact.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Unique advantages 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The Trinsic Wallet has some advantages that make it unique from some of the other digital wallets out there.<br><br></p>  Based on interoperable, open standards: This gives end users the capability to seamlessly receive and share credentials with any organization that is also using community-driven SSI standards for verifiable credential exchange (i.e., the organizations do not have to be using the Trinsic platform to issue credentials to or request information from the Trinsic Wallet). In fact, the Trinsic Wallet was the first mobile app that met the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-commitment-to-interoperability-ahead-of-iiw/">Aries interoperability profile</a>.  No vendor lock-in: Just like people can change out their leather wallet for a new one whenever they want, the same can be done with the Trinsic Wallet. End users can easily export their credentials from the Trinsic Wallet and import them into another Aries-based digital wallet that supports <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">import/export functionality</a>.  Free: It is free to download and immediately use for iOS and Android.

<p>Should countries develop national strategies for data in order to release its full potential? If so, what should they look&nbsp;like?</p><p>The British Government is currently mulling responses to its consultation about a new UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">National Data Strategy</a>. The decisions it arrives at will affect developments for many years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Mydex CIC provided comprehensive answers to questions asked by this consultation. To help promote debate, we’re publishing edited versions of these answers in a series of blogs. (Meanwhile, to see some of the practical work we are doing, <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click here</a> to catch up on progress on the Macmillan My Data Store&nbsp;Pilot.)</p> We need two strategies, not&nbsp;one <p>The first point made by our submission is that we need two national data strategies — one for personal data and one for non-personal data. A national data strategy that talks about ‘data’ in the abstract and fails to distinguish between non-personal data and personal data is a sure fire recipe for confusion and error because they require very different treatments. Any attempt to treat them as if they are one and the same is akin to developing an ‘energy’ strategy that treats electricity and gas as the same because they are both ‘energy’. The results could be explosive and very damaging.</p> Many users, many&nbsp;uses <p>The second, critical point we made is that our society is at a tipping point in data management — one that can either be managed well or&nbsp;badly.</p><p>The consultation paper contained an important insight: a recognition that the “full value [of data] is not being realised because vital information is not getting to where it needs to be.” The big question that follows is ‘what needs to be done to rise to this challenge?’ What follows is a summary of what we&nbsp;said.</p><p>To be successful, the Strategy needs to grasp a nettle. The main reason why vital information is not getting where it needs to be is that our data economy has evolved to be an organisation-centric ‘One User One Use’ (OUOU) system — whereas, thanks to the inner logic of data itself, it needs to operate as a ‘Many Users, Many Uses’ (MUMU) data ecosystem.</p> Characteristics of&nbsp;OUOU <p>The digital economy first evolved with organisations collecting, storing and using the data they needed to pursue their particular purposes. This resulted in a data landscape that is overwhelmingly organisation-centric, with large quantities of data collected and used almost exclusively by large organisations, operating via a series of separate data silos. The inevitable result of this structure is that the uses of this data are restricted to the priorities and purposes of the organisations concerned. It is a ‘one user, one set of uses’&nbsp;system.</p><p>While this approach has unleashed many benefits, it has also created built-in structural limitations and restrictions on what data assets are created, how they are used, by who. Other parties, including citizens, SMEs, charities, researchers and other organisations cannot access the data they want/need. Key stakeholders, particularly citizens, are effectively excluded from taking part in the workings of the digital economy and from directly benefiting from the collection and use of&nbsp;data.</p> Characteristics of&nbsp;MUMU <p>It is in the nature of data that it can be used many times without being ‘used up’. Therefore it can potentially be re-used by many different parties for many different purposes. In this context, the current organisation-centric restrictions on who can access data and what they can use this data for represent a fundamental architectural, structural and infrastructural constraint on the data economy’s ability to evolve and flourish. We need to shift to a Many Users, Many Uses data ecosystem.</p><p>A simple analogy sums up the National Data Strategy’s core challenge. So far, the data chick has grown and evolved inside the protecting nurturing shell of OUOU — an organisation- centric data architecture. To mature and flourish, it now needs to break out of that&nbsp;shell.</p><p>The importance and nature of this <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">shift from OUOU to MUMU</a> is highlighted by the recent <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-citizen-data-systems">The Future of Citizen Data Systems</a> report by the Government Office for Science, which notes&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>“Data about people, here referred to as citizen data, is increasing rapidly in volume and variety. The effective use and sharing of such data has the potential to bring huge benefits to the economy and society as a whole: boosting productivity and trade, enabling innovative products, improving public service delivery and informing scientific research.</blockquote><blockquote>“However, the shifting data landscape is challenging for policymakers to navigate. Data collected for one purpose can be used many times over for a range of other ones, and government policy in one area can have unintended impacts elsewhere. Restrictions of data sharing can sometimes mitigate risks of privacy breaches and misuse. However, the linking together of new types of citizen data — across the boundaries of industry, government, and our personal lives — offers some of the greatest opportunities.”</blockquote><p>The big question is how to realise these benefits. The National Strategy for Data needs to recognise that the full benefits of MUMU cannot be realised solely by increasing data sharing between existing organisations. The system itself needs to re-set, to shift from exclusivity (‘organisations only’) to inclusivity (in particular, including citizens whose data it&nbsp;is).</p> Far-reaching reform <p>For this to happen we need far-reaching structural, architectural, infrastructural and institutional reform. Key elements of this reform agenda&nbsp;include:</p>  Structural Add new data actors/stakeholders capable of collecting, storing and sharing data independently of existing ‘data controller’ organisations. This includes enabling citizens to be able to build up their own data assets in their own personal data stores and enabling new data trusts or foundations to access and use data for a broad array of non-commercial purposes, including scientific and medical research. Adding new stakeholders to the workings of the system would turn today’s data landscape of multiple, isolated parallel data silos into an expanding set of linked data nodes in a vibrant data sharing&nbsp;network.  Architectural Recognise the need for increasing differentiation of functions and divisions of labour in data collection, storage and use, particularly the increasing separation of data storage from use. As specialist data storage services (including personal data stores) develop, they can enable multiple different parties to access the same data for a range of different purposes. The need to separate data storage from data use is recognised in t<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/vindicated-cb897fb4e94b">he EU’s new Data Governance Act</a>. The National Data Strategy is the UK’s opportunity to also grasp this nettle. If it fails to do so, it risks lagging behind the EU in the development of a world-leading data driven&nbsp;economy.  <p>The strategy also needs to recognise the need for other specialist support services such as the development of metadata standards to ensure and reassure data users of the nature and quality of the data they are accessing, and data directories to help data users find and access the data they&nbsp;need.</p>  Infrastructural Develop independent, neutral data logistics infrastructure that achieves the above: that enables the right data to flow to and from the right parties in the right formats at the right times. Personal data stores are an essential part of this. We would go a long way to achieving this if every individual was provided with their own personal data store, where they can collect, store and share their own data under their own&nbsp;control.  Institutional Build the institutions capable of making and enforcing the rules, safeguards, standards, processes and incentive structures relevant to the types of data in question. This is needed to ensure safe, fair, trustworthy and efficient data sharing between multiple&nbsp;parties.   A job for Government <p>The creation of MUMU-enabling data sharing infrastructure and institutions extends beyond the remit, boundaries and goals of any particular organisation. It needs Government support and facilitation. In particular, it requires the resolution of collective action dilemmas that arise from the organisation-centric structure of the current&nbsp;system.</p><p>For example, it is in the interests of every user of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">verified attributes</a> (that confirm details about an individual) that organisations holding these attributes enable them to be shared. But it may not be in the immediate interests of each particular organisation holding these attributes to enable such sharing. Result: verified attributes are not shared and all individuals and service providers that could use them lose out. Such collective action issues threaten to block progress towards the goal of increased data sharing and&nbsp;use.</p><p>Together, the reforms and developments outlined above point to the creation of a data landscape and ecosystem that is very different to what we see today. In particular they shift the focus of innovation from particular organisations’ uses of data to the structural, architectural, infrastructural and institutional innovations needed to deliver&nbsp;MUMU.</p><p>They also point to a new direction of economic growth — opening up all the opportunities for data use that OUOU systems and structures currently stifle.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">How to unleash the full potential of data?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Listen to Ubisecure CEO, Simon Wood, on the <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/podcast/ubisecure-2/">State of Identity podcast</a>. With host Cameron D’Ambrosi from One World Identity, Simon discusses trusting an individual’s digital right to represent their organisation.</p>
<p>The conversation explores:</p>
 
 Current challenges of proving an individual’s right to represent their organisation 
 How digitising representation governance is made possible by trust anchors and delegation – with the benefits here from the globally-applicable Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) 
 What benefits digitisation of representation enables 
 How the Finnish government digitised representation governance 
 Predictions for digital identity in the year ahead 
 
<blockquote><p>“…What that gives us is a trust anchor which couples a director of the organisation to a highly- assured record for that organisation. Coupled with the identity access management platform we have, we can now enable an authentication scenario that then returns your representation rights for that organisation. So you’ve now transitioned from what was a manual checking of documents, understanding process to a standard online authentication, which returns your association with a highly-assured organisation. The act of issuing that LEI has allowed us to generate that linkage between the individual and the organisation and that is the trust anchor that has been missing so far to date to enable these representation government services to take place.”</p></blockquote>

 Podcast transcript: 
<p>Cameron D’Ambrosi: Welcome to State of Identity. I’m your host Cameron D’Ambrosi. Joining me this week is Simon Wood, CEO at Ubisecure. Simon, welcome back to State of Identity.</p>
<p>Simon Wood: Excellent, thank you. Great to be here again.</p>
 <p>Cameron DAmbrosi</p> 
<p>Cameron: For folks who might have missed that first episode, you have a pretty interesting background in the broader identity space. Again, like myself, maybe wasn’t necessarily thinking about it, the lens or through the lens of digital identity at the time. But maybe looking in retrospect seems like there’s maybe quite the interesting digital identity through line that kind of runs around your career. How did you come to be the CEO at Ubisecure?</p>
 <p>Simon Wood</p> 
<p>Simon: Thank you. Yeah. As you say, it’s quite a long story. We will try and keep it short. I guess I’ve been involved in identity, as you say when you look backwards and realise where you’ve come from, since the start of my career. And that was originally the military battlefield equipment and scenarios.</p>
<p>One of the things that was always clear at that point, is that the need for security is paramount and without identity, it’s – I would suggest– impossible to enforce security. You have to understand who the actors are, who the parties are, involved to be able to have that security.</p>
<p>So right from the mid-90s, so what’s that? 25 years ago. From that time dealing with identity and then through various different high-performance technical environments: Formula One telemetry, aircraft flight recording, various legal software systems as well.</p>
<p>But then more up-to-date into the world of PKI, I was, prior to this, CTO for GlobalSign –world number three public trust CA– and of course PKI is a fine-grained, complex, high-assured provider of identity and security services, and then from there into the CEO role here.</p>
<p>Cameron: Simon, for folks who are not familiar with Ubisecure, what you guys do and what your platform is, what’s a quick 15,000-foot overview?</p>
<p>Simon: We are a company that specialises in external identity, more specifically business-to-business external identity with a strong focus on the importance of organisation identity coupled with individual identity. We’ve been in existence since 2002 – a great footprint in the Nordics, a lot of the Finnish government services, pairing more and more with the Swedish government services now pushing out across Europe and delivering identity management solutions that couple together organisation identity with individual identity.</p>
<p>Cameron: Not to step on the entire conversation we’re about to have, but I think is right at the intersection of so many trends that we really saw catalyzing even before this horrible global pandemic. But now in the wake of COVID in some parts of the world or the deepest pit of despair of COVID in others is so, so relevant.</p>
<p>To kick off the conversation, before we get started, we’re really kind of talking about this flattening of identity into a single layer. Previously, you might have had a personal physical identity. Then you had your legal identity, like a driver’s license, and then you maybe had your organisational identity and we’ve really begun to see that flatten around as digital identity solutions enable identity to happen for lack of a better word. How are you seeing this trend manifest in the marketplace right now with Ubisecure?</p>
<p>Simon: Yes. So we’re absolutely seeing more and more demand for the coupling together, the bringing together, of an individual and an organisation, and the various rights and representations that can fit between those two different identity classes.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand the logical difference between an individual identity –so yourself, myself, as natural people. We have government-issued identities, bank-issued identities, however, they may be formed, but we are natural people, individuals.</p>
<p>By the same token, organisations also have an identity. So an organisation, it could be Amazon, it could be Walmart… These organisations are legal entities. They have legal capabilities, but they also typically have online interactions as well in the current situation in the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>The amount of interactions that are happening online have obviously spiraled significantly. We see that as almost a primary interaction now – and I don’t know what the natural numbers look like but I suspect a good proportion of the world that it’s shopping on Amazon this year, not wanting to venture out, not wanting to be exposed and so on.</p>
<p>And in those interactions, it’s understanding who you’re dealing with. It’s fine that the online provider may go through great works, significant verification to check you as an individual. But how do you understand that organisation? How do you really know that you’re talking to the right organisation?</p>
<p>Also, now we’re seeing a continual wave of cyber-attacks, bad actors, out there. More often than not, they’re looking to exploit weaknesses in that either identity definition or identity verification.</p>
<p>Are they looking to fill in gaps in identity that have been unfortunately not correctly handled so they can take over systems, or are they looking to claim to be something else? You know, the standard phishing types of attacks that we see.</p>
<p>So, having the ability for individuals to understand organisations and organisations to understand individuals at that identity level I think is very important.</p>
<p>Moreover, as we see individuals becoming remote from their organisations in a – certainly in a physical sense –, having the ability for individuals to effectively represent their organisation becoming more and more important all the time.</p>
<p>Cameron: Tie this back to Ubisecure in a bit more of a direct sense. Where does Ubisecure fit into this conversation and how is your platform enabling some of these applications that previously may have not been possible and establishing that trust layer and those digital underpinnings in a real sense?</p>
<p>Because I think where it can be challenging for some folks who are interested in implementing some of these technologies is “OK, all this sounds really cool and this is something I want to do but, I maybe don’t understand at a more nuts and bolts level, how it works and how we go about doing it”.</p>
<p>Simon: To help understand that, we should talk a little bit about what I refer to as <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/trust-anchors-right-to-represent/">trust anchor</a> and that will help set the context of how Ubisecure then helps to deliver solutions to solve some of these challenges.</p>
<p>When we think about trust anchors, trust anchors are already defined. They’re not a new term. It’s not a new phrase. There’s an RFC that defines what a trust anchor is with regards to a PKI solution in terms of a root point where there is no external validation. It’s just where there is a starting point for trust, so a root of trust, and that is a trust anchor.</p>
<p>Those trust anchors today exist in many different forms, in many different places. So, you have them in your cars. Your bank is a trust anchor. Any certificate that you have, whether it’s an email sign-in certificate or a browser, service security, SSL providing certificate, etc., they all work with trust anchors in different ways to provide the capabilities that they need to deliver that trust and allow those services to happen.</p>
<p>When we look at the challenges that you have with individuals representing their organisation, it comes down to how do you define that trust anchor? Where does that trust anchor come from and then how can you use that within a transaction to alleviate some of the challenges that we see there?</p>
<p>Today, a lot of that processing is administrative. So we have many government processes and organisations and that can be from things as simple as events reporting through to complex legal transactions, all transactions and so on.</p>
<p>The majority of those assertions, the majority of those operations, those processes, are controlled by administrative processes. Somebody checks that the right thing has been done, somebody validates it, somebody puts the appropriate documentation in place to cover what should be done.</p>
<p>But that leaves you in the world of manual processes and the complexity that you get around those manual processes. So really, it’s about how can you look to digitise that representation governance and what does that gives you as a set of benefits.</p>
<p>From a Ubisecure point of view, we’ve spent a long time dealing with systems that digitise representation governance. If we look back in our history, 2008, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf">we deployed a platform to the Finnish government</a> that essentially allowed organisations to have a unique identity, and individuals were allowed to have a unique identity, and had those coupled together, so that individuals within the organisation could represent online features of the organisation, make claims, make statements on behalf of the organisations in a digital form and use that to enable online commerce, enable online business, way beyond just online financial transactions, online ordering and so on.</p>
<p>Cameron: That is really tremendously powerful and I don’t necessarily think in the way that you just described it for folks who maybe don’t understand why that’s so powerful is thinking about we are in a world where companies have on-boarded employees in the midst of the pandemic that have maybe never been into the office. You have all sorts of new business relationships that maybe previously would have been consummated with handshakes and cocktails and steak dinners and that trust was kind of ingrained in the physical realm. That is no longer possible and may not be preferable moving forward just from an efficiency perspective.</p>
<p>If you think about what is required to do that, knowing that when I am representing One World Identity in a transaction, that I am in fact Cameron D’Ambrosi and that I do in fact hold a position in the company that is high enough to allow me to enter into legally-binding contracts remains a huge problem.</p>
<p>You know, we see this all across the space where you have outright fraud, money laundering or other embezzlement type activities that occur, specifically because you can’t establish that linkage not just around someone’s identity but tied to the identity of that organisation itself in a way that can be verifiable.</p>
<p>Simon: Absolutely and that is the root challenge that’s out there. How do you form that bond? What builds that trust anchor in the first place? As you say, previously –and this is not just something that has changed as a result of the pandemic–, but previously those trust anchors have been subjective, maybe emotive from a number of business point of views.</p>
<p>Of course, they’re&nbsp; are legal contracts. Of course, there are mechanisms that define limits authorities and so on. But a lot of the time when businesses have been done, it has essentially been undertaken manually. It has been undertaken face to face. And now we’re seeing the pandemic, plus efficiency drivers, moving away from that to looking at online operation, online business, online transactions in the broadest possible sense, and the ability to digitally express that representation and the limits of that representation are becoming more and more critical, absolutely.</p>
<p>Cameron: The governance layer of all of this is a piece that is critical as well. And from that angle of this conversation, does Ubisecure help organisations figure out that structure and administration piece or are you primarily focused on the technical side and it is up to the implementing organisation to really figure out how they’re managing these identities from that governance perspective?</p>
<p>Simon: We’re very much a software and systems provider, so we focus on the technology aspects of solving these challenges. The one key delivery that we bring to this, which allows us to help organisations or build these trust anchors for organisations, is the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">legal entity identifier issuance business</a> that we have.</p>
<p>So while we are primarily known, or have been primarily known, as a provider of kind of classical identity and access management systems focused on B to B external relationships, we have since mid-2018 been approved as an issuer of <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/organisation-identity/">legal entity identifiers</a>.</p>
<p>Now this may be a new term to a number of people listening to this. A legal identity identifier is a globally unique number that gives you a unique reference to a legal entity, to an organisation.</p>
<p>That is something that was set up essentially by the G20. It’s the result of the 2008 financial crisis. One of the core causes of that crisis were a number of circular investments where ultimately you had corporate structures investing in a circular fashion which caused a lot of this issue, and that couldn’t be seen. The LEI was requested as a concept to be introduced by the G20 as an aid to stopping that situation happening again.</p>
<p>You see today that there are statements around certain types of financial instrument trades so that if you don’t have an LEI, you can’t undertake the trade and that is there to stop these patterns emerging again or at least to detect them early if that should happen.</p>
<p>The issuance process is a well-defined, well-regulated thing. Every issuer, called an LOU, has to go through a yearly audit, not dissimilar to a web trust audit that public trust CAs have to go through, to check the issuance has been done correctly.</p>
<p>One of the core parts of the process of that issuance is checking if the individual who’s requesting the LEI for the organisation has the appropriate right to make that request.</p>
<p>So as part of that issuance, we have to examine the individual who’s making the request, we have to look at the organisation and what we end up with is the LEI itself, which is a highly-assured identity record describing various attributes about that organisation and a qualified individual, qualified in the sense of we’ve determined who they are and we’ve verified that they have a right to make that request.</p>
<p>Now a right to request is not the same as a right to represent. A right to represent is a higher, more privileged right. But with a few extra checks, we can promote that right to request to a right to represent.</p>
<p>What that gives us is a trust anchor which couples a director of the organisation to a highly- assured record for that organisation. Coupled with the identity access management platform we have, we can now enable an authentication scenario that then returns your representation rights for that organisation.</p>
<p>So you’ve now transitioned from what was a manual checking of documents, understanding process to a standard online authentication, which returns your association with a highly-assured organisation.</p>
<p>The act of issuing that LEI has allowed us to generate that linkage between the individual and the organisation and that is the trust anchor that has been missing so far to date to enable these representation government services to take place.</p>
<p>That’s really what we’re now pushing forward with from Ubisecure point of view.</p>
<p>Cameron: That’s a great overview and I think what is super, super interesting is the way in which we have seen this infrastructure develop – I don’t want to say completely organically but – in a way that can really support kind of the current and future growth of this identity layer. From your personal perspective, has COVID really been the catalysing force that we have kind of expected it to be with regard to organisations that maybe were hesitant to jump onboard protocols like this to finally make the leap and realise that they need to move into the digital trust anchor realm?</p>
<p>Simon: I certainly think that the current situation has driven a large acceleration of that. I don’t think it’s exclusively caused by the current COVID situation. I think if we kind of broaden that slightly to identity and access management, I think what we see right now – there are a number of organisations where digital transformation has happened, but either not completely or in some organisations still not hyper-effective digital transformation in place at this point.</p>
<p>We’re seeing those organisations now stepping back and accepting that this is the time that they really have to move forward with this, start putting those projects in place and driving them forward.</p>
<p>I made the comment there that it’s not just from the pandemic. We also see and have seen over the last – I guess last 10 years – but over the last 24 months, the massive increase in cyber-crime activity. There’s not a week that goes by when we don’t see another set of personal information being leaked somewhere, being stolen from an organisation, a system being hacked.</p>
<p>We saw, – I don’t know if you saw the news on Monday – just before Parler was taken down by Amazon, it appeared that there was a security breach there that pulled out a lot of information. I think people are still waiting to see what that actually means in terms of that breach.</p>
<p>But we see these cyber-attacks becoming more and more prevalent and I think we see organisations recognising the need for a holistic, broad digital identity view within the organisation that helps them tackle these challenges and make sure that they’re best prepared to respond to those.</p>
<p>I think that coupled with the situation that has been forced on the world by COVID is starting to drive an acceleration of those projects, of those considerations. And I think when you get to that point, we see the situation now where companies that haven’t done that yet, I guess they kind of get to take advantage of the step change in infrastructure. They don’t have to go through all of the iterative phases of what companies just 15 years ago have now gone through.</p>
<p>They can jump straight to the higher order, higher value delivery points including potentially online representation governance and so on, to take advantage of that in a single step.</p>
<p>Cameron: And branching out from I guess some of the more stead applications, not to say that anything that we discussed isn’t tremendously important and – I guess for lack of a better word – underpinning the global economy, tremendous use cases outside of just what we have discussed that might not be obvious to the average listener. What are some of the other areas that you are hoping the Ubisecure platform can be impactful with regard to bringing trust anchors and delegation to a broader audience?</p>
<p>Simon: I think it’s interesting to look at some of the projects we’ve already delivered that kind of show where we can go forwards with this.</p>
<p>One of the solutions that we’re involved in, and this goes back to 2008 so this is not a new concept for us, but we do have this new much high value trust anchor with the LEI basis. That LEI basis gives us what we would refer to as an open ecosystem. So, it’s globally applicable.</p>
<p>But these systems have been deployed for a number of years based on closed ecosystems. A great example of that is the Finnish Tax Authority. So back in 2008, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf">we deployed a platform there to the Finnish Tax Authority</a>. That is linked with the business registry. So that when a company’s set up in Finland, the details are automatically passed to the Finnish Tax Authority.</p>
<p>The Finnish tax authority reaches out digitally to the nominated contact point for that organisation, be it the CEO/be it the Chairman, whoever is at the top of that contact point. They receive an invite to the tax platform. Their organisation has to submit sales tax, corporate tax, payroll tax. Those are the three classic taxes that we’re all having to process all the time.</p>
<p>So they received an invite to the platform. But of course the CEO is not going to undertake that, it will be the CFO of the organisation who’s responsible. So, the CEO signs onto the platform but then delegates the rights and the responsibilities of submission to the CFO.</p>
<p>The CFO receives an invite to the platform, signs up, accepts those responsibilities, but has a team working for him or her, so delegates to the team. The team get invited to the platform. They follow the same process. So, we’ve seen this chain of delegation and invites to the platform.</p>
<p>If we look at the payroll side of this, it’s very common for organisations to use external payroll providers. Let’s assume that’s the case here. The person responsible for payroll will now invite the external organisation to the platform that has the payroll responsibility for the target company.</p>
<p>That organisation will be invited in. The organisation will receive that, accept it and delegate internally to whoever is the account manager for the original company.</p>
<p>That whole process has happened outside of the oversight of the cost of the tax authority. It has been handled by the people who know the information, so by the CEO, CFO, the team within the payroll company. They’ve done that directly without any interaction there.</p>
<p>It’s that kind of scenario that brings a value of representation governance. The top level CEO role delegated down the rights and responsibilities related to national tax obligations. That was passed through the organisation, it was passed out to external organisations, and all of that was done without the tax administration having to do any particular activity. And that’s the efficiency side that comes in as well.</p>
<p>So I think that’s a great example of a different type of use case that brings delegation, that brings representation capability into that. And this is something that we’ve been doing for the last 10 years or so.</p>
<p>Cameron: That’s amazing. I think you guys are at the vanguard in so many ways, bringing this infrastructure to every aspect of both person-to-government interactions as well as corporate interactions. I think it’s really not an “if”, &nbsp;It’s a “when” in many regards.</p>
<p>It’s funny when you unpack identities and this transition to digital identity. A lot of the concerns, and I think there are legitimate privacy concerns and I think we need to be cognizant of how we’re approaching those challenges, but the notion that we don’t have digital identities already that are just out of our control? I think is something that people who take a hardline stance on adopting some of these technologies haven’t fully internalised. And there is, I almost think of the risk as like matter in the universe. It can’t be created or destroyed. You’re just kind of deciding how it’s apportioned.</p>
<p>Right now, I think a lot of the risks around identity have just been shunted onto the user themselves and there is such a limited recourse and such limited control and protection against fraud, whether that’s in these interactions with governments or interactions between enterprises, especially small businesses.</p>
<p>So, the faster we can implement some of these transitions, I think we’re all going to be better off and consumer education and business leader education I think, is a large part of it. I think to, again, help people understand that “look, you already have a digital identity. It’s just a question of whether or not you can control it, whether or not aspects are revocable, for example”.</p>
<p>If you have an employee who right now can go around pretending to be part of your organisation and signing documents based on the email address that they have, is that better or worse than a system in which that attestation they can make is completely revocable from your end? I would argue I would much rather be in that latter situation.</p>
<p>Simon: Absolutely. I think – as you say – the risk that any transaction faces is always going to be at a certain level. That level can be managed, risks can be mitigated and again oftentimes by the use of appropriate technology controls.</p>
<p>You touched on the point of individuals wanting to have control over their identity as well. We recognise that. We see that self-sovereign identity type models are becoming of growing importance now.</p>
<p>That manages the claim aspect from the individual side. Authentication is always going to come down to some kind of shared trust and in fact, SSI is still based on having trust anchors there. The underlying verified credentials that are being used by the wallets, by the verifiers against the issuer, and so on. There is still that trust anchor mechanism that’s required that has to sit in place.</p>
<p>So, the broader side of the representation governance provides a very strong benefit to the management and the reduction of the risks that we see in place today. I think it sits nicely alongside where we see the future going potentially with more individual control over core identity management, identity attribute release. I think that does all fit together really quite nicely.</p>
<p>Cameron: Amazing. So, Simon, before we wrap up here, I did want to give you a chance to dust off your trusty crystal ball and maybe make a few fun predictions for 2021. Certainly, already off to a rip-roaring start here for many reasons. If we wanted to focus just on digital identity and what we might expect to see over the course of the next year, I would love to get some of your thoughts.</p>
<p>Simon: Sure, absolutely. I think unfortunately right now as we’ve touched on multiple times already, predictions today are probably very much grounded in the situation we all find ourselves in right now.</p>
<p>I’ve touched on this already in the discussion that we’ve just had. But I do think the pushing of individuals remotely through the current pandemic situation, the fact that we’ve unfortunately become more separated, more external as a result of that, will see an acceleration, a rise in the number of digital identity projects that are out there.</p>
<p>It could almost be seen as a silver lining. I think a number of countries even have been slow to adopt at a national level general pervasive identity capabilities. Not from the point of view of obviously monitoring people but from the point of view of enabling effective business.</p>
<p>I think as we go through and as this pandemic continues to unfold, I think we will see more adoption of generic identity solutions that help organisations deal with that increased separation, with the fact that employees are starting to look more like external identities and the fact that the relationships they have will be more and more online with the organisations and the end individuals that they deal with.</p>
<p>So, I certainly see that accelerating during this year. I think we’ve already seen the start of that from the tail end of last year as well. So I think that’s definitely going to happen over the next 12, 18 months or so.</p>
<p>The other area and again it ties into what we’ve already touched on in the conversation. I think like yourself, self-sovereign identity. I think we see a number of early proposals of how governments and countries are going to deal with things like vaccination records and so on.</p>
<p>I think that is going to drive an increase in awareness of self-sovereign identity. I still think there are some underlying challenges around that. I always go back to technology is available for mainstream adoption if my mother can use it. That’s my baseline for figuring out if something is practical, is viable.</p>
<p>I think self-sovereign identity is where we will all end up, is where individuals should be able to manage their own identity. But there are challenges in individuals being able to manage their own identity. But I do think as we go through this, as we start to come out the other side, we will definitely see a rise in that aspect as well, as one of the mechanisms for being able to share the information that we do need to share but under our control.</p>
<p>Cameron: I couldn’t agree with you more there. I think that’s a really great perspective on these issues and I share your optimism that hopefully we can continue seeing progress made towards solving these challenges because life is hard enough without anything else, let alone getting in our own way regarding making some of these challenges easier with technology.</p>
<p>So, fingers crossed. Although I’ve learned to mute my expectations for what might happen in a given year.</p>
<p>Simon, thanks again so much. I really, really appreciate it. For folks who wanted to learn more about Ubisecure, I take it your website is the best place for them to go?&nbsp; [<a href="http://www.ubisecure.com">www.ubisecure.com</a>]</p>

 Conditional Transfer 
<p>Before the transfer is executed on the blockchain, an authorization request will be sent to the issuer (or his processing agent) for the transaction’s release or rejection.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>As you may know, it’s already been possible for an investor holding a position in a T-REX security token to execute a “simple transfer” instruction to another white-listed investor: they simply need to select both the number of tokens to transfer and the counterpart’s wallet. The T-REX system then instantly performs a provision-check on their position, verifies that the counterpart is indeed whitelisted for the token considered and, upon submission and signature, the simple transfer instruction is sent to the blockchain for execution on a peer-to-peer basis.</p>
<p>However, some issuers and asset managers have confirmed to us that they need to assert more control over this type of transfer. Essentially, before the transfer is executed, they need to be able to authorize or reject the transfer between the two investors. This final “go” might be needed for various reasons, including checking pre-emption or veto rights for instance. We at Tokeny have listened to this request and are now introducing “conditional transfers” as part of our product offering.</p>
<p>An investor will initiate a conditional transfer exactly in the same way they initiate a simple transfer and the system will perform the same provision- and eligibility-checks. However, before the transfer is executed on the blockchain, an authorization request will be sent to the issuer (or his processing agent) for the transaction’s release or rejection. In case of rejection, a reason has to be provided and communicated to the investor. This is how it works:</p>

		 
	 
                      
	 
		 
			<p>It is up to the issuer of the T-REX security token to determine whether their token/s will allow for simple or conditional transfers. Investors will obviously only be able to instruct the type of transfers relevant for a specific token.</p>

 <p>This article is also available in <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/fr/ce-documentaire-va-vous-donner-envie-de-quitter-les-reseaux-sociaux/">French</a>.</p>
<p>The documentary The Social Dilemna produced by Netflix focuses on the sordid aspects of our ultra-connected lives and it's bound to be disturbing.</p>
<p>Between the docu-reality that features a contemporary family and inlays by experts, this film dissects the workings of social networks. At a time when Whatsapp is changing its terms and conditions of use, it's always instructive to understand why... The interviewees, some of whom are still working in this field, express themselves on the current consequences of technology (interference in elections and disinformation that is growing exponentially) and draw a dark picture of the future that awaits us if we don't change our habits.</p>
<p>As is often the case in this type of documentary or docu-drama, producers do not skimp on the means to hammer their message. On the program: an anxiety-provoking soundtrack, poignant scenes and hard-hitting statistics that seem to be attributable to social networks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, apart from this debate on the real place of the Internet and social networks in the evils of our time, this film paints a very accurate picture of how technology has shaped the modern world. Here's what we need to remember about The Social Dilemna :</p>
 If it's free, you are the product 
<p>Contrary to the adage, which fortunately is now beginning to erode, free services (search engines, social networks, etc.) are not aligned with the interests of its users. The Social Dilemna, social media platforms are companies that use a three-step business model :</p>
<p>Commitment: the goal is to capture your attention in the application<br>
Who doesn't remember the former Google employee <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_a_handful_of_tech_companies_control_billions_of_minds_every_day">Tristan Harris</a> who became an active activist and an alarm bell about the manipulation of our minds by tech giants.</p>
<p>Growth: the goal is for you to invite your friends and family to join the application.</p>
<p>Advertising: the goal is to offer you advertising in the application.</p>
<p>For a user, these three "acts" provide a better understanding of how different platforms and applications work. Their purpose is to hold our attention as long as possible, to encourage us to invite others and to expose us to advertisements as we use them. On this last point, it is important to note that advertisers do not aim to generate immediate sales. Indeed, as explained in the documentary <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier">Jaron Lanier</a>, a pioneer of virtual reality, social networks have the ability to gradually and imperceptibly change our consumption habits.</p>
<p>Advertisers use this power to modify and predict our future actions, which amounts to influencing our behaviours.<br>
For <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff">Shoshana Zuboff</a>, PhD student and author of <a href="https://www.zulma.fr/livre-lage-du-capitalisme-de-surveillance-572196.html">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, "Internet actors speculate on the future behavior of users" as some companies do on the price of oil. We tend to focus all our attention on the management of personal information. Yet the most valuable asset for these platforms is our behavioral data.</p>
 All our online activity is "dissected" 
<p>The Social Dilemna reminds us that no action taken online goes unnoticed: the giants of the Internet know what we consult and how long we consult it. When we browse online, algorithms study our activity to find out how to capture our attention. These results then allow them to make us stay longer on the sites and applications we use. It is thanks to this that advertisers can understand each person's habits and use them to their advantage.</p>
 When a handful of people decide for us... 
<p>We then imagine that the Internet is controlled by a divine force pulling the strings... no, it is not Gods but a handful of individuals who execute, participate in increasing the number of users, in monetizing their data.</p>
<p>This documentary features Justin Rosenstein, former engineer for Google and Facebook and co-creator of the "Like" button. This initially seemingly innocuous invention, originally designed to increase commitment, is now a global symbol of recognition that, for many users, has a direct impact on their self-esteem. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rosenstein">Justin Rosenstein</a> admits that at the time they had no idea of the consequences that could ensue... It reminds me of another Tristan... Nitot, ex-Mozilla, <a href="https://cozy.io/fr/">Cozy Cloud</a> and Qwant who spoke about the dopamine generated by this famous button in <a href="https://vimeo.com/251654559">one of his famous lectures</a>.</p>
 Internet widens the gap on divisive issues 
<p>On the Internet, the current discourse reflects an increasingly divided society, especially on divisive issues. On this point, the mechanisms (or algorithms) that govern social networking platforms are being singled out. As we have seen above, these platforms seek to capture your attention for as long as possible. To do this, they use algorithms that analyze your behavior when dealing with different types of content. Thanks to the data collected, the service can then offer you new information and publications that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, the documentary The Social Dilemna takes the example of videos of conspiracy theories and the role played by social media in the rise of their crazy theories, the latest conspiracy theories around the non-re-election of Trump or the Qanon phenomenon in the United States. When a video ends, platforms such as YouTube automatically suggest new content: users are then "hypnotized" by a continuous flow of information going in the same direction. This uninterrupted cycle of suggestions is often managed by an algorithm that will not try to find out if the suggested content is true. However, some platforms, such as Twitter, have deployed fact-checking software to combat this phenomenon. When a publication is considered "dubious" by such a tool, a warning message is displayed. Unfortunately, this is sometimes not enough to stop the problem. Misleading information is everywhere on the Web, so every claim, however far-fetched, is bound to be corroborated somewhere on the Internet. The result? The result is that users on both sides of the web are increasingly distancing themselves from each other and the gap is widening.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that the search bar in browsers takes into account your usage history. For example, Google's auto-suggest feature means that if a user types "flat earth" into the search bar, the suggestions displayed will be influenced by their usage behavior, geographic location, and the data Google has collected about them.</p>
<p>Faced with this reality, some experts interviewed in The Social Dilemna are very pessimistic about future consequences, citing the possibility of civil war - the recent intrusion into the Capitol in Washington proves it.</p>
 But then what to do? 
<p>Not everything is to be thrown away with the bath water. Alternatives are emerging - the influx of Whatsapp users who have just changed their terms and conditions of use (to the benefit of its parent company Facebook) to the Signal messaging service is testimony to this collective awareness. This documentary offers advice on how to limit our addiction to social networks, twist the neck to misinformation and complicate the task of the algorithms that predict our behaviors.</p>
<p>To be less addicted to social networks, the best reflex is to deactivate your notifications, as advised by almost all the experts interviewed in this documentary.</p>
 
 
<p>Use a search engine that does not record your activity, such as <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a>, <a href="https://www.startpage.com/fr/">StartPage</a>...</p>
 
 
<p>Remove the Chrome extensions (which follow your behavior) and prefer the Firefox browser to Google's browser.</p>
 
 
<p>Do not click on recommended videos and click traps. #Resist</p>
 
 
<p>Cross-check the information of an article before sharing it and verify the reliability of its source.</p>
 
 
<p>Limit the amount of time spent on the screens each day (for adults and children alike).</p>
 
 
<p>Put your phone at the entrance of the house in silent mode (when you have finished your work day), unplug it during the night . Until about 15 years ago, we lived without social networks, without solicitations... So it's possible!</p>
 
 
<p>Choose tools that respect your privacy (<a href="https://blog.cozy.io/fr/je-change-mes-habitudes-numeriques-avec-cozy-cloud/">Cozy Cloud is one of them but we are not alone</a> and learn how to better control your data.</p>
 
 
<p>Of course, the ideal would be to delete all its social networks and other thieving applications of our time but let's go like Kaizen and its method of small steps. A habit sets in after 21 days and it's hard to get rid of the convenience offered by these "tools", especially at a time when telecommuting and the fall of the much-lamented "social relationship" is so common.</p>
 It's all about security 
<p>Start watching this documentary (on Netflix, to top it all off!) and listen and/or read other content that is just as rich in information and pedagogy, because the key word is digital education and its excesses.</p>

<p>Dock has decided to extend the token migration until midnight (GMT) on the 31st of March 2021. We are extending the migration window by around 3 weeks to ensure those who haven’t migrated yet have sufficient time to do so. For those who are migrating directly, you can continue to use the Dock <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/token-migration">migration portal</a> and accompanying <a href="https://docs.dock.io/token-migration/migration-tutorial/migration-tutorial">migration tutorial</a>. As we’ll discuss in the next section, Binance will also assist their users with the migration prior to the 31st of March. </p><p>Exchanges</p><p>Current exchanges supporting the newer mainnet token are <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/exchange/dock_btc">Huobi</a>, <a href="https://trade.kucoin.com/DOCK-BTC">Kucoin</a> and <a href="https://www.gate.io/trade/DOCK_USDT">Gate.io</a>. Binance has already <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/758e3d56c5f747fdbf5eeebfd509dc54">confirmed their support</a> and that they will be supporting the mainnet token prior to the migration window closing. Those with DOCK ERC20 tokens currently on Binance can leave them on the exchange at their choosing and they will be migrated by Binance on your behalf. Binance will confirm specific timings in the coming weeks. </p><p>Moving forward </p><p>Those who have been following Dock will know that the Dock mainnet token represents a key part of the network and already provides utility. It acts as an integrated payment mechanism for performing network operations, a way to reward validators who provide their resources to the network by producing blocks and confirming transactions, and as a voting mechanism within Dock’s <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-future-in-decentralized-governance/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=Token_Migration_Extension">decentralized governance</a>. </p><p>As outlined in our recent <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-2021-roadmap/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=Token_Migration_Extension">roadmap post</a>, Q2 2021 (between April and June) will see Dock transition to Proof of Stake and with that we’ll provide the community with one of our most requested features, <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">staking</a>. We’ll also be building a new Dock wallet during the course of this year with our v0.1 release planned for Q3. This will not only facilitate the storage and transacting in DOCK tokens, but it will also be a place to store W3C-compliant verifiable credentials. </p><p>Stay safe out there</p><p>Although we are nearing the end of the migration process it is still important that we all remain vigilant and keep our crypto safe. Extraordinary events like a token migration can represent an opportunity for scammers to part you from your tokens if you don’t take care.

Transparency is explicitly mentioned as part of SSI, and it places a high emphasis on the importance of the public’s trust.</p><p>As we look to the future of digital identity, SSI principles with blockchain have already proven to be successful by bringing together stakeholders to create a mutually beneficial network.</p></blockquote> Covid 19  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Feb/0128.html">Digital Vaccination Certificates -- Here Be Dragons!</a> <p>This is a thread to keep an eye on. &gt;&gt; Anil John writes:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Because I believe that this is an important conversation, I figure I would put together some high level slideware that synthesizes and shares the answers I have provided directly to those who have asked.&nbsp; I am not in the hearts and minds business, so consider this in the spirit of the quote from Bruce Lee - "Absorb what is useful, Discard what is not, Add what is uniquely your own."</p><p>Happy to chat to share our mistakes, so that you don't need to repeat them, with those who have a public interest focus in this area.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://trustoverip.substack.com/p/the-inevitable-vaccine-passports">The inevitable vaccine passports Or, are they actually inevitable?</a> <blockquote><p>Until the time digital records for vaccination are as simple and do not require a second thought around wallet/app/credential format etc - we have a long way to go before they are inevitable.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z0MaGrb-Py7V3ZO4AnmYMHsXNgTmLhVocyaX7ySQ5mI/edit#gid=1671625933">CCI Knowledge Base</a> <p>If you haven’t already you might want to check out this google sheet</p><blockquote><p>As our community continues to grow and the pandemic situation keeps evolving, this CCI Knowledge Base serves as a repository of ongoing COVID-19-related news, topics, researches and resources which are deem relevant to our community and digital identity technology.

[...] The concept of Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI) and the associated standards “Verifiable Credentials” and “Decentralized Identifiers” is a promising approach to improve the situation. They allow the flexible exchange of tamper-proof digital proofs between users and systems. Therefore, they form the foundation for building trust relationships in the digital space. This paper introduces the SSI paradigm and discusses the barriers that prevent the wide-scale adoption of this concept.&nbsp;</p></blockquote> Beyond SSI&nbsp;  DHS S&amp;T Awards $198,600 to Develop Security and Privacy Testing of COVID-19 Contact Tracing Apps <blockquote><p>to AppCensus, a start-up based in El Cerrito, California, to develop testing and validation services for digital contact tracing applications (apps).

Necessary information for each customer is simply uploaded onto the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Q: Are the possible solutions to the high cost of using erc-20 liquidity tokens: alternate protocols like Polkadot or Cardano?<br>A: In the long term, we are looking to utilize and trade our mainnet tokens as a gas solution. Currently we have no plans to use other protocols.</p><p>Q: How will KDAC custodial efforts affect the AERGO token. Will Tokens be used in these solutions? Will Bitgo be using any AERGO products?<br>A: BitGo is not using any AERGO products. We are working to integrate KDAC custody solution with the AERGO platform.</p><p>Q: Have people print stickers and paste them on their city, send you a picture, and the most liked one gets a prize in AERGO. Spread the news of the winner. Give someone 5k AERGO or something for the most creative one. <br>A: We definitely do not want to have our community committing any illegal vandalism type of campaigns in their respective city. I believe there are other ways to spread news about AERGO.<br><br>Q: Partnerships with several youtubers, known and upcoming ones. (It might cost some money but at this point, its a bull market. Spread the word, why are we missing this chance, even if the projects aren't done, spread the NEWS of the upcoming projects and then deliver)<br>A: We are working with our marketing agency to set up interviews and coverage by crypto influencers.</p><p>Q: Where is the updated Roadmap, please provide a concrete answer here.<br>A: We will be publishing our official roadmap within a&nbsp;week.</p><p>Q: Where are you on marketing, are you hiring someone to handle the different channels and keep twitter, reddit, facebook, website constantly updated with new and re-used information?<br>A: We have a great marketing agency that oversees our communication with the community. We will be doing more in the future with our website and create additional transparencies with the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Q: What happened with the Samsung Partnership, any new developments?<br>A: We are in talks, however with large companies such as Samsung, they are not flexible nor quick on decisions. We are leveraging our relationship as best as we can within their guidelines.</p><p>Q: What happened with the Hyundai partnership, any new developments?<br>A: There are many divisions of Hyundai. Hyundai Mobis, a SI company, works with Blocko to service Hyundai Group companies with blockchain solutions. Hyundai Motors is a customer of Blocko that utilizes AERGO Enterprise platform for used car part inventory tracking solution.</p><p>Q: How is the AERGO Hub being received? Any feedback received?<br>A: We have just opened our beta testing program and just started to collect feedback. We will be sharing the feedback with the community soon.</p><p>Q: Would a buyback option be available in the future?<br>A: This is an option that can be considered in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Q: Would you buy ad slots on Coinmarketcap to promote AERGO.<br>A: At AERGO Mainnet launch we did purchase ads on Coinmarketcap website, however the return on investment was not high. We may consider again in the future major events. We do however send regular signals on Blockfolio.</p><p>Q: Can the website be updated with current news and information?<br>A: Current news and information are always posted on the website. We are looking into making it more easily&nbsp;visible.</p><p>Q: How do you feel about doing promotions on Twitter to spread the recognition of this coin, giveaway or something.<br>A: We would be open to ideas. We have done giveaways on AMAs in the past that were promoted on&nbsp;Twitter.</p><p>Q: New listings, we know you mentioned Coinbase, did you apply? What happened there? What about other exchanges, US consumers have no way to buy this coin.<br>A: Exchanges have very strict NDA regarding listings. All we can say at this point is that one of our goals is to list on an US based exchange.</p><p>Q: Thoughts on partnerships with other coins?<br>A: Yes, this is something we are brainstorming. If you have any ideas, we would definitely be open to hearing about them. We do not want to just announce a partnership for the sake of pumping the token price. We would like to do a real partnership where it can scale in the future and sustain a high token&nbsp;price.</p><p>Q: Have partnerships also promote AERGO, as it stands most partnerships just mention Blocko but never AERGO.<br>A: Press releases with Blocko’s customers are very tricky. Most of the high profile customers go through their PR department reviews. Mentioning themselves, and their SI partner is easy, but adding a 3rd party company into press releases is difficult.</p><p>Q: More community involvement and most of all ACTIVE social media handles. (Not a post here and then 2 or 3 weeks later another post)<br>A: We have AERGO Knights that we support to do posts for us, as well as our marketing agency. Time to time, AERGO team members participate in the official channels.</p><p>Q: Are you able to hire a company to handle the social media side who is able to be ACTIVE and constantly remind old users and new users alike of what is being worked on and what has been done already.<br>A: We are actively doing this, but we could do this more frequently.</p><p>Q: The United Nations bought 2.8M LTO coins (similar project to AERGO) and is going to use it for a digital land registry in Afghanistan. That is proof that huge organizations and governments are not afraid of blockchain tech any more. The AERGO team can use it as an argument in negotiations with companies. AERGO was going to do some land registry as well. What is the progress? Will it / does it use AERGO mainnet?<br>A: Every country has different laws regarding certification of documents. Just because one country uses blockchain one way, does not mean another country will adopt their policy. The Korean government does not yet recognize certification through public blockchain, however they do recognize private blockchain usage with certain licenses in place. Blocko was able to install AERGO Enterprise for a Korean land registry to certify land deeds to thwart forged deeds. Until the laws in Korea are changed, which we currently see changes in the right direction, we can only service the customers with their current needs. But, the good news is that Blocko and AERGO are positioned with our customers, should the day public blockchain usage becomes certified.<br><br>Q: AERGO knows that they are partners of Samsung. But do Samsung know that they are partners of AERGO? Is AERGO really a partner of Samsung or is it just a marketing thingy?<br>A: Yes, Samsung knows AERGO is a partner of their Samsung Blockchain Wallet. Contracts were signed to be listed on the wallet. We continue to discuss programs that we can implement to promote both AERGO and their Blockchain wallet.</p><p>Q: Forbes is mentioning Samsung and its Nexledger on the Blockchain 50 list each year. Is there some way we could be mentioned instead/ next to Nexledger in the list?<br>A: I believe the answer is no, as Nexledger is Samsung SDS’&nbsp;product.</p><p>Q: What is the strategy for AERGO in Korea? Won-Beom Kim shared there is one. Why do most Koreans not know about AERGO in its own region?<br>A: We have stepped up our marketing in Korea to the crypto investor community. AERGO is more widely known in the Enterprise segment versus consumer&nbsp;segment.</p><p>Q: Why not do live AMA’s with big youtube influencers like BOXMINING OR IVAN ON TECH&nbsp;?<br>A: We can look into doing AMAs with influencers, however we are mindful of not spending our marketing budget on everything. Influencers are expensive and we need to be strategic with our budgets.<br><br><br>Q: A weekly or bi weekly summary of what’s been worked on will be useful for keeping the community updated on progress. For example A timeline for all the projects that AERGO is working on like ISDB, DTT, CCCV.<br>A: We will consider making a dashboard to show progress of our projects/timelines.</p><p>Q: Where is the updated roadmap?<br>A: It will be published before the end of February.</p><p>Q: Why no marketing is being done?<br>A: Marketing is being done regularly, as we have an agency that helps us with marketing AERGO.</p><p>Q: What happened to the Samsung partnership?<br>A: We have a great relationship and will continue to find joint projects.</p><p>Q: Request to reduce supply to 50m from 500m in the ratio of 10:1 like algorand<br>A: Could you supply a compelling reason for this technically, and not just for token price&nbsp;pumping?</p><p>Q: What is AERGO’s plan to increase community engagement and draw in developers to build on mainnet and drive network effect<br>A: We are hoping to do this with our AERGO Hub product. We will also create programs that incubate compelling developer/projects on AERGO<br><br><br>Q: Are there any plans for community events?<br>A: We are looking into online&nbsp;events.</p><p>Q: What is this year's roadmap? We were told the team is working on releasing it soon<br>A: Roadmap will be published within the month of&nbsp;February</p><p>Q: Have u thought about renewing the brand? New website, Logo etc.?<br>A: We are looking to refresh with easier view of relevant information</p><p>Q: What date will the roadmap be released? The team has been saying we’ll let you know for weeks. It’s been almost 2 months since the new year and halfway into the quarter. We need a date.<br>A: The roadmap will be published in the month of&nbsp;February</p><p>Q: What’s happening with Samsung DeFi partnership? There was meant to be a competition to promote dapps being built on AERGO. What is the update&nbsp;?<br>A: We are currently working on the fine&nbsp;details.</p><p>Q: What do you plan specifically in terms of marketing? Blog on website, reddit, etc.?<br>A: We have published a steady stream of blogs and updates. We have not published on Reddit, however we are looking into assigning someone to this. Also looking frequently into micro promotions.</p><p>Q: Jae Shin mentioned that the team hopes for Korean government to start to recognize crypto currencies as a security. What is the reason for this?<br>A: Currently cryptocurrencies are not recognized in Korea as a form of security. This prevents banks from using crypto as a form of monetary instrument nor a need for custody. As many countries are not recognizing crypto as a security, this holds back many services from using crypto as a replacement for&nbsp;fiat.</p><p>Q: How many tokens are currently staked?<br>A: Currently there are 48 million AERGO tokens staked, which is about 9.6% of circulating supply.</p><p>Q: What separates AERGO from other leading enterprise blockchains and platforms?<br>A: Unlike other Enterprise Blockchains, it has entered the real business market with a partner called BLOCKO and has the ability to expand further. BLOCKO supports easy interworking between Private Blockchain and Public Blockchain through solutions such as AERGO Enterprise Manager.</p><p>Q: Is AERGO/Blocko looking at implementing DeFi? To clarify, I'm aware of the KDAC/Kobit move. I'm talking about yield farming within AERGO, or if AERGO would look at lending, loaning, insurance provision or being an aggregator?<br>A: AERGO/BLOCKO has no plans to directly develop DeFi and issue tokens. However, AERGO is preparing for the DeFi/Dapp Contest and Incubation, and is looking forward to creating a new business based on the AERGO mainnet.<br><br><br>Q: Are there any plans to list AERGO tokens on Uniswap? If yes, what is the status and when can we expect to see AERGO on Uniswap?<br>A&nbsp;: The AERGO Foundation does not provide liquidity directly to Uniswap. The community has listed AERGO pairs. You can check it by looking up the latest contract address (0x91Af0fBB28ABA7E31403Cb457106Ce79397FD4E6 ).</p><p>We appreciate all the questions you have asked the team and understand your concerns. 2021 has plenty in store for all of us, we will be releasing our updated roadmap soon so keep an eye out for that!

<p>このような活動の一環として、ジェルリダ・アフリカは、アフリカ拠点の起業家や開発者の育成を目的とした<a href="https://www.abdcseries.com/">ABDC（Africa Blockchain Dev Call）プログラム</a>を開催。3月には、「<a href="https://www.meetup.com/jelurida-africa-blockchain-meetup-group/events/276559447/?utm_content=buffer4efdf&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">タンザニア・ブロックチェーン・ミートアップ</a>&nbsp;」と題した、教育目的のミートアップを主催する予定だ。</p>

<p>ジェルリダの共同創設者Lior Yaffe氏曰く、ジェルリダがアフリカに拠点を置き、アフリカ基盤のプロジェクトをサポートしているのは、同地域の金融サービスの少なさ、および透明性への需要増加が理由だという。このようなケースは、分散型台帳技術の最適なユースケースであると、同氏は述べている。</p>

<p>To make your <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy</a>, your best ally for 2021: this is the main objective of our team.</p>
 What's new in Cozy? 
<p></p>
 💶 Cozy Banks 
<p>New banks and banking institutions have been added to your banking aggregator, <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Banks</a> (Revolut, N26, Natixis Interépargne (Epargne Salariale), etc.).</p>
<p></p> More than 90 banking institutions available and to be connected to your Cozy<p></p>
<p>The Banks application is also available on iOS and Android.</p>
<p><a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#bank"></a></p>
 🗒 Cozy Notes 
<p>While waiting for the possibility to add images in Notes, our team has implemented commands to enrich your notes with version 1.14.0 which includes :</p>
<p>✨ an improvement of the tables: cell merging , choice of column size, coloring of boxes<br>
✨ adding a date<br>
✨ the addition of blocks for code</p>
 Cozy Drive - web 
<p>✅ Guaranteeing you certified documents</p>
<p></p>Interface of documents certified by your Cozy<p></p>
<p>Your Cozy acts as a **trusted third party and certifies that the document conforms to the one uploaded, that it has not been modified. Each unmodified document appears today in your Drive folder with a marker of the brand (see the CAF example above).</p>
<p>It is a big job within our team and in the future, if for example when you present an invoice as proof of address when you register for your children's nursery or for a mortgage loan, your Cozy will guarantee to your contacts that it is indeed the original document, and that it is trustworthy. This functionality will be enhanced to guarantee you more "certified" documents. This is not currently the case.</p>
<p>✅ Making it easier for you to share folders with Drive and Notes</p>
<p>The collaborative sharing functionality in Drive is continuously improved.<br>
For example, by creating a new folder in your Drive, you can :</p>
 
 create a note (here: 20210216Mathematics courses - with Pythagoras Theorem as subject) 
 add a link to the definition of the Pythagorean theorem from the Wikipedia site. 
 add a link from another site to complete the folder you are going to share. 
 
<p></p> Shared folder interface with bookmarks<p></p>
<p>The Drive application is also available on iOS and Android (and also on apk😎)</p>

<p>Rebuilding our foundational infrastructure</p><p>We need to step into a phase of rebuilding. Rebuilding not towards what we had but towards an increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">antifragile</a> and empathetic society. This transition will require governments, institutions, companies, and associations to rethink and reconstruct the contextual settings [FIGURE 1] in which people operate - society’s platform for the future. It is increasingly clear how the micro molecular violences of late 20th century society e.g. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303796991_Association_between_neighbourhood_air_pollution_concentrations_and_dispensed_medication_for_psychiatric_disorders_in_a_large_longitudinal_cohort_of_Swedish_children_and_adolescents">air pollution</a>, <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-noise-pollution-biggest-health-city.html">noise pollution</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751071/">light pollution</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759372/">household stresses</a>, <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/coronavirus-threatens-global-surge-malnutrition-jeopardizing-future-extra-10-million-children">nutrient decline</a>, etc. foundationally impact our mental health and wellbeing and thereby limit the collective capacity of our&nbsp;society.</p><p>Remaking our institutional, environmental and cultural contexts will be essential to the development of people’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities. In a time of complexity and uncertainty, these capacities provide foundational infrastructure for our 21st- and 22nd-century society and economy. They are of the highest priority during the nascent rebuilding phase.</p>Figure 1: Overview of the contextual settings that drive mental&nbsp;wealth<p>But how do we work towards rebuilding people’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities when there are increases in <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis">depression rates</a>, <a href="https://ki.se/en/nasp/the-coronavirus-risk-for-increased-suicide-and-self-harm-in-the-society-after-the-pandemic">suicides</a>, <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/4/statement-ed-phumzile-violence-against-women-during-pandemic?gclid=CjwKCAiAsaOBBhA4EiwAo0_AnHQc3UlX2TiO7ktE0pmu8edO0KPJwPrfz-jkreF1WkGz37JRJnPkKxoCbJcQAvD_BwE">domestic violence</a>, and <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/government-society-unemployment-covid19/">unemployment</a>? How do we rebuild public good and the ability to imagine another future when existential hope seems&nbsp;lost?</p><p>Drawing from our experiences across Sweden, Canada, and South Korea, we have identified five vital areas of focus during the rebuilding phase. This blog post examines key lessons that have been&nbsp;learned.</p><p>Five key take-aways</p> 1. Language and metrics for a systemic policy architecture <p>Through conversations and research it has become clear that the taxonomy of mental health is largely associated with treatment, failure to treat and the clinical space of operation. This reality has structurally limited our capacity to systemically perceive and allocate resources to prevention and perhaps more critically thriving. (We define thriving as the substantial improvement of mental health at a societal scale; an achievement equivalent to the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">20th century feat of doubling life expectancy</a>).</p><p>Further, if we are to rebuild a societal-scale and entangled infrastructure, we need to start by describing the same thing, using a shared language. Currently, our taxonomy landscape is not only varied, but also a driver of different objectives. Either it encourages the legitimate need to increase funding for treatment and support services or it encourages the genuine investment in deep prevention and thriving. A plurality of perspectives visible across contexts: New Zealand, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/05/new-zealand-is-publishing-its-first-well-being-budget/">Wellbeing Budget</a>; the World Health Organisation, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response">Mental Health</a>; the UK Government, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/292453/mental-capital-wellbeing-summary.pdf">Mental Capital and Wellbeing</a>; and the Swedish Government, <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2020/01/17-miljarder-for-att-framja-psykisk-halsa/">Psychological Health</a>.</p><p>We believe we currently don’t have the descriptors necessary to make a case to for this entangled infrastructure, thereby operating in a state of ambiguity and challenge, trying to chart a shared way forward. Therefore, our next step needs to be shared language and taxonomy; taking into account the nuanced cultural, historical, and contextual differences and the added complexity they generate.</p><p>In software engineering, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/importance-of-ubiquitous-language-in-domain-driven">ubiquitous language</a> describes the idea of domain specific languages. While this is not directly comparable, it is possible to learn how shared language among actors in a single domain can enable rigorous and reliable communication between them, unlocking the potential for collective problem-solving. In the absence of existing terminology, we will refer to a shared language for society’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities as mental&nbsp;wealth.</p><p>In addition to providing clarity and direction, shared language can further encourage the design of shared metrics. These metrics help us understand the current mental wealth of a specific context, its evolution over time, and how it compares to other contexts. What is learned from data collection and analysis can inform the development of new policies that consider the entangled challenge of rebuilding our mental&nbsp;wealth.</p><p>There are already some metrics in place for mental health using <a href="https://delphis.org.uk/mental-health/continuum-mental-health/">zoning systems</a>. However, these are based on the individual scale while mental wealth is concerned with the societal scale. Once again, language becomes important. As mental wealth involves multiple actors and domains, we need to be able to make sense at scale, as well as across sectors and departments. Without this common ground, it becomes difficult to write cross-contextual policies. It seems to be that this is one of the reasons why a systemic policy architecture for mental wealth is nowhere to be&nbsp;seen.</p> 2. Investing in an entangled infrastructure <p>We believe that mental wealth can not be seen as a cost. Instead, it needs to be seen as an infrastructure enabled through societal-scale investments. By nature, mental wealth is a systemic problem, driven by multiple factors [FIGURE 2]. Investing in it requires us to move beyond short-return cycles and single-point investments. We need to co-curate portfolios of investments that are able to reach into the future, span across sectors and departments, and unlock innovation.</p>Figure 2: Drivers of mental health and wellbeing and the investment classes required to build mental&nbsp;wealth<p>Building a mental wealth portfolio requires us to focus on improving the contextual settings in which people operate. These settings create the foundation on which society’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities can develop. This could&nbsp;include:</p>  Increasing a community’s <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145305/green-space-is-good-for-mental-health#:~:text=The%20scientists%20found%20that%20citizens,substance%20abuse%20in%20later%20years.">nature-based areas</a>. For example, by introducing <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-aa141acdf227">urban&nbsp;forests</a>.  Reducing nighttime light pollution. For example, by adopting <a href="https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/light-pollution-solutions/">dark-sky solutions</a>.  Supporting the availability of <a href="https://www.search-institute.org/our-research/youth-development-research/sparks-and-thriving/">sports and other activities</a>. For example, through initiatives like <a href="https://sparksgeneration.com/omoss/">Sparks Generation</a>.  Developing <a href="https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/87573/E72015.pdf">non-polluting public transport</a> that provide citizens with access to their surroundings, as exemplified by <a href="https://www.drivesweden.net/en/news/mobility-service-watch-new-film">Mobility as a&nbsp;Service</a>.  <p>Each intervention of this type has spillover effects across sectors and departments. They require us to build the capacities and the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-elements-for-a-way-forward-c208787ab6ae">elements</a> that coordinate, measure, transact, pool, and aggregate the co-beneficiary results, their spillover effects, and their beneficiaries [FIGURE 3]. Without the ability to do this, we will struggle to invest in the entangled infrastructure of mental&nbsp;wealth.</p>Figure 3: Co-benefits, spillover effects, and beneficiaries of a community urban&nbsp;forest 3. An accounting framework for the&nbsp;future <p>It is often said that we make what we measure. If this is the case, there is a risk that investment in mental wealth could be under-prioritised as a result of missing metrics. Without them, we lack the data to build a case. More importantly, we are deprived of the ability to account for, drive, and value the co-beneficial results and spillover effects of a mental wealth portfolio.</p><p>For example, healthcare institutions know well how to account for the cost of treatment. They have done so for generations, with balance sheets remaining within health departments. However, when it comes to health budgets and accounting for prevention, it is unclear how they account, individually or collectively, for the costs and values created, especially as these often relate to future risks and the liabilities of not addressing the&nbsp;risks.</p><p>There is, then, a case for introducing an accounting framework that spans across silos and is able to account for the long-term effects of our mental wealth infrastructure, including benefits, risks, and liabilities. Values which might otherwise have <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">disappeared from the public good</a> become the very reason for investment in the first&nbsp;place.</p> 4. Capacity for horizontal collaboration <p>Unless we are able to build distributed capacity to collaborate and drive a co-beneficial thesis, we risk becoming permanently stuck in silos. Today, many of us are trained to optimise one silo at a time; a reality where the boundary of a problem is defined by the name of the department. However, mental wealth is a <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/wicked-problem/about/What-is-a-wicked-problem">wicked problem</a> that ignores and spans boundaries. It is necessary, therefore, that we build the human capacity to (re)organise for an entangled and dynamic&nbsp;system.</p><p>Governments need to be able to collaborate across multiple domains and actors, creating a shared portfolio of interventions to invest in. These should&nbsp;enable:</p>  Horizontal innovation across whole value&nbsp;chains.  Shared understanding of the portfolio created.  A foundation to make collective decisions  Distributed agency to move different interventions forward.  <p>This approach can move us beyond departmental and sectoral divisions and address the reality of a dynamic&nbsp;system.</p>Figure 4: The reinforcing feedback loop between horizontal collaboration and mental&nbsp;wealth<p>Building the human capacity to collaborate horizontally is, at the same time, dependent on our mental wealth. Without developing people’s social and emotional capacity, it becomes difficult to unlock complex collaboration. It is necessary, therefore, to design capacity-building processes that incorporate social and emotional training. Without it, we will struggle to implement co-beneficial solutions where the human is no longer optimised to be a ‘bad robot’ but, rather, a highly cognitive, emotional, and social&nbsp;being.</p><p>Horizontal collaboration further requires the enabling of cross-departmental and sectoral budgeting. The healthcare sector is facing a <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis">treatment crisis</a> and the education sector a <a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/education-not-cost-its-investment-recovery">learning crisis</a>. Asking these sectors to move significant budgets from doctors, nurses, and teachers in order to invest in an urban forest becomes problematic. Even in cases where it could <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-noise-pollution-biggest-health-city.html">prevent more people</a> from showing up at the socially distanced waiting rooms or from drifting away during an online class <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27922536/">owing to a neighbourhood’s poor air quality</a>. Therefore, we need to build the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-elements-for-a-way-forward-c208787ab6ae">elements</a> that allow us to pool funds horizontally. Allowing health and education sectors to use seed funding as a directional tool, inviting other investment-strong departments to follow and provide the societal-scale investments required.</p><p>Once the horizontal budget is on its way, we need to talk about procurement. Procurement is the most common tool for investing in infrastructures, especially in relation to the public sector. It has many upsides and downsides, laid out well by our colleague <a href="https://alastairparvin.medium.com/">Alastair Parvin</a> in ‘<a href="https://alastairparvin.medium.com/after-the-crisis-lets-fix-procurement-428c598fb558">After the Crisis</a>’. The most significant challenge regarding mental wealth is the ability to procure for co-beneficial outcomes across departments. The European Commission refers to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/public-procurement-reform-provides-explicit-rules-public-public-cooperation-0_en">public-public cooperation</a> as an enabler of contracts between departments without having to call for tender. However, it is clear that these corporations are still rare cases and do not allow the involvement of private bodies. This reality prompts the question: How do we increase procurement for co-beneficial outcomes within and beyond the public sector, for the public&nbsp;good?</p><p>We do not have all the answers to this question. However, we have shared initial thoughts about it in our ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">Bridging the Investment</a>’ series and look forward to continuing to unpack how to enable horizontal collaboration for mental&nbsp;wealth.</p> 5. Insuring societal scale innovation <p>Today large investment goes towards treatment related innovation. However, the societal scale innovation required to rebuild an entangled infrastructure goes beyond treatment and sits between sectors and departments. Traditional financing models for grants and public funding struggles to provide the speed or quantity of capital required to bridge this innovation gap. Impact investing also falls short, as risk models cannot price the scale or nature of the societal solutions required. As such, innovation for mental wealth tends to fall outside eligibility criteria.</p><p>Therefore, we ask ourselves: how do we fund at speed the scale of the necessary innovation? The answer may not lie in innovation itself, but in the ability to dynamically match innovation to future and societal scaled liabilities. In an age of complexity and uncertainty, the matching of these liabilities with potential hedges or solutions is a structural issue for innovation financing. It is what is called a settlement risk and unless we bridge the risk between liability holders and innovators we might not be able to ensure the societal scaled innovation required to rebuild our mental&nbsp;wealth.</p>Figure 5: financing ecosystems for multi-actor innovation capacity<p>There are still many questions related to how this could be done. Currently we are exploring the potential of creating financing ecosystems for multi-actor innovation capacity and a contract that can transfer the settlement risk to underwriters. At the centre of such an ecosystem, a Public Interest Trust operates to 1) pool the liabilities of mental illness and 2) aggregate the investment required to fund innovation for mental wealth. The high investment risk would be underwritten by grant and philanthropic funds, rather than being provided by them [FIGURE 5]. Thereby, larger investments can be attracted, creating a financial hedge against the settlement risk. Over time this hedge would be transformed into a natural hedge, as the innovation becomes the insurer of the liabilities.</p><p>Due to their size and density, cities are currently the main liability holders of mental wealth and innovators are the ones providing the solutions able to hedge these risks. Therefore, we see cities (including public, private and civic) and innovators (public, private and amateur) as the main actors in the ecosystem. An ecosystem, which we argue could help us bridge the innovation gap and support the systemic rebuilding of our mental wealth [FIGURE&nbsp;6].</p>Figure 6: Enabling the rebuilding of Psychological Wealth Moving towards rebuilding <p>As we look forward to a society that no longer favours precariousness and starts rebuilding an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">antifragile</a> foundation for mental wealth, we recognise the need of a “<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-necessity-of-a-boring-revolution-a71b1ae6f956">boring revolution</a>”. A revolution focused on delivering a co-beneficial economy that transitions our contextual settings. A revolution of how we account, how we bridge silos and how we invest in societal infrastructures.</p><p>Our mental wealth is the foundational entangled infrastructure that enables society to build back better. It is an infrastructure in need of a revolution to manifest and without it, we will not be able to create the inclusive societal capacities that unlock the full potential of our 21st-century and 22nd-century reality.</p><p>This is a revolution necessary for the future and of equivalence to the late 19th century/20th century revolution of public health which yielded the 2nd industrial revolution.</p><p>We are grateful having had the chance to explore these questions with passionate people.

  <p>As game creators, we hold a fundamental responsibility to protect and secure any and all data that our players entrust to us. Historically, security in games has not been high on the priority list because games were enjoyed anonymously and offline. But with our society becoming ever more connected, demand for social gaming experiences and online gaming features has increased exponentially. This has led to the development of cloud-based gaming platforms, such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/what-is-playfab">PlayFab</a>, that handle everything from multiplayer server hosting, leaderboard tracking, virtual economy, data/analytics, and much more. Even games that are mostly considered “offline” are seeing increased demand for some connected functionality. As more games are developed in the cloud (or developed with cloud-based platforms) and track an increasingly large amount of user data, security is becoming one of the highest priorities for the games community.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In their 2020 <a href="https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-security-gaming-you-cant-solo-security-report-2020.pdf">State of the Internet / Security</a> report, Akamai tracked 100 Billion credential stuffing attacks from June 2018 to June 2020 and found that 10 Billion of these attacks were targeted at gamers. It is not just up to the player or the distribution platform to take security seriously. Players expect that the game companies producing the product that they are trusting their data to will also be keeping them secure.</p>

<p>In <a>Identity Security for Games in C# with Unity</a>, we took a look at the extreme basics of storing and authenticating users in a Unity project. That example is a great starting point for the fundamentals, providing a “hello world” concept within the Unity editor. I want to expand upon how the design can change depending on the build target and how to make use of a player’s authorization by passing it into other back-end platforms. To do this, we will be building a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-gettingstarted.html">WebGL</a> application in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> that authenticates player’s and authorizes them to <a href="https://playfab.com/">Azure Playfab</a>; where their player data will be stored. Here is a conceptual overview of what this will look like:</p>

 Build Target and Design 

<p>For this project, I will be targeting <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-gettingstarted.html">Unity WebGL</a>. The build target is important because different platforms will require different means of facilitating user interaction.</p>

<p>In <a>Identity Security for Games in C# with Unity</a>, I described both native and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc">OAuth</a> design concepts. While building out a user interface for authentication natively in the engine might seem like the best approach because of user experience, it is not the preferred approach for security, and it typically adds much more effort for the developer. This is because it requires the developer to build out logic supporting the entire <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#transaction-state">authentication state machine</a>; securely handling every event, every MFA state, registration, MFA enrollment, user self service (account unlock and password reset), etc.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Prebuilt widgets can simplify the amount of effort in this regard. However, developers would still be asking a player to enter their password into an untrusted UI that the developer is responsible for and typically not able to fully keep secure. This is why OAuth is considered the best practice standard for authorization within the security industry, and utilizing a security platform’s hosted login experience is considered the most secure way to handle authentication. Players will be entering their credentials into a trusted browser window and a trustworthy security platform. Best of all, developers can share the responsibility of keeping the login experience with the security platform, which is much easier and more secure than attempting to do it all themselves.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Ok, great. But how does this relate to the build target? The browser. OAuth relies on a browser to facilitate user authentication, which must validate the user identity before providing authorization. Every platform will have a different, platform-specific way of presenting the user with a browser to interact with. For WebGL, the game is already running in a browser, so a simple pop up is all that is needed. But if the build target were Android, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/multidevice/android/customtabs/">Chrome Custom Tabs</a> would instead be needed to embed the browser into the app. Similarly, if the build target was iOS, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller">Safari View Controller</a> would be needed to embed the browser into the app. For full-screen games on a PC, it would be better to use a <a href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/device-code/">device code</a> concept, similar to a TV or IoT device, or even authenticate the player before launching the game client; from an external launcher application interacting with the default browser on the operating system. The browser interaction and design will change for every platform and device. When designing the authentication experience, the build target will heavily influence the rest of the design.</p>

<p>The good news is that once the target is defined and the browser interaction decided, the rest of the code should be similar across all platforms. This is thanks to the shared responsibility with a security platform’s hosted login experience and a standardized authorization specification. The job of the developer is to securely provide a platform-preferred browser experience for the user and direct them to the OAuth authorize endpoint. Once the user has authenticated, the browser is closed, and an auth code is captured in client code to be exchanged for tokens behind the scenes. With tokens in hand, user authorization can be passed to all other backend cloud platforms; providing a centralized, and secure, identity security design that drastically simplifies the implementation effort.</p>

<p>With a build target in mind, lets look at how to code this in Unity.</p>

 Create the Project 

<p>First, if you have not already done so, create a new project from <code>Unity Hub</code> with the <code>3D</code> template.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, configure the Playfab Unity SDK and Editor Extensions using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/sdks/unity3d/quickstart">Unity Quickstart</a> provided by PlayFab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Create a new scene by clicking File, New Scene and save it in the projects <code>Assets</code> &gt; <code>Scenes</code> folder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Change the project to targetWebGL by, clicking File, Build Settings, WebGL, and then click Switch Platform.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you did not install WebGL when you installed this copy of the editor, you would be prompted to do so now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure that your newly created scene is checked in the <code>Scenes In Build</code> menu, and then close the <code>Build Settings</code> UI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you do not see your scene, click the Add Open Scenes button in the bottom right of the <code>Scenes In Build</code> menu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right-click in the <code>Scene Hierarchy</code> panel and click UI, Button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will be the button that triggers the authentication request.</p>

<p>Right click the button in the <code>Hierarchy</code> panel,  click Rename and name the button <code>Sign In.</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>Expand the <code>Sign In</code> button in the <code>Hierarchy</code> panel to expose its text object and select it.</p>

<p>Change the text of the button in the <code>Inspector</code> panel to <code>Sign In.</code></p>

<p></p>

 Interact With the Browser 

<p></p>

<p>With the project ready, the next thing needed is a way for the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html">WebGL object to interact with the browser</a> HTML that is holding it. This is because the C# in Unity will be called when the user clicks the <code>Sign In</code> button and that C# code needs to instruct the browser to render a popup window for the user to complete authentication.</p>

<p>To do this, a jslib is used to act as the middleman between the C# in Unity and the JavaScript in the WebGL objects parent page.</p>

<p>Open up a preferred text editor, create a new file called <code>OAuth.jslib</code>, and save it in your project’s <code>Assets</code> &gt; <code>Plugins</code> folder.</p>

<p>Add the following to <code>OAuth.jslib</code> and save it.</p>

   <code>mergeInto(LibraryManager.library, 
{
        startAuthentication: function (utf8String) 
        {
                var authRequest = UTF8ToString(utf8String);
                var authorizationRequest = authRequest;
                startAuth(authorizationRequest);
        }
});
</code>   

<p>This code very simply takes an OAuth authorization request URI, passed to it from the calling C# in Unity, and passes it to a corresponding startAuth() function in the parent page’s JavaScript. This <code>startAuth()</code> function will instruct the browser to open a popup and redirect to the OAuth authorization URI passed to it by the C# in Unity. The WebGL object calls the jslib which runs in the browser, allowing it to interact with the code running in the browser where the WebGL object cant.</p>

<p>Next, create the <code>startAuth()</code> function in the JavaScript within the WebGL’s parent page so that the C# can interact with it via the <code>OAuth.jslib</code>. To do this, start by building the WebGL project in Unity, which will generate an <code>index.html</code> that renders the WebGL object.</p>

<p>Click File, Build Settings and then click Build.</p>

<p>Select a preferred output folder and then click Select Folder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the build process is complete, open the output folder and then open the <code>index.html</code> file in a preferred text editor. The contents of <code>index.html</code> may vary depending on if you are on Windows or Mac and depending on what version of the editor you are using. The important thing to note in what Unity generates is that there should be a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element towards the top of the HTML that contains the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;script&gt;
        var unityInstance = UnityLoader.instantiate("unityContainer", "Build/WebGL2.json", {onProgress: UnityProgress});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p><code>unityInstance</code> is the container that holds the WebGL object. This is how the page’s JavaScript will be able to call back to the C# code in Unity using:</p>

   <code>unityInstance.SendMessage(objectName, methodName, value);
</code>   

<p>Find the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags in the HTML and locate the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. Right before the closing tag, at the end of body, add the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;script&gt;
function startAuth(authorizationRequest) 
{
        window.addEventListener('message', function (e) 
        {
                unityInstance.SendMessage("OAuth2", "getAuthResults", data);
        }, false);

        var childwin;
        const childname = "Authenticate";
        childwin = window.open(authorizationRequest, childname, 'height=300px, width=500px');

        childwin.focus();
};
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is the JavaScript function that the <code>Sign In</code> button in the WebGL object will trigger. The button does this by first calling a function in C# on its click event. That function will then call the <code>OAuth.jslib</code> which will then call this <code>startAuth()</code> function in the page JavaScript. This represents the best way for WebGL to provide browser interaction to the player from within the WebGL object.</p>

   <code>window.addEventListener('message', function (e) 
{
        unityInstance.SendMessage("OAuth2", "getAuthResults", data);
}, false);
</code>   

<p><code>window.addEventListener()</code> creates an event listener that will be called by a child popup window when authentication is complete. The result of authentication will be an <code>Auth Code</code> sent back to the C# in the WebGL object via <code>unityInstance.SendMessage()</code>.</p>

   <code>var childwin;
const childname = "Authenticate";
childwin = window.open(authorizationRequest, childname, 'height=300px, width=500px');
</code>   

<p>With the event listener ready, <code>window.open()</code> is used to create a popup window to the OAuth authorization request URI.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>childwin.focus();</code> ensures that the popup focuses on the user to interact with.</p>

<p>Now that the WebGL’s parent page can initiate the authentication process and wait for a response from the authentication process, the next thing that is needed is a separate <code>callback.html</code> page for the OAuth authorization server to redirect the user back to after authentication. Because the authentication process is happening in the parent pages popup window, the <code>callback.html</code> page will also be rendered after authentication is successful. This will allow the <code>callback.html</code> page to receive the resulting <code>Auth Code</code> and send it back to the parent page via the event listener.</p>

<p>In the same folder as <code>index.html</code> create a new file called <code>callback.html</code> using a preferred text editor. The HTML in this page should be designed based on project needs, but it typically will not be rendered long enough for a player to see it. Add the following and customize the HTML as desired:</p>

   <code> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-us"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        //Parse query string helper function
        function getParameterByName(name, url = window.location.href) 
        {
                name = name.replace(/[\[\]]/g, '\\$&amp;');
                var regex = new RegExp('[?&amp;]' + name + '(=([^&amp;#]*)|&amp;|#|$)'), results = regex.exec(url);

                if (!results) 
                {
                        return null;
                }

                if (!results[2]) 
                {
                        return '';
                }

                    return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace(/\+/g, ' '));
        }

        //Get auth code from query string
        var code = getParameterByName('code');
        //Get state from query string
        var state = getParameterByName('state');

        window.opener.postMessage(code + "," + state, "*")
     
        try 
        {
                window.close();
        }
        catch (e) { console.log(e) }

        try 
        {
                self.close();
        }
        catch (e) { console.log(e) }       
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p><code>getParameterByName()</code> is a helper function that will parse the <code>Auth Code</code> and OAuth <code>State</code> from the query string.</p>

<p><code>window.opener.postMessage()</code> sends the <code>State</code> and <code>Auth Code</code> to the parent window’s event listener so that it can send them back to a callback function in the WebGL’s C#.</p>

<p>Finally, the popup window is closed, putting the player back on the parent page where the WebGL object is waiting for authentication to complete.</p>

<p>With the browser portion of the project complete, the next step is to create the OAuth code in Unity that will be called by the <code>Sign In</code> button’s on click event.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Now that customizations have been made to <code>index.html</code>, it will need to be backed up and replaced every time the project is built because Unity will overwrite it each time.</p>
</blockquote>

 Adding OAuth 

 Configure an Authorization Server 

<p>Many OAuth authorization solutions exist today. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> is the industry-leading, best of breed, identity security platform on the market and allows for creating an unlimited number of OAuth Authorization servers quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Okta provides the easy-to-use <a>Okta CLI</a>, which will simplify the registration and setup process. First, <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Install the Okta CLI</a> for your preferred operating system. With the CLI installed, run the following command:</p>

   <code>okta register
</code>   

<p>Follow the instructions to register for a new Okta account. The CLI will handle the Okta configuration automatically. If you already have an Okta account use the following command instead:</p>

   <code>okta login
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: <code>okta login</code> requires a valid <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/create-the-token/">Okta API Token</a> to be entered. This will be stored in the CLI’s <code>okta.yaml</code> file locally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, run the following command to set up an OAuth app.</p>

   <code>okta apps create
</code>   

<p>Give the app a name, and select option 2, <code>Single Page App</code>, for the application type.</p>

<p>The <code>Redirect URI</code> needs to point to where the <code>callback.html</code> page will be hosted. Use the following URI format, replacing <code>appName</code> with a name that will be used later when deploying the Unity project to Azure App Services.</p>

<p><code>https://appName.azurewebsites.net/callback.html</code></p>

<p>The <code>Post Logout Redirect URI</code> will need to point to where the <code>index.html</code> page will be hosted. Use the following URI format, again replacing <code>appName</code> with a name used later when deploying the Unity project to Azure App Services.</p>

<p><code>https://appName.azurewebsites.net/callback.html</code></p>

<p>Finally, select the <code>default</code> authorization server if prompted.</p>

<p>The CLI will create the application and return an <code>Issuer</code> along with a <code>Client ID.</code> Make sure to take note of both which will be used when creating the OAuth script.</p>

<p></p>

 Create the OAuth Script 

<p>In Unity, install <a href="https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity">Newtonsoft.Json for Unity</a> using the instructions outlined in the library repo.</p>

<p>Next, create a new folder in the <code>Assets</code> folder and name it <code>Scripts</code>.</p>

<p>Right Click in the scripts folder, click Create, and then select C# Script. Name the script <code>OAuth</code> and double click to open it in Visual Studio.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Start by referencing the following libraries:</p>

   <code>using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using UnityEngine.Networking;
</code>   

<p>Next, create a new class called <code>OAuth</code> and declare the needed instance variables to hold the client’s OAuth configuration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The instance variables could pull from a preferred configuration solution, or be exposed to the editor for configuration if desired.</p>
</blockquote>

   <code>public class OAuth2 : MonoBehaviour
{
    [DllImport("__Internal")]
    private static extern void startAuthentication(string authRequest);

    // OAuth2 Client Configuration
    private const string clientID = "{clientId}";
    private const string authorizationEndpoint = "/oauth2/default/v1/authorize";
    private const string tokenEndpoint = "/oauth2/default/v1/token";
    private const string userInfoEndpoint = "/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo";
    private const string redirectURI = "https://appName.azurewebsites.net/callback.html";

    private string state;
    private string code_verifier;
}
</code>   

<p>Notice <code>DllImport</code> referencing the <code>startAuthentication()</code> function from the jslib at the start of the class. This is importing the jslib so that it can be called from the script.</p>

<p>The OAuth endpoints to be used are defined in the instance variables and the URI to the <code>callback.html</code>.</p>

<p>Enter the <code>Okta Domain</code> for your Okta org where indicated in the code above. Change <code>appName</code> in the <code>redirectURI</code> variable to match the app name used when configuring the approved redirectURI in Okta. Remember, this app name will be used later when hosting the project on Azure App Services.</p>

<p>Create a new function called <code>Authenticate()</code> to be called by the <code>Sign In</code> button’s on click event.</p>

   <code>public void Authenticate()
{
        // Generates state and PKCE values.
        state = randomDataBase64url(32);
        code_verifier = randomDataBase64url(32);
        string code_challenge = base64urlencodeNoPadding(sha256(code_verifier));
        const string code_challenge_method = "S256";

        // Creates the OAuth 2.0 authorization request.
        string authorizationRequest = string.Format("{0}?response_type=code&amp;scope=openid%20profile&amp;redirect_uri={1}&amp;client_id={2}&amp;state={3}&amp;code_challenge={4}&amp;code_challenge_method={5}",
            authorizationEndpoint,
            System.Uri.EscapeDataString(redirectURI),
            clientID,
            state,
            code_challenge,
            code_challenge_method);

        startAuthentication(authorizationRequest);
} 
</code>   

<p>The first thing that <code>Authenticate()</code> does is prepare the OAuth Authorization request. This is the request sent to the jslib, and then to the JavaScript running in the browser. The player will be redirected to this URI in a browser popup.</p>

<p><a>Authorization Code grant with PKCE</a> is the most secure and preferred OAuth grant to use. Historically, OAuth has required a client secret to be passed in the authorization request from the client. This design worked fine for back-end services that could securely store the client secret but is flawed in the case of SPA-type applications that do not have a back end. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">Proof Key for Code Exchange</a> (PKCE) was created as a way to remove the need for the client secret altogether. A <code>code_verifier</code> is randomly generated by <code>Authenticate()</code> and then hashed with SHA-256 to create a <code>code_challenge</code>. The code challenge is what replaces the client secret and the code verifier is what will be used to validate the request for tokens after authentication.</p>

<p>Next, <code>Authenticate()</code> builds the authorization request URI with all of the required parameters - including the code challenge, a randomly generated state string, and a redirect uri pointing to the <code>callback.html</code> - and passes it to the jslib <code>startAuthentication()</code> function so that it can be passed to the browser for the popup to navigate to.</p>

<p>Once the popup is displayed, the user authenticates and is redirected back to the <code>callback.html</code> page with an OAuth <code>Auth Code</code> and exact copy of the <code>State</code> string that was included in the authorization request. The <code>callback.html</code> uses <code>window.opener.postMessage(code + "," + state, "*")</code> to send the <code>Auth Code</code> and <code>State</code> back to the parent page holding the WebGL object which triggers the event listener to call <code>unityInstance.SendMessage("OAuth2", "getAuthResults", data);</code>. <code>SendMessage()</code> needs to call a function in the OAuth2 class called <code>getAuthResults()</code>, which will process the authorization results and exchange the auth code for tokens. Add the following code to <code>OAuth.cs</code>:</p>

   <code>public void getAuthResults(string authResult)
{
        string[] s = authResult.Split(',');

        string code = s[0]; // Auth code from javascript
        string incoming_state = s[1]; //state from javascript

        Debug.Log(code);
        Debug.Log(state);

        if (incoming_state != state)
        {
                Debug.Log(String.Format("Received request with invalid state ({0})", incoming_state));
                return;
        }

        performCodeExchange(code, code_verifier, redirectURI);
}
</code>   

<p>This function simply receives the results from the authorization request and parses them. The next step is to exchange the <code>Auth Code</code> for an OAuth <code>Access Token</code> and <code>ID Token.</code></p>

   <code>void performCodeExchange(string code, string code_verifier, string redirectURI)
{
        Debug.Log("Exchanging code for tokens...");

        //Generate token request
        string tokenRequestBody = string.Format("code={0}&amp;redirect_uri={1}&amp;client_id={2}&amp;code_verifier={3}&amp;scope=openid&amp;grant_type=authorization_code",
            code,
            System.Uri.EscapeDataString(redirectURI),
            clientID,
            code_verifier);

        UnityWebRequest uwr = new UnityWebRequest(tokenEndpoint, "POST");
        var contentBytes = new UTF8Encoding().GetBytes(tokenRequestBody);
        uwr.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(contentBytes);
        uwr.downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer();

        uwr.SetRequestHeader("content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");

        Debug.Log("TOKEN REQUEST BODY: " + tokenRequestBody);

        UnityWebRequestAsyncOperation async = uwr.SendWebRequest();
        async.completed += (AsyncOperation op) =&gt; { GetTokenExchangeResponse(async); };
}
</code>   

<p>A token request is created using the <code>auth code</code> and <code>code verifier</code>. <code>UnityWebRequest()</code> is used to handle the token request, and the response is sent to a function called <code>GetTokenExchangeResponse()</code> once complete. Create <code>GetTokenExchangeResponse()</code> by adding the following code:</p>

   <code>private void GetTokenExchangeResponse(UnityWebRequestAsyncOperation op)
{
        Debug.Log("Got Token Response");
        string responseText = op.webRequest.downloadHandler.text;
        Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; tokenEndpointDecoded = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;&gt;(responseText);
        string access_token = tokenEndpointDecoded["access_token"];
        string idToken = tokenEndpointDecoded["id_token"];

        PlayFabInterface.Instance.LoginWithOpenIdConnect(idToken);
}
</code>   

<p><code>GetTokenExchangeResponse()</code> simply parses the OAuth <code>Access Token</code> and OAuth <code>ID Token</code> from the response to the token request made by <code>performCodeExchange()</code>. The last line of the function sends the OAuth <code>ID Token</code> to <code>PlayFabInterface.Instance.LoginWithOpenIdConnect()</code> so that it can be used to log the player into PlayFab, which is the last step in this project before it can be deployed.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>Authenticate()</code> referenced a few helper functions for generating the code challenge\verifier, encryption, and encoding.</p>

   <code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns URI-safe data with a given input length.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="length"&gt;Input length (nb. output will be longer)&lt;/param&gt;

public static string randomDataBase64url(uint length)
{
        RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
        byte[] bytes = new byte[length];
        rng.GetBytes(bytes);
        return base64urlencodeNoPadding(bytes);
}

        return sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);

        string base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(buffer);

        // Converts base64 to base64url.
        base64 = base64.Replace("+", "-");
        base64 = base64.Replace("/", "_");
        // Strips padding.
        base64 = base64.Replace("=", "");

        return base64;
}

 Log Into PlayFab 

 Configure PlayFab OIDC 

<p>Before PlayFab can accept authorization tokens from Okta, a new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/playfab/admin/authentication/createopenidconnection?view=playfab-rest">Open ID Connection</a> will need to be created. This is the connection that will give PlayFab the needed information to validate the player’s ID Token.</p>

<p>Log into your PlayFab portal and click on the title for your project. If you do not have a <code>Studio</code> or <code>Title</code> created, create them now. The studio and title would have been needed for the PlayFab Unity SDK setup.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click the gear next to the title name in the top left and select Title Settings.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the <code>Open ID Connect</code> tab and select New Connection</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the <code>New Connection</code> menu, name the Connection ID <code>Okta</code> and enter the <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Issuer</code> from the app set up by the Okta CLI. <code>Client Secret</code> is not used because of <code>PKCE </code>, so enter any random string into the <code>Client Secret</code> box in PlayFab. Finally, PlayFab is just validating an ID Token from an external authorization server so nonce is not needed here. Check <code>Ignore nonce</code> and click Save Connection.</p>

<p></p>

<p>PlayFab is now able to validate ID Tokens from the OAuth Authorization Server in Okta.</p>

 Create the PlayFab Interface Script 

<p>Now that the player has successfully authenticated, the last step is to authorize the player to PlayFab using the ID token received after authentication.</p>

<p>In Unity, right click in the <code>Assets</code> &gt; <code>Scripts</code> folder and select Create, C# Script. Name the script PlayFabInterface.cs and double click to open the script in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Start the script with the following using statements:</p>

   <code>using UnityEngine;
using PlayFab;
using PlayFab.ClientModels;
</code>   

<p>Next, create a new class called <code>PlayFabInterface</code>:</p>

   <code>public class PlayFabInterface : MonoBehaviour
{
}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>LoginWithOpenIdConnect()</code> function:</p>

   <code>public void LoginWithOpenIdConnect(string _idToken)
{
        Debug.LogError("LoginWithOpenIDConnect Start! Token: " + _idToken);
        var request = new LoginWithOpenIdConnectRequest();
        request.ConnectionId = "Okta";
        request.IdToken = _idToken;
        request.CreateAccount = true;

        PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithOpenIdConnect(request, OIDCLoginSuccess, OIDCLoginFailure, _idToken);
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, handle the results:</p>

   <code>public void OIDCLoginSuccess(LoginResult _result)
{
        Debug.Log("Login With OIDC Success");
}

public void OIDCLoginFailure(PlayFabError _error)
{
        Debug.LogError("Login With OIDC Failure");
        Debug.LogError(_error.GenerateErrorReport());
}
</code>   

<p>The user will now log into PlayFab using their ID Token from the OAuth Authorization Server in Okta.</p>

 Wire It Up 

<p>Now that the authentication logic exists, it just needs to be triggered. The <code>Sign In</code> button created earlier will need to call the <code>Authenticate()</code> function from its on-click event. The <code>OAuth.cs</code> and <code>PlayFabInterface.cs</code> scripts will also need to be added to a game object in the scene.</p>

<p>In Unity, right-click in the scene <code>Hierarchy</code> panel and then click Create Empty. Rename the game object to <code>OAuth.</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>Drag the <code>OAuth.cs</code> and <code>PlayFabInterface.cs</code> scripts from the <code>Scripts</code> folder and onto the empty game object in the <code>Hierarchy</code> panel.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the <code>Hierarchy</code> panel, expand the <code>Canvas</code> object holding your <code>Sign In</code> button, and then select the <code>Sign In</code> button.</p>

<p>In the <code>Inspector</code> panel, find the <code>On Click()</code> box and drag the <code>OAuth</code> game object onto it. Select the function dropdown, click OAuth2, and then click Authenticate().</p>

<p></p>

<p>The button will now call the <code>Authenticate()</code> function in OAuth.cs when the player clicks it.</p>

 Deploy to Azure App Services 

<p>Because of the jslib and browser code’s complexity, this project cannot be run from the editor directly. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/">Azure App Services</a> makes the deployment of the entire project easy.</p>

<p>First, back up your <code>index.html</code> and <code>callback.html</code> files.</p>

<p>In Unity, click File, Build Settings and then click Build to rebuild the project. Select the desired output folder and click Select Folder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to the output folder selected and overwrite the <code>index.html</code> and <code>callback.html</code> files with the ones you backed up previously.</p>

<p>Open a preferred text editor, create a new file in the output folder called <code>web.config</code>, and add the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;system.webServer&gt;
    &lt;staticContent&gt;
      &lt;mimeMap fileExtension=".unityweb" mimeType ="TYPE/SUBTYPE" /&gt;
    &lt;/staticContent&gt;
  &lt;/system.webServer&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code>   

<p>This web config file will make sure that the WebGL object is properly loaded when hosted.</p>

<p>Next, open Visual Studio and click Continue without code from the startup wizard.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click File, Open, Web Site and select the output folder where the <code>index.html</code> and <code>callback.html</code> are located.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click Build, Publish Web App, and then click Start on the <code>Publish</code> tab. Select <code>Azure</code> and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select <code>Azure App Service</code> and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Create New Azure App Service.</p>

<p>Give the app the name used when setting up the <code>RedirectURI</code> in the Okta CLI where the placeholder was <code>appName.</code> This example used <code>https://webgloauth.azurewebsites.net/</code>, so the app name to use in Azure is <code>WebGLOAuth.</code></p>

<p>Select a valid subscription, click New to create a new resource group, click New to create a new hosting plan, and then click Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With the new app selected in the publish menu, click Finish.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Before clicking <code>Publish,</code> make sure that the <code>Site URL</code> in the <code>Summary</code> section matches the DNS that was defined in the Okta CLI during the app setup for the callback URI. This example used <code>https://webgloauth.azurewebsites.net/</code> and <code>https://webgloauth.azurewebsites.net/callback.html</code> which matches the <code>Site URL</code> in Visual Studio. This same callback URI also needs to be correctly defined in the instance variables in the <code>OAuth.cs</code> script in Unity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, click Publish to deploy the application to Azure App Services.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once publishing is complete, click the <code>Site URL</code> to navigate to the application and test it out.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Player security is quickly becoming one of the most critical aspects of game development today. More development is being done in the cloud, and more player data is being collected than ever before. While best practice for authentication and authorization is to use OAuth and a trusted security platform’s hosted login experience, the design to do this changes from one target platform to another. For Unity WebGL, you were able to interact with the WebGL’s parent page to render a popup that facilitated user authentication via your trusted cloud security platform, Okta. The resulting auth code was exchanged for tokens that can authorize the player to backend cloud platforms that your project is using; in this case, Azure PlayFab. Finally, you were able to host the project entirely on Azure App Services. The OAuth tokens used with PlayFab can authorize the user to other backend cloud platforms as needed, allowing for a convenient, centralized security design. The method used to facilitate browser interaction for WebGL will change with other target platforms, but the rest of the design would continue to be similar across all platforms.</p>

					 Start simple to scale decentralized identity 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  The market for decentralized identity is growing—and the key to that growth is to start simple, Indicio.tech’s CTO Ken Ebert, tells KuppingerCole Analysts.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>When beginning the journey toward decentralized identity deployment, “The simpler the system you make, the more likely you are to be successful.”</p>
<p>So said Indicio.tech Chief Technology Officer Ken Ebert in a <a href="https://youtu.be/AA-eYwiCXpg">recent presentation</a> to the leading European information security firm KuppingerCole Analysts.</p>
<p>In a simple deployment of decentralized identity, the relationship between credential issuer, credential verifier, and credential holder is already established. Because participants are determined by these relationships, we call this decentralized identity deployment a closed ecosystem. &nbsp;This allows for an iterative implementation in a controlled credential environment versus the chaos that can ensue with a larger scale roll-out.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the implementation of decentralized identity is viewed solely as a purely technology solution, but in reality, the technology solution is just one leg of a three-legged stool:</p>
 
 One leg does consist of the technology solution— the credential issuer, verifier and holder and the ability to write cryptographic messages to a digital ledger and retrieve them.
 
 Another is the business solution, namely, what is the problem that decentralized identity is working to solve? Who are the users and what is the benefit? How does it get funded?
 
 Finally, there is the governance solution, how do users get and use their credentials? How does a digital identity deployment comply with the ever-expanding global regulations on data stewardship? 
 
<p>In the case of a company call center, for example, credentials could be issued to a firm’s customers to speed transactions. If customer service can verify customer credentials in five seconds instead of 30, then that savings can be used to fund the continued adoption of decentralized identity. The technology serves to solve the business problem, and the governance is the closed ecosystem of the firm and its customers.</p>
<p>Not to be overlooked, Ebert says, is the role of marketing, both internal and external to ensure success. This includes at the most basic level communicating to users the pain points that decentralized identity will alleviate and hence its value proposition.</p>
<p>The bigger picture, said Ebert, is that marketing colleagues can help document messaging, synchronize press releases and announcements, and educate across the organization the benefits of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>During the course of an initial decentralized identity roll-out, new and expanded applications of the technology and process improvements will emerge. But again, Ebert stressed that expansion should proceed incrementally. The potential steps here are, going back to our call center example, increasing verifiers, issuers and credential holders to encompass more participants in the firm’s supply chain to decrease friction in performing routine transactions.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is such a transformative technology it’s easy to get lost in building a new world, rather than building something small, fixing one problem at a time, and learning how to expand from that experience. Simple deployments mean you get to fix actual problems in a way that drives buy-in from stakeholders. Try to boil the ocean of decentralized identity, and you risk getting burned.</p>
<p>Indicio.tech is committed to being a resource hub for decentralized identity, providing enterprise-grade open source tools to get our clients, and the community, building solutions today. By providing <a href="https://indicio.tech/private-networks/">Private Networks</a>, the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio TestNet</a>, and a variety of customizable <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-packages/">training programs</a>, companies and organizations from diverse industries around the world rely on Indicio.tech for expertise in building and scaling their decentralized identity solutions.</p>

<p>As we settle into 2021, we are facing a new outlook. We now know that it is possible to manage most of our lives remotely thanks to digitalisation. The German government has been running a digitalization initiative now for some time, to achieve exactly that and enable citizens to take digital trips to the authorities out of the comfort of their homes. The declared goal is to conduct many public procedures digitally by the end of 2022, as stated by the Online Access Law (Onlinezugangsgesetz).</p>
<p>Digital trip to the authorities – but only with identity verification</p>
<p>Identification plays a key role in conducting all business from home, as applicants will need to prove their identity reliably during any public procedures. The necessary technology is already available; since 2017 the German electronic ID has been issued with the online functionality activated by default. Owners can use two-factor-authentication to identify themselves digitally and nowadays most smartphones are equipped with the required Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology, turning the smartphone into a card reader, to do exactly that. Just recently, the German government announced, that they are also looking into implementation of a digital identity card (the so called smart eID, read more about it <a href="https://www.personalausweisportal.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/Webs/PA/DE/2021/smart-eID-gesetz.html">here</a>), paving the road for e-government further.</p>
<p>A step in the right direction for Financial Services and other industries</p>
<p>Recent news aside, the technological groundwork has already been established and the digitalization initiative by the German government will be a trailblazer for the broader adoption of the electronic Identity Card. While the eID plays an important role for any authority relations, a lot of usage potential lies in other industries, where reliable identification is a core requirement for onboarding new clients. Financial Services, Gaming, Telecommunications and many more might embrace this simplified method of identity verification.</p>

  HYPR is now certified by VMware and Citrix marketplaces.

<p>The HYPR Cloud Platform is now certified by two top virtualization leaders, VMware and Citrix, to help organizations take a true passwordless approach to secure today’s distributed workforce and improve productivity.</p>
      
<p>The partner integrations make remote login easier and truly passwordless across Windows and Mac computers running Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). The user experience is simple and flexible:</p>
      
  The user logs into their VDI environment, such as VMware Horizon, or Citrix Storefront, by entering their username.  Then, they’re redirected to authenticate to the HYPR Server via their single sign-on (SSO) provider.  A push notification is sent to their HYPR mobile app, which requests their FIDO-based authentication such as face or fingerprint. Once successful, they gain access to their VDI environment. If available, they also have the option to authenticate with Windows Hello or TouchID embedded on their computer.  
      
This login example redirects HYPR users through VMware’s True SSO.

<p>In today’s security landscape, passwords, even when used alongside traditional MFA, still leave users vulnerable to phishing and credential reuse. It also creates a poor user experience that strains the remote work experience and lowers productivity. By freeing people from passwords and password-based MFA, people can better focus on their work rather than fumbling their way across apps and resources.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>At HYPR, we understand how important VDI is for today’s more distributed global workforces. VDI gives people access to their digital workspaces with minimal management and maintenance by the organization’s IT team. That’s why we teamed up with VMware and Citrix to further bolster the remote experience.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 HYPR &amp; VMware 
      
<p>True Passwordless MFA is available via the <a href="https://marketplace.cloud.vmware.com/services/details/true-passwordless-mfa-1-1-1?slug=true">VMware Marketplace</a> and integrates with VMware Horizon and Workspace ONE using SAML. Employees authenticate once to their Horizon portal and gain secure access to workstations and published resources. Passwords are not needed.</p>
      

      
<p></p>
      
 HYPR &amp; Citrix 
      
<p>HYPR is also on the <a href="https://citrixready.citrix.com/hypr-corp/true-passwordless-mfa.html">Citrix Ready Marketplace</a> and integrates with Citrix StoreFront on any existing identity provider (IdP) using SAML. The passwordless MFA experience is no different across virtual apps and desktop environments. There are no complex passwords nor one-time passcodes (OTP) to type in. Users simply authenticate once with the HYPR mobile app and gain access to all of their downstream applications.</p>
      

      
<p></p>
      
 Key Takeaways 
      
  HYPR’s certified integration offers remote workers login flexibility across Windows and Mac computers, as well as Android and iOS tablets and mobile devices.&nbsp;  True Passwordless MFA enables organizations to scale their MFA infrastructure along with their growing distributed workforce.  A truly passwordless approach across the enterprise enables organizations to better secure their workforce and increase productivity, wherever work is done.

<p>#ThrowbackThursday</p>



<p>MyLife Digital has been at the forefront of people-centric solutions since we started. This article was first published in July 2018 and is still highly relevant today. At that time, we had recently surveyed consumers about their data and rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have completed another survey, this time with both consumers and organisations, again asking about attitudes to data. We can see that consumers haven’t changed much in what they need, transparency about data practices has always been important. Have organisations given consumers what they want? Sign up <a href="https://mylifedigital.co.uk/attitudes-to-personal-data-management/">here</a><a href="https://mylifedigital.co.uk/attitudes-to-personal-data-management/"> </a>to receive our latest research once published. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s easy to see the EU’s new data protection rules as a box-ticking exercise. Yet going a step further and explaining how personal data is used and the benefits to data subjects can reward companies with stronger customer relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many companies believe they are now well on their way to compliance with the new European data protection regulation, according to recent GDPR market research<a href="https://www.edq.com/uk/resources/papers/gdpr-impact-research-2018/">[1]</a>. But the GDPR survey also suggests a mismatch between those companies’ perceptions of their progress and their understanding of what’s required of them. This means they could be missing out on important opportunities to reinvigorate customer relationships.&nbsp;</p>



<p>GDPR, enforceable in the UK under the new Data Protection Act 2018, significantly bolsters people’s <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/">rights</a> over their personal data and what companies do with it. At its introduction in May, more than a quarter of organisations claimed to be ‘very well prepared’ for the EU General Data Protection Regulation and 61 percent ‘somewhat’ prepared. Yet it’s hard to imagine that these businesses have transformed their approach to customer data as part of those preparations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many cases, companies approached the new rules as a compliance exercise – not a broader review of how the controls could work best for the business and its clients. Yet with GDPR, companies have a unique chance to develop a more sustainable plan around customer data that will contribute positively to their brand and business development.&nbsp;</p>



 Poor vs best practice&nbsp; 



<p>It’s easy to spot the companies that see GDPR compliance as a box-ticking exercise. The first sign is a lack of clarity in their customer communications: a big green button on their website, accompanied by generic policy wording pasted from a template. The main aim here is to secure quick confirmation of people’s data permissions, so they can get on and buy something. Anyone clicking through for more detail is faced with pages of small-print.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is at odds with the spirit of GDPR, which is about empowering customers (‘data subjects’) to make more informed decisions. The key to this is transparency and full disclosure. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) recommends using plain language and information layering. This puts the individual more in control, enabling them to drill down quickly to specific areas they want to clarify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sainsbury’s has clearly thought this through for shoppers <a href="https://www.nectar.com/register/consumer/enrol.htm">registering for Nectar</a>, its partner-based loyalty scheme. The online registration page explains exactly what each party wants to do with subscribers’ data and what customers can expect in return – relevant and personalised offers, for example. By explaining everything clearly and setting out the value for the data subject, Sainsbury’s is demonstrating fairness and integrity, in line with GDPR’s core <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/">principles</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Juro, a London startup that automates the creation and management of companies’ sales contracts using AI, has taken a similar approach. Click through to find out more about its cookies and there is a <a href="https://juro.com/#privacy-popup">full breakdown</a> of what Juro and its partners would like to do with personal data, and why, with their permission. Click through to its <a href="https://juro.com/policy.html">full privacy notice</a> and you’ll be rewarded with a step-by-step walk-through of what will happen at every point along the customer journey – the information you will be asked to give and what you will get in return. Juro also spells out customers’ data rights and how to exercise them. It’s a great example of an experience that has clearly been designed – by default – from the client’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Embracing the spirit as well as the rules of data protection&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is as important to embrace the ‘spirit’ of GDPR as it is to follow the rules. Here’s where organisations need to pay special attention if they want to convince people that they have their best interests at heart and will treat their data with respect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies can engender trust by managing customers’ data permissions using a dedicated central platform specifically designed to address the more intricate detail of GDPR. If every aspect of consent is managed and tracked in a single place over time – a resource that can be quickly consulted and linked to a range of business systems (such as customer-relationship-management systems) – organisations can show that they are embracing data protection by design and default.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking this a step further, companies could open up such a central permissions hub for self-service access by customers – allowing them to securely access, review and edit their own permissions at any time. A recent GDPR customer survey by MyLife Digital found that two-thirds of consumers would welcome the chance to be able to view all of the data a company holds on them in one place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Significantly, the same survey also confirmed that, far from wanting to withhold their data, people are largely happy to give it – as long as there is a clear benefit to them in doing so. When asked “Would you like to make money (or get other benefits) from your data?”, 64 percent of UK respondents and 77 percent of US consumers said yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, true GDPR compliance is a mindset, and a way of doing business that offers lasting rewards. Operationalising GDPR using purpose-built compliance software isn’t hard to do and offers a chance to increase engagement with customers, drive loyalty, and ultimately revenue.&nbsp;</p>

 How Keyless is advancing biometrics to provide fast, secure, and reliable authentication  Advancements in biometrics have reached a point where the technology can reliably replace passwords, eliminate threats, and enhance the customer experience all at once. It’s time for enterprises to take a multi-modal approach to biometric authentication and identity management.  Biometrics today, a single-modal approach <p>Biometrics are fast, easy, and eliminate our reliance on passwords and PINs, however, despite their growing popularity and benefits, biometrics have their own unique challenges when it comes to widespread adoption, mainly due to reliability and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Most solutions on the market today only offer single-modal biometrics to authenticate users — this could be one of the reasons that that <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202012/biometric-authentication-adoption-slowed-in-uk-by-privacy-and-ux-concerns-nomidio-suggests">adoption of biometrics has been slow</a>, particularly at the enterprise level in industries that would benefit most from the technology in terms of user experience, but require greater assurance that their users or employees are who they claim to&nbsp;be.</p><p>The reliability of single-modal biometric systems plays a part in this. Single-biometric solutions are less likely to withstand advanced spoofing threats and are also less likely to correctly match biometric templates as a user’s physical characteristics change, whether due to the natural aging process or suddenly as a result of an accident or disability. As a result, the reliability of single-modal biometrics is often questioned.</p><p>Multi-modal biometrics offer a breakthrough solution to these challenges — empowering businesses to finally part ways with passwords and other archaic authentication methods.</p> Why multi-modal? <p>Multi-modal solutions that combine physical and behavioral biometrics enable companies to enhance security, without disturbing the user experience.</p>Physical Biometrics vs Behavioural Biometrics What are physical biometrics? <p>The most popular biometric solutions leverage a user’s unique physical traits to authenticate them. Biometric templates are created by mapping a user’s unique physical traits. For example, at Keyless we use Neural Networks, a deep learning technique to extract high-dimensional feature vectors from sequences of images of the user’s&nbsp;face.</p> What are behavioral biometrics? <p>Behavioral biometrics, on the other hand, leverage deep learning to recognize unique patterns in how a user interacts with a device over time. These patterns could be based on how the user taps, swipes, or holds their device. Once patterns have been recognized, they can be transformed into biometric templates that can be used to monitor access to a user’s device in real-time.</p><p><a href="https://justaskthales.com/en/what-are-behavioral-biometrics/">Behavioral biometrics</a> offer enhanced usability as they require no conscious effort from the user, allowing for continuous, frictionless authentication, enabling companies to frequently verify that a user is who they say they are, without disrupting the user. Physical biometrics, on the other hand, are better suited to one-time authentication, as they typically require conscious effort from the&nbsp;user.</p> Frictionless security powered by who the user is, not what they&nbsp;know <p>When it comes to enabling fast, secure authentication, because biometrics are inherently user-friendly, a multi-modal approach to authentication can directly solve the trade-off between convenience and security.</p><p>Multi-modal solutions give companies greater control over managing remote access to their private systems and data. For example, if an employee logs in but then the system recognizes unusual behavior (such as different keystrokes or tapping patterns), then it can log the user&nbsp;out.</p> The Keyless approach to biometric authentication  At Keyless we take a multi-modal approach to biometrics, leveraging both physical and behavioral biometrics to offer a seamless authentication solution that allows companies to reliably identify&nbsp;users. Keyless uses a combination of possession and inherence factors to provide a fast, seamless and secure authentication experience.<p>The Keyless protocol allows for several physical biometric modalities including facial, fingerprint, voice, and iris recognition; as well as behavioral modalities like keystroke and swipe recognition.</p> Using deep learning to ensure high-accuracy <p>To offer behavioral biometrics, we must first learn how users interact with their devices. We do this by feeding deep-learning algorithms unique, user-generated data captured through sensors on the user’s mobile&nbsp;device.</p><p>Each input can be gauged on its reliability in authenticating an individual user. Once it’s considered reliable enough for identifying the user with high accuracy, the feature can be added to the user’s biometric templates.</p> Ensuring privacy compliance <p>Since biometrics are uniquely linked to the individual, it’s important that companies processing biometric data take extra measures to protect it against both new and emerging&nbsp;threats.</p><blockquote>Biometrics have the potential to make authentication dramatically faster, easier, and more secure than traditional passwords, but companies need to be careful about the biometric data they collect. — <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3339565/what-is-biometrics-and-why-collecting-biometric-data-is-risky.html">Maria&nbsp;Korolov</a></blockquote><p>Keyless ensures that the biometric data we capture is never at risk of being stolen, compromised, or lost by combining multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing technologies. The combination of privacy-enhancing technologies, deep-learning, and multi-modal biometrics uniquely addresses the greatest barriers facing the adoption of biometric authentication solutions.</p><p>Read these pieces to gain a better understanding of how we leverage privacy-enhancing technologies to protect biometric data: <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/how-keyless-uses-zero-knowledge-proofs-to-protect-your-private-data-255d936be4fd">Keyless and Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-secure-multiparty-computation-dc3fb9365458">Keyless and Secure Multiparty Computation</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">Keyless and Shamir’s Secret&nbsp;Sharing</a>.</p> Closing the gap between security and convenience <p>Multi-modal biometric solutions enable a high level of security without causing undue disruptions to the authentication experience. Rather, multi-modal solutions can enhance the authentication experience by offering frequent, unconscious authentication that can be used to detect advanced&nbsp;threats.</p><p>By presenting multiple biometric challenges to users, multi-modal solutions protect private systems and data in the rare event of successful spoofing attempts or account takeovers that take place after the point of authentication.</p><p>Thus multimodal biometric solutions can help companies close the gap between security and convenience, allowing for more seamless authentication and identity management experiences that enhance security and privacy compliance, without sacrificing the authentication experience or productivity.</p> Request a Free Demo of&nbsp;Keyless <p>Keyless™ authentication can help deliver secure and seamless digital experiences for your end-users and for your increasingly remote workforce.</p><p>Head to our <a href="http://keyless.io/">website</a> to learn more about our biometric authentication and identity management solutions.</p><p><a href="http://www.keyless.io/">www.keyless.io</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can email us directly at <a href="http://info@keyless.io/">info@keyless.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/tapping-into-the-potential-of-multi-modal-biometrics-cee78f7649f3">Tapping into the potential of multi-modal biometrics</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The mortgage application process should be easier. It should be more accurate. It should involve less risk and less fraud. It shouldn’t be a slog for borrowers or for lenders. It should be as convenient and streamlined as we’ve come to expect from other modernized, digital experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transforming the entire underwriting process is a massive undertaking. And while Finicity already provides solutions across all the primary segments of mortgage lending, today we’re reaching another milestone by streamlining the verification of assets, income, and employment into a one-touch, GSE-accepted experience. I’m excited to introduce <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">Finicity Lend</a>’s Mortgage Verification Service (MVS), the faster, more accurate, more empowering verification experience for both lenders and borrowers.</p>
 What Is MVS? 
<p></p>
<p>Mortgage lending underwent a historic transformation in 2020. Problems that had been minor cracks in the mortgage lending experience became chasms as lenders had to rapidly adapt to physically-distanced workflows. But despite the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuing economic fallout, and record-breaking volume—which, while temporarily obscuring them, does not eliminate the cracks—certainly accelerating the need for a new mortgage experience, that need was already apparent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paper-based mortgage processes take more time—something many lenders are already lacking with today’s high volume—and they’re more prone to fraud. Slower, less streamlined solutions also reduce organizational agility, preventing lenders from keeping pace both when the market is booming and when the market again normalizes. And the high-friction paper-chases are annoying for borrowers that are already acclimated to fast, convenient, digital solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wanted to deliver a mortgage lending experience that exceeds the expectations of today’s borrowers while also enhancing outcomes and agility for lenders and their stakeholders. That’s why we designed MVS to deliver a one-touch, GSE-accepted digital verification of assets, income, and employment. Now you can complete all necessary verifications in one seamless process. It’s a fast, secure, anytime-anywhere experience that gives the borrower control over their financial data while also providing the lender with a real-time, accurate picture of the borrower’s financial health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MVS is powered by Finicity’s open-banking platform. This means that mortgage lenders get access to extended lengths of real-time data, analyzed and categorized thanks to advanced data intelligence. We also assure the most accurate data and keep the consumer at the center of the data-sharing experience with clear transparency and the ability to dispute reports. Access to reliable, real-time, multi-sourced, and even cross-verified data enables the most accurate verifications, setting you on your way to get rep and warranty validation from GSEs and investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because every lending use case and process is unique, we’ve designed MVS to be flexible and accommodate everything from refinancing to new purchases, including both qualified and non-qualified mortgages. We’ve also made it easy for mortgage lenders to integrate MVS into their workflow with several flexible integration options.</p>
<p>All of these features come together to build a consumer-centric lending experience that improves ROI for lenders.</p>
 Why Should Lenders Use MVS? 
<p>MVS is more than a product, it’s a partnership with Finicity that enables lenders to benefit from our open banking platform and our market-leading, secure connections to financial institutions. Through those connections, lenders can get the accurate data necessary to verify assets, income, and employment, and enhance their overall decisioning and underwriting processes. And with <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/updated-fannie-mae-lender-letter-suspends-rep-and-warrant-relief-through-du-expands-ron/">GSEs tightening their rep and warranty relief policies</a> due to COVID-19’s impact on consumer income and employment, lenders will need the most reliable data from the most reliable sources.</p>
<p>MVS enables a digital mortgage experience, allowing lenders to reap the benefits that come from digital streamlining. In fact, validating assets, income, and employment digitally can cut up to <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty">12 days</a> off the origination process. MVS takes digital streamlining even further by completing these verifications with only a single borrower interaction. You can then refresh those verifications at close at no cost and without reengaging the borrower. With MVS, you complete more originations in less time—time that’s crucial for lenders to remain agile in a crazy, high-volume year like this. More time opens room for more originations and more commission.</p>
<p>The convenience of digital verifications and the simple, streamlined consumer permissioning process also enhances the lending experience for borrowers and helps them leave more satisfied and more likely to refer their lender to friends and family. MVS’s seamless and customer-centric digital experience enables lenders to distinguish themselves, especially against digital laggards, and gain a competitive edge.</p>
<p>We’ll also set you up for success with Finicity’s Adoption Best Practices training so you can hit the ground running and start reaping the rewards of a streamlined, digital mortgage process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With MVS, everybody wins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t settle for yesterday’s mortgage lending experience. You deserve better. And so do your borrowers. Use Finicity Lend’s Mortgage Verification Service to build the foundation of your enhanced mortgage lending experience. Find out how to integrate MVS into your mortgage lending process and to learn more about how Finicity provides other mortgage solutions in prequalification, underwriting, funding enablement, secondary quality control, and servicing.</p>

<p>One-touch, GSE-accepted verification of assets, income and employment reduces loan process by up to 12 days</p>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY, Utah – February 25, 2021 – Finicity, a Mastercard company and leading provider of open banking solutions, today announced its one-touch Mortgage Verification Service (MVS), enabling lenders to provide the simple, easy experience that today’s consumers and lenders are looking for in mortgage origination. The solution allows consumers to permission data, quickly and easily, so lenders can verify assets, income and employment in a single interaction with borrowers that takes seconds or minutes instead of days or weeks. The verification is accepted by both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in place of cumbersome manual loan documentation.</p>
<p>While mortgage lending has rapidly moved toward a digital experience, the verification process has largely remained a manual, paper-driven process. By reducing the burden of manual methods of documentation, Finicity may help shave 8-12 days off the origination process for rapid loan closing while also increasing accuracy, improving profitability, and creating a better experience for both lenders and borrowers.</p>
<p>Through Finicity Lend’s Mortgage Verification Service, Finicity’s open banking platform leverages high value data available from financial institutions and payroll processors to provide accurate, real-time insights into a borrower’s current assets, income and employment. The solution offers flexible flows for different mortgage lending use cases — from refinancing to new purchases, qualified to non qualified mortgages.</p>
<p>This innovative service creates a simple, fast, FCRA-compliant verification experience that empowers consumers to digitally permission use of their financial data with one touch, through Finicity Connect, to rapidly validate key financial suitability requirements of a mortgage application. This is perfectly aligned with Finicity’s mission to empower both lenders and consumers while helping consumers benefit more from their own financial data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are streamlining mortgage lending significantly, reducing costs and shortening the time needed for the overall loan origination process,” said Finicity CEO and Co-founder Steve Smith. “With Finicity Lend, our ultimate goals are to help mitigate risk for lenders, create an improved consumer experience, and ultimately increase overall financial inclusion by helping borrowers better prove their creditworthiness.”</p>
 GSE Accepted 
<p>The Finicity Lend Mortgage Verification Service is accepted by both GSEs as a valid demonstration of a borrower’s assets, income and employment. Lenders are able to use Finicity verification reports for automated assessment and receive representation and warranty relief using Freddie Mac Loan Product Advisor® asset and income modeler (AIM).&nbsp; Fannie Mae accepts Finicity mortgage verification reports for automated assessment within Desktop Underwriter® validation service through Day 1 Certainty®.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Freddie Mac has been at the forefront of advancing the digital mortgage experience that today’s borrowers have come to expect,” said Rick Lang, Single-Family Vice President of Strategy and Integration at Freddie Mac. “Our data-driven strategy helps produce safer loans and reduces the paper chase so our clients can speed up underwriting and bring borrowers to the closing table sooner.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At Fannie Mae, we’ve been pioneering the digital technologies that will make the borrowing experience faster and easier for borrowers,” said Chuck Walker, Vice President Digital Alliances and Distribution at Fannie Mae. “Manually providing verification documents is a time-consuming and stressful process, so addressing asset, income and employment verification is central to moving the industry toward the ideal digital mortgage.”</p>
 What the Industry is Saying

<p>Security, privacy, and ease-of-use will be the central concepts of IMPULSE (Identity Management in PUbLic SErvices), a European Horizon 2020 project that kicks off this month. Coordinated by Gradiant, a team of 16 entities from 9 different countries will use Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain to improve online identification processes.</p>



<p> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Impulse_EU">www.twitter.com/Impulse_EU</a></p>



<p>Digital processes are increasingly used by citizens. The current health crisis around the world has limited personal interactions, digitising all kinds of procedures. This brings a number of problems, not only for those unfamiliar with the complex identification systems on the internet, but also for those who are not comfortable providing their personal data online. IMPULSE seeks to be a tool to simplify the digitisation of the European public sector as a result of a comprehensive assessment on how the use of disruptive technologies may impact society from technical, socio-economic, legal, ethical, policy, and standardisation standpoints.

IMPULSE will work on the concept of Electronic Identity (eID) – the way users can identify themselves (and be identified) through the network – and its implications in multiple contexts. The initiative has a budget of around €4 million.

The 16 partners that make up this multidisciplinary consortium will create a tool to meet all the ethical, legal, and social requirements, so that the tool may be adopted for public services in all the countries of the European Union, regardless of their culture and degree of digitisation. IMPULSE will become the clear representation of an efficient, useful, and responsible modernisation by combining Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain to offer a technological advantage over other systems used today.

At the project kick off meeting earlier this week, all partners confirmed their optimism about the results that the initiative will offer and the pace of work that is expected to be maintained throughout the 3-year project thanks to the experience and expertise of those involved.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The digitisation of public administration services is one of the seven flagship initiatives identified in the NextGen Europe programme, which gives an idea of the strategic dimension of IMPULSE. In this context, the project was born with a clear objective of facilitating the access of citizens to these services but without giving up the maximum guarantees of security, something essential if we want to move towards a fully digitised and inclusive society”

</p>Luis Pérez Freire – Gradiant (the Spanish Research and Technology Organisation leading the IMPULSE project)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Digitizing the public services is not just a matter of technical infrastructure, rather a multi-stage question of ethics and justice. There is the non-trivial question of regulating digital technologies in a way that guarantees the full protection of personal data. But it is also important to recall that accessibility and quality of public services are fundamental prerequisites of democratic participation in social life. This links techno-regulation and ethics with politics. And this is the strategic horizon in which IMPULSE will play a ground-breaking role.”

</p>Antonio Carnevale – Senior Researcher at CyberEthics Lab. and the company’s contact point in the project</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“We are proud to participate, together with highly qualified partners, in a project as prestigious and ambitious as IMPULSE. We will strengthen the consortium with our ability to work in multi-disciplinary teams, an ability refined over years of presence at important institutional tables, even at the international level, with public institutions and private technology companies. “During the project, we will be responsible for the management of the entire process of Innovation and we will be involved in the development of the general plan for the dissemination and exploitation, at a pan-European level, of the project results. We will contribute to the project with our long experience in digital identity for the public sector, achieved thanks to the role of Identity Provider for SPID, the Italian Digital Identity Schema. Moreover, in the field of distributed identity based on blockchain technologies, we will support the consortium with the know-how developed thanks to DIZME, a decentralized digital identity platform, conceived by InfoCert, which combines the world of Self Sovereign Identity with eIDAS regulatory compliance. In conclusion, IMPULSE is an important opportunity, even more so if the results will be functional to the identification of new potential areas of application of Digital Identity at the European level and not limited to the public sector.”

</p>Carmine Auletta – Chief Strategy &amp; Innovation Officer at InfoCert</blockquote>



 AI and blockchain for electronic identification processes 



<p>In a world where it is increasingly common to carry out all kinds of processes online, avoiding fraud and deception is only possible with first-class technology. Funded under the call Transformative impact of disruptive technologies in public services (DT- TRANSFORMATIONS-02-2018-2019-2020), IMPULSE will develop a system to respond to the needs of both citizens and public servants in digital processes.</p>



<p>IMPULSE’s innovation focuses on combining two of the most promising technologies available today, that is Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain networks. The project’s goal is to improve the management of digital identity and electronic identification in the public sector. Today we have technology with the potential to overcome these challenges so its application in the field of digital identity will substantially improve the existing electronic identification systems at the time legal, privacy, or social issues requiring further analysis may raise.</p>



<p>Most citizens have an electronic identity card to carry out the authentication processes with the online services offered by the administration; however, its use is cumbersome due in large part to the lack of user-friendly interfaces for the common citizen. To overcome this adversity, IMPULSE will incorporate advanced face biometrics and document validation techniques based on AI to facilitate identification processes and provide the user with a digital onboarding experience that is fully transparent.</p>



<p>In addition, blockchain technology and the use of smart contracts will add trustworthiness in the process, providing mechanisms for users to demonstrate their identity without the need to disclose their personal data to third parties, who are a priori considered to be less reliable. In this way the citizen will maintain total control of their data and will be able to verify at all times the use that is being given to them.</p>



 16 high-profile partners 



<p>The consortium, made up of partners from Spain, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland, Iceland, France and Denmark, is funded by the European Union with €4 million under the Horizon 2020 programme. Partners from Italy will receive a total of €976.625 in funding. The complete list of partners is included below.</p>

<p>Sicurezza, privacy e intuitività saranno i concetti centrali di IMPULSE(Identity Management in PUbLic SErvices), un progetto di ricerca europeo all’interno del programma Horizon 2020 che inizia questo mese. Coordinato da Gradiant, un team di 16 entità da 9 paesi diversi userà l’intelligenza artificiale e la blockchain per migliorare i processi di identificazione online.</p>



<p> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Impulse_EU">www.twitter.com/Impulse_EU</a></p>



<p>I processi digitali sono sempre più utilizzati dai cittadini. L’attuale crisi sanitaria in tutto il mondo ha limitato le interazioni personali, digitalizzando tutte le procedure. Questo porta una serie di problemi, non solo per coloro che non hanno familiarità con i complessi sistemi di identificazione su Internet, ma anche per coloro che non si sentono tranquilli nel fornire i propri dati personali online. IMPULSE vuole essere uno strumento capace di semplificare la digitalizzazione del settore pubblico europeo come risultato di una valutazione completa su come l’uso di tecnologie dirompenti può avere un impatto sulla società da un punto di vista tecnico, socio-economico, legale, etico, politico e di standardizzazione.</p>



<p>IMPULSE lavorerà sul concetto di Identità Elettronica (eID) – il modo in cui gli utenti possono identificarsi (ed essere identificati) attraverso la rete – e le sue implicazioni in molteplici contesti. L’iniziativa prevede un budget di circa 4 milioni di euro.</p>



<p>I 16 partner che compongono questo consorzio multidisciplinare svilupperanno uno strumento in grado di soddisfare tutti i requisiti etici, legali e sociali, tale da poter essere adottato per i servizi pubblici in tutti i paesi dell’Unione Europea, indipendentemente dalla tradizione e sviluppo culturale e dal loro grado di digitalizzazione. IMPULSE costituirà un chiaro esempio di una modernizzazione efficiente, proficua e responsabile, che combina l’intelligenza artificiale e la Blockchain per offrire un vantaggio tecnologico rispetto agli altri sistemi utilizzati oggi.</p>



<p>Al kick off meeting del progetto, che si è tenuto all’inizio di questa settimana, tutti i partner si sono mostrati ottimisti in merito ai risultati che il progetto comporterà e al ritmo di lavoro che dovrebbe essere mantenuto durante i 3 anni del progetto, grazie all’esperienza e alla competenza di coloro che sono coinvolti.</p>



<blockquote><p>“La digitalizzazione dei servizi della pubblica amministrazione è una delle sette iniziative di punta individuate nel programma NextGen Europe, il che dà un’idea della dimensione strategica di IMPULSE. In questo contesto, il progetto è nato con il chiaro obiettivo di facilitare l’accesso dei cittadini a questi servizi, ma senza rinunciare alle massime garanzie di sicurezza, cosa essenziale se vogliamo andare verso una società completamente digitalizzata e inclusiva.”</p>Luis Pérez Freire – Gradiant (’organizzazione spagnola di ricerca e tecnologia alla guida del progetto IMPULSE)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Digitalizzare i servizi pubblici è una questione non solo di infrastruttura tecnica, ma anche di etica e giustizia. Ci si deve porre la domanda – per nulla triviale – del regolare le tecnologie digitali in modo da garantire la piena protezione dei dati personali. Rimane importante ricordare che l’accessibilità e la qualità dei servizi pubblici sono prerequisiti fondamentali per la partecipazione democratica nella vita sociale. Tale considerazione lega la regolamentazione necessaria della tecnologia con l’etica e la politica. E questo è l’orizzonte strategico nel quale IMPULSE giocherà un ruolo chiave.”</p>Antonio Carnevale – Senior Researcher presso CyberEthics Lab e punto di contatto aziendale nel progetto</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Siamo orgogliosi di partecipare, al fianco di partner altamente qualificati, a un progetto così prestigioso e ambizioso qual è IMPULSE. Metteremo a disposizione del consorzio la nostra capacità di lavorare in team multi-disciplinari affinata in anni di presenza a importanti tavoli istituzionali, anche di livello internazionale, con enti pubblici e realtà tecnologiche private. Durante il progetto saremo responsabili della gestione dell’intero processo di Innovazione e interverremo nella predisposizione del piano generale per la diffusione e valorizzazione, a livello paneuropeo, dei risultati progettuali. Contribuiremo ai lavori con la lunga esperienza sull’identità digitale in ambito pubblico, ottenuta grazie al ruolo di gestore accreditato per SPID. E, in tema di identità distribuita basata su tecnologia blockchain, supporteremo il consorzio grazie al know-how acquisito con DIZME, la piattaforma decentralizzata d’identità digitale, ideata da InfoCert, che integra già il mondo della Self Sovereign Identity con la compliance normativa eIDAS. Insomma, IMPULSE è un’importante opportunità, ancor di più se i risultati saranno funzionali all’identificazione di nuovi potenziali ambiti d’applicazione dell’Identità Digitale a livello Europeo e non solo nel settore pubblico.”</p>Carmine Auletta – Chief Strategy &amp; Innovation Officer in InfoCert</blockquote>

<p>In un mondo in cui è sempre più comune effettuare tutti i tipi di processi online, evitare frodi e falsificazioni è possibile solo adoperando una tecnologia di eccellenza. Finanziato nell’ambito del bando Transformative impact of disruptive technologies in public services (DT- TRANSFORMATIONS-02-2018-2019-2020), IMPULSE elaborerà un sistema per rispondere alle esigenze sia dei cittadini che dei dipendenti pubblici nei processi digitali.</p>



<p>L’innovazione di IMPULSE si concentra sulla combinazione di due delle tecnologie più promettenti oggi disponibili, vale a dire l’intelligenza artificiale e le Blockchain. L’obiettivo del progetto è migliorare la gestione dell’identità digitale e dell’identificazione elettronica nel settore pubblico. Oggi disponiamo della tecnologia con il potenziale adatto per superare queste sfide: in questo modo la sua applicazione nel campo dell’identità digitale migliorerà sostanzialmente i sistemi di identificazione elettronica esistenti nel momento in cui sorgano questioni legali, di privacy o sociali che richiedono ulteriori analisi.</p>



<p>La maggior parte dei cittadini possiede una carta d’identità elettronica per effettuare i processi di autenticazione con i servizi online offerti dall’amministrazione; ciononostante, l’utilizzo appare macchinoso, soprattutto a causa di interfacce che si rivelano poco user-friendly per il cittadino comune. Per superare questo ostacolo, IMPULSE includerà tecniche avanzate di biometria facciale e di convalida dei documenti basate sull’AI per facilitare i processi di identificazione e fornire all’utente un’esperienza di registrazione digitale perfettamente trasparente.</p>



<p>Inoltre, la tecnologia blockchain e l’uso di smart contracts apporteranno ulteriore affidabilità al processo, attraverso meccanismi che permetteranno agli utenti di dimostrare la loro identità senza la necessità di rivelare i loro dati personali a terzi, a priori considerati meno sicuri. In questo modo il cittadino manterrà il controllo totale dei propri dati e potrà verificare in ogni momento l’uso che ne viene fatto.</p>



 16 partner di alto livello 



<p>Il consorzio, composto da partner provenienti da Spagna, Italia, Austria, Bulgaria, Germania, Finlandia, Islanda, Francia e Danimarca, è finanziato dall’Unione europea con 4 milioni di euro nell’ambito del programma Horizon 2020. I partner italiani riceveranno un totale di 976,625 euro di finanziamento. Di seguito l’elenco completo dei partner.</p>

<p>Rond het financieel advies dat een financieel adviseur uitbrengt speelt het gebruik van klantdata een belangrijke rol. Om te zorgen dat deze data eenduidig vastgelegd kan worden introduceert SIVI de vertaling van het Ockto Data Model naar de SIVI All Finance Datacatalogus (AFD).</p>



<p>Bij financieel advies gaat het zeker niet alleen over verzekeringsgegevens, maar bijvoorbeeld ook om gegevens rond inkomen, pensioen, belasting, hypotheek en lease. Behalve in documenten is deze informatie ook steeds meer als data beschikbaar. Met behulp van Ockto kunnen adviseurs hun klanten verzoeken hun persoonlijke gegevens direct uit de bronsystemen op te halen en met hen te delen.</p>



<p>Steeds meer partijen gebruiken de SIVI All Finance Datacatalogus (AFD) niet alleen voor het verzenden van berichten, maar ook voor het vastleggen van data binnen moderne database structuren. Dit is een belangrijke reden geweest voor de recente introductie van de vernieuwde SIVI AFS-standaard. Binnen het SIVI AFS is het mogelijk het complete klantdossier op gegevensniveau weer te geven. Op deze wijze kunnen softwaretoepassingen deze klantgegevens eenduidig vastleggen en bevragen.</p>



<p>Om deze vastlegging van gegevens binnen het klantdossier in de dagelijkse praktijk te ondersteunen introduceert SIVI nu de vertaling (mapping) van het Ockto Data Model naar de SIVI All Finance Datacatalogus (AFD). Deze Ockto-AFD-mapping maakt het voor software ontwikkelaars makkelijker de data uit het Ockto-bericht te importeren binnen het klantdossier. De Ockto-AFD-mapping is nu eerst beschikbaar in C# code. Later dit jaar zal de Ockto-AFD-mapping ook in de vorm van een API beschikbaar komen. De Ockto-AFD-mapping zal de releases van het Ockto Data Model volgen.</p>



<p>Peter Mols, Directeur SIVI: “De Ockto-AFD-mapping is de eerste in een reeks van mappingen rond o.a. inkomen, pensioen en hypotheken die SIVI zal uitbrengen binnen de vernieuwde SIVI AFS-standaard. Hiermee spelen we in op de toenemende noodzaak om eenduidig klantbeelden vast te leggen. Door het centraal aanbieden van deze mappingen verlagen we de kosten in de keten.”</p>



<p>Paul Janssen, Product Director Ockto: “Ockto sluit graag aan bij de SIVI-standaarden. Deze mapping tussen Ockto en het AFD ondersteunt het eenduidig vastleggen van gegevens binnen het klantdossier en faciliteert het toenemend gebruik van brondata. Onze samenwerking met SIVI sluit goed aan bij ons streven om de afhandeling van klantdata uit bronsystemen voor iedereen makkelijker te maken.”</p>

<p>Why You Should Pay For Apps and How It Can Protect Your Personal Data.</p><p>It’s “Free!” That’s Amazing! Who doesn’t love something that comes with no cost? For small businesses, hobbyists, startups and everyday people, I think it’s fair to say we all get excited when we hear this. In fact, in a world filled with social media, apps and games on our phones, perhaps we even expect it--but what is the hidden cost to you? </p><p>If you have seen <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">The Social Dilemma</a> then you might be familiar with this quote:<br>“If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product” — Daniel Hövermann</p><p>The hard fact here is that these “free” apps (ad-supported products) profit from collecting your data. They also make money from your attention through your clicks, likes and screen time. The real product for sale in all of these cases is your attention and subsequent interactions while logged in.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of how you become the product: In advertising-supported products, ads are presented to you. &nbsp;These advertisements are curated based on cookies you agree to in your web browser as well as other behaviours you exhibit within the app itself. &nbsp;</p><p>Let’s break this down a bit more. You’re scrolling Facebook when you see a “post” for something you were recently shopping for online. This is called an impression and the app/platform gets paid by the advertiser simply for it coming into your view. Now say you click on that ad. Facebook receives another payment for your behaviour, in this instance for your click. This might sound familiar given what we all know about Facebook, but this kind of advertising is rampant in our world. A recent article from the website MLSDev states that currently, “7 out of 10 apps contain embedded advertisements”. This seems innocent at first glance, but who can advertise on these platforms is largely unregulated and monitored primarily by algorithms. Algorithms that many people--including those who work at these companies-- don’t completely understand.</p><p>Using ads to provide free apps for users means that these companies are collecting information about you. This information is collected via your behaviour, views, and interactions. Then, this harvested information is used to infer demographic information about you. This includes but is not limited to where you live, your age, if you have kids etc. All of this is made available simply from behaviours you exhibit online. </p><p>At Fission, we are on a mission to normalize the payment of apps for this very reason and believe that a movement towards paying for apps, even at nominal rates, would bring about greater protection for you, the user. </p><p>What happens when you pay for your app:</p>  Your data becomes more secure and we begin to move towards a more ethical and humane technological future.  Your behaviour and attention are not propagated and sold.  Your privacy is more protected because the profitability of the application you are using is not contingent on your screen time/attention and personal information for targeted advertisements.  Charging for apps can improve the standard of living for app developers outside of North America and Western Europe.<br>a. Example: You publish an app and promote it, developing a user base of 		 &nbsp; &nbsp;500 users. If those 500 users pay $50 for that app, we’re talking about a 		 &nbsp; &nbsp;$25,000 USD salary for that developer. Pretty substantial for an 				 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;independent developer in most parts of the world, especially in developing 	 &nbsp; &nbsp;countries  Payment places value on the work. In an article from Derek Sivers, “Psychology experiments have shown that the more people pay for something, the more they value it.”  Developers should be paid ethically without distributing their user’s data for financial gain to largely unregulated advertisers.  <p>Let’s think about this. Would you be comfortable telling a stranger you met on the street, where you live, how many kids you have, where you went to high school, if you’re married or not? We readily volunteer this information online every day using ad-supported apps, like social media, productivity apps and games. Sounds insane right? </p><p>The future is not as abysmal as it might seem. While technology is bound to proliferate there are ways to prevent this dark picture above. The first step of many is to pay for the applications and software you use. </p><p>At Fission this is a driving focus for us. We believe in the protection and privacy of our users is essential--That’s why we feel so strongly about our mission. By supporting a movement for normalizing the payment of apps, we aim to be part of the solution. We encrypt the data of every end-user--while giving developers the tools to build great apps, and eventually include the ability to easily charge for them.</p><p>For end-users wanting to try out some of these apps, you can start by logging into <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission’s Drive app</a>. It’s free for small amounts of data, and you can pay for a <a href="https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive">premium account on Open Collective</a>, which helps us build more apps and tools for developers.</p><p>For developers, check out some of the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/11/none">App ideas in the forum</a>, or start with the <a href="https://guide.fission.codes">dev guide</a> to build an app of your own.</p><p>References<br><br>The Social Dilemma.

Learn more about what you can do with Trinsic Studio below.</p>

			 Create Organizations 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Before issuing or verifying any credential, you must create an Organization in Trinsic Studio. When you create an Organization, you are creating a credential issuer and/or verifier. The number of Organizations you can create depends on your Trinsic Studio plan, so check out our <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">pricing page</a> to see how the plans differ.</p>

					 <p>When we say that issuing verifiable credentials using Trinsic Studio takes only minutes, we mean it. The Studio guides you step-by-step on how to create a credential template, so you can control what information is included in a certain type of credential. You can also enable revocation if necessary for your use case. Once a credential template is created, you can start issuing that type of credential to anyone. Trinsic Studio gives you the option to send the credential by connection, email, or QR code/link. Check out this tutorial on <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">how to issue credentials in Trinsic Studio</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Verify credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Verifying credentials is just as easy with Trinsic Studio as issuing them. To be able to verify a credential, a verification template must be created. Verification templates specify the exact information an individual needs to share in order for the verification to be successful. Trinsic Studio even gives users the flexibility to define verification templates that utilize <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proof</a> (ZKPs) technology. Once a verification template has been created, you can use Trinsic Studio to send a verification request using by connection, email, or a QR code/link.

					 <p>Connections are used in SSI to create a secure, peer-to-peer communication channel between you and another party. With this connection, you can issuer, verify, and share verifiable credentials without fear of man-in-the-middle attacks. With Trinsic Studio, creating a connection with someone else is as easy as clicking a button to generate a QR code and sending that QR code to the other party for them to scan using an <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">SSI digital wallet</a> (like the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>).

<p>The beauty industry isn’t good at opening up when it comes to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessibaker/2021/02/04/hey-beauty-its-time-to-lift-the-lid-on-ingredients-and-impact/?sh=16bc8e6848b7">ingredients and impact</a>. But the ‘values shopper’ cohort is growing, and brands need to step up to meet their expectations. According to the British Beauty Council’s <a href="https://britishbeautycouncil.com/the-courage-to-change-sustainability-report/">Courage To Change report</a>, 86% of beauty shoppers want information about ingredient supply chains. Brands are falling behind these customer expectations: 1 in 5 customers don’t know how to check a product’s sustainability credentials.</p>
<p>Supply chain transparency is a difficult issue for brands. At Provenance, however, we believe they have a responsibility to open up about impact. And, with customer expectations for transparency growing fast, those who do will benefit. We believe every product should come with accessible, trustworthy information about origin, journey and impact. Through Provenance’s Transparency Framework, we’re helping beauty brands deliver exactly this.&nbsp;</p>
 What’s the Transparency Framework? 
<p>Our <a href="https://www.provenance.org/business/platform">Transparency Framework</a> is an open-source framework that helps companies communicate the impact of their business and supply chains with integrity. The framework is benchmarked to international standards, verifiable through proof and backed up by a council of expert advisors. It allows brands to turn supply chain data into information shoppers can understand, accessible through off-pack and online channels.</p>
<p>As part of the Transparency Framework process, we work with brands to develop a comprehensive understanding of a product’s impact throughout the supply chain. This covers a range of issues relating to a business’s impact, from carbon impact to animal welfare issues. The framework then allows brands to communicate the impact through Proof Points, which connect claims around impact to real data in the supply chain.</p>
 <p>The Transparency Framework is benchmarked to international standards</p> 
 What does it mean for beauty brands? 
 1: Unlock the truth around ingredients 
<p>Beauty shoppers are used to a lack of information around ingredients. When ingredients lists are disclosed, they’re often difficult to understand, making it hard for shoppers to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>Our Transparency Framework is enabling brands to be open with customers about ingredients and their impact on people and the planet. Through Proof Points, brands can clearly communicate proven claims around their ingredients, so that shoppers can compare products based on facts.</p>
<p>The framework in action: Provenance recently worked with an Italian brand who were marketing sunscreen as Coral Reef Safe. Thanks to the Transparency Framework process, they learned that their formulation in fact contained an ingredient not considered to be Coral Reef Safe. The brand immediately stopped making this claim, and are currently taking steps to address the issue.</p>
 <p>With Provenance, beauty brands can make proof-backed claims across a range of impact areas</p> 
 2: Add clarity to clinical claims 
<p>Beauty shoppers are used to brands marketing their products as ‘clinically tested’. But unfortunately, not all claims adhere to a consistent standard, and shoppers are generally left in the dark on the nature of these tests</p>
<p>Through our Transparency Framework, brands can get specific with their ‘clinically tested’ claims. The framework allows brands to share the subject, method and results of the test in question. Shoppers can then access this information online – by clicking on a Provenance Claim Capsule or in-store – by scanning a QR code.</p>
<p>The framework in action: <a href="https://www.cultbeauty.com/mt/en/lumity-day-night-nutritional-suppliments.html">Lumity</a> is a cosmetics brand that sells ‘clinically tested’ Day &amp; Night Nutritional Supplements. With Provenance Proof Points, their customers can see a detailed summary of these clinical tests with just a click. Lumity’s customers can see that “a placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-cell clinical trial was conducted on 50 female subjects, aged 35-65, for 12 weeks.” Crucially, they can also see the positive results: “users saw significant improvements in hair, skin, nails &amp; quality of life.”</p>
 3: Communicate with confidence on product recyclability 
 <p>Beauty brands can add credibility to their recyclability claims with verified Proof Points</p> 
<p><a href="https://britishbeautycouncil.com/the-courage-to-change-sustainability-report/">British Beauty Council research</a> found that unrecyclable packaging is amongconsumers’ top environmental concerns – and little wonder, given that the global cosmetics industry produces more than 120 billion units of packaging every year.</p>
<p>However, it’s a complex issue and many brands struggle to know what they&nbsp;can and can’t claim. Through the Transparency Framework, we’re helping brands develop a comprehensive understanding of the recyclability of their packaging, so that they can communicate confidently around this key consumer issue.</p>
<p>The framework in action: We recently worked with a haircare brand called <a href="https://www.wearecentred.com/">Centred</a>. Through the Transparency Framework, they were able to collate comprehensive packaging information from their supplier for a recyclability Proof Point. In the process, they discovered that parts of their packaging were actually made from recycled plastic. This meant that they weren’t only recyclable, but more than 75% of the product’s packaging was made from recycled materials, which they could communicate to shoppers through an additional Proof Point.</p>
 4: Build trust with third-party proof 
 <p>Sana Jardin’s claim of supporting local communities in their supply chain is verified by NEST</p> 
<p>According to a <a href="https://compareethics.com/building-trust-sustainability">Compare Ethics report</a>, just 1 in 5 shoppers trust brands’ sustainability claims. It’s perhaps understandable thatlarge brands are often guilty of ‘greenhush’, and reluctant to communicate progress for fear of backlash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beauty brands can tackle this problem by working with independent third parties to verify their claims. The Transparency Framework helps brands add weight to claims and build consumer trust by embedding these verifications within the off-pack and online shopping experience. In practice, this lets brands highlight the positive impact they are having in the supply chain, whether that’s by working with communities or reusing byproducts.</p>
<p>The framework in action: The socially conscious fragrance brand <a href="https://sanajardin.com/">Sana Jardin</a> claims to “contribute to development of the community where our hero ingredient is sourced”. Through the Transparency Framework, the brand is able to evidence their actions: the Orange Blossom Project which they helped form has led to a 136% increase in local womens’ wages and the re-purposing of floral waste. Sana Jardin had this claim publicly verified by NEST, a nonprofit focused on responsible handcraft.</p>

Ontology and Binance have a long history of working closely together — a fruitful, mutually beneficial cooperation. The integration of Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Solution into the Binance Smart Chain is the latest in our collaborative efforts, further strengthening the ties between the two companies. The symbiotic relationship sees Ontology and ONT ID as the sole partner for BSC in terms of providing a truly decentralized identity option and KYC user verification.  Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was interviewed by CointelegraphCN and shared his thoughts on public chain’s globalization.  <p>Industry News</p><p><a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/data-regulation-in-2021%3A-more-small-steps-or-a-giant-leap-2021-02-04">Data Regulation In 2021: More Small Steps Or A Giant&nbsp;Leap?</a></p><p>By Li Jun, Founder of&nbsp;<a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a></p><p>We are living through an activist period of data regulation that will dictate how our economies function for generations to come. Data regulation is being designed from first principles before our very eyes. It draws from notions of individual privacy, and is heavily influenced by world events from national security regulation following 9/11 to a reckoning on data collection in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. Technical considerations are also feeding into regulation, in particular the ability of machine learning technology to help with medical treatment or predict crime using ever larger data&nbsp;sets.</p><p>ONT ID is a framework for decentralized identity, built on the Ontology blockchain and integrated with the Binance Smart Chain. So any user, developer, or project launching STO’s will have access to fully integrate the benefits of ONT ID and with it, decentralized identity, into their existing developments. We are looking forward to witnessing the wider use of ONT ID, providing any entity with a digital identity that is controlled by the entity through decentralization.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-february-16th-22nd-2021-2275c2e4b71">Ontology Weekly Report (February 16th- 22nd, 2021)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Being digital first with a robust digital journey is more than just a competitive advantage for educational institutions – it’s fundamental. The diversity of the user base, IT budget restrictions, along with an absolute need for frictionless flow throughout services calls for a well thought out identity and access management (IAM) solution. Here is how higher education should take advantage of digital transformation with IAM.</p>
 Dynamic identity lifecycle management 
<p>Educational institutes have many different groups with different roles going through their various systems.</p>
 
 Students – from enrolment, to student lifecycle, all the way to becoming an alumnus 
 Staff – regular staff accessing systems based on roles 
 Visitors – visiting lecturers and students, short-term international students, contractors with the need of temporary access rights 
 
<p>Managing these identities without a dynamic identity management solution means time wasted on repetitive operational tasks, can cause serious delays with enrolling new faculty or students, and ultimately leads to a poor user experience. A good identity management solution simplifies creation, migration and storage of these user identities and ensures a frictionless, any-time, any-place journey throughout their identity lifecycle.</p>
 Cut down costs with good user experience 
<p>As well as various user groups, higher education institutes typically have various services. By enabling single sign-on (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-sso/">SSO</a>), users can benefit from simplified login using one identity to all digital services and applications – which would otherwise call for admin-heavy tasks, draining IT support resources. By allowing the end user to manage their own accounts and resolve issues themselves, such as passwords or ID management through self-service, the whole process is even more quick and user-friendly. Giving the power to the end user, institutions are able to reduce operational costs significantly while increasing overall user satisfaction.</p>
 Robust security 
<p>Security issues, such as data breaches, are becoming more common every day. Higher education institutes are processing a lot of personally identifiable information (PII), which calls for solid security measures. Developing a security strategy based on capabilities such as identity verification, multi-factor authentication and delegated authority prevents security threats and helps to deal with security challenges effectively. A good identity management solution makes sure your users are who they say they are and that they have the right access to authorised services.</p>
 Future-proof operations 
<p>Attracting new students and maintaining the quality and growth in use of digital services affordably is a key part of the competition for higher education institutions. As budgets and resources are being constrained unceasingly, the demand for online services is growing fast – especially due to the pandemic. Having a digital-first mindset not only solves budgeting issues by cutting down unnecessary costs, but can make your institution competitive by appealing to tech-savvy students. Enriching educational life online with good identity management and having a truly secure, modern online experience is not a “nice to have”, it’s a must have and makes your digitalisation project sustainably future-proof. Digitalisation can help you to place first in the competition. &nbsp;</p>
 Start your digital transformation 
<p>Higher education institutes are facing many challenges that can be solved with proper IAM solution. (See this blog from Intragen:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.intragen.com/blog/strong-solutions-for-5-iam-challenges-in-higher-education">5 IAM Challenges in Higher Education</a>). Being digital-first has always been a competitive advantage but now it is the key to business success. Ubisecure has almost two decades of experience in delivering proven digital ecosystems and we’ve helped higher education institutions take full advantage of digitalisation through our Identity Platform.</p>

THEPOL ensures voter’s anonymity using DID: THEPOL uses Metadium’s DID(Decentralized ID) technology to ensure “vote anonymity” that traditional online voting services couldn’t&nbsp;realize.  Meta(META) Coni and badge(NFT): The surveyor can pay META coin to surveyee as a reward. By participating in the survey, surveyee can obtain not only META coins but also rare badges(NFT) issued on Metadium blockchain.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/thepol-launched-6a428af37d6a">THEPOL Launched</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>I’ve been a musician most of my life. I was in bands when I was in junior high up until I joined the Army at 19. I started writing software a few years after getting out of the military and kinda put music to the side. Recently, I’ve started to play in bands again, and something struck me about the dynamics of playing with other musicians and how that prepared me for writing software on a team. I’ve been writing software professionally now for over twenty years. There are many parallels, so I thought I would share some of those lessons hoping that it might help other programmers work more effectively in a team. Writing software, after all, is a team sport.</p>

 

 

 Practice Your Craft 

<p>As a musician, you should practice your parts for the songs you’re playing with the band and also practice getting better on your instrument in general. The better you play your part, the better the team will be, but never forget that your part is just one part of a larger whole. This means practicing and perfecting your part before you get to rehearsals. The more prepared you are when you get to rehearsal, the better the band will sound at rehearsal.</p>

<p>In software, this means continuing to learn about the languages and platforms that you program for. Take time to read that blog post, or watch that tutorial, or read that programming book. You don’t want to let it consume your whole life (work-life balance is extremely important), but you can just carve out one evening a week where you spend time improving your skills for an hour or two without becoming a workaholic.</p>

 Let Go of Mistakes 

<p>When you mess up, learn what you can from the mistake: was it just a typo? Or a more serious deficit in your knowledge? Then, let it go. It’s easy to dwell on mistakes, but that will only force you to make more of them. You don’t want to ignore a mistake completely, but learn what you can and move on. I’ve always thought that the best musicians in the world are the ones who can make a mistake instantly learn, and then forget it. Just keep playing.</p>

<p>This goes for coworkers as well. Your band/teammates will make mistakes as well. Believe me, they know they messed up. Fix it, and move on. They probably already feel bad enough, and you might be surprised at just how far a “That’s okay, you got this” will go to creating a really strong team bond.</p>

 Celebrate Bandmates Successes 

<p>It’s important to celebrate your bandmates’ victories, accomplishments, and those times when they just kill it during a performance. Not only does this form a stronger team bond, but they will undoubtedly return the favor. It may seem like a small thing, but it can really make someone’s day. Everyone wants to feel like that “rock star” from time to time, and band members will remember that feeling of killing it and want to do it all the time. This will also make you want to have more of those moments too. Everyone’s performance will improve, and the band will sound fantastic. There is nothing like being on a team of high-performing players, whether you’re playing a local dive bar or building a large software system.</p>

 Stay On Good Terms 

<p>If you must part ways with a member, do your best to part on good terms. Bad feelings are too heavy to carry around, and that weight affects your performance (on and off stage). Plus, whether you live in LA or Springfield, IL, you’ll likely see those same players around your local scene, and you don’t want anyone running around with bad feelings about you. You might find yourself in a band with them later, and you don’t want things to be awkward or to not even get the gig because of one person.</p>

<p>On the flip side, welcome new members with excitement. Do your best to include them in band activities and make them feel like they’ve ALWAYS been part of this group. Being a new member of the team is stressful and can be isolating. You’ve probably been the new guy before too. The band will sound better and playing music will be more fun.</p>

 No Showboating 

<p>Everyone has a solo once in a while. It won’t always be you. It’s important that all of the members of the band get a chance to show off their talents. When it’s your turn, let ‘er rip! When it’s not your turn, do whatever you can to make sure that you’re playing in a way that helps to highlight just how badass your teammate is. They will do the same for you when it’s your turn to shine. This, again, creates a tighter team bond and makes playing with your team that much more enjoyable. You’re going to be spending a lot of time with these people, do your best to make it a joy to work with them.</p>

<p>Nobody likes a know-it-all anyway. If you’ve ever been on a team where one of the members believes they’re above the team, it can be quite demoralizing to the team and really affect the team’s performance. Don’t be that person. If you really feel like your skills are way above the team you are on (it happens), find another team. Sometimes that is a great signal that it’s time to move on. You might also find other ways to serve the team, like helping them in areas where they are deficient. This can be a little tricky since you don’t want to seem like a know-it-all, but if you see them struggling, you might just say, “Hey! Want some help?” You might even find you have a knack for teaching and find yourself a new career direction!</p>

 Not Every Song Will Be Your Favorite 

<p>I’ve played in a lot of cover bands, some originals bands as well. Not all of the songs we played were fun for me. Maybe my part was boring; maybe I just didn’t like that particular song. It’s fine. It is important to remember that you are doing this for someone else. When you’re putting together a setlist, you try to play songs that the audience will enjoy. Sometimes those are songs you don’t really like.</p>

<p>The same goes for software. Sometimes you might get tasked with the “grunt work.” Maybe it’s a task you don’t really like doing. It’s important in those times to remember the team’s goals. What are we trying to accomplish here? Understanding how an unenjoyable task helps the team make better software can be the key to making those tasks more bearable.</p>

 Your Tips 

<p>Over the years, I’ve met a LOT of developers. There seem to be a lot of you who are musicians. So what did I miss? Any tips along the way you’ve found that made you a better team member or made your work more enjoyable? Please share your tips below in the comments.</p>

A “bombshell” in the SEC v. Ripple&nbsp;case? <p>Revealed during the pretrial court hearing: A large exchange approached the SEC in 2019 asking if they could trade/sell XRP. Apparently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHpV0m_bi3c">the SEC didn’t say&nbsp;no</a>.</p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Photo: TechCrunch<p>Elsewhere, Coinbase is now trading at over $100 billion — potentially making it the biggest IPO since Facebook.

Second Market), offering up to 1.8 million shares in weekly&nbsp;batches.</blockquote>  The goal was to help Coinbase determine a reference price for its public offering, which will be done via direct listing instead of&nbsp;IPO.  The initial batch of 75,000 shares was sold on Jan. 29 at $200 per share. That worked out to a valuation of nearly $54 billion, compared to the $8 billion valuation Coinbase received during its prior venture capital round in late&nbsp;2018.  The next two batches were sold at $301 and $303, respectively.  The most recent batch of 127,000 shares was sold Friday at $373, which works out to a valuation of $100.23&nbsp;billion.  <p>And finally, if you haven’t already, check out our latest podcast episode featuring Solana creator Anatoly Yakovenko: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-04-the-future-of-blockchain-with-the-creator-of-solana-4e7944e3ba50">EPISODE 04 — The future of blockchain with the creator of&nbsp;Solana</a></p><p>It’s a super educational listen as Anatoly gives a bit of history on the evolution of blockchain, while providing the origins story behind Solana’s novel solution — proof of&nbsp;history.</p><p>Also:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/diem-stablecoin-prepares-for-liftoff-with-fireblocks-custody-partnership">Diem Stablecoin Prepares for Liftoff With Fireblocks Custody Partnership — CoinDesk</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>— <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/why-silicon-valley-doesnt-get-bitcoin">Why Silicon Valley Doesn’t Get Bitcoin with Dan Held — What Bitcoin&nbsp;Did</a>   2. Last week, we talked about where Clubhouse fits into the evolution of our platforms in the context of this broader cycle. Here’s a counterpoint. <p>From <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/clubhouse-and-the-future-of-cult-driven-social-platforms">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>People are right to be focusing attention on Clubhouse’s meteoric rise. But almost everyone seems to misunderstand what is making the app so successful.</blockquote><blockquote>It isn’t, as people like Ben Thompson suggest, simply another iteration of the old story of lowering the barriers for production and consumption, shortening feedback loops and creating new “white space” for aspiring stars. If you think of it as being like Twitter, Stories or TikTok, you are missing the&nbsp;point.</blockquote><blockquote>The key to Clubhouse’s rapid accession is that its social design makes it an ideal platform for cults at a time when the social internet is rapidly evolving away from organizing around communities and toward cults. Clubhouse’s rise likely signals major strategic shifts that several legacy social platforms are going to have to consider.</blockquote><blockquote>The weakening of digital communities and rise of digital cults that we are seeing is inevitable. A similar pattern played out millennia ago in the physical world, as large cults and autocracies came to dominate small local communities. It is reasonable that the same cycle would repeat at warp speed in the digital&nbsp;space.</blockquote><p>Also:</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-22/clubhouse-chats-are-breached-raising-concerns-over-security">Clubhouse Chats Are Breached, Raising Concerns Over&nbsp;Security</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/reddit-content-removal-2020-b0365610-932c-4c10-b2c6-2d9111fbcf1a.html">Reddit removed 6% of content on its platform in&nbsp;2020</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-audio-clubhouse-twitter-facebook-c58ee759-9645-46d2-943c-1ef67dd70f9c.html">Audio platforms are thriving in the&nbsp;pandemic</a>  <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/mark-zuckerberg-joel-kaplan-facebook-alex-jones">“Mark Changed The Rules”: How Facebook Went Easy On Alex Jones And Other Right-Wing Figures</a>   3.

				  New community effort, Aries Bifold, targets an open source Aries mobile agent interoperable with other Aries projects.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Hyperledger Aries is infrastructure for blockchain-rooted, peer-to-peer interactions. It includes &nbsp;shared cryptographic storage for blockchain clients as well as a communications protocol for allowing off-ledger interactions between those clients. And while mobile agents are a vital piece of the community ecosystem, helping implement verifiable credentials exchange between mobile devices, the community does not yet host an active effort targeting mobile agents.</p>
<p>Indicio is happy to announce an initial code contribution and ongoing development and support for this community effort to produce a production quality mobile agent that implements common protocols within the Aries community. We look forward to collaborating with others in this effort.</p>
<p>Part of the goal of this open community effort is to ensure Aries Bifold’s interoperability with other Aries projects to ensure protocols are built to Hyperledger Aries and Indy standards.</p>
<p>The initial community meeting will occur on Wednesday, February 24, 12:00 PM MST (11am PST, 2:00pm EST, 7:00pm UTC) Meeting information can be found <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Aries+Bifold+User+Group+Meetings">here</a>.</p>
<p>We welcome participation from the multiple organizations, contributors, and maintainers within the Aries community that have expressed interest in this effort and anyone interested in collaborating with the Aries community to create open source mobile agents.</p>
<p>All are welcome! Come join us!</p>

			<p>In many major jurisdictions, blockchain technology is now recognised as a suitable infrastructure for the issuance and transfer of financial securities. There is now a huge opportunity for financial institutions to launch their digital asset marketplaces (DAMs). These players can utilise a network that brings solutions to long-standing efficiency and liquidity problems.</p>

Because Fission is also interested in working in browsers very securely, we decided to work with the Filecoin team on this project. Hear from Ben and Brian about their progress in the Fission Demo Day video. </p> IPFS Cluster Updates <p>Daniel (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/dholms">@dholms</a>) talked to us about his updates to the IPFS Cluster. Fission is built on an Interplanetary File System (or IPFS) which is a global peer-to-peer network. Fission builds encryption on top of the IPFS stack, running IPFS servers to make sure that your data stays online and accessible directly from the browser, all with your security in mind. Daniel shares with us some recent backend infrastructure work he's doing to improve our system performance. </p> Tiddlywiki and Fission <p>Jeremy Rustin (<a href="https://twitter.com/Jermolene">@jermolene</a>) is the creator of Tiddlywiki, a serverless web app that allows users to create a non-linear notebook for recording, organizing and sharing complex information. We're collaborating to build an app that will allow users to use TiddlyWiki on the Fission platform. You can hear from Jeremy directly in the Demo Day video. We’ve also been working out in the open in the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">TiddlyWiki group on the Fission forum</a> so hop over there to see what's going on. </p> Video  Join us next time <p>We're experimenting with <a href="https://lu.ma/">Luma</a> for registering for events.

<p>This is a guest&nbsp;blog.</p><p>In October 2020, Caribou Digital engaged my production company, Nairobi-based <a href="http://www.storyby.design/">Story x Design,</a> to produce a <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">participatory video storytelling project</a> that put 11 people who earn their livelihood from digital platforms at the centre of their own story. We are passionate about innovative storytelling methods and were able to apply our experience in user-generated content and production skills training to design and implement the&nbsp;project.</p><p>This project was a continuation of Caribou Digital’s ongoing work on <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">platform livelihoods</a>. At the onset of COVID-19, Caribou Digital initiated <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/covid-19-and-the-platform-livelihoods-of-young-african-workers-f0b5efa1d9c">a series of conversations</a> with platform workers and sellers in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda about how the pandemic had impacted their lives. This storytelling project brought to life the stories of 11 workers through video&nbsp;diaries.</p><p>My company provided the workers with training on videography skills, equipped them with decent camera phones, and provided ongoing narrative mentorship to empower the participants to tell their stories over a period of two months. Through a series of short self-shot videos, each participant shared their real-life experiences as digital labourers during the pandemic.</p><p>In this blog, we share our methodology, including successes, challenges, and tips for those who are interested in running a similar&nbsp;project.</p> Methodology <p>During the project design phase, we discussed how the participants would submit their footage; we decided that issuing a smartphone would be our best chance for success. It would also be an incentive to participate in the project. The 12 participants were sent a Samsung A21s smartphone, chosen for the quality of its camera and for its price. We locked the phone at the start of the project using <a href="https://preyproject.com/">Prey</a>, software that can remotely control and secure the&nbsp;phone.</p><p>Upon successful completion of the project, each phone was unlocked and ownership was transferred to the participant. A small octopus tripod, a Bluetooth selfie stick, a lapel microphone, and a selfie light were also distributed to each participant. This small production kit was designed to increase the production value of the video recordings and aid skills development.</p><p>For their contribution to the project, each participant received three payments tied to the delivery of a video for each chapter. The payments were a recognition of the time invested by the participants in the project while doing their platform work. In addition to their smartphone kit, they also received internet data bundles for&nbsp;uploads.</p><p>It was important in the project design phase to ensure the project was designed in an ethical and respectful way. We clearly outlined the terms of the engagement through a formal agreement form and gathered the informed consent of each participant for the usage of their image and likeness. This process also allowed the participants an opportunity to voice concerns about how their story would be edited and disseminated. A few participants told us they did not want to film their families and others drew boundaries in terms of time commitment. Knowing this upfront helped us work together with respect and understanding.</p><p>Through an agile approach, we engaged the participants in three ways: via video skills development, one-on-one narrative mentoring, and through a participatory, post-production process.</p><p>Video Skills Training — Using WhatsApp, we ran a series of one-on-one training sessions on how to record video using their phone. The participants were asked to submit video samples before the training that were used as examples to identify common mistakes. Afterwards, they were taught how to stabilize the camera, record clean audio, and capture shots to build a scene. We created a series of training videos and supporting graphics that were shared on WhatsApp, and then re-shared when a participant needed a specific reminder to, for example, turn their radio off while recording a video&nbsp;diary.</p><p>Narrative Mentorship — To support the storytelling outcomes, our mentor Abu “Sensei” Majid worked remotely with each participant to help them identify and express stories important to their lives. Through WhatsApp messaging and Google Duo video sessions, Abu spoke to the participants weekly for two months. This organic dialogue built trust and confidence, while empowering participants to self-direct their own story. Guided by <a href="https://scottdistillery.medium.com/dan-harmon-the-heros-journey-and-the-circle-theory-of-story-b64bb77d6976">Dan Harmon’s popular 8 story circle structure</a>, Abu and I crafted a series of standard narrative prompts for the participants. As we received material back, we adapted the narrative model to the nuances of each person’s evolving&nbsp;story.</p><p>Participatory Post-Production — The participants shared their video diaries and original video footage primarily through Google Drive, <a href="https://wetransfer.com/">WeTransfer</a>, and <a href="https://send-anywhere.com/">Send Anywhere</a>. The upload to cloud platforms was often stalled by unreliable internet access. Our post-production team downloaded the files to review and edit the material, sharing previews and follow-up questions with each participant in real-time. This structure helped the participants maintain ownership of their story without the need for high-level technical skills. Our team found Google Drive challenging as a cloud platform for video editing because it lacked file prioritization functionality and slowed down the back-and-forth feedback&nbsp;loop.</p> Successes <p>Overall, the project succeeded in capturing a variety of otherwise underrepresented voices in a unique and timely way. We produced and published 23 video chapters over the course of two months. That’s 92 minutes of content created remotely by a small production team and first-time self-shooters in quite a short period of time. Some of the specific successes include:</p>  One-on-one Mentoring — The greatest success of the project design was the inclusion of the role of Story Mentor from the very beginning. Abu was the only touchpoint for all the participants, which reduced any confusion and streamlined communication. Abu delivered one-on-one skills training using WhatsApp audio and video, Google Duo App, and occasionally, traditional network carrier phone calls when experiencing internet downtime. In these calls, he provided narrative guidance and contributed to the project management, ensuring the success of the&nbsp;project.  Empowered Voices — Eleven of the 12 participants successfully delivered three video chapters showing a strong level of engagement as self-driven storytellers. Some participants were quick to engage and able to share their story readily. Others were slower to unfold. But as the participants gained technical skills and saw we were treating their story with respect, confidence grew. By the third chapter, Mary Ikigu, 24, politely declined our prompts and self-directed her entire shoot, a significant milestone in our&nbsp;eyes.  Intimate Stories Captured — The stories captured went deeper than conventional reportage or research would permit. Video highlights include a COVID-19-related funeral, a wedding, and a genuine, real-time emotion that help audiences engage more deeply with the participants’ lived experience. For example, Stanley Shiafu, 34, was an on-demand cleaner with Lynk Kenya who lost his work during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/stanley-story-coming-soon/">Watch his three chapters&nbsp;here.</a>   Challenges and how they were&nbsp;overcome <p>We knew the project was ambitious. The 12 participants live in four countries and two time zones. By the nature of their work, they are busy people with mouths to feed and lives to live. This storytelling project, though compensated, was always going to be a big ask. But we learned a lot and, by all accounts, so did the participants. Some of the challenges include the following:</p><p>B-roll — B-roll is footage that is laid over interviews or video diaries. It illustrates the story being told. For example, Dorcas Mutheu, 41, runs a cake business, so visuals of her baking, decorating, and boxing her product were important to show her work. We trained the participants in basic video conventions such as the different purpose of establishing and close-up shots. Also, because we wanted the project to be as collaborative as possible, we resisted being prescriptive about what B-roll participants should be filming. However, it became clear that recording video diaries was fairly easy for most to do and that filming B-roll of their lives was more challenging. Through continual briefings, resending our video instructions, and eventually, sending specific shot lists, we were able to co-create each story in a visually engaging&nbsp;way.</p><p>Deadlines and Incentives — Between the ambitious two-month timeline and the demands of their lives, the engagement of the participants varied over time. We found it was difficult for most of them to upload enough content to meet the tight edit turnaround. We decided we needed to incentivize them to meet their deadline by offering a small cash transfer via mobile money in addition to their agreed instalment fee. This worked really well and about two-thirds of the participants uploaded on&nbsp;time.</p><p>Data Uploads — The upload of video files was challenging for all participants, particularly those in rural areas where internet speeds were slow. Stanley, for example, had to commute to a nearby town to access good upload speeds. Okoli Edwin Chimereze, 20, an e-commerce entrepreneur, had to go to cyber cafés in Lagos to help with faster internet. When it became clear the upload was slowing down the Google Drive production workflow and frustrating the participants, we distributed additional data bundles, some of which needed to be reloaded for each chapter. We also encouraged the use of alternative file transfer websites like WeTransfer and Send Anywhere. However, this meant organizing the files manually, which consumed a lot of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Language Barrier — It became evident that a lot of communication was lost in translation with one participant. She was getting frustrated and unmotivated, so we translated her prompt questions to her mother tongue and hired a translator for one-on-one calls. This made for easier, efficient one-on-one training sessions. Her subsequent video submissions were of greater depth and&nbsp;quality.</p><p>Insecurity — Showing where you live and work was an important part of gathering B-roll. However, this was not always possible or safe. One participant was treated with aggression while filming on the streets of Kampala during a tense political climate. We worked with her to find creative ways to film while reducing her exposure. Also, two of our participants were mugged during the course of the project and had their phones stolen. While we had installed a lock-out software on the phone in the case of such a scenario, we were only briefly able to trace the locations of the two stolen phones. Fortunately, we were able to retrieve the data remotely. We had a contingency budget, so we re-issued the phones to keep the two participants on&nbsp;track.</p> Tips for others considering using this technique <p>This innovative participatory approach is exciting for the participants and engaging for audiences. When used in combination with more traditional research or reportage methods, it has a great deal of potential to unlock surprising insights. However, there are a few things to consider before embarking on your project&nbsp;design.</p>  Set clear expectations. We drew up a clear project agreement and informed consent document, which each participant signed, scanned and sent back to us. However, we didn’t make clear how much time we would expect people to put into the project. The time it takes to produce a video, particularly the B-roll overlay footage often surprises newcomers to video. It would have been helpful to communicate a conservative estimate of the hours the project would require. In hindsight, we estimate each chapter took the participants approximately eight hours to plan, film, and upload. In addition to training and communication time, the average time spent on the project was about 30 hours per participant. For most, the remuneration was fair. However, it still would have been better to estimate and communicate how much time this would actually equate&nbsp;to.  Try to be realistic. Participatory projects like this have a huge payoff in terms of originality and access to the stories that are shared. However, they also take a lot more concerted effort and time. Our two-month timeline was probably too ambitious for the amount of content we co-created. We could have done with a third more months, a third fewer participants, a third more staff, or a third fewer videos. If you’re looking to undertake a similar project, set your goals high and then add a third more resources!  Stay agile. No, really, stay agile. Flexibility and improvisation are central to a participatory approach. The project design was premised on producing and publishing three discrete video chapters per person. For some people, their story naturally unfolded over time and the three-chapter format made sense to track their journey. For example, Peter Maraizu Ogbonna, 35, a taxi driver in Lagos, captured the construction of his new poultry farm side-hustle over the course of two months. For others, such as Onyinyechukwu Anastestia Onyekaba, 24, a software developer also in Lagos, her story was more compellingly told in just one compressed chapter. The decision to vary the number of chapters edited per participant was made in the last days of the project, triggering a furore of re-editing but ultimately making the content more engaging for audiences across a variety of platforms. Also, one participant found the challenge to record B-roll and in-depth video diaries too difficult to manage with his end-of-year work commitments, so we collectively decided to end his involvement in the project without any video output. While disappointing, we had anticipated there would be a level of attrition and were pleased 11 of the 12 participants successfully engaged with the demands of the&nbsp;project.   Conclusion <p>This participatory process has led me to feel deeply connected to 12 people I’ve never met. In fact, because Abu was the only person to speak directly to each person, I’ve never even spoken to them. After a hard year for most people around the world, and a particularly hard year for my production business and the creatives I work with, this project was a deeply healing&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Without even realizing the impact they would have, these 12 participants took on a huge new challenge. They learned new skills. They bravely bared their souls. They said “Yes” at a time when the world was consumed by anxiety. I personally think this is very cool. Not only do they offer important insights into the reality of work on digital platforms, but by sharing their stories, they also validate the struggles of millions like them, surviving and thriving even during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">Watch all the videos&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/a-platform-of-their-own-our-experience-running-a-participatory-video-storytelling-project-e90075e3f69d">A platform of their own: Our experience running a participatory video storytelling project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<br>
 The Storm before the Calm 
<p>Building things, even Calm™ things, makes noise. George Nakashima’s wooden furniture evokes peace, but its construction still begins with a chainsaw. We mention this because we’re firing up our newest power tool.</p>
<p>We call her Eliza. She is a data-collection robot.</p>
<p>Hang on. An AI? Harvesting my data? Spying on me? Flooding me with spam? This is Urbit, right? Let us tell you about our new friend in basic terms, where MEGACORP might otherwise deploy legalese.</p>
 What Eliza is and isn’t 
<blockquote>
<p>Replicants are like any other machine - they're either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.</p>
<p>Rick Deckard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's start with the benefits. Eliza is a simple chatbot. She was made to collect feedback on Landscape. She asks direct questions about peoples' usage of Urbit, records any responses, and reports them to her managers at Tlon. She'll also provide timely advice and information to ships kind enough to chat with her. She'll begin reaching out to ships via DM in the coming month. If you don't want to, just say no, and you'll never hear from her again.</p>
<p>Finding bugs is critical to Urbit's rapid development, especially in this period of nascency. Most Urbit-related frustrations go unreported; regular folks don't think to open up Github when they experience a minor issue. That's why it's incumbent upon us to design a lower-friction forum for feedback. People who aren't comfortable filing an issue might be willing to talk to a friendly chatbot.</p>
<p>Now, about hazards. By design, there are few. Eliza runs on Tlon's comet, not on your planet. There will be no OTA to install <code>%eliza-bot-store</code> on everyone's ships. Eliza learns things through conversation, not hidden surveillance software. Data she requests, like the text output of our network analytic tool, <code>+tally</code>, must be sent manually. MEGACORP tends to cut this corner; to refine their products, they just track your reactions in real-time.</p>
<p>Since she's <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/b0c1f83287cbf4c85847a9238d9f4be17e1fcb33/pkg/arvo/app/eliza.hoon">open-source</a>, anyone can creatively deploy Eliza. Just write her a dialogue tree. Of course, that also means we can't keep people from misusing Urbit bots. We think automated agents on the Urbit network are inevitable, so let's create a good baseline culture around them. (Much love to Tendiebot, who's serving up stock prices in <code>~tomdys/wall-star-bets</code>.) However, once Urbit is used world-wide, we can't rely on culture alone.</p>
 A New Internet Economics 
<p>The sum of Urbit's architectural design is a new online economics: a way to finance and monetize access to internet infrastructure where people retain maximum equity. Explicitly acquire a low-maintenance, low-cost server. Use it to compute explicit things. Return to life.</p>
<p>We all know the basic MEGACORP business model: offer a free service (to suckers who don't own a server), secretly mine the data they generate on the (addictive) platform, then sell targeted ads to advertisers. This model will not survive Urbit. The ubiquitous personal server changes the economic equation. You used to 'pay' for an experience with your time and data. On Urbit, once you purchase core internet infrastructure, it's yours.</p>
<p>So, can Urbit meaningfully curtail our world's appetite for data? We'll see. Post-enlightenment society runs on instrumental reason, right down to the last byte. Marketers will always want a fresh dataset. However, when the goods are on your Urbit, you can at least demand the respect you deserve. Long term, we expect a transparent market for data, not an opaque "agreement".  An analytics company wants to track everything you see and do on Urbit? They better be paying well.</p>
<p>Eliza doesn't pay respondents. Her collection is a charity to Urbit's developers. (We're also still busy enabling payments on Urbit with the Bitcoin wallet.) However, her presence is not a term of service either. In a few years, by the nth time some smart aleck uses Eliza's chatbot code and conjures 'Zalexa' to attempt an intrusion upon your Calm™, we will see the economics of Urbit's architecture suddenly vivify. Blacklists, reputation systems, and, eventually, even data markets, all Urbit primitives envisioned long ago, will become real. We won't need Zoogle to underwrite a spam filter for the entire internet; the scarcity of Urbit address space, in tandem with a true web-of-trust, handles that.</p>
<p>If Urbit is to be used worldwide, the old system will not go down without a fight. Spammers, spies, and digital robber-barons will hunt for ways to game Urbit. Our passage out of the digital gutter is beginning in earnest, and we are thrilled to put our new architectures to the test.</p>

<p>Government’s paper vaccine certificates would create a catalogue of problems.</p>
<p>The UK Government’s plans to require holidaymakers to ask their GP for a paper vaccine certificate would encourage fraud, create unnecessary work for GPs and patients and would be unlikely to be accepted as attested proof by many more forward-thinking nations, UK experts have warned.</p>
<p>Chris Justice, President of BLOK BioScience, has urged the Government to join the global Good Health Pass Collaborative¹ of health, travel, technology and government organisations looking to create a blueprint for universally accepted digital health credentials that are privacy-protecting, user-controlled and globally interoperable.</p>
<p>Warning that the Government’s preference for paper vaccine certificates risks creating a range of problems for the public, healthcare professionals and law enforcement, while also reducing the UK’s standing on the global stage, Chris gives five reasons why an ethical privacy-focused digital-based health pass should be introduced, based on Self Sovereign ID technology.</p>
 Our personal data is more private and secure 
<p>Right now people don’t know where their Covid-19 health data is being stored or how it could be used in the future. This is a risk as NHS databases could be compromised², paper certificates are easy to lose¹ or people may have concerns over their data being accessed by government or health authorities³.</p>
<p>With a digital health pass built around a Self Sovereign ID, individuals’ test, vaccine and infection data sits exclusively on their device and the raw data is never shared with anyone else. The only communication it needs to give is attested proof that the individual meets the entry criteria of the country or vendor.</p>
 There’s no risk of counterfeit vaccine passports 
<p>There have already been several reported cases of counterfeit test results being presented¹ ⁴ and that is a huge risk when it comes to managing infections being carried from country to country – including into the UK.</p>
<p>While a paper certificate could be easily counterfeited, a digital health pass can combine attested identity and health credentials and allow an individual to prove that they meet a country’s entry criteria and are who they say they are. It is likely that an easy to counterfeit paper certificate will not be sufficient to access many countries.</p>
 They can be ethical and inclusive, if designed appropriately 
<p>The UK vaccine minister has said that vaccine passports are “discriminatory”⁵ but that really doesn’t have to be the case.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that vaccine passports should be designed in a digital-first form for maximum privacy, security and usability but that doesn’t mean that people without access to a smartphone would be excluded. Inclusivity models such as guardianship or providing secure access through a printed QR code just need to be built in – our own BLOK Pass is ID2020 certified⁶ for meeting 41 outcomes-based technical and ethical standards.</p>
 They would reduce bureaucracy and save time and money 
<p>It has been suggested that patients may need to book a GP appointment and pay £30 for a vaccination certificate⁷. Why should they?</p>
<p>This would be a costly inconvenience for both GPs and patients, and the British Medical Association has already said that patients should be given easy online access to their records for this reason⁷.</p>
<p>If people have access to their personal vaccination and testing data and they can use it for personal benefit then they are more likely to opt into vaccination programmes, which has public health advantages.</p>
 Anonymous insights could be a key tool in the battle against Covid 
<p>Imagine a world where experts can access completely anonymous Covid-19 data in real-time as part of a coordinated national programme that allows us to quickly respond to new variants, regional outbreaks and vaccine side-effects – without ever compromising people’s privacy.</p>
<p>This level of insight could be a game-changer in the battle against the virus but we would only ever be able to secure the level of adoption needed if we address people’s concerns about privacy and security, and make it attractive to sign-up for.</p>

<p>Bitcoinist.com: Around the African continent, the use of new digital currencies and fintech solutions is expanding, as a common interest in decentralized finance grows. One example is at Jelurida Africa, where a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abdcseries.com/">Africa Blockchain Developer Call Series</a>&nbsp;program promoted more entrepreneurs and engineers getting involved in the cryptocurrency world. Jelurida Africa is an offshoot of a Swiss firm of the same name, which was incorporated in the Netherlands in 2016 and moved to Switzerland in 2017. Now, Jelurida Africa is engaged in prelaunch project testing and other goals ahead of additional expansion to a greater number of African nations. At the same time,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adedayo-adebajo-61b908b9/?originalSubdomain=ng">&nbsp;Jelurida Africa&nbsp; Managing Director Adedayo Adebajo</a>&nbsp;is addressing the Nigerian bank’s notice by noting the conflict between fiat and crypto systems.&nbsp;“My question is, will the CBN reinstate the cryptocurrency support if the fundraising is carried out in support of the sitting government?” Adebajo said, according to reporting at Bitcoin.com. “Situations like this provide more reasons why decentralization, as offered by the blockchain technology, is highly required in Africa.”</p>

  <p>NestJs is a popular Node.js framework that is built with typescript and makes use of object-oriented programming, functional programming, and functional reactive programming. NestJs boasts that it provides a framework for building scalable server-side applications.</p>

<p>NestJs integrates nicely with Okta’s single sign-on provider. Okta makes securing a web service, such as the one you will build, quick and easy.</p>

 Create Your Okta Application with the CLI 

<p>The first thing you will need to do is sign up for an Okta developer account if you don’t already have one. This account is free forever and allows you to start building applications secured with Okta immediately. To do this you will use the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/10/introducing-okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>. If you haven’t worked with the CLI yet you can check out the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">full documentation here</a>.</p>

<p>Start by opening the terminal application of your choice. In the terminal, use the command <code>okta register</code>. This command will ask you for your name and email and then create an Okta developer account for you. If you already have an Okta developer account, you can use the <code>okta login</code> command and follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your organization. Once the CLI is set up for your organization, run the command <code>okta apps create</code> and give the application a meaningful name. I named mine <code>library-api</code> but you can name yours whatever you like. Select <code>Single Page App</code> as the application type. Even though you are creating an API in this tutorial, you will be using Postman as the “application” that will consume the API. This can be even more beneficial if you actually create a single-page application later. You’ll be able to use this client ID and issuer in that application.</p>

<p>Since you are going to use Postman to test, enter <code>https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback</code> as your Login Redirect URL. Set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oauth.pstmn.io/</code>. If your organization has multiple authorization servers, you can use <code>default</code> for this tutorial. After the CLI runs, it will return your Issuer and Client ID. Make note of these as you will need them in your application.</p>

 Create Your NestJs Application 

<p>Next, you can create your Nest.js application. If you haven’t installed the nest.js CLI yet then you should do that before beginning. Run the command <code>npm i -g @nestjs/cli@7.5.4</code>. Once that completes, run <code>nest new library-api</code> to create a new application called library-api.</p>

<p>Next, you need to install some dependencies you will need. First, you will want to install <code>dotenv</code> for your environment variables.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to install the passport and Okta libraries that will help set up your auth module.</p>

   <code>npm i passport@0.4.1
npm i passport-http-bearer@1.0.1
npm i @nestjs/passport@7.1.5
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@2.0.0
</code>   

<p>Now you can create a new folder in your root directory called <code>.env</code>. Add the following values to it.</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
OKTA_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer}
OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
</code>   

<p>Now you can begin the work of setting up your application. Nest uses a few concepts that it’s important to discuss at this point. The first is controllers. Controllers are responsible for handling requests from the client.</p>

<p>Next is providers. The name “providers” is a bit of a catch-all term for services, repositories, factories, and many other types of classes. Providers can be injected into other classes using the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator.</p>

<p>Finally, there are modules. The role of the module is to organize the application structure. Modules are decorated with the <code>@Module()</code> decorator.</p>

<p>With that work in mind, you can begin to create your auth module. First, create a new folder in your <code>src</code> folder called <code>auth</code>. Add a file to this folder called <code>http.strategy.ts</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import { HttpException, Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Strategy } from 'passport-http-bearer';

import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class HttpStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {
	super();
  }

  async validate(
	token: string,
	done: (error: HttpException, value: boolean | string) =&gt; any,
  ) {
	try {
  	return await this.authService.validateToken(token);
	} catch (error) {
  	done(error, 'The token is not valid');
	}
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This provider will look for an injected <code>AuthService</code> provider to do the heavy authentication lifting. You can define the <code>AuthService</code> logic in a new file called <code>auth.service.ts</code> in the same folder.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as OktaJwtVerifier from '@okta/jwt-verifier';

import { ConfigService } from '../config/config.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  private oktaVerifier: any;
  private audience: string;

  constructor(private readonly config: ConfigService) {
	this.oktaVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  	issuer: config.get('OKTA_ISSUER'),
  	clientId: config.get('OKTA_CLIENTID'),
	});

	this.audience = config.get('OKTA_AUDIENCE');
  }

  async validateToken(token: string): Promise&lt;any&gt; {
	const jwt = await this.oktaVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, this.audience);
	return jwt;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This implementation of the <code>AuthService</code> using the <code>oktaVerifier</code> to verify an incoming token.</p>

<p>Finally, you can tie these two providers together in one module by adding a file called <code>auth.module.ts</code>.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

import { ConfigModule } from '../config/config.module';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { HttpStrategy } from './http.strategy';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  providers: [HttpStrategy, AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
</code>   

<p>The <code>HttpStrategy</code> and <code>AuthService</code> get listed as providers in the <code>AuthModule</code>. You are also importing the <code>ConfigModule</code> but that hasn’t been implemented yet. Go ahead and do that now.</p>

<p>First, add a folder under <code>src</code> called <code>config</code>. Add a new file for <code>config.service.ts</code>. The code for that follows.</p>

   <code>import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as fs from 'fs';

export class ConfigService {
  private readonly envConfig: { [key: string]: string };

  constructor(filePath: string) {
	this.envConfig = dotenv.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath));
  }

  get(key: string): string {
	return this.envConfig[key];
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The implementation here uses <code>dotenv</code> to read the parameters from the <code>.env</code> file. It exposes a <code>get</code> function that will get the appropriate value from the file.</p>

<p>Next, add a file to the <code>config</code> folder named <code>config.module.ts</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from './config.service';

@Module({
  providers: [
	{
  	provide: ConfigService,
  	useValue: new ConfigService(`${process.env.NODE_ENV || ''}.env`),
	},
  ],
  exports: [ConfigService],
})
export class ConfigModule {}
</code>   

<p>This module takes the <code>ConfigService</code> and packages it as an export. This makes it available for your <code>AuthModule</code> to use.</p>

<p>You can now create your controller. Open the <code>app.service.ts</code> and replace the existing code with the following.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  books = [
	{
  	id: 1,
  	title: 'The Hobbit',
  	author: 'J. R. R. Tolkien',
  	status: 'Checked-in',
	},
	{
  	id: 2,
  	title: 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?',
  	author: 'Philip K. Dick',
  	status: 'Checked-out',
	},
	{
  	id: 3,
  	title: 'Brave New World',
  	author: 'Aldous Huxley',
  	status: 'Checked-out',
	},
  ];

  getAllBooks(): any[] {    
	return this.books;
  }

  getBook(params: any): any {
	return this.books.filter((r) =&gt; r.id == params.id)[0];
  }

  updateBook(book: any): any {
	return book;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This file provides some stubbed methods for getting and updating books. Next, open <code>app.module.ts</code> and replace the code there with the following.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthModule } from './auth/auth.module';

@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
</code>   

<p>The only change here from the boilerplate code is the addition of the <code>AuthModule</code> as an import. You will use this in a moment.</p>

<p>Finally, open <code>app.controller.ts</code> and replace the code there with the following controller code.</p>

   <code>import { Controller, Get, Post, Param, UseGuards, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Controller('books')
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get()
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  getAllBooks(): any[] {
	const books = this.appService.getAllBooks();
	return books;
  }

  @Get(':id')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  getBook(@Param() id): any {
	return this.appService.getBook(id);
  }

  @Post()
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  updateBook(@Body() book: any): any {
	return this.appService.updateBook(book);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you are using the AuthGuard to ensure your user is authenticated. You have also defined methods for <code>get/:id</code>, <code>get</code>, and <code>post</code>. In your <code>@Controller()</code> decorator you have named the controller <code>books</code> meaning that your routes will be <code>books/GET</code>, <code>books/:id/GET</code>, and <code>books/POST</code>.</p>

 Testing Your NestJS Application 

<p>You are now ready to test your application. As I said above, I will be using Postman for the instructions below. But you can use Advanced Rest Client or another application to test your Nest.js application. You can even build your own React front end for it.</p>

<p>In your terminal, run the command <code>npm run start</code> to start your application. While that is booting up, open Postman. Start a new request and head to the Authorization tab. Select OAuth 2.0 in the Type dropdown, then in the Current Token section on the right, set your header prefix to bearer. Under the Configure New Token section, select Authorization Code (With PKCE) as the grant type. Next, check the Authorize using browser checkbox. Populate your Auth URL, Access Token URL, and Client ID from your Okta developer’s console as follows:</p>

 
   Auth URL: {yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize 
   Access Token URL: {yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token 
   Client ID: {yourClientId} 
 

<p>In the Scope field type in openid email profile and in the State field, put any alphanumeric string you wish. Click Get New Access Token and complete the Okta login. Once you have done that, click Use Token the Access Token should be populated automatically in the Current Token section.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the URL bar of your request, type in localhost:3000/books/ and hit Send.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should see the full list of books returned to you. You can further experiment with this by trying the URI <code>localhost:3000/books/1</code> or attempting to post to the <code>books</code> endpoint. You can also remove the access token from the Current Token section and see the <code>401 Unauthorized</code> message.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Nest.JS is an exciting framework that makes writing clean and scalable Node.js applications quick and easy. Combined with the simplicity and security of Okta you will be able to build secure applications in no time.</p>

<p>BTC Manager:&nbsp;Now there are new fintech and cryptocurrency initiatives on the horizon that are generating their own interest and attention worldwide. For example, a firm called&nbsp;<a href="https://jelafrica.com/about/">Jelurida Africa</a>&nbsp;is trading on the success of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abdcseries.com/">Africa Blockchain Developer Call Series</a>&nbsp;and building a bigger footprint for eventual rollout in more African countries.</p>

<p>What is Jelurida Africa? According to&nbsp;<a href="https://jelafrica.com/about/">its web site</a>, the enterprise “offer(s) guides to startups and established businesses both ones that have adopted the technology and the prospects which can be in multiple stages” and “engage(s) in practical and training for staffs in the organization or institutions on the new technology, how it’s being used and the benefits it offers for their company processes.”</p>

<p>It’s part of a movement to make cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance assets more a part of the financial webwork, not less, and to allow different financial ecosystems to coexist better together. As Jelurida Africa Managing Director Adebayo Adebajo&nbsp;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-nigeria-denies-it-has-placed-new-restrictions-on-cryptocurrencies-uses-debunked-claims-to-justify-new-directive/">says of Nigeria’s CBN</a>&nbsp;and its recent mandate</p>

 Ontology — The ONLY Decentralized Identity Partner for Binance Smart&nbsp;Chain <p>Ontology and Binance have a long history of cooperation and partnership that has generated benefits for both sides, none possibly more important the integration of Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Solution into the Binance Smart Chain. The symbiotic relationship sees Ontology, and ONT ID, as the sole partner for BSC in terms of providing a truly decentralized identity option and KYC user verification.</p><p>The recent explosion of projects landing on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is expected to be accompanied by a meteoric rise in the number of potential investors interested in Security Token Offerings, otherwise known as STO’s. A key variable that is addressed through Ontology’s partnership with BSC is the problem of identifying potential investors, and ensuring their identities are not only protected but also validated through Ontology’s Trust Anchor Gateway and overall Trust Ecosystem.</p> About ONT&nbsp;ID <p>ONT ID is a framework for decentralized identity, built on the Ontology blockchain and integrated with the Binance Smart Chain. So any user, developer, or project launching STO’s will have access to fully integrate the benefits of ONT ID and with it, decentralized identity, into their existing developments. Protected by cryptographic techniques, ONT ID provides any entity with a digital identity that is controlled by the entity through decentralization. The entity in question here can be a variety of things, including but not limited to individuals, organizations, or objets. This makes tasks such as authentication, authorization or performing audits much simpler while protecting the data of the entity being authenticated, authorized, or&nbsp;audited.</p> About ONT&nbsp;TAG <p>Ontology’s Trust Anchor Gateway (TAG) is a decentralization platform based on ONT ID which provides access to security features such as KYC (know your customer) and global authentication services such as Shufti Pro, IdentityMind, and CFCA to name a&nbsp;few.</p> How does this help&nbsp;STO’s? <p>For any security token offering on BSC, the most important aspect is being able to accurately and safely verify the assets held by potential investors, while adding a layer of anonymity and protection to their identity through decentralization. Some pain points in compliance requirements include verifying of qualified investors, cross-border sales of security offerings, and the duration of the qualification validity period for both the United States and the European union. In a normal STO process, the issuance, self compliance, fundraising, and working with technical issues can be both time consuming and difficult. Neither of which is conducive to a successful STO. But by integrating ONT ID and adopting the ONT TAG, any STO on the Binance Smart Chain can identify potential investors much quicker, and nudge them through the checklists smoother. Not to mention that this is a more secure form for investors to participate while having their personal ID protected through the decentralization powered by Ontology — the only partner who offers this service on&nbsp;BSC.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="https://ont.io/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">Ontology GitHub</a> / <a href="https://onto.app/?source=post_page---------------------------">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases?source=post_page---------------------------">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Telegram (English)</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-the-only-decentralized-identity-partner-for-binance-smart-chain-d531efbc569">Ontology — The ONLY Decentralized Identity Partner for Binance Smart Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

They bring a level of convenience to anyone who needs to access applications throughout the day to conduct business effectively and without having to enter credentials each time. So, it is not surprising that Okta, who’s the leader in the market, oftentimes uses the following tagline: “One-click access to all your enterprise apps—in the cloud and behind the firewall.” But, there is another slogan used by Okta that tends to leave me perplexed: “Okta is one trusted platform to secure every identity, from customers to your workforce.”</p>

   The Ugly Face of Yesterday’s CIAM 
<p>We all have multiple different personas. But before we put on our hats as identity “experts” -&nbsp; either as architects, implementers or vendors - let us start by simply being consumers.&nbsp; Consumers of online services for banking, e-commerce, education, entertainment, and more.&nbsp; And by thinking as consumers, we can all tell endless stories of poor user experiences with respect to using those services. Those poor user experiences are essentially putting an invisible barrier to entry to the applications and goods we wanted to consume.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one forgets how someone or something made them feel, and a poor registration, login or password reset journey, at best reduces the likelihood of consumer recommendations, at worst, you simply lose users which ultimately results in lost revenue.</p>
<p>The lack of a “digital fabric” is typically the root cause of those badly performing ecosystems.</p>
 Broad Requirements Drive The Need for an Identity Fabric 
<p>CIAM however is not just about the end-user experience. Obviously, the UI “is THE application” from an end-user point of view, but under the hood, there's an entire catalog of other requirements that are needed to make CIAM a success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Core elements of a good Consumer Identity Fabric are:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Functionality for upholding compliance (think GDPR for EMEA or CCPA for the US amongst others),&nbsp; 
 Multi-device integration,&nbsp; 
 Adaptive and contextual security,&nbsp; 
 Bot-protection&nbsp; 
 Fraud management checks at various different states of the end-user journey.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>Data integration and data access are also important things to consider and are likely to need the creation not only of new software components - either through development or procurement - but also new operational structures and potentially new teams to manage that new landscape.</p>
<p>Put simply, CIAM isn’t just IAM. CIAM is an outside-in view of identity as opposed to the inside-out model for employee IAM. Features are different, but so too are the non-functional requirements. Scale - for storage and throughput - will be considerably higher, as will geographical availability, support for different locales and languages and the ability to elastically respond to changes in service demand. Many of these overall needs would unlikely have been a priority if a CIAM project was not needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new requirements however are driving the need for a more integrated, extensible and accessible set of identity services - likely based on an API/SDK first approach. This is where the “fabric” model of identity comes into play.</p>
 Start With The End in Mind 
<p>So how can we make CIAM a success for the organization?&nbsp; The most simple approach is to “start with the end in mind” and by asking, what the CIAM platform is going to achieve for the business. In the identity world, CIAM is the solution most closely aligned to the organization's business objectives so it needs to be a priority for any organization going through a digital transformation and having their customers and partners in mind. It can open up new revenue streams, alter how business is conducted and provide a foundation for continued growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Stakeholders in the implementation process are numerous –&nbsp;typically the CISO, CMO, a digital leader, and various identity services leads are involved. So having a platform of distributed components that can assist them in their divergent goals is critical to making CIAM effective. By supporting services for a range of stakeholders we are moving towards developing a broader cross-business unit platform that can break down silos. This is exactly what an identity fabric aims to achieve.</p>
 CIAM Lifecycle 
<p>CIAM interactions really follow a cyclical pattern of interaction, from initial registration, through to secure login and contextual access, allowing consent and data management to take place seamlessly across a range of devices at a time of the users choosing. Throughout that lifecycle, we need to look beyond assurance and knowledge levels of those user interactions and should ask ourselves how a target service or application for the end-user can be provided in a way that encourages them to refer, recommend and renew?</p>

			 Eva joined the team six months ago as an intern to complete her graduation internship. 

		 
	 
              
	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Eva Gasyte and I am from Lithuania. Even in my childhood I was interested in banks and the financial world, so as a first step towards my career, I studied finance in Vinius. After this I decided to deepen my knowledge and get a Master’s degree, but I also wanted to gain some international experience, and so in 2019 I moved to Monaco and started studying MSc Finance at the University of Monaco. This month I am finishing my internship at Tokeny and I am about to start my professional career.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>As part of my studies at University of Monaco, I am required to do a 6-month internship. Luckily, I was noticed by Tokeny’s HR manager Radka on Linkedin as she read an article about me published by the university, in which I mentioned I am looking for an internship. She contacted me, and after a few interviews I was offered the internship. This is how Tokeny came into my life.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>The experience was great in a lot of ways. I like the team, my duties and the company’s culture. Tokeny is a remote friendly company, with people working all over the world. I’ve been communicating with most of the team remotely, but I feel very happy that some of those people became my friends, even though I’ve never met them in real life! During the internship I’ve had a very dynamic schedule – every day was unique for me, with different tasks, and therefore I’ve gained a lot of experience in various fields. Our offices here in Monaco are at MonacoTech which provides a very dynamic and innovative environment. The start-up atmosphere there is amazing. It’s a combination of such a challenging place, exciting projects I took care of and great colleagues that helped me to grow even more and gain agility.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I love traveling and discovering new cultures – it amazes me how many breathtaking places are on Earth, one life is not enough to see everything. Even in Monaco – it is one of the tiniest countries in the world and after 2 years I still find places here I’ve never seen before.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My dream is very simple – all I wish is to live a happy life. To succeed in my career, to have a nice family, and that everyone around me is happy as well.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I love animals, and if I could, I would provide home and food for all of them that are abandoned in this world.</p>

<p>By Miranda Grant and Grace Natabaalo</p><p>Platform livelihoods hold great promise for making work more inclusive for young women. At the same time, they also present <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">new expressions of gender differences</a> in opportunity, uptake, earnings, and the ways work intersects with other areas of&nbsp;life.</p><p>These tensions are apparent in a participatory <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">video storytelling project</a> carried out by Caribou Digital and Nairobi-based <a href="http://www.storyby.design">Story x Design</a>, with the support of Mastercard Foundation, in October 2020. The project equipped seven young women based in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda with mobile phones, video training, and mentoring, to enable them to tell us their own experiences of platform work over a period of two&nbsp;months.</p><p>The women — two web developers, a farmer, a carpenter, a motorcycle rider, and two social commerce entrepreneurs — told us how marketplace platforms have enabled them to challenge structural barriers such as access to capital, sexism, freedom of movement, access to ICTs, and personal safety. Some needed very little capital to start. Others could conduct the work from the comfort and safety of their home, which enabled digital platforms to provide an entry point into the world of&nbsp;work.</p><p>Some women also leveraged the fact that they already had a computer, internet access, and the requisite skills to perform their platform work; others pushed themselves to learn skills that enabled them to join a male-dominated profession. While the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted their lives, the women all fought to stay financially afloat and keep their passions alive&nbsp;online.</p><p>Despite these opportunities, the women’s stories also bring to light gender-specific challenges associated with platform livelihoods, like sexism and having to balance unpaid care work at home with platform&nbsp;work.</p> Breaking down gender stereotypes in the workplace Dathive<p>Dathive, 31, known as “Señorita” to her regular customers, is one of only two female motorcycle taxi riders on Uganda’s SafeBoda ride-hailing platform. Before becoming a driver, she has tried numerous other business ventures like running a mobile money business and a fashion boutique. However, none offered the potential profit of boda boda work. Joining this male-dominated sector means that Dathive has not had it easy; she sometimes had to prove that she could transport passengers well regardless of her gender. However, being one of only two female SafeBoda riders does have its&nbsp;perks.</p><p>“When I take a customer, I see that they are really very happy to ride my motorcycle. When we reach [our destination], and we negotiate the money, they give me a tip. We take a selfie, they call their family, their neighbors [and say]…come and see my driver, come and see who’s brought me.” — Dathive, SafeBoda driver,&nbsp;Kampala</p><p>SafeBoda has helped boost Dathive’s profile by popularizing her in the media, she&nbsp;says.</p><p>“I have been on TV, radio, and in the newspapers. SafeBoda did this so that people could get to know me and feel confident when I show up as their rider on the app,” Dathive says. <a href="https://youtu.be/QQdK1hVNVj8">Watch Dathive’s story</a></p><p>Sabina, 29, is also one of a few women in a male-dominated profession. She is a carpenter with Lynk, an on-demand labor platform based in Nairobi, Kenya. Sabina’s move into carpentry was thanks to a partnership between Lynk and BuildHer, a social enterprise that equips women in Kenya with vocational and life&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Sabina’s experience points to the types of training that might be needed to set women up for success with platform work outside of vocational training alone. She told us that the training she received taught her life skills and coping strategies that she could apply beyond her profession as a carpenter. This is worth investigating further if there is a possibility to help more women succeed on platforms by seeing what types of training they&nbsp;need.</p><p>“BuildHer taught me the basics of life skills, the career itself, carpentry and joinery, and how to cope with life.” — Sabina, Lynk carpenter, Nairobi</p>Sabina<p>After completing the training and employment program with BuildHer, Sabina began working full time as a carpenter for Lynk. She spoke of how hard it was initially when she had just joined the platform. “When you come to the workshop, [men’s] first impression is like, ‘Really? Like really, can you make anything?’” Sabina&nbsp;says.</p><p>She adds that Lynk helped to create an environment where she could thrive as a female carpenter. The platform played a critical role in further developing the skills she needed to be able to prove herself through her competence in the profession. The platform work has become Sabina’s passion and only source of income. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/sabina/">Watch Sabina’s&nbsp;story</a></p><p>After graduating from the University of Lagos with a degree in Chemical Engineering, Anastestia (Ann), 24, found it challenging to find a job. As she sent out job applications after job applications, a friend suggested she think more laterally. Having seen the success of some of her friends on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, Ann thought, “Okay, I can do this,&nbsp;too.”</p><p>When Ann realized that she could make good money as a coder, she began to teach herself the basics of coding. She is now part of a small but steadily growing number of female developers in Africa. <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/e358c23f-afe3-49c5-a509-034257688580/e-Conomy-Africa-2020.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=nmuGYF2">Recent statistics</a> show that only one in five developers in Africa is female. She quickly fell in love with the work and loves that she’s making it as a young Nigerian woman in a male-dominated industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/_GUOh_CZ9fI">Watch Ann’s&nbsp;story</a></p> Social commerce: An easy (and free) choice for female entrepreneurs <p>For platform sellers like Gloria, Mary, and Dorcas, social media sites like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and YouTube reduce the barriers to entering the world of platform selling. Women often face these barriers when setting up their own business or engaging in offline work, like a lack of capital and having to balance work with childcare responsibilities.</p><p>Social selling has provided Mary, 24, a young entrepreneurial farmer in Kenya, with the flexibility to earn an income while caring for her young son as a single parent. She already owned a computer and a phone and didn’t need much else to start her own YouTube channel, through which she shares farming best practices and promotes her mushroom and strawberry businesses. She cross-posts these videos on her Facebook page and then moves conversations with interested buyers over to WhatsApp. These channels helped her connect with buyers during the pandemic when the markets were closed. Mary is also looking forward to earning money from her YouTube channel once she reaches the 1000-follower mark, the minimum number of subscribers one must have before their channel is monetized. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/mary/">Watch Mary’s&nbsp;story</a></p><p>For Dorcas, 41, in Nairobi, platforms have helped her overcome the limitations of lupus that keeps her mostly housebound. She started by baking and selling cakes on Facebook and WhatsApp and has since managed to expand her home-based business to include shoes. She relies on her social networks and various Facebook groups as a low-cost means to find customers.</p>Dorcas<p>“90% of my sales are generated from Facebook. And then the few who do not buy, they give exposure. So, you find someone who will refer my page to someone else. So that’s how my business grows.” — Dorcas, social commerce entrepreneur, Nairobi. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/dorcas/">Watch Dorcas’s&nbsp;Story</a></p><p>For Gloria, 30, social commerce represented a flexible way to diversify her income, something that became critical when she lost her job just before the outbreak of COVID-19. While doing her full-time job, Gloria co-founded House of Penda, a Kampala-based company, as a side business selling fashion accessories through Facebook. It became her only source of income during the pandemic. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/kemi/">Watch Gloria’s&nbsp;story</a></p> The tension behind the flexibility of online&nbsp;work <p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">Some studies</a> have discussed the tensions of “flexible” platform work and raised questions regarding the expectations of women that it perpetuates, specifically in handling both full-time obligations in the home along with platform work. An ODI <a href="https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/resource-documents/women_in_the_gig_economy_final_digital.pdf">study</a> found that women gig workers in Kenya and South Africa identified childcare as the biggest challenge to their economic opportunities, along with work–life balance and the decreasing quality of their&nbsp;work.</p>Mary and her&nbsp;son<p>The women engaged in this project confirmed this tension. On the one hand, many of them talked about how platform work has offered a level of flexibility that enables them to choose when, where, and how to work. For Dathive, a single mother of four, for example, the flexibility that comes with her ride-hailing job enables her to head out early in the morning, drop students to school and workers to work, then return home in time to give her children breakfast and get them to school, too. She is glad that the money she makes from SafeBoda is enough to provide her children’s needs.</p><p>Four of the seven women in this project are single mothers. They talked about the challenges of splitting time between work and children on top of the responsibility of being the sole breadwinners for the&nbsp;family.</p><p>Mary, for example, explained how she needed to be online regularly to connect with her customers. She said it consumes a lot of time away from her&nbsp;family.</p><p>On the whole, despite the challenges, the platform experience for these women was positive. Even during the pandemic, they earned some income by doing work they enjoy through platforms.</p><p>However, the many unique challenges women face as they engage in platform-based work should not be overlooked. Platforms and policymakers should recognize the gendered aspects of platform labor and devise ways to improve women’s platform livelihood opportunities.</p><p>This year, Caribou Digital, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, will embark on a multi-country study to further explore the intertwining of gender in digital work, aiming to make specific recommendations for programmatic and policy engagement. We look forward to sharing more on this important topic.</p><p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJyLOKwzy59hX8paPYDHbfOg9mJ8J1jt">Watch all the videos from the project&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/womens-platform-livelihoods-balancing-the-opportunity-with-the-myth-of-flexibility-4b08cf05da44">Women’s platform livelihoods: Balancing the opportunity with the myth of flexibility</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Miranda Grant and Grace Natabaalo</p><p>In October 2020, Caribou Digital and Nairobi-based <a href="http://www.storyby.design">Story x Design</a>, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, embarked on a <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">participatory video storytelling project </a>that put 11 young Africans who earn their livelihood from digital platforms at the center of their own story. For two months, the seven women and four men in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda shared their experiences as platform workers and&nbsp;sellers.</p><p>A key theme that stood out in these stories was the prevalence of “side hustles” — money-earning businesses, gigs, or jobs undertaken in addition to a person’s primary business or employment. With personal needs and families to take care of, along with the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many platform workers and sellers have taken on side hustles in the form of additional platform work or the pursuit of off-platform ventures. Below, we share insights on these side hustles as shared through their video&nbsp;diaries.</p> 1. Hustling across platforms <p>Many platform workers and sellers operate across various digital platforms, also known as multi-homing. As singular platform work often fails to provide enough income, workers and sellers are driven to sign up to multiple platforms. Studies by <a href="https://fair.work/wp-content/uploads/sites/131/2020/12/Fairwork-2020-Annual-Report.pdf">Fairwork</a>, for example, have found that many gig workers still earn below minimum&nbsp;wages.</p><p>In early 2020, David, 28, took up a motorcycle delivery rider gig with Solar Taxi, a ride-hailing and courier company in Accra that uses solar-powered cars, tricycles, and motorbikes. David secured the bike on a hire purchase agreement and has to make monthly payments. To meet his payment target of $7 a week, David tells us he had to sign up to other platforms, including Wote, Bolt Food, and Enrout, on top of riding for Solar Taxi. But even then, David is worried that the money he earns from across these platforms is not enough for him to fulfill his big dreams, one of which is to start a&nbsp;family.</p><blockquote>“I stay online as and when a trip comes. I accept whether on Bolt, on Solar Taxi, or on Enrout. I accept them and then I run,” he&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>In Nairobi, Dorcas, 41, sells cakes and children’s shoes across multiple social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. In Uganda, Gloria, 30, does the same, selling fashion accessories through Facebook and WhatsApp. Although they are already using various platforms to help increase sales, they are both planning to set up their own websites as yet another way to reach more customers.</p><blockquote>“I want to set up a website especially for the cake business. I want to make it big but still, home-based. Because I have been asked by so many people if I can tutor them on how to do just basic cakes. I can go to where they are and then just maybe tutor or even take advantage of online and then just do either Zoom classes or Google class,” Dorcas&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>Even online freelancer Anastestia, 24, who is a software developer and still new to online work, knows that creating a profile on more than one platform pays off. She is toggling Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, and Freelance.com. She sees Upwork as her main hustle as it is where she gets most of her jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/_GUOh_CZ9fI">Watch Anastestia’s story</a></p> 2. “Double-up your side hustle” and move&nbsp;offline <p>Some of the workers also balance on-platform work with off-platform side hustles, using the flexibility platform work offers to run and set up other businesses.</p><p>On top of being a rider for three apps, David is also an independent delivery guy and takes calls from customers off the platforms. However, despite working across multiple platforms and independently, he is still looking for additional means of earning&nbsp;money.</p><blockquote>“There are bigger projects I want to do which this one cannot fund. So, what I will do is to add more avenues to make money so that I can actually see my dreams come true,” David&nbsp;shares.</blockquote><p>Peter, 35, drives for Bolt and Taxify in Nigeria. A few months ago, he invested what money, time, and energy he had left into a 2000-bird poultry farm. If COVID-19 has taught him anything, it’s that you need to have a Plan B. He sees the poultry farm as a more stable investment than his platform&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>“You need to double up your hustle. You need to look for strategies and ways apart from what you’ve been thinking. You need to think a step or two steps ahead just to achieve or get the pursuit of your goals,” Peter&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>In Nigeria, Okoli Edwin, 20, who runs a physical shop selling solar products, tried to expand his business online through Jumia and Jiji at the onset of the pandemic. He assumed there would be a surge in solar panel demand as people would be quarantined and in need of consistent power supply. However, what he had not accounted for was the stretched pocket of buyers in a strained economic year. Okoli said he went online to look for ideas on how to make extra cash and came across forex trading. Now, Okoli takes forex trading classes online and watches the markets through his phone for any potential investments and&nbsp;deals.</p><blockquote>“It got to a time where everything was just crazy — no more resources, we were out of stock, we couldn’t supply the customers. I fell down, really bad because how am I going to feed my family? How am I gonna do a lot of things? And so, I thought to myself, ‘Man, I had to get a side hustle. I had to look for another thing to do,’” Okoli&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>For Gloria, what used to be her digital side hustle has now become her only source of income. In 2019, she and a friend founded House of Penda, a social commerce store that sells fashion accessories through Facebook and WhatsApp. Back then, she still had a full-time job in brand marketing and considered House of Penda as her side business. When the pandemic hit, Gloria lost her job; she has, since then, focused on growing House of Penda. However, as it struggles to make enough money, she is now looking out for branding gigs and also applying for full-time jobs.</p><blockquote>“I told everyone that hey, I’m available for gigs. I’m passionate about brand and communications. Tell someone that you know someone, mention my name, and that you know someone who’s really good at this. That was my strategy, get gigs and hope to God that a job comes along,” Gloria&nbsp;shares.</blockquote> 3. The struggle for those who don’t have a Plan&nbsp;B Stanley<p>Workers who are not able to find or take on side hustles are fully reliant on the work that comes through the platform, leaving them vulnerable when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. Stanley, 35, previously a cleaner on Lynk, an on-demand labor platform in Kenya, relied on the platform as his sole source of income. In fact, as part of an incubation program, Lynk even paid him a monthly stipend and bonuses. However, despite its best efforts, Lynk was forced to halt its cleaning services a month into the pandemic, leaving Stanley with no work and no income. Stanley says this has taught him a lesson — “Have a Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, and even a Plan&nbsp;D.”</p><p>As Muthoni Mwaura’s Kenyan <a href="https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/12985">study found</a>, “The notion of side hustling is particularly important for understanding youth livelihoods in contemporary contexts” because it helps to understand how young people make meaning of themselves and opportunities around them in extreme socioeconomic conditions. Listening to the platform workers and sellers over two months has revealed how having a side hustle — whether working across platforms or juggling on-platform and off-platform work — is key to surviving and thriving across digital platforms.</p><p>However, this also points to the shortcomings of platform work, and should make us question if this work is really dignified. Should people have to frantically piece together so many sources of income to earn a living? Does this make platform work meaningful or fulfilling?</p><p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">Watch all the videos&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-of-young-people-in-africa-the-hustle-is-real-c566b3b3a7f9">Platform livelihoods of young people in Africa: “The hustle is real”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   The Growth of Artificial Intelligence in Identity Governance 

<p>Organizations are facing increasing pressure to provide employees and contractors with the right access to the right applications and systems at the right time. But how can they do this with their existing, manually-driven Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions and processes? How can security and IT professionals address the needs of the new remote workforce and its demands for access to new cloud applications and services? Combined with new machine identity types, accelerated DevOps/Agile development methodologies, and unplanned organizational changes, static IGA solutions and processes need to become more flexible, more dynamic, and more automated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the introduction of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga">artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into IGA</a>, organizations have a clear path to hyper-automating their existing identity governance solution and processes. By applying AI and ML, enterprises can further streamline and automate intelligence across all identity governance use cases, including access requests and approvals, access reviews, and role engineering. Here are a few examples of how AI and ML can<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga"> hyper-automate IGA</a> solutions and processes to help combat your organization’s entitlement creep problems:&nbsp;</p>

  Identify access risks across the entire organization and provide actionable insights to help accelerate the removal of overprivileged access 
	 Identify excessive privileges, orphaned accounts, and provide confidence scoring (example: low, medium, and high) in order to provide the right level of security risk context&nbsp; 
	 Enable micro-certifications, where only a small set of entitlements and roles are approved between annual or biannual certification campaigns 
 <p>While no new technology is 100% foolproof, the introduction of AI and ML capabilities into <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga">identity governance solutions</a> and processes provides organizations with the most promising way to address the silent access challenge known as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/what-entitlement-creep">entitlement creep</a>.</p>

 ForgeRock’s Modern Approach: Autonomous Identity&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">ForgeRock Autonomous Identity</a> provides real-time, continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility. The solution allows organizations to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">accelerate secure workforce access,</a> achieve regulatory compliance, mitigate risks, and reduce costs. By leveraging AI and&nbsp; ML techniques, Autonomous Identity collects and analyzes all identity data to identify security access and risk blind spots. The solution provides organizations with a complete user access landscape view – what good and bad access looks like across the entire enterprise. It provides organizations with wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access by providing enterprise-wide contextual insights, high-risk user access awareness, and remediation recommendations, such as the removal of overprivileged access, excessive permissions, and orphaned accounts.&nbsp;</p>

 How it Works 

<p>ForgeRock Autonomous Identity links users to entitlements at the lowest attribute level. The solution uses profile data to determine the likelihood that an individual will need an entitlement, based on how entitlements are currently distributed across the organization. By applying AI and ML techniques, Autonomous Identity can quickly analyze all your organization’s identity data and identify overprivileged access, excessive permissions, and orphaned accounts. All are key contributors to your organization’s entitlement creep challenges.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

 Why ForgeRock Autonomous Identity? 

<p>Here’s how Autonomous Identity’s unique and highly differentiated capabilities address entitlement creep:&nbsp;</p>

  Global Visibility: By leveraging AI-driven identity analytics, you can collect and analyze identity data (example: accounts, roles, assignments, entitlements, and more) from diverse identity, governance, and infrastructure data sources in order to provide enterprise-wide visibility to all identities and what they have access to, including over privileged user access. This approach provides your security and risk teams with contextual insights into low-, medium-, and high-risk user access at scale. 
	 Data Agnostic: ForgeRock Autonomous Identity works with all identity data types to develop a complete view of the user access landscape. By consuming and analyzing tens of millions of data points quickly, Autonomous Identity can predict and recommend user access rights and highlight potential risks. Total landscape visibility provides highly accurate models based on what good access should and shouldn’t look like, including excessive permissions. Unlike other “black box” identity analytics solutions that are based on static rules, roles, and peer group analysis, Autonomous Identity relies strictly on organizational data to develop an analysis that is free from bias originating from human-derived rules and roles that exist in your existing identity governance solution. 
	 Transparent AI: Unlike other “black box” identity analytics solutions, ForgeRock Autonomous Identity allows you to fully comprehend how and why risk confidence scores are determined. By visually presenting low-, medium-, and high-risk confidence scores together, security and risk professionals can contextually understand what key risk indicators were met and, more importantly, why they were met. For example, why are certain employee and contractor accounts orphaned? This AI-driven approach recommends risk-based identity governance remediation updates based on enterprise-wide confidence scores. 
  Eliminate Entitlement Creep with AI-Driven Identity Analytics 

<p>In today’s new reality, organizations have dynamic business challenges. They need a dynamic solution to help them achieve their business goals and grow the business. By applying AI-driven identity analytics, organizations can hyper-automate their existing identity governance solutions and processes, thereby eliminating entitlement creep. By detecting user access patterns – identity analytics can quickly highlight inappropriate user access. In turn, AI-driven identity analytics can automate the removal of high-confidence and low-risk access rights, lowering the risk of entitlement creep across your organization.&nbsp;</p>

 Elemental Chat — The First Holochain P2P App Released for&nbsp;Hosts  Leadership &amp; Org Update&nbsp;#25 <p>When we first began this project, we shared our vision for an Internet of peer-to-peer web applications that would give users the power to direct their own online experiences. We connected with thousands of people also inspired by the possibility of removing centralising powers built into the infrastructure so that humanity might vastly expand its creative and collaborative potential.</p><p>The launch of Elemental Chat in our Alpha test certainly doesn’t get all that done. But it is a real step towards realising that promise. Elemental Chat running on HoloPorts has no central database. Each person who is running the app signs their messages to their own chain and then automatically posts them to the shared database that is hosted by the other users of the application. This is the start of something. This isn’t simply the seed of an idea. The deep roots of Holochain and Holo have fully sprouted and are now growing and strengthening.</p><p>This rapid recent growth is demonstrated in the timeline of events that led us to the current&nbsp;release.</p>  15-Sept-2020<br> <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/a-big-leap-forward-for-holochain-holo-2efaaa54ed08">We shared publicly about Holochain RSM</a>  15-Oct-2020 <br><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-path-from-rsm-to-beta-1fdca3f581a">We shared our Path to Beta roadmap for Holochain RSM</a>  12-Nov-2020 <br><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/real-p2p-networking-coming-to-holochain-rsm/">We shared about the upcoming Networking features for Holochain RSM in the Dev&nbsp;Pulse</a>  27-Nov-2020 <br><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/networking-has-landed/">We announced also in the Dev Pulse that Networking in RSM had&nbsp;landed</a>  24-Dec-2020 <br><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/closing-the-year-with-elemental-chat-on-holochain-rsm-105f9eede19c">We announced Elemental Chat was released to Pre-release testers</a>  29-Jan-2021 <br><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/testing-testing-testing-and-some-goodies-for-developers/">We shared about rewriting automated test tools for RSM in the Dev&nbsp;Pulse</a>  10-Feb-2021 <br><a href="https://forum.holo.host/">We announced the release of Elemental Chat to&nbsp;Hosts</a>  <p>The speed at which we have been able to move since the launch of Holochain RSM is indicative of how quickly and easily others will also be able to bring new P2P apps to market. So let’s dig into what Elemental Chat is, what it is not and what it lets us do moving&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Elemental Chat is simply a proof of concept application. What we mean by that is that it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of popular messaging apps on the market today. You can create channels and you can send messages. You can also query the application network to see how many nodes are connected and how many people have the application open in a&nbsp;browser.</p><p>What you can’t do is limit what channels you see or follow, or send messages to only one person. You also can’t have reply threads, and in fact, the UI doesn’t even showcase all of the best features in Holochain. In this super-basic testing app, you see everything and can differentiate little which means a less than ideal user experience.</p><p>None of those wonderful user-friendly features are included with Elemental Chat, and that is intentional. We wanted an uncomplicated app with only a few features to avoid spending too much of our time testing and debugging a chat application, when our focus is really to build the underlying infrastructure that comprises the Holo distributed hosting platform.</p> A chat app differentiates Holochain from blockchain <p>Paul explained a few of the reasons why we chose Elemental Chat to release as the first distributed app for Holo quite nicely in the December 24 Dev&nbsp;Pulse:</p><blockquote>“First, we thought it would be more fun to test; second, we knew it would push against all of Holochain’s capabilities in ways that would show up any bugs; and third, we wanted something that would show us where the performance bottlenecks were.”</blockquote><p>But another important reason for us is because chat functionality illustrates the difference and potential of Holochain as compared to blockchain.</p><p>Releasing a chat app — even a toy app like Elemental Chat — demonstrates unequivocally that Holochain is designed for building classes of applications that could never really work on a blockchain. Think about apps where things like scalability, and speedy transactions or interactions are crucial for basic functionality. The vast majority of web apps that we use in our lives simply do not require the global consensus of a blockchain and in fact could be hampered if we try to force them into consensus models. Chat exemplifies this difference to us in the most natural of&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Imagine being at a party with 25 to 100 of your closest friends with people in small groups around a room chatting. Many different conversations are happening in the room simultaneously. You might be able to hear parts of many of them, but you are likely paying attention to one or two of them more than others. Each other person in the room is most likely doing the same — that is they are listening to the conversation they are having — not to the general humm of conversation in the entire space. Because of that, each person has their own unique experience of what is being said. I doubt anyone at that party would say there was something wrong with the way people were communicating. In fact — that very normal in-person multi-sensory type of setting is exactly what many of us have been missing this past year due to the pandemic.</p><p>So let’s talk about how a typical blockchain might try to model the communication at that party. One person (Alice) might say something. Another person (Bob) would need to process it and clarify to everyone else what was said and would record it and ensure that each other person understood it the exact same way. The first person (Alice) could not say something again until the first thing she said was processed by every person in the room. Some sort of order would need to be created for who was speaking because each statement would need to get placed in the correct order and shared with every other person in the room for the conversation to be deemed&nbsp;valid.</p><p>This sounds ludicrous — because it is. Consensus models are irrelevant for many human needs and when it comes to collaboration they are often extremely inefficient. With blockchains that inefficiency is evidenced in multiple ways but perhaps most explicitly by the extreme consumption of energy and creation of waste used to power the networks.</p><p>The reality is many applications only need to do two things really well: enable ease of coordination and reach eventual consistency.</p><p>Let’s take a look now at how Holochain’s natural patterns approach would model that same party. As you speak with a small subset of your friends, your messages are saved to your local chain. Your friends that are participating in your conversation would receive an immediate signal and hear your message. After someone’s message is saved to their local chain it is also saved to the group database or DHT. After a short while, your part of the shared database would get updated with messages from other conversations happening elsewhere in the party — and eventually you’d have access to all the gossip messages from the party. Sounds like a great and memorable party!</p><p>The use of natural patterns to model digital interaction is something that makes Holochain different — it’s why Holochain enables applications that can truly scale and why it’s ideal for collaboration. Holochain ensures agency for each user but does not require imposing a singular perspective.</p> How does Holochain work for currencies? <p>So we can see why Holochain is great for modeling a chat app, but many were expecting us to release the app that will run Holo’s cryptocurrency HoloFuel. People often ask “How can HoloFuel work without consensus?”</p><p>Imagine a bunch of parents in a community create a babysitting time swap system and have a phone app where I can credit you for three hours of babysitting, and my babysitting balance goes down by three hours when I do. Some people have provided more babysitting than they’ve received and they’d show positive balances of hours. Other folks who have received more babysitting than they’ve provided, would have a negative balance of&nbsp;hours.</p><p>If Alice needs to transfer some credits to Bob, do we really need global consensus? Do we need to know the state of every account in the system? No. Only Bob’s and Alice’s accounts are changing from this transaction, and they are the only authorities to make changes to their accounts. They can sign a single identical transaction to each of their chains (a transaction that shows Alice spending credits and Bob receiving them), and when they publish it to the rest of the network, others on the network will validate the transaction to make sure it follows the shared agreements. It is basically that simple. (Well it’s not quite that simple, but for a better understanding of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3yqYhJViCQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">how Holochain works, check out this twelve minute&nbsp;video</a>.)</p><p>This model for currency is more like peer-to-peer accounting of value, where your chain holds the history of your transactions. Not everyone is transacting in hours of babysitting but the principles of the model work exactly the same way when you replace babysitting with distributed cloud hosting as the service, and it will work that way for food, energy, and many other applications as&nbsp;well.</p> What’s Next <p>The release of Elemental Chat for hosts is an important step forward on the journey. For us though, the next infrastructure milestone is the one we’ll be doing backflips about. That is when non-hosts — regular web users — will actually get the experience of creating an account and logging into Elemental Chat that is hosted on a hosts’ HoloPort. We are already beginning the testing cycle for that milestone.</p>Roadmap<p>In the coming weeks, you can count on us to support more and more hosts to connect their ports to the Holo network and to begin chatting in Elemental Chat. We will be assessing how well the performance scales and listening to what folks have to say about&nbsp;it.</p><p>We will most likely make a few small changes to the chat app as we prepare for the wider release to web users. We will continue to evolve the testing framework so that it can be used more generally by hosted apps, not just applications we directly install on&nbsp;HPOS.</p><p>As we shared in the previous article, we are also moving forward on several of the other milestones that come after Hosted Elemental Chat. We may even be releasing the Host Console work simultaneously, but we are not promising that yet. After that, we’ll be focusing on the HoloFuel application.</p>Approx Progress on Upcoming Milestones<p>What isn’t visible from these diagrams, however, is the work on Holochain that is continuing to evolve and which is critical for both Holo and community application developers who are building apps in our ecosystem.</p><p>Holochain has been steadily improving usability of the framework. When we first announced RSM, though it was a vast improvement technically, we hadn’t started releasing to crates, nor stabilized the Holochain development kit (HDK). We have recently shipped a raft of breaking changes to the HDK which should be fairly stable now. We’ve also ‘nixified’ Holochain to make it easier to install and ensure identical installations among collaborators. You can stay current with the latest tested version via <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/">Holochain.love</a>.</p><p>In the coming weeks, there will be additional improvements to Holochain. Following the changeover of the database engine, we’ll be implementing sharding and other key network scaling features before we move on to more security and identity management features. All of these are foundations necessary for the Beta release of&nbsp;Holo.</p><p>So, I will leave you with yet another shout out to all of those who are supporting this amazing work coming into being. Kudos to the dev teams for bringing this release across the finish line. Kudos to the community-facing teams who are supporting hosts getting connected to the network. Kudos to all the app devs in the community pulling for new features and demonstrating how natural patterns work in Holochain. Kudos to all the admins and volunteers who share their knowledge with newcomers to the&nbsp;project.</p><p>In gratitude,<br>Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/title-elemental-chat-the-first-holochain-p2p-app-released-for-hosts-3e9f44bdcaca">Elemental Chat — The First Holochain P2P App Released for Hosts</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Bloom's CTO Isaac Patka recently gave a talk at ETHDenver 2021 in which he discussed the co-evolution of the DeFi and Decentralized Identity spaces; and how Bloom is bridging the gap between them. </p><p> Watch the full talk by clicking on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/909811905?t=05h30m09s">this link</a>. &nbsp;</p> Decentralized Identity &amp; DeFi are Disconnected <p>While the markets for decentralized finance and decentralized identity are both expanding rapidly with new and novel products, the two are still largely disconnected. &nbsp;</p><p>DeFi apps are increasingly built to be interoperable amongst each other mainly due to their adherence to a single common standard, ERC20. &nbsp;This allows tokens to move between projects to contribute liquidity to Automated Market Makers, be used as collateral for loans, or provide much needed liquidity to borrowers in return for interest. &nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, decentralized identity products and services are quickly maturing into its own ecosystem, with continued collaboration between service provider members of <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> and a quickly developing standard of interoperability through W3C. &nbsp;And yet despite fast maturing markets in each sector, few solutions exist to bridge the communication and integration between these two worlds.</p> Decentralized Identity is Chain-Adjacent <p>The beauty of the decentralized identity space is that it is built on blockchain fundamentals. &nbsp;While the identity record or credential itself is created off-chain, it can rapidly be brought on-chain and converted to a digital identity solution using technologies developed by a number of innovators in the space including Sidetree and Bloom. &nbsp;Existing open-source blockchain wallet technologies already support native distribution of decentralized identities (DID). &nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a>, for example, is a scalable DID protocol that enables interoperability with IPFS and any decentralized ledger system.</p> Bridging Decentralized Identity with DeFi <p>While decentralized identity systems can be said to be chain-adjacent, they need an intermediary to help facility the relaying of this chain-adjacent information to on-chain requestors such as DeFi applications. &nbsp;These intermediaries or so-called bridges already exist in many forms and can be leveraged to provide decentralized access to DID systems. &nbsp;Examples include Oracles, which can connect with data vaults to retrieve information specific to an individual user. &nbsp;NFT’s are another example, where unique attributes can be packaged within them and exchanged for specifically tailored services. &nbsp;Because of the rapid innovation that has occurred in the DeFi and larger blockchain space, the technology already exists to facilitate a complete ecosystem of interconnected products starting with digital identity verification to the rendering of decentralized finance products and services.</p> Decentralized Identity &amp; DeFi are Complimentary<br> <p>DeFi Has a Trust Problem</p><p> Popular DeFi lending apps like Compound and Aave have a trust problem. &nbsp;Because they collect no information on their participants, they are unable to make informed decisions on how much to lend, what interest rate to charge, and for how long the loan should be extended. &nbsp;Instead, they must treat all participants with the same level of risk, and thus require significant sums of collateral, in exchange for loans. &nbsp;This means that borrowers must already possess more than the value of cryptocurrency they are asking to borrow, making DeFi lending impractical for participants who own little to no cryptocurrency. &nbsp;</p><p>To compound this issue, regulations in the cryptocurrency space are quickly expanding and evolving. &nbsp;According to the FATF “Travel Rule,” Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are required to verify the identities of individuals using their products in an effort to curb the financing of terrorism. &nbsp;DeFi platforms are unlikely to successfully skirt these regulations based on the technicality that they are “decentralized.” &nbsp;While most operate in a decentralized manner, they are still subject to regulatory enforcement. &nbsp;For example, Compound has equity investors and therefore must have a base of operations and an entity to which these original equity contracts were signed. &nbsp;This means it can be subject to the same regulatory requirements that are required by traditional financial institutions. &nbsp;Thus, DeFi platforms like Compound are very likely to be required to adhere to Travel Rule regulations, necessitating eventual screening of participants.</p><p>Decentralized Identity has an Adjacency Problem</p><p>Even with the strides made within the decentralized identity ecosystem, including new use cases in a variety of different industries, their widespread use is still limited. &nbsp;The decentralized identity space is poised to deliver a myriad of novel solutions to the world of distributed ledger applications; but its dependency on decentralized apps that are still finding traction means it may take some time to find adoption.</p><p>However, the one blockchain sector that has proven scale and usage is DeFi. &nbsp;It has an immediate need and demand for decentralized identity solutions and is perfectly suited to be paired with such platforms. &nbsp;It’s immediate need from both a consumer demand and regulatory compliance standpoint means that it is an ideal first-mover fit with current DID solutions. &nbsp;Bloom is just one of the many decentralized identity management platforms that offers highly-performant solutions to bridge the gap between DeFi and DID systems. &nbsp;Other examples exist which we will discuss.<br></p> How Decentralized Identity is Being Used<br> <p>Health Data Passports</p><p>Currently the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is exploring methods in which travelers can move across borders freely without concern for further COVID spread and transmission. &nbsp;IATA has proposed the use of a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-23-01/">Travel Pass</a> which will contain testing information on travelers in a verified and secure way. &nbsp;Travel Pass itself is based on IATA’s OneID, an initiative endorsed by resolution at its 75th Annual General Meeting to help securely facilitate travel through the use of a single identity token. &nbsp;It is one of the first of its kind to retain passenger identity information on a device, specifically managed and permissioned by the traveler, ensuring privacy through a decentralized identity management solution. &nbsp;OneID serves as the base for Travel Pass.</p><p>Employment Information</p><p><a href="https://truu.id/">Truu</a> is an example of a platform that facilitates the simplified management of employment information through the use of a decentralized identity management system. &nbsp;It collaborates with regulatory bodies, central National Health Service (UK) organizations and trusts to provide a digital passport for healthcare professionals. &nbsp;It builds a comprehensive record that includes identity information, qualifications, workplace-based assessments, medical licensing, and employment information all as separately verified credentials. &nbsp;Truu enables employers to make fast decisions on employment without the inefficiencies in tracking down records and other documents or managing communications between a variety of different data sources. &nbsp;This is especially helpful in circumstances where rapid medical deployment is necessary such as in pandemic situations where medical professionals are being moved and employed between new job sites in any given day of the week. &nbsp;Credentials are held digitally within a professional’s mobile device ensuring privacy and enabling specific dissemination of information on an as-needed basis. &nbsp;Truu runs on Everynym’s distributed ledger technology and is a founding-member of Sovrin, a nonprofit organization enabling self-sovereign identity on the internet.</p> Credit, Income, KYC Data<br> <p>Bloom continues to set the benchmark for how digital identity can be leveraged by decentralized financial institutions. &nbsp;Bloom works by securing an individual’s digital identity information through receipt of verified credentials from an issuing body. &nbsp;From there, it allows an individual to interact with various DeFi platforms that request and require identity information on its users to provide specifically tailored services such as credit facilities or to simply pass KYC checks as required by law. &nbsp;Bloom’s DID platform provides several methods in which third-party applications can access DID data and isn’t specifically limited to DeFi uses cases. &nbsp;It can function wherever DID is needed, and the technology is expandable to support other use cases where personalized information needs to be made sharable but private at the same time.</p> Building Solutions<br> <p>Digital identity management systems enable DeFi platforms to perform KYC. However, in the spirit of DeFi, just as cryptocurrencies used to interact with these platforms are held non-custodially, the digital identity data can also be processed in a non-custodial manner. &nbsp;In fact, according to information provided by the original author of KYC legislation, financial institutions need not store a copy of information used to perform KYC, only evidence that such KYC checks have occurred. &nbsp;This means DeFi platforms can maintain the highest levels of security and privacy by reducing risks of “honey pot” hacks, while greatly improving user experience.</p><p>DID systems also provide a gateway to unsecured lending. &nbsp;They help transition existing CeFi users on platforms like BlockFi and Celsius over to non-custodial DeFi platforms, enabling the benefits of CeFi without its risks and drawbacks.</p><p>The industry is ripe for exploration with new use cases and innovations being rolled out regularly. &nbsp;If there is something you want to build at the intersection of decentralized identity and crypto we’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Contact: <a href="mailto:isaac@bloom.co">isaac@bloom.c</a>o</p><p>Telegram: @IsaacPatka</p><p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/ipatka">https://github.com/ipatka</a></p><p>DIF Banking &amp; Finance SIG: <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/finance-sig">https://lists.identity.foundation/g/finance-sig</a><br><br><br></p>

<p>IMPULSE (Identity Management in PUbLic SErvices) is an european project led by Gradiant – Research and Technology Organization (RTO) focused on connectivity, intelligence, and security technologies – and involving 16 entities from 9 different countries, including InfoCert.</p>



<p>The alliance will work on the concept of Electronic Identity (eID) – the way users can identify themselves (and be identified) through the network – and its implications in multiple contexts – through the use of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The current health crisis around the world has limited personal interactions, digitising all kinds of procedures. This brings a number of problems, not only for those unfamiliar with the complex identification systems on the internet, but also for those who are not comfortable providing their personal data over the internet.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in a world where it is increasingly common to carry out all kinds of processes online, avoiding fraud and deception is only possible with first-class technology.</p>



<p>InfoCert and the other 15 partners involved in the project aims to create a tool which combines two of the most promising technologies available today, such as Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain networks, with the aim of improving the management of digital identity and electronic identification in the public sector.</p>



<p>The application of these technologies in the field of digital identity will substantially improve the existing electronic identification systems at the time legal, privacy or social issues requiring further analysis may raise.</p>



<p>IMPULSE will incorporate advanced face biometrics and document validation techniques based on AI to facilitate identification processes and provide the user with a digital onboarding experience that is fully transparent.</p>



<p>In addition, blockchain technology and the use of smart contracts will allow adding trustworthiness in the process, providing mechanisms for users to demonstrate their identity without the need to disclose their personal data to third parties, a priori, not reliable.</p>



<p>The consortium, made up of partners from Spain, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland, Iceland, France and Denmark, is funded by the European Union with €4 million under the Horizon 2020 programme.</p>

Source: <a href="https://polkadot.network/">https://polkadot.network/</a><blockquote>Note: This article provides a general and slightly technical introduction to Parachains and indicates how to get started building a Substrate based blockchain which can be launched as Parachain in the Kusama &amp; Polkadot ecosystem. It will explain some parts of Polkadot but it won’t get too much into specific details like staking, slashing or other important mechanics in the ecosystem. Check out the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/">official wiki</a> to learn more about Polkadot.</blockquote> Status quo <p>First of all it is important to mention that the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parachains">Parachain</a> functionality is not live yet. This functionality is the last missing piece of the Polkadot <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-io/polkadotpaper/raw/master/PolkaDotPaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> and there is a public <a href="https://polkadot.network/launch-parachains/">rollout plan</a> available that provides an overview about the progress. However, <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/introducing-rococo-polkadots-parachain-testnet-e3e67fc40b56">since August 2020</a> the Parachain functionality is being tested in the official Parachain Testnet Rococo which in V0 only ran with prototype code. In December 2020 <a href="https://medium.com/plasm-network/announcing-plasm-network-parachain-on-rococo-v1-bf49b3f3ca53">Rococo V1 was launched</a> and recently Plasm Network <a href="https://medium.com/plasm-network/announcing-plasm-network-parachain-on-rococo-v1-bf49b3f3ca53">announced to be the first project that joined the Rococo V1 Testnet</a> which surely is a big milestone as the codebase of Rococo V1 will also be used in Kusama and Polkadot. Meanwhile other possible future Parachains like KILT <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/kilts-path-to-parachains-ad3be644db8a">followed and announced their own&nbsp;Roadmap</a>.</p> Kusama vs.&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Although Kusama can be seen as the pre-production environment for Polkadot you should be aware that Kusama might and probably will evolve independently from Polkadot. If your project is in an early stage or you want to experiment with Parachains in a real world environment before moving it into production you will probably prefer Kusama over Polkadot first. You might also be interested in testing specific features in Kusama which aren’t yet available on Polkadot.</p>Source: <a href="https://polkadot.network/">https://polkadot.network/</a> Relay Chain &amp; Parachains <p>The Relay Chain is the central chain of Polkadot. All validators of Polkadot are staked on the Relay Chain in DOT and validate for the Relay Chain. It has deliberately minimal functionality and its main responsibility is to coordinate the system as a whole, including Parachains. Other specific work is delegated to the Parachains that serve different purposes. All Parachains that are connected to the Relay Chain share the same security. Polkadot also has a shared state between the Relay Chain and all connected Parachains to ensure the validity of the entire system. Smart Contracts are not supported on the Relay Chain but can be supported by Parachains.</p><blockquote>It’s expected that each Parachain will be as light and application specific as possible and serve a specific use&nbsp;case.</blockquote>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06">https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06</a><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/the-path-of-a-parachain-block-47d05765d7a">The Path of a Parachain Block</a> it is described in detail how a new Parachain Block is produced.</p><p>You may notice the term Parathread in the picture above. The current (optimistic) assumption is that the Relay Chain supports up to 100 Parachains and some of these Parachain slots will be permanently reserved to serve the network on system level (e.g. Governance). Thus there probably won’t be enough slots available for all projects which is why they need to be obtained in a so-called auction (more on that below). Whereas Parachains get a guaranteed high throughput by bonding DOT tokens, Parathreads follow a <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06">pay as you go model</a> where a fee in DOT is being paid to validators for creating blocks. In some cases this even makes sense if there aren’t many or high frequent state updates expected (e.g. DNS, Oracles).</p>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06">https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06</a><p>Parachains can become Parathreads and vice versa as they share the same technical base.</p> Parachain Slot Auction &amp; Parachain Crowdloans <p>In order to become a Parachain in Kusama or Polkadot a slot must be obtained in a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction">Parachain Slot Auction</a>. Each slot duration is capped to 2 years and divided into 6-month lease periods. Parachains may lease more than one slot over time in order to extend their lease to Polkadot past the 2 year slot duration. Depending on the auction it might be possible that a slot is owned by 4 different Parachains during the 2 year slot duration.</p><blockquote>Parachains don’t need to always inhabit the same slot. As long as a Parachain inhabits any slot it can continue as Parachain.</blockquote><p>Parachain candidates can place bids in unpermissioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_auction">candle auctions</a> that rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_random_function">verifiable random functions</a> (VRFs) where the original mechanism has been slightly modified to be secure on a blockchain. The auction can be divided into two&nbsp;phases:</p>  Opening Phase  Closing Phase  <p>No matter in what phase the auction is, the bids are public. From the first block until the last block during the Closing Phase a winner will be determined randomly and nobody knows which block determines the winner until the Closing Phase is finished.</p><p>Projects will also be able to launch a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crowdloans">Crowdloan Campaign</a> with specific parameters which allows them to loan DOTs from the community to obtain a Parachain slot without having to bond all the required DOTs on their&nbsp;own.</p><p>In the video above core developer Shawn Tabrizi explains both variants very&nbsp;well.</p> Substrate <p>After giving an overview about the Polkadot ecosystem it’s time to introduce Substrate. It is a modular framework that enables you to create purpose-built blockchains by composing custom and/or pre-built components.</p><p>Substrate is the foundation of all blockchains in the Polkadot ecosystem and requires knowledge in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>In the Substrate Developer Hub (link below) you can learn everything that is required to get started developing your own Substrate-based chain.</p><p><a href="https://substrate.dev/">Official Substrate Documentation for Blockchain Developers · Substrate Developer Hub</a></p><p>A few important things to know about Substrate:</p>  The runtime of Substrate is referred to as the “state transition function” which contains the business logic that defines the behavior of the blockchain. You as a developer can define storage items that represent the state of the blockchain and functions that allow users to make changes to the&nbsp;state.  Substrate ships with FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities) which is a set of modules (called Pallets) and support libraries that simplify runtime development. Pallets are individual modules within FRAME that host domain-specific logic.  To enable forkless runtime upgrade capabilities, Substrate uses runtimes that are built as WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode.  <p>To learn more about how to perform a forkless runtime upgrade you can take a look at the <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/upgrade-a-chain/">official tutorial</a>.</p> Pallets vs. Smart Contracts <p>For people heading over from other chains and ecosystems like Ethereum it might be obvious that application specific logic is always written in Smart Contracts which in turn are deployed on the blockchain. But as you already learned the idea of the Polkadot ecosystem is to have different Parachains that are as light and as application specific as possible.</p><p>There are basically 3 possibilities to add custom logic to a Substrated-based blockchain:</p>  Write custom Pallets and include it in the runtime<br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/create-a-pallet/">https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/create-a-pallet/</a><br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/recipes/pallets-intro.html">https://substrate.dev/recipes/pallets-intro.html</a>  Include the <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/smart-contracts/contracts-pallet">Contracts Pallet</a> in the runtime and write contracts in ink! (Rust based eDSL)<br>- <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs/">https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs</a><br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/">https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop</a>  Include Frontier (Pallets that serve as Ethereum compatibility layer) to the runtime and write contracts in Solidity<br>- <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier">https://github.com/paritytech/frontier</a><br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/frontier-workshop/#/">https://substrate.dev/frontier-workshop</a>  <blockquote>Custom Pallets are the best choice if you are building a greenfield project that serves a specific purpose and needs to run its own&nbsp;network.</blockquote><p>Substrate already provides a lot of Pallets which you can combine together as needed, including your custom Pallet(s) in order to build a lightweight and unique runtime for your application specific blockchain:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/v3.0.0/frame">Default Pallets of Substrate</a> (Note: The link points to the v3.0.0 version of Substrate which was released a few days ago. Most tutorials are still based on&nbsp;v2.0.0)  <a href="https://github.com/danforbes/pallet-nft">NFT Pallet</a> (There is also a WIP reference implementation that showcases CryptoKitties on Substrate)  <p>I also discovered a <a href="https://marketplace-staging.substrate.dev/">Substrate Marketplace</a> where you are able to find different Pallets (at least the default ones) which you can include into your&nbsp;runtime.</p><p>If you aim to write contracts in ink! or port a Solidity based application from Ethereum over to a Substrate-based Parachain you don’t necessarily need to launch your own Parachain as there already exist projects that plan to launch a Parachain and include the required Pallets in their&nbsp;runtime:</p>  <a href="https://edgewa.re/">Edgeware</a> (ink! based contracts)  <a href="https://moonbeam.network/">Moonbeam</a> (Solidity contracts)  <blockquote>Note: To check out how Moonbeam works you can clone the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/moonbeam-playground">https://github.com/51nodes/moonbeam-playground</a></blockquote> Polkadot compatibility with&nbsp;Cumulus <p>When you have written (and hopefully tested&nbsp;;-)) your custom Pallets you need to make sure that you build a Polkadot compatible runtime that exposes an interface for validating its state transition and provides interfaces to send and receive messages of other Parachains.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-cumulus">Cumulus</a> is an extension to Substrate that makes it easy to transform any Substrate-built runtime into a Polkadot-compatible Parachain. It is still in development, but the idea is that it should be simple to take a Substrate chain and add the Parachain code by importing the crates and adding a single line of code. You can also dive deeper into that topic and learn more about the mechanics of Polkadot by reading the <a href="https://w3f.github.io/parachain-implementers-guide/index.html">Parachain Implementers Guide</a>.</p><p>If you have built your own Parachain and want to join the official Rococo Testnet you have to follow <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-parachains-rococo#rococo-v1-parachain-requirements">this guide</a>. The auction mechanism mentioned above is not active yet and Rococo is currently controlled by the development leads at Parity Technologies. For joining the network you have to run at least 1 Collator for your Parachain and 1 Validator node for&nbsp;Rococo.</p><blockquote>Note: Learn how to setup a local Polkadot network based on Rococo by following the Readme of our repository: <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/polkadot-local-rococo">https://github.com/51nodes/polkadot-local-rococo</a></blockquote> Final Thoughts <p>Substrate has a clean design and makes it very easy to build an application specific blockchain for everyone familiar with Rust. If you decide to run your own Parachain (or Parathread) you should also think about how to incentivise other players to run a Collator node in your network — for example by introducing your own network&nbsp;token.</p><p>Although Parachains are not live on Kusama and Polkadot yet we can already see many projects that aim to become a Parachain as soon as possible. It will be interesting to watch the battle of those projects to secure their exclusive Parachain slot on Kusama and Polkadot. Personally I am very interested to see how the auction mechanism works and which projects will secure their Parachain slot via a Crowdloan Campaign.</p><p>I am also looking forward to play around with the interoperability features that Polkadot provides when the implementation is mature&nbsp;enough.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> based in Stuttgart is a provider of Crypto Economy solutions.</p><p>51nodes is member of the <a href="https://www.parity.io/announcing-substrate-delivery-partners/">Substrate Delivery Partners</a> program and supports companies and other organizations in realizing their blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/kusama-polkadot-build-an-application-specific-blockchain-and-launch-a-parachain-524ff4560acf">Kusama &amp; Polkadot: Build an application specific Blockchain and launch a Parachain!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Join the growing list of forward-thinking companies and organizations across the globe who are actively building the future of digital identity. This is your chance to be a part of the newest and most dynamic network in decentralized identity technology, open for innovative developers and companies eager to bring their solutions to market.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>At Indicio, we’ve seen a rapid rise in demand for robust, stable, and professionally maintained networks to support decentralized identity solutions. It’s not a surprise: decentralized identity’s moment has arrived. That’s why we’ve been hard at work creating Hyperledger Indy networks upon which developers all over the world are building, testing, and launching their solutions. Powering these networks are Node Operators— companies and teams from around the world and from various industries who are designing and launching decentralized identity solutions.</p>
<p>What is a Node Operator?<br>At the heart of a decentralized identity ecosystem lies the distributed ledger— a distributed database made up of multiple copies of a ledger, hosted by various nodes. In practice at Indicio.tech, this means companies and organizations, together as a community, volunteer to run a copy of the ledger on a server that is under their authority. On the Indicio Network, we call these “Node Operators.” Together, these copies make up a verifiable data registry, from which credential issuers and verifiers can prove important information.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				  Set your solutions up for success by becoming a Node Operator 
<p></p>
<p>Be where the action is happening<br>We’re creating a community of doers, made up of companies worldwide who are creating digital identity solutions for use cases of all kinds, including banking, education, supply chain, travel, and humanitarian efforts. As a node operator, you’ll be on the frontline of the innovation, playing a leading role in this world-changing digital transformation.</p>
<p>Get access to resources<br>Node Operators are eligible to receive a complementary business support package for their first year in the program, including architectural guidance, best practice checks, an account-dedicated Slack channel, and a dedicated network engineer monitoring your environment and assisting you with your needs. We also help our node operators prepare their presentations and marketing materials for webinars and informational events.</p>
<p>Learn by doing<br>There’s no better way to get trained on how a decentralized identity ecosystem works than to play a critical role in the ecosystem itself. Supporting one of the nodes on the network gets your team a front-row view of how a network functions from the inside. We’ve seen firsthand how operating a node speeds up a company’s ability to develop and deploy their own solutions.</p>
<p>Take part in community events<br>Indicio hosts community events, such as monthly Node Operator sync-ups and spotlights, giving our Node Operators a platform to showcase, demonstrate, and discuss their solutions. We help keep our node operators up-to-speed by discussing new open source tools, improvements, network updates, and standards progress, as well as help them identify business opportunities. </p>
<p>Make identity simpler<br>The decentralized identity world can be daunting for newcomers and veterans alike. There are myriads of working groups, governance bodies, standards organizations, and cross-industry initiatives. While these all play a vital role in the development and adoption of the technology, they can often lead to “information overload” and distract your team from developing a refined, commercial-ready product. We’re here to help our Node Operators make sense of the tools and information available to them in the community, saving them valuable time, money, and resources. We don’t just talk the talk. We understand business demands and work closely with Node Operators to get to market fast. </p>
<p>Concerned running a node might be too challenging? </p>
<p>Our “Node Operator as Service” option can take care of your network needs, leaving you free to focus on building your identity solution and participate in the Node Operator community. Indicio can host your node on a service of your choice, maintaining it with business-critical updates.</p>

<p>Fission is working with Jeremy Ruston, creator of TiddlyWiki, to build a TiddlyWiki on Fission app and make the Webnative SDK available as a plugin to save and load TW content across browsers.</p><p>We’ve been working out in the open in the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">TiddlyWiki group on the Fission forum</a> for a couple of weeks, so now it’s time to welcome more people to join us.</p><p>The goal is to make it so that TiddlyWiki can easily run as an app on the Fission publishing platform. Individual users will be able to sign up and launch a new TiddlyWiki or upload their own. Then, they will have everything saved and portable automatically from any browser, including mobile, that's logged into their Fission account.</p><p></p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/introducing-flag-cat-tiddlywiki-on-fission-mascot/1578">TiddlyWiki on Fission Flag Cat</a>. Stay tuned for more images and stickers!<p>Fission’s webnative javascript libraries and app publishing platform are open source and built on open standards. We’re designing the system to be portable and easy-to-personalize for anyone--not just professional developers--so that they can launch a business around apps, themes, or other creative software experiments.</p><p>We want to work with TiddlyWiki creators who are making custom <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Editions.html">Editions</a>. The TiddlyWiki launcher that we’re working on with Jeremy can include any community Editions that people want to include, and we’ll be opening up the Github repo shortly for that.</p><p>And if you’re a creator that wants to build a business around a TiddlyWiki Edition on Fission, with your own supported app that 100s or 1000s of users can launch with a click and have their own custom domain, we’d love to talk. Our upcoming App Cloning feature is designed for this, and we’ll showcase this ability in the community-supported TiddlyWiki on Fission app so that you can see how it works.</p><p>We’re totally inspired by the TiddlyWiki community, and want to see what else we can build together. We're on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywiki">TiddlyWiki Google Group</a>, and please come by and chat with us in the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">forum</a> or <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Fission's Discord chat</a> if you have questions. If you're a developer, you can follow <a href="https://guide.fission.codes">Fission's guide</a> to set up your developer account and get started.</p><p>Please join us at tomorrow’s <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/fission-demo-day-february-2021/1442">Fission February 2021 Demo Day</a> if you’d like to find out more and talk live with Jeremy and the Fission team.</p><a href="https://lu.ma/event/evt-nHhXeNbXYwW4DW1">

Clubhouse is the end of a chapter, not the beginning of a new&nbsp;one. Photo: William&nbsp;Krause<p>Clubhouse is the belle of the ball right now. This is a pandemic story. This is a content creation story. And sure, COVID was a clear catalyst, but it was probably only a matter of time audio joined text and video in reaching this logical destination.</p><p>Facebook, Twitter, Mark Cuban, and I’m sure countless others have already gotten the&nbsp;memo.</p><p>As Ben Thompson notes, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouses-inevitability/">Clubhouse was “inevitable</a>”:</p><blockquote>Clubhouse, meanwhile, Silicon Valley’s hottest consumer startup, feels like the opposite case: in retrospect its emergence feels like it was inevitable — if anything, the question is what took so long for audio to follow the same path as text, images, and&nbsp;video.</blockquote><p>Also:</p><blockquote>The most obvious difference between Clubhouse and podcasts is how much dramatically easier it is to both create a conversation and to listen to one. This step change is very much inline with the shift from blogging to Twitter, from website publishing to Instagram, or from YouTube to&nbsp;TikTok.</blockquote><blockquote>Secondly, like those successful networks, Clubhouse centralizes creation and consumption into a tight feedback loop. In fact, conversation consumers can, by raising their hand and being recognized by the moderator, become creators in a matter of&nbsp;seconds.</blockquote><p>In other words, it’s not that Clubhouse ushers in a new chapter of anything — well, aside from the democratization, which itself is arguably a game changer. Rather, it represents the natural conclusion of the last cycle, in part due to audio’s stunted evolution during the period, now supercharged in a locked down&nbsp;world.</p><p>One telling&nbsp;fact:</p><p>This is a well-worn story, but one story it isn’t? It’s not yet a monetization story. It’s unclear how you seamlessly insert algorithmic ads into real-life conversations.</p><p>According to Ben, tipping is a potential path forward that’s been discussed, a path Twitter is looking to also&nbsp;take.</p><p>And so the rapid ascent Clubhouse has enjoyed is easy to understand, but it will run into similar challenges — perhaps greater — than all the other analogs from this past&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>All of which speaks to the need of Trusted Engagement.</p><p>That’s the story here, and like the pitter patter on Clubhouse, that story is being told in real-time.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a> — <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-ceo-floats-user-tipping-213724463.html">Twitter CEO Floats User Tipping, Exclusive Content&nbsp;Features</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a>— <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations">Mark Cuban is co-founding a podcast app where hosts can talk to fans live and monetize their conversations</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-wins-deal-for-creator-economy-startup-stir-at-100-million-valuation">Andreessen Horowitz Wins Deal for Creator Economy Startup Stir at $100 Million Valuation</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/attention-economy-after-trump-bfa0ef27-b10d-432a-a40a-6bb642424709.html">After Trump, the attention economy&nbsp;deflates</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-wechats-struggle-to-slow-down-tiktok-owner-bytedance">Inside WeChat’s Struggle to Slow Down TikTok Owner ByteDance</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouses-inevitability/">Clubhouse’s Inevitability</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a> — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/fan-subs">Fan Subscriptions | Facebook for&nbsp;Creators</a>  Via kiwipete — <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/brave-browser-the-passive-income-king-a5d78da848c3">Brave Browser, The Passive Income&nbsp;King?</a>   2. A reminder of Clubhouse’s old chapter challenges: <p><a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/clubhouse-china">Stanford</a>:</p><blockquote>The Stanford Internet Observatory has confirmed that Agora, a Shanghai-based provider of real-time engagement software, supplies back-end infrastructure to the Clubhouse App. This relationship had previously been widely suspected but not publicly confirmed. Further, SIO has determined that a user’s unique Clubhouse ID number and chatroom ID are transmitted in plaintext, and Agora would likely have access to users’ raw audio, potentially providing access to the Chinese government. In at least one instance, SIO observed room metadata being relayed to servers we believe to be hosted in the PRC, and audio to servers managed by Chinese entities and distributed around the world via Anycast. It is also likely possible to connect Clubhouse IDs with user profiles.</blockquote> 3.

It would also block Apple from making developers use its payment system for in-app purchases and subscriptions.</blockquote><blockquote>In Virginia, a digital privacy bill that’s supported by some tech trade groups and companies like IBM is set to pass and be signed into law.

					 <p>We <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/">launched</a> our newest API—the Provider API—last year as the first product built specifically for <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) providers. Providers are the organizations that bring together issuers, holders, and verifiers into a single ecosystem, generally under a single use case or family of use cases. They establish the rules around who is able to participate in their ecosystem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In verifiable credential exchange, as shown in the graphic below, instead of verifiers having to establish a relationship with every single issuer in an ecosystem in order to perform verifications, the verifiers establish a single relationship with the provider. If they can trust the provider, they can trust the credentials coming from any number of issuers in the ecosystem.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A familiar example of a provider is Mastercard, and within the Mastercard ecosystem, banks are the credential issuers (in this case the credential is a Mastercard credit card), consumers are the holders, and merchants are the credential verifiers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Provider API makes it possible for providers to create credential issuers and verifiers programmatically instead of one at a time. With the Provider API, any organization can literally become a SSI provider for their ecosystem. When the Provider API was first released, one of our users created 13,000 verifiers in a singles script! Unlike the Credentials API and the Wallet API below, the Provider API is a paid feature on our platform.</p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Ben Cronin, Managing Director at UBO Service. 
<p>In episode 39 of LTADI, Oscar talks to Ben about UBO Service and the challenges it solves around verifying Ultimate Beneficiary Owners, how UBO Service is leveraging Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) for KYC and enhanced CDD, and the Global LEI Foundation’s validation agent (VA) framework.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was very obvious to us that adding the LEI to that identification piece was very powerful because you’re really identifying and verifying the entity to a very high standard. By using data that we get from official government registries – adding that to an LEI just makes complete perfect sense to us.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Serial entrepreneur Ben Cronin founded GBR (Global Business Register) in 2008. GBR morphed into <a href="https://www.kyckr.com/">Kyckr</a> over the following years and Kyckr listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange in 2016, providing commercially proven products for the authentication of businesses globally.

   What is Single Sign-on?   Single sign on (SSO) allows a user to sign on with one set of credentials and gain access to multiple applications and services. SSO increases security and provides a better user experience for customers, employees and partners by reducing the number of required accounts/passwords and providing simpler access to all the apps and services they need.   &nbsp;

  <p>Today, we are going to build a simple web application that implements a to-do list. The backend will be written in Go. It will use the Go Gin Web Framework which implements a high-performance HTTP server. The front end will use the Vue.js JavaScript framework to implement a single page application (SPA). We will secure it using Okta OAuth 2.0 authentication. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>PS: The code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-go-gin-vue-example">GitHub</a> if you’d like to check it out.</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Go, Gin, and Vue Application 

<p>First things first, if you don’t already have Go installed on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, create a project directory where all of our future code will live:</p>

   <code>mkdir ~/okta-go-gin-vue-example
cd ~/okta-go-gin-vue-example
</code>   

<p>A Go workspace is required. This is a directory in which all Go libraries live. It is usually <code>~/go</code>, but can be any directory as long as the environment variable <code>GOPATH</code> points to it.</p>

<p>Next, install the Gin package into the Go workspace using this command:</p>

   <code>go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
</code>   

<p>If you haven’t already got Node.js and npm installed, you’ll need them to use Vue.js. To install Node.js and npm, go to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Downloading and installing Node.js and npm</a> and install them.</p>

<p>Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can now install Vue.js with this command:</p>

   <code>npm install --global @vue/cli
</code>   

 How to Build a Simple Go/Gin Application 

<p>We will start by creating a simple Gin application. Create a file called <code>simple.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, "Welcome to Go and Gin!")
    })
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s explain what this code does. The <code>import</code> statement loads the Gin package from the Go workspace. The <code>main()</code> function is the program entry point. First, a default Gin server is created with the <code>r := gin.Default()</code> statement. The <code>r.GET()</code> function is used to register code with Gin that will be called when a matching HTTP GET request is called. It takes two parameters: the URI to match (<code>/</code>), and a callback function that takes a Gin context struct as a parameter. The <code>String</code> function is called on the context (<code>c</code>), passing it the response status and the response body. Finally, the <code>Run</code> function is called to start the server listening on port 8080 by default.</p>

<p>Next, run the server.</p>

   <code>go run simple.go
</code>   

<p>You will get some warnings when you run the command above, which you can ignore for now.</p>

<p>Now, we can test the server using <code>curl</code>.</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>You should see the <code>Welcome to Go and Gin!</code> welcome message.</p>

 How to Build a RESTful Application 

<p>First of all, we will build the RESTful backend server. We will later add a Vue.js frontend and add Okta authentication.</p>

<p>We are going to make a Go module called <code>golang-gin-vue</code> which is the same name as the working directory. This will create a file called <code>go.mod</code> which defines the module and the version of Go.</p>

   <code>go mod init okta-go-gin-vue-example
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>main.go</code> containing the following Go code.</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

var todos []string

func Lists(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"list": todos})
}

func main() {
    todos = append(todos, "Write the application")
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/api/lists", Lists)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>This contains some enhancements from the previous program.</p>

<p>A slice called <code>todos</code> has been created to contain the todo items.</p>

<p>The function <code>Lists</code> processes GET requests and returns a JSON object containing the items.</p>

<p>The <code>net/http</code> package has been imported so that we can use the more readable <code>http.StatusOK</code> as a status code rather than the opaque number <code>200</code>.</p>

<p>The function <code>c.JSON()</code> serializes the structure into a JSON string in the response body. It also sets the <code>Content-Type</code> header to <code>application/json</code>.</p>

<p>The function <code>gin.H</code> is used to create JSON objects.</p>

<p>The <code>GET</code> function now calls the <code>Lists</code> function when the request URI is <code>/api/lists</code>.</p>

<p>Now we can run the server. The first time it is run Go will have to resolve the Gin library and add it to <code>go.mod</code>.</p>

   <code>go run main.go
</code>   

<p>We can test that it’s working using this curl command in another terminal window</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080/api/lists
</code>   

<p>You should get a response that looks like this:</p>

   <code>{"list":["Write the application"]}
</code>   

 What Is a Path Parameter and How Do I Implement It in Gin? 

<p>A path parameter is a URI with a variable part. Any part of a URI can be a path parameter. In our example, we can get individual entries using URIs such as <code>/api/lists/0</code>, <code>/api/lists/1</code> etc.</p>

<p>The implementation is quite simple. The variable part of the URI is prefixed with a colon when the URI to function mapping is defined.</p>

   <code>r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)
</code>   

<p>The implementation of this is shown in the <code>ListItem()</code> function below:</p>

   <code>func ListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    errormessage := "Index out of range"
    indexstring := c.Param("index")
    if index, err := strconv.Atoi(indexstring); err == nil &amp;&amp; index &lt; len(todos) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"item": todos[index]})
    } else {
        if err != nil {
            errormessage = "Number expected: " + indexstring
        }
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": errormessage})
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The name specified in the URI after the colon can be extracted using the <code>Params</code> function in the Gin context.</p>

<p>Update your code in <code>main.go</code> to add <code>strconv</code> to the imports, include the <code>ListItem</code> function, and add the <code>r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)</code> statement to the <code>main()</code> function so that <code>main.go</code> looks like this:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
    "strconv"
)

var todos []string

func Lists(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"list": todos})
}

func ListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    errormessage := "Index out of range"
    indexstring := c.Param("index")
    if index, err := strconv.Atoi(indexstring); err == nil &amp;&amp; index &lt; len(todos) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"item": todos[index]})
    } else {
        if err != nil {
            errormessage = "Number expected: " + indexstring
        }
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": errormessage})
    }
}

func main() {
    todos = append(todos, "Write the application")
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/api/lists", Lists)
    r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>The server can be tested running the <code>go run main.go</code> command and then using <code>curl</code>. Verify that the error handling works using invalid URIs.</p>

   <code>curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists/0
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists/1
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists/foo
</code>   

<p>Notice that the last two commands will display different error messages.</p>

 How Do I Handle a POST Request Using Gin? 

<p>A POST request simply requires using <code>POST</code> in place of <code>GET</code>.</p>

<p>Add the following statement to the <code>main()</code> function in <code>main.go</code></p>

   <code>r.POST("/api/lists", AddListItem)
</code>   

<p>The POST handler uses a <code>PostForm</code> method to extract the parameters, add the code below to <code>main.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func AddListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    item := c.PostForm("item")
    todos = append(todos, item)
    c.String(http.StatusCreated, c.FullPath()+"/"+strconv.Itoa(len(todos)-1))
}
</code>   

<p><code>main.go</code> should look like this now:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
    "strconv"
)

var todos []string

func Lists(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"list": todos})
}

func ListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    errormessage := "Index out of range"
    indexstring := c.Param("index")
    if index, err := strconv.Atoi(indexstring); err == nil &amp;&amp; index &lt; len(todos) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"item": todos[index]})
    } else {
        if err != nil {
            errormessage = "Number expected: " + indexstring
        }
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": errormessage})
    }
}

func AddListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    item := c.PostForm("item")
    todos = append(todos, item)
    c.String(http.StatusCreated, c.FullPath()+"/"+strconv.Itoa(len(todos)-1))
}

func main() {
    todos = append(todos, "Write the application")
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/api/lists", Lists)
    r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)
    r.POST("/api/lists", AddListItem)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>It is important to note that a REST POST request creates a resource on the server and assigns it a URI. The proper response to a POST is a status of 201 Created and the response body should contain the URI of the new resource.</p>

<p>The server can be tested using <code>curl</code>. Restart the server using <code>go run main.go</code> and then use the <code>curl</code> commands below to test it out:</p>

   <code>curl -i -X POST -d "item=Build Vue frontend" http://localhost:8080/api/lists
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists
</code>   

 How to Build a Simple Vue Application 

<p>A number of files need to be created to build a Vue application. The Vue client (Vue CLI) can create the necessary files for us. Let’s use the Vue CLI to create an application called <code>todo-vue</code>.</p>

   <code>vue create todo-vue
</code>   

<p>The creation process will ask a number of questions. Use the arrow keys to select the option required then hit the enter key.</p>

 
   It may ask if you want to use a faster registry: answer Y. 
   Please pick a preset: use the arrow keys to select Manually select features. 
   Check the features needed for your project: Babel, which is a JavaScript compiler, and Linter / Formatter should be selected. 
   Choose a version of Vue.js that you want to start the project with (Use arrow keys): select 2.x. 
   Pick a linter / formatter config: select ESLint with error prevention only. This will check for and catch common errors but will not enforce strict rules. 
   Pick additional lint features: select Lint on save. This will check for errors when files are saved in the project. 
   Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? Select In dedicated config files. Several small files are better than one big file. 
   Save this as a preset for future projects? select type N. 
   Pick the package manager to use when installing dependencies: select Use NPM 
 

<p>The Vue CLI will then create the project. This includes downloading components which can take some time.</p>

<p>Let’s see what got created in the new directory <code>todo-vue</code>. We will explain the content of the files in more detail as we build the application:</p>

<p>The directory <code>node_modules</code> contains the Node.js modules which are needed by Vue.</p>

<p>The file <code>README.md</code> contains instructions on building and running the Vue application.</p>

<p>The file <code>package.json</code> describes the Vue package and its dependencies.</p>

<p>The template for the application is <code>public/index.html</code> it contains <code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> which gets replaced by the Vue content.</p>

<p>The <code>src</code> directory contains the core Vue application. The entry point for the application is in <code>src/main.js</code> which replaces the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in the HTML page with the content.  The file <code>src/App.vue</code> contains the top-level Vue component. There is one component <code>src/components/HelloWorld.vue</code> which can be deleted as it is not required.</p>

<p>We will now simplify the file <code>src/App.vue</code>to have the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  name: 'App',
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>Let’s talk about what this does. The template element contains the HTML which will replace the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in the HTML file. The script element exports the application and gives it a name. The style element is self-explanatory and can be modified any way you want to.
We can now run a built-in development server to test the application.</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run serve
</code>   

<p>This will build the application and start listening on port 8080 by default. You can access the page by pointing a web browser at http://localhost:8080. If you are curious, the port number can be changed by setting the environment variable <code>PORT</code> to another value.</p>

 How to Add the To-Do List to the Application 

<p>First, we are going to add a placeholder for the actual to-do list. We need to modify <code>App.vue</code>. The style element will be omitted in the example as it doesn’t change.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
const appData = {
  todolist: "More to do"
}
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return appData;
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>So, what has changed? The template has been modified to add the list. The `` gets replaced with the contents of a variable called <code>todolist</code>.</p>

<p>There have been two changes to the script element. An object called <code>appData</code> has been added which defines the variable <code>todolist</code> used in the template and gives it a default value. The default application now has a function called <code>data()</code> which returns the <code>appData</code> object.</p>

<p>Now, run the application and point a web browser at it. You should see the text “more to do” on the page.</p>

 How to Combine the Web Servers 

<p>When a Vue application is ready to use it can be converted into a static website. Run the command below to do that:</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
</code>   

<p>This creates a directory called <code>dist</code> containing the static content.</p>

<p>Then, we change the Go server to deliver the static content. We will serve the <code>todo-vue/dist</code> directory as the root URI <code>/</code>. Modify <code>main.go</code> and add <code>"github.com/gin-contrib/static"</code> to the imports and add the following line to the <code>main()</code> function, after the <code>r := gin.Default()</code> line:</p>

   <code>r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./todo-vue/dist", false)))
</code>   

<p>Run the Go server with <code>go run main.go</code> and point a browser at http://localhost:8080 to see the Vue generated web page.</p>

 How to Make the Vue App Call the Server 

<p>The Axios JavaScript package is required to call the server. Make sure it is installed locally.</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm install --save axios
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to modify <code>src/App.vue</code> to make the Ajax call and render it.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li v-for="item in todolist" v-bind:key="item"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import axios from "axios";
const appData = {
  todolist: ["More to do"]
}
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return appData;
  },
  mounted: function() {
    this.getList();
  },
  methods: {
    getList: getList
  }
}
function getList() {
  axios.get("/api/lists").then( res =&gt; {
    appData.todolist = res.data.list
  });
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the changes. At the start of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, the Axios package is imported. At the end of the script the function <code>getList()</code> is defined. It makes an Axios <code>get()</code> call to the API. The response is a JSON object which gets transformed into a JavaScript object. The JSON object contains an object called <code>list</code> which is an array of item strings. The response is in <code>res.data</code> and <code>res.data.list</code> extracts the array of item strings that are assigned to the <code>todolist</code> variable.</p>

<p>In the <code>export</code> the <code>methods</code> object exports the <code>getList()</code> function as a JavaScript function with the same name which is visible to the application. The <code>mounted</code> entry defines a function that is called when the page has loaded. It calls <code>getList()</code> to get the list of items.</p>

<p>In the template, there is now an unordered list. The <code>v-for</code> attribute iterates over the array of strings contained in <code>todolist</code> creating a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element for each entry. The <code>v-bind:key</code> attribute makes the <code>item</code> variable from the <code>v-for</code> attribute a template variable.</p>

<p>Rebuild the Vue project, then start the server using these commands:</p>
   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
cd ..
go run main.go
</code>   

<p>Then, load the web page. A single item from the API should be displayed.</p>

 How to Make a POST Request from Form Data 

<p>We are going to add a form that enables a new item to be added to the list.</p>

<p>First, add a form inside the  <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag, just above the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> line in <code>App.vue</code>.</p>

   <code>    &lt;form method="POST" @submit.prevent="sendItem()"&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" size="50" v-model="todoitem" placeholder="Enter new item"/&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>The form contains a text input box and a submit button. The <code>v-model</code> attribute associates the text input with a variable called <code>todoitem</code>. The function <code>sendItem()</code> is called when the submit button is clicked. The <code>@submit.prevent</code> attribute prevents the page from being reloaded when the form is submitted.</p>

<p>Next, create the <code>sendItem()</code> function at the bottom of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the <code>App.vue</code> file:</p>

   <code>async function sendItem() {
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  params.append('item', this.todoitem);
  await axios.post("/api/lists", params);
  getList()
}
</code>   

<p>The function is made asynchronous so that it is non-blocking. The POST parameters are set using a <code>URLSearchParams</code> object. There is a single parameter called <code>item</code> and its value is the value of the text input passed into the variable <code>this.todoitem</code> which was defined by the <code>v-model</code> attribute on the text input. The POST request is made by calling <code>axios.post()</code>. The <code>await</code> makes the function wait until the POST response arrives. Finally, the <code>getList()</code> function is called to get the updated list.```</p>

<p>You will also need to add the <code>sendItem</code> function to the list of methods that are exposed to Vue. Update the <code>methods</code> section of the <code>export default</code> part of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag so that it looks like this:</p>

   <code>  methods: {
    getList: getList,
    sendItem: sendItem,
  }
</code>   

<p>Here is how your <code>Vue.app</code> file should look:</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form method="POST" @submit.prevent="sendItem()"&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" size="50" v-model="todoitem" placeholder="Enter new item"/&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li v-for="item in todolist" v-bind:key="item"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import axios from "axios";
const appData = {
  todolist: []
}
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return appData;
  },
  mounted: function() {
    this.getList();
  },
  methods: {
    getList: getList,
    sendItem: sendItem,
  }
}
function getList() {
  axios.get("/api/lists").then( res =&gt; {
    appData.todolist = res.data.list
  });
}

async function sendItem() {
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  params.append('item', this.todoitem);
  await axios.post("/api/lists", params);
  getList()
}

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>To test the changes: Build the Vue application and start the server using these commands:</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
cd ..
go run main.go
</code>   

<p>Then load the web page. Enter a new item and submit the form. The updated list should be displayed.</p>

 How to Add Okta Authentication to the Application 

<p>To add authentication to the Vue application, we first need to install two packages.</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm install @okta/okta-auth-js
npm install @okta/okta-signin-widget
</code>   

<p>To use Okta authentication you need to have a free [Okta Developer account] (https://developer.okta.com). Once you’ve done this, sign in to the developer console and select Applications &gt; Add Application. Then select Single-Page App and hit Next. The next page is filled in with default values, most of which are sufficient for this application and don’t need to be changed. Add the URL <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to the allowed Login Redirect URLs. Hit Done.</p>

<p>There are two pieces of information that you need to obtain from the Okta Developer Console. These are your Okta domain name and your client id. These values need to be passed into the Vue application. As these values are effectively secrets, they must not be hardcoded in the application. The way around this is to create environment variables in a file called <code>.env</code> in the <code>todo-vue</code> directory containing these values. Also add <code>.env</code> to the <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>

   <code>VUE_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID=my-client-id
VUE_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN=my-okta-domain.okta.com
</code>   

<p>PS: The environment variable names must start with <code>VUE_APP_</code> otherwise they will not be visible in the application.</p>

 How to Add Okta Authentication to the Vue Client 

<p>We are going to use the Okta authentication widget to log the user in. A successful login will create an access token that can be used to verify that the user is logged in.</p>

<p>First of all we will add a container for the login form to the template in <code>src/App.vue</code>, add the code below just above the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag:</p>

   <code>&lt;div id="widget-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to add the login code to the script section of <code>src/App.vue</code>, starting with importing the <code>OktaSignIn</code> object inside the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</p>

   <code>import OktaSignIn from "@okta/okta-signin-widget";
import "@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-sign-in.min.css";
</code>   

<p>Next, just below the import lines, modify the <code>appData</code> constant so that it can hold a token:</p>

   <code>const appData = {
    todolist: ["More to do"],
    token: ''
}
</code>   

<p>Next, update the contents of the <code>mounted: function()</code> with the code below. This code creates the widget and extracts the token.</p>

   <code>    mounted: function () {
        var signIn = new OktaSignIn({
            el: "#widget-container",
            baseUrl: "https://" + process.env.VUE_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN,
            clientId: process.env.VUE_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
            redirectUri: window.location.origin,
            authParams: {
                issuer:
                    "https://" + process.env.VUE_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN + "/oauth2/default",
                responseType: ["token", "id_token"],
                display: "page",
            },
        });
        signIn.showSignInToGetTokens({
            scopes: ['openid', 'profile']
        }).then(function(tokens){
            appData.token = tokens.accessToken.accessToken;
            axios.defaults.headers.common["Authorization"] =
                "Bearer " + appData.token;
            signIn.hide();
        });
        getList();
    },
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the code to understand what is happening. First of all, we construct an <code>OktaSignIn</code> object. It takes a dictionary as a parameter. The <code>el</code> defines the ID of the template element in which the login form will be displayed. The <code>baseUrl</code> and <code>clientId</code> are extracted from the secrets in the <code>.env</code> file. The <code>redirectUri</code> is set to the current page. This will cause the current page to be reloaded on a successful login with the required access token passed in the URL.</p>

<p>The <code>renderEl</code> method causes the login widget to be displayed.</p>

<p>The <code>.then()</code> function is called  on  a successful login. The access token is extracted and then set as an Authorization header in the Axios default headers. This means that the header will be sent on subsequent Axios requests. The sign-in widget is hidden once the token has been obtained.</p>

<p>We are going to validate the token on the server and return an error response if it fails. We need to modify the <code>sendItem()</code> function in <code>App.vue</code> to handle the error.</p>

   <code>async function sendItem() {
    const params = new URLSearchParams();
    params.append('item', this.todoitem);
    await axios.post("/api/lists", params)
    .then(function() {
        getList();
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        appData.todolist = [ error.message ];
    })
}
</code>   

<p>Build the Vue application, start the server and load the web page:</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
cd ..
go run main.go
</code>   

<p>The login form should be displayed. Log in using your Okta Developer Console credentials.</p>

 How to Validate an Access Token in Go 

<p>The access token which the client obtained is what is known as a JSON Web Token (JWT). To verify the token we will use an Okta JWT verifier. The Go package needs to be installed.</p>

   <code>go get -u github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang
</code>   

<p>First, add an import to <code>main.go</code> to load the Okta JWT verifier package.</p>

   <code>jwtverifier "github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang"
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>verify()</code> function to <code>main.go</code>.</p>

   <code>var toValidate = map[string]string{
        "aud": "api://default",
        "cid": os.Getenv("OKTA_CLIENT_ID"),
}

func verify(c *gin.Context) bool {
    status := true
    token := c.Request.Header.Get("Authorization")
    if strings.HasPrefix(token, "Bearer ") {
        token = strings.TrimPrefix(token, "Bearer ")
        verifierSetup := jwtverifier.JwtVerifier{
            Issuer:           "https://" + os.Getenv("OKTA_DOMAIN") + "/oauth2/default",
            ClaimsToValidate: toValidate,
        }
        verifier := verifierSetup.New()
        _, err := verifier.VerifyAccessToken(token)
        if err != nil {
            c.String(http.StatusForbidden, err.Error())
            print(err.Error())
            status = false
        }
    } else {
        c.String(http.StatusUnauthorized, "Unauthorized")
        status = false
    }
    return status
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>toValidate</code> map defines the values of the audience and client ID claims for the verifier. The <code>verify()</code> function looks for an Authorization header containing a bearer token. If the token is found then the verifier is called to verify the token. If the token is verified successfully the function returns true. If the token is not found then a 401 Unauthorized response is sent and the function returns false. If the token is found but does not verify, then a 403 Forbidden response is sent and the function returns false.</p>

<p>Finally modify the <code>AddListItem</code> function to call <code>verify()</code>.</p>

   <code>func AddListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    if verify(c) {
        item := c.PostForm("item")
        todos = append(todos, item)
        c.String(http.StatusCreated, c.FullPath()+"/"+strconv.Itoa(len(todos)-1))
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Build the Vue application—start the server and load the web page. Add a To-Do item and submit the form. You should get an error response. Login and resubmit the To-Do item to verify that token verification works.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The Gin package for Golang makes it very easy to create a web server. It is particularly easy to build a RESTful web server as there is a function for each of the request methods. A user-defined function is called whenever a request is received. Gin can also serve static content from a specified directory.</p>

<p>The Vue.js JavaScript framework makes it easy to build web front ends that generate dynamic content. The Vue client can create the basic directory structure and the files required for a Vue application. The files are validated for correct syntax which helps avoid hard to diagnose JavaScript errors. Vue provides a server that can be used to test development code. Building the code in production mode creates static content that can be delivered by any web server.</p>

<p>The Okta authentication widget makes the verification process very easy to implement. The OAuth 2.0 authentication process is quite complex. The widget hides the complexity securely. Once the access token has been obtained it can be sent to the API server in a header. The JWT verification process is very simple using the Okta Go JWT verifier.</p>

The proposed European <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-european-data-governance-data-governance-act">Data Governance Act</a> is another progressive indication that the EU is seeking to develop a more equitable digital economy. However, where we go from here depends on how the European Union is able to use the Data Governance Act to strike a balance between the existing tech giants and data platforms alongside an entirely new range of services designed to enable the collection, protection and exchange of data.




 




Currently, a handful of global players enjoy a virtual monopoly on the exploitation of data. Unlocking these data silos and regulating for data mobility and interoperability will provide the vital infrastructure required for meeting the challenges of the next century, including timely and informed decision making.




 




At <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> we believe that enabling citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data will ultimately lead to greater trust and personalisation, resulting in a more prosperous society. However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation such as the Data Governance Act and the digital tools to transform our connected society.




 




We believe this will lead to significant benefits to including personalised health and education, increased financial literacy and better financial decisions, more informed consumer choices which also contribute to protecting our environment.




 




Meeco is endorsing the Data Governance Act as a founding member of <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org">Data Sovereignty Now</a>; a coalition of leading Europe-based technology companies, research institutions and not-for-profit organisations. We are working together to ensure that the control of data remains in the hands of the people and organisations that generate it in order to play a key role in not only securing the rights of individuals over their data, but also providing significant stimulus for the digital economy.




 




Meeco is also a member of <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> and was amongst the first 16 organisations to be awarded the <a href="https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/">MyData </a><a href="https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/">Operator</a> designation in 2020. We join in the goal towards developing interconnected and human-centric data intermediaries to meet the personalisation and equity challenges of open digital society.




 




We welcome the regulation as a needed common ground for clarifying the role of data intermediaries, building trust in these intermediaries and setting the direction for data governance, including the emergence of digital human rights.




 




In this context we offer the following suggestions:




 




1. Explicitly include individuals as active participants in the definitions: define the key roles in data sharing (Art. 2 Definitions) so that data rights holders (data subject) and technical data holders (controller or processor) can be separated and acknowledge the type of data sharing where individuals are active participants in the transactions.




 




2. Clarify the scope of the data sharing services (Art. 9 (2)) and extend it to include services that empower the data subject beyond compliance.




 




3. Foster the growth of intermediaries, which offer new technologies and have the greatest likelihood of success in Europe if supported by the Data Governance Act.




 




4. Open silos and implement soft infrastructure such as standards &amp; open APIs to accelerate uptake and interoperability between data sharing services.




 




5. Foster eco-systems and demonstrate the value through practical use-cases. The EU data sharing ecosystem is formative; therefore, it is imperative to demonstrate utility and benchmark best practices that contribute to a more sustainable, healthy, resilient and safe digital society.




 




6. Create a level playing field for sustainable data sharing by providing funding to pioneers at the forefront of developing data eco-systems, this includes start-ups, scale-ups alongside established enterprises.




 




Included is a Meeco <a href="https://www.meeco.me/data">white paper</a> detailing practical use-cases aligned to our response, including the barriers the Data Governance Act can address to make data work for all.

<p>At first glance, account recovery might seem like a simple topic: just write a reset password function, send a challenge code, and you're done!</p><p>But, Fission’s commitment to prioritizing user control makes things a little more complicated. When the user is in control, how do we help them get back into their data if they get locked out? The main relevant factors are:</p>  We’ve designed our account system around portable account identifiers, called Decentralized IDs (DIDs)  Your account holds encryption keys that keep your private content encrypted and private only to you — even the Fission platform doesn’t have access and can’t see your content.  We wanted an account recovery system that was as trust-minimized as possible. Meaning, you don’t have to trust us, and you would require as few third-party systems as possible to help you out if you lose account access.  <blockquote>Oh, and one more thing: we wanted to do all of this without passwords.</blockquote><p>At Fission, being password-free is the default. Instead, we use technology built into modern browsers — including mobile browsers — that generates and keeps a private encryption key safely stored. This is called the Web Crypto API.</p><p>By the way, if you haven’t tried this yet, head over to the default <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission Drive app</a> and create a new Fission account. Notice that it asks you for a unique username and an email address, but it doesn’t ask you for a password.</p><p>To use your account on other devices — like your desktop browser, tablet, or phone — you get access by creating a key on your new device and linking it to another device that already has permission.</p><p>Now, the private keys built into the browsers on all your devices have permission to access your account and all of your encrypted, personal data — all without setting up or having to remember a password.</p><p>Apple is known for providing users with end-to-end encryption that keeps everyone, including Apple, out of any personal information. Fission is taking the same approach.</p> What about lost devices? <p>But what happens if you lose all your devices? Can you still get access to the encrypted content stored and synced online by your Fission account? Right now, the answer is no! We don’t have a copy of your key — and the Web Crypto API built into browsers is designed in such a way that we can’t get a copy for security reasons. If you lose access to all your devices, how can you recover your encrypted content? This is where Account Recovery comes in.</p><p>One of the design goals we have with Fission is to support a broad number of default use cases — we think this stuff should just work for everyone. We do rely on the most cutting edge browser standards, but we choose these standards based on the real world support available in all major browsers, including mobile browsers.</p> Using a single-device as a base case <p>Let’s consider the base case scenario of a person having just one mobile computing device — owning and using a single phone — meaning that losing that one mobile device means you’ve lost everything.</p><p>This is the common base case we need to keep in mind.</p><p>It’s crucial to remember that the typical software developer or early adopter is much easier to support: at least one mobile device and one desktop/laptop device. The private key stored on a desktop is much more likely to stick around for a really long time.</p><p>In fact, in some of our user research interviews, developers told us that the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">private key they used to securely connect to GitHub</a> was often on their machine for 5 years. Basically, the entire lifetime of owning the machine before they got a new computer and set up a new key!</p><p>But since that isn’t the deal for our single mobile device base case, we have to plan for account recovery process with just a single device to make the system accessible and recoverable by the largest number of users.</p> Splitting up keys <p>Our basic principle involves making backup keys and splitting them into pieces. We then store some of those pieces on the Fission platform linked to the user account.</p><p>The other half is stored “offline” by the user, as recovery codes.</p><p>When the offline recovery codes are combined with the pieces on Fission, it creates the complete key that can access the person’s account.</p><p>Because of our commitment to privacy, Fission never has access to the whole key.</p><blockquote>If someone breaks into Fission's database, there are no passwords and no secret keys to leak.</blockquote> Where should I store recovery codes? <p>On Apple iOS devices, basic iCloud file storage is built into the operating system — just like Fission accounts have the Web Native File System included. We’ll recommend that users download the recovery codes and store them in their Safari iCloud downloads folder — or somewhere else on their iCloud files.</p><p>On Android, the defaults are a lot more varied. Many Android phones have Google services built in by default, so we’ll recommend this as a similar approach to using iCloud in our iOS example.</p><p>Advanced users can store this file anywhere they feel comfortable - be it in Apple Notes with a password, printed out on paper, stored in their 1Password account, or even sent as a “Note to Self” in their Signal messenger app.</p>Signal's <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043272451-Note-to-Self">Note to Self feature</a><p>And in the future, based on the feedback, we may allow advanced security-conscious users to forgo the use of recovery codes entirely, allowing them to self-manage backup keys.</p> Get involved <p>You can check out the in-progress diagrams and notes of our <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432">Account Recovery design process</a> in the forum.</p><p>We’re not done with our design. We are still working at the level of security, systems, and cryptographic principles, as well as streamlining the user experience and the flows for users.</p><p>The code is being developed out in the open in the <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/dashboard">Dashboard code repository</a>.

  IDunion (formerly SSI for Germany) has completed the competition phase of the innovation competition “Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten” and is applying to the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (BMWi) for the next phase of the innovation competition.  The use of decentralised, self-sovereign identities for natural persons, companies and things is to be tested in over 35 use cases from a wide range of sectors.  The project involves 26 well-known public and private partners.  More information can be found on our website idunion.org.  



<p>Frankfurt am Main, 24 November 2020 – IDunion (formerly “SSI for Germany”) creates an ecosystem for decentralised, self-sovereign identities for natural persons, companies, institutions and things. In a partnership of renowned public and private institutions, a distributed identity network will be established, which will be managed by a European cooperative. The partners develop software applications and components, which leverage the the IDunion network and enable the allocation, storage and exchange of verified identity information. The use of open source software and standardised data formats will create a vendor-neutral solution and transparency as well as promote interoperability between providers, networks and traditional identity solutions.</p>



<p>A distributed test network is currently operated by 12 partners and will be available as a production environment for numerous use cases also outside the consortium from 2021. A detailed legal governance structure for the network has been developed with the support of the law firm Jones Day. In addition, extensive reports were prepared on legal topics, including the GDPR and eIDAS regulations, as well as on security aspects and a freedom-to-operate analysis.</p>



<p>In addition, various software applications were developed for both citizens and companies and tested in extensive user acceptance tests. Currently, identity wallets from the Main Incubator GmbH (Lissi Wallet) and esatus AG (esatus Wallet) are already available for end users to download. All partners are currently evaluating or implementing applications or use-cases for the further integration of the IDunion network into their existing systems.</p>



<p>The use cases touch on a variety of areas and target a variety of stakeholders including citizens, (public) institutions, companies and things. The over 35 use cases are divided into seven clusters: education, e-commerce/mobility, e-government, e-health, finance, identity &amp; access management (IAM) and </p>



<p>industry/IoT. The consortium is open for further partners or use cases and is happy to provide all necessary software components for further pilots. You can find more information on our website at: <a href="http://www.idunion.org"> www.idunion.org</a>.  
</p>



<p>As consortium leader, Main Incubator GmbH is applying together with the following 25 partners for the implementation phase of the BMWi-funded project “Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten”. </p>

<p>The Cambria project is an exploration of how to manage changing data formats and schemas in a decentralized piece of software. We had Geoffrey Litt and Peter van Hardenberg present the project, in which they were also joined by Orion Henry.</p><p>The project is funded and operated by <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com">Ink &amp; Switch</a>, whose work on <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">Local First Software</a> we often reference.

<p>The output of the project so far is an experimental Typescript library:</p><blockquote>…for effectively managing schema change in distributed systems.

 <a href="https://btcmanager.com/nft-2021-biggest-speculation-utility/">NFTs Are Set to Become 2021’s Biggest Hit – But Speculation Isn’t the Only Utility</a> 

<p>BTC Manager: Mythical Beasts of the World offers users the chance to purchase a starting deck of three digital NFT-based trading cards for just a few €. The project will issue a total of 50 individual cards, each one featuring the artwork of a mythical creature created by artist Ana Santiso, accompanied by a description of their cultural significance in their country of origin. There will be ten cards released per continent, with 30 available in the initial set and more released each month until there are 50 available in total. Cards will be issued in a limited number of copies and classified according to their scarcity as common, rare, or epic. Tarasca is using the Ardor blockchain to create the cards, so all users will hold their cards in an Ardor account and can trade their duplicates in the Ardor decentralized exchange. Although Tarasca doesn’t intend to create the kind of crazy speculation seen in other NFTs, the game developers believe that the cards will eventually be priced on the secondary market by supply and demand forces, with the epic cards naturally changing hands for higher prices.</p>

			 Security Tokens Get the Green Light in Luxembourg 
<p>Last week, Luxembourg’s regulator, the CSSF, adopted a bill that explicitly recognised the possibility of using distributed ledger technology for the dematerialisation of securities. See the market spotlight below for the panel I spoke on with the CSSF and some other friends.</p>
<p>The regulation is moving quickly across Europe: Tokenized securities now fall under the same rules and regulations as traditional financial instruments in many other European countries including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK.</p>
 What will this new bill in Luxembourg mean for tokenized securities? 
<p>The Bill is a continuation of the law passed in 1 March 2019. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after it was introduced we saw a surge in demand from financial institutions in the region. Curiosity was sparked in Luxembourg and in wider European markets. Most importantly, it gave market actors the confidence they needed to start utilising the technology operationally. In the coming months, we expect the same to happen across the industry due to this recent regulatory development.</p>
 How can market actors adopt the technology? 
<p>For market actors to adopt the technology and benefit from the automation and transferability improvements, they need to do so in a compliant manner. Control and regulation still need to be applied. Therefore, proven and open-source security token standards like the T-REX protocol are essential as they allow assets to be represented on the blockchain compliantly. They enable agents appointed by the issuer to exercise control over assets and ensure the securities can only be held by eligible investors.</p>
 What do we expect to happen in the year ahead? 
<p>We believe the regulation will give even more confidence to the financial services sector in Luxembourg and beyond. So far, Luxembourg has been one of the most proactive jurisdictions in Europe with its first law in 2019. However, this needed to be developed and last week’s law will bring more clarity and more confidence to asset owners. Real estate closed-end funds are currently the asset class that benefits the most from this new form of securities and we expect this to accelerate in 2021.</p>
<p>Due to the progression in regulation we are experiencing a spate of interest and projects from the fund industry. Our customers, WeInvest, Finimmo and Digibrixx have already begun building their projects, with more on the way.</p>

<p>Il World Science Report dell’Unesco ha definito la carriera professionale femminile un tubo forato in riferimento al fatto che, dopo la laurea, non tutte le donne proseguono il proprio percorso nel mondo del lavoro.</p>



<p>A livello mondiale la percentuale di donne impegnate in attività di ricerca non supera il 29%, mentre in Italia:</p>



<blockquote><p>La percentuale di donne ricercatrici varia molto in funzione della disciplina: in biologia, medicina, e in generale nelle scienze della vita i numeri sono molto incoraggianti. […] Gli ultimi dati sui livelli di istruzione registrano un numero maggiore di donne laureate (22,4%) rispetto agli uomini (16,8%). […] La percentuale di ricercatrici invece cala se si considerano solo le materie STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths), in modo particolare scienze matematiche, informatiche, fisiche, ingegneria ma anche scienze economiche e statistiche. In questi campi le donne hanno maggiori difficoltà nel continuare la via della ricerca scientifica dopo aver conseguito il dottorato o anche un assegno post doc.</p>Lucia Votano – dirigente di Ricerca emerita Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare</blockquote>



<p>Considerando questo contesto, InfoCert ha aderito con entusiasmo al progetto Sistema Scuola Impresa di ELIS: un progetto formativo rivolto agli studenti delle scuole italiane con un’attenzione specifica alle ragazze per il loro accesso alle professioni nei settori a prevalenza maschile.</p>



<p>Il progetto ha l’obiettivo di presentare a docenti e studenti dei modelli in cui potersi rispecchiare e in cui riconoscere talenti inespressi e percorsi possibili. Le Role Model individuate dal progetto, sono professioniste aziendali dimostratesi capaci di incidere nel contesto in cui operano con entusiasmo e determinazione.</p>



<p>3 dipendenti InfoCert laureate in materie scientifiche sono state selezionate per prendere parte al progetto in qualità di Role Model.</p>



<p>Alla fine di una serie di incontri di formazione, queste incontrarono gli studenti delle scuole italiane in una nuova edizione del programma, che nella precedente ha raggiunto oltre 18.600 studenti sul territorio italiano, il 97% dei quali consiglierebbe ad altri studenti di fare la stessa esperienza.</p>

It elaborated on the differences between JSON and JSON-LD and articulated differences between the two different implementations of ZKP style credentials. The ‘Journey of a VC’ section articulated all steps where VCs are active and highlighted the differences in how different VC flavors ’behave’.&nbsp;</p></blockquote> <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/decentralized-identity-inatba-roundtable/">Decentralized identity discussed: An INATBA roundtable round-up</a> <p>We pointed to this before it happened. It was great. Here is a round up from Jolocom. It is highly recommended.</p><blockquote><p>The paper <a href="https://inatba.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-INATBA-Decentralised-Identity-001.pdf">Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?</a>. Answering the paper’s core question of what’s at stake, it gives three essential scenarios:</p>  <p>Ideal – full convergence of SSI technology with interoperability by default.</p>  <p>Functional – partial convergence resulting in detached ecosystems.</p>  <p>Dysfunctional – no convergence and isolated, locked-in ecosystems.</p>  </blockquote><p></p> Blogs  <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/a-unified-theory-of-decentralization-151d6f39e38">A Unified Theory of Decentralization</a> <blockquote><p>The good news is that centralization isn’t the only source of convenience. As you will see in the discussion farther down, decentralized solutions for the problems of distributed systems are more robust and designed to operate in the worst of conditions.</p></blockquote> Windley Writes  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/passwords_are_ruining_the_web.shtml">Passwords are Ruining the Web&nbsp;</a> <blockquote><p>Passwords are ruining the web with awful, lengthy, and inconsistent user experiences. They're insecure and lead to data breaches. The good news is there are good ways for web sites to be passwordless. If you hate passwords, build the world you want to live in.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/persistence_programming_and_picos.shtml">Persistence, Programming, and Picos</a> -&nbsp; <blockquote><p>Picos show that image-based development can be done in a manner consistent with the best practices we use today without losing the important benefits it brings.</p></blockquote> About: PICOS <blockquote><p>The project name, PICOS, is an abbreviation of “Privacy and Identity Management for Community Services”. The objective of the project is to advance the state of the art in technologies that provide privacy-enhanced identity and trust management features within complex community-supporting services that are built on Next Generation Networks and delivered by multiple communication service providers. The approach taken by the project is to research, develop, build trial and evaluate an open, privacy-respecting, trust-enabling identity management platform that supports the provision of community services by mobile communication service providers.</p><p>Learn more about the <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Motivation.181.0.html">motivation</a>, the <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Objectives.182.0.html">objectives</a>, <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Tasks.183.0.html">tasks</a> and <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Achievements.190.0.html">achievements</a> of PICOS, and get to know the PICOS exemplary <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Communities.184.0.html">communities</a>.</p></blockquote> Kaliya has <a href="https://identitywoman.net/two-exciting-new-roles/">two cool new jobs.</a> <p>Working as the Ecosystems Director at Covid Credentials Initiative and heading the <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/verifiable-credentials-policy-commi">Verifiable Credentials Policy Committee</a> of the Blockchain Advocacy Committee.&nbsp;</p><blockquote></blockquote> Organization News  <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/jolocoms-contributions-to-dif/">Jolocom’s latest contributions to DIF</a>  <a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252814dd-44ff-4dd6-b8f9-49d94408678e_1500x867.png"></a> <p>Over the course of 2020,&nbsp;</p>  <p>Jolocom added support for an <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">off-chain element based on KERI</a>.

(KERI is currently being worked on in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/identifiers-discovery.html">Decentralized Identity Foundation’s Identifiers and Discovery Working Group</a>,)</p></blockquote>  <p>We at Jolocom strongly believe that DIDComm is a crucial infrastructure element for the broader and future-proof SSI stack, and <a href="http://github.com/jolocom/didcomm-rs">current work on DIDComm v2 includes Jolocom’s implementation of the specification</a> with authcrypt (authenticated encrypted) and most of the low level of the protocol.</p>   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaNvIorKQ9I&amp;feature=youtu.be">DIF F2FJan21 - DIDComm Demo Session with Ivan Temchenko, Tobias Looker, and Oliver Terbu</a> <p>During the live demo he showed the message lifecycle in various setups using the new, <a href="http://github.com/jolocom/didcomm-rs">open source didcomm-rs library</a> on GitHub</p> Sovrin ANN: <a href="https://medium.com/@sovrinid/promoting-banking-for-all-announcing-the-compliance-inclusive-finance-working-group-cifwg-340633ef3e6c">Compliance &amp; Inclusive Finance Working Group (CIFWG)</a> <blockquote><p>Since 2019, Sovrin has hosted the Compliance and Payments Task Force (CPTF), an open group of traditional bank and non-bank financial institutions, regulators, policymakers, technologists, ethicists, and legal experts.

But, the inconsistent use of standards and varying implementations have already led to confusion and public concern. An effort coordinated at the federal level would lead most quickly to uniform adoption and true inter-state and cross-domain interoperability.</p><p>LFPH and our partner organizations are ready to collaborate with you on this.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://digitalscot.net/covid-vaccinations-data-donor-proposal/">Covid Vaccinations ‘Data Donor’ Program</a> – A Proposal for the Scottish Government <blockquote><blockquote><p>“The Scottish Government must invest in data, digital and technology in health and social care to help Scotland recover from Covid-19. Closing the data gap in the sector could be worth £800m a year and deliver savings of £5.4bn to NHS Scotland. SCD said better data would help to build resilience against future public health challenges, which in turn will drive a healthy economy.” - <a href="https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/scotland-urged-close-healthcare-%E2%80%98data-gap%E2%80%99">Scottish Council for Development and Industry</a></p></blockquote><p>Our solution provides a platform for achieving exactly this, both in terms of equipping Scotland with a powerful integrated data environment and also through a framework where developers can further build on this with other apps for a myriad of other use cases.

<p>Hundreds of millions of cards have been stolen from online retailers, banks and payments companies before being sold for cryptocurrency on dozens of online marketplaces. According to Elliptic’s analysis, the founder of one of the most popular carding marketplaces, Joker’s Stash, has retired having amassed a fortune of over $1 billion.</p> 
<p>Every time you make a purchase with a credit or debit card, your card details are transmitted and stored in computer systems. Many of the major hacks of retailers and other companies are motivated by getting hold of these card credentials.</p> 
<p>Stolen cards have value because they can be used to purchase high-value items or gift cards, which can then be resold for cash. This process is known as “carding”, and has become a key part of the cybercriminal’s playbook. Carding is very profitable in its own right, but it is also used to help launder and cash-out cryptocurrency obtained through other types of cybercrime.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Joker’s Stash - the King of Carding</p> 
<p>Over the past six years, Joker’s Stash rose to become the largest online seller of stolen credit cards and identity data. It is an example of a carding AVC (automated vending cart), which allows large volumes of cards to be sorted, filtered and purchased for Bitcoin with immediate delivery. In the image below you can see these cards categorised and searchable by country, bank, expiry date and other attributes. The going price for a single card on Joker’s Stash ranges from $1 to $150, with those at the upper end coming complete with the cardholder’s name, address and social security number.</p>

 What We’re Building in 2021, and&nbsp;Why  Summary <p>This post describes <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean’s</a> 2021 product roadmap. It reflects our shift from achieving early product-market fit (0 →1), to that of traction (1 →N). The roadmap includes fixing gas costs via multiple chains, Data Farming to further incentivize data consumption, fine-grained permissions, and streaming data services. There will be continued improvements in the core Ocean developer tools, Ocean Market, and OceanDAO.</p>Ocean 2021 Roadmap&nbsp;Summary Outline <p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. We describe Ocean’s maturation from targeting product-market fit (0→1) towards traction (1→N). We then describe how we think about traction, then drill down in further and further detail from key performance indicators, to traction hypotheses, and finally to the 2021 product roadmap by quarter. Let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> From 0→ 1 (The&nbsp;Past) <p>From Ocean’s inception until the end of 2020, the focus for Ocean was getting product-market fit (“0 → 1”) around <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">unlocking data</a> [1]. In early 2020, we published our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">2020 roadmap</a>, and by the end of 2020 we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-in-2020-c5297e73584f">had met&nbsp;it</a>.</p><p>Let’s review the major items. In fall 2020, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v3-is-now-live-b47c0e73f52a">released</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">Ocean V3</a>. It was a huge release for us. It included two products to publish / buy / consume / stake on datasets / services:</p>  <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market webapp</a> — for data publishers, consumers, and&nbsp;stakers  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean developer tools</a> — core software libraries &amp; contracts for developers to integrate with other apps or build wholly new&nbsp;apps  <p>In Dec 2020, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">released</a>:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">OceanDAO</a> — a community-curated grants DAO for growth &amp; long-term sustainability.  <p>The reception to all three products has been enthusiastic. There are tens of teams building on Ocean core software, Ocean Market has hundreds of datasets with more than €5M TVL [2], and OceanDAO has a steady cadence of monthly funding cycles to teams which promise positive value. There’s also steady chat in Telegram and Discord channels surrounding all three products, and a vibrant weekly videochat town&nbsp;hall.</p><p>The most important outcome was: People started to treat data as an&nbsp;asset.</p><p>We’d designed for this, by wrapping each dataset as an ERC20 token (datatoken), for use in DeFi. MetaMask became a data wallet, and Balancer a data DEX. People launched new data assets as Initial Data Offerings. People bought data assets not just to consume, but also to speculate. People staked on data AMM pools, not just to curate but also to provide liquidity. The perennial question “how do you price data?” got answered definitively: the market prices the data. Trading volume is over 100 times the consume volume; this is a good thing because trading and liquidity are preconditions for markets to form. We just witnessed the birth of the open Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p> To 1→ N (The&nbsp;Future) <p>In short, Ocean has a first toehold in product-market fit (“0→1”). Data is being treated as an asset; this is the foundation going forward. Many users are able to get real value from Ocean’s core product offerings. There’s still room to improve each of these products, for more users. Let’s focus on “more users”. The overall goal is ubiquity — we want Ocean to be used everywhere as key IT infrastructure for the planet, side-by-side with DNS, Bitcoin, and other emerging blockchains and protocols. To achieve ubiquity, we need sustained growth over long periods of time. The label ”traction” encapsulates the goal of growth over time. Therefore the focus for Ocean from 2021 onwards is traction (“1→ N”). Importantly, $OCEAN is <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">engineered</a> to grow as traction&nbsp;grows.</p><p>We’ve already started on the traction path, by having rapid iterations with users, to get feedback and translate that into improvements in each of the products (and all the planning, design, construction, etc that happens in between). For example, Ocean Market has seen remarkable evolution in just the few months it’s been live, due to these rapid cycles — from bug fixes to handling fraudulent actors to better-aligning incentives of publishers with&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>That’s a near-term approach to improve traction. We can structure this more rigorously for longer time&nbsp;periods.</p> Ocean Traction&nbsp;Strategy <p>Here’s our traction strategy (inspired by the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369">Traction</a>):</p>  Have target key performance indicators (KPIs)  Have hypotheses of how to grow those&nbsp;KPIs  Try the most promising hypotheses, and observe how they&nbsp;do  Double down on the hypotheses that do the best and prune the&nbsp;rest.  Once those experience diminishing returns, repeat the process with new hypotheses  <p>The next three sections outline (i) the KPIs, (ii) hypotheses, and (iii) specific plans respectively.</p> 2021 KPIs <p>In Dec 2020 and early Jan 2021, the Ocean core team met several times for planning 2021. Traction was the name of the&nbsp;game.</p><p>The following traction-oriented KPIs emerged. We aim to grow each of these indicators.</p><p>Data consumer/provider traction</p>  Value of data consumed in USD. This is particularly important — it’s a good indicator of value being created in this new data&nbsp;economy  Number of datasets / services&nbsp;offered  <p>Staking &amp; DeFi traction:</p>  Total Value Locked of OCEAN &amp; datatokens  Number of DeFi protocols with OCEAN &amp; datatokens as first-class citizens  <p>Developer &amp; community traction:</p>  Number of active high-quality dapps using&nbsp;Ocean  Number of GitHub contributors, external maintainers &amp; support, active ambassadors  Number of community members, and content&nbsp;creators  Value of monthly grants distributed by OceanDAO, while retaining quality  <p>Enterprise/government traction:</p>  Number of engagements. Specifically, for a dedicated handful of partners, maximize their success towards real-world production deployment   2021 Traction Hypotheses <p>With these KPIs in hand, we brainstormed on hypotheses of ways to drive them. (And of course we also included many ideas from the past too.) There were many great ideas! We then filtered to our favorites. Here’s the distillation of that, grouped according to three pillars: (I) Bottom-up, (II) Top-down, and (III) DeFi. Let’s elaborate on each&nbsp;pillar.</p><p>I. Bottom-up: Ocean Market users, developers, startups. Main activities:</p>  Drive growth of Ocean Market. Improve user experience (UX), including reducing gas costs. Further optimize incentive structure. Add virality. Help data publishers, consumers, and liquidity providers make money. Provide arbitrage opportunities.  Help people build with Ocean libraries. Improve developer experience (DX). Help teams make&nbsp;money.  Fund teams for building, outreach, unlocking data. Via OceanDAO (community-curated grants), Shipyard (core-team curated grants), and Data Economy Challenge (prizes). It’s especially important to grow OceanDAO, since it will decentralize Ocean further and position Ocean for long-term sustainability. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Details&nbsp;here</a>.  Integrations. Integrate more datatoken / service types: streaming data, oracles, etc. Deploy on more chains: Eth → many (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">details here</a>). Integrate to more crypto apps: wallets, DEXes, DAOs, and more. Integrate to existing AI tools like scikit-learn, Anaconda, TensorFlow, OpenMined, and&nbsp;OpenML.  <p>II. Top-down: enterprises, governments. Main activities:</p>  Business development and services support, starting with POCs but leading to live deployments on massive scale. Help enterprises turn their data into value, including data “on their books” rather than as a liability. Help governments implement data policies with the help of&nbsp;Ocean.  Service partners. Growing a network of service partners to support these enterprise and government activities (to offload reliance on core&nbsp;team).  <p>III. DeFi. Main activities:</p>  Data Farming. It’s similar to liquidity mining but emphasizes consuming data (versus pure speculation). <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Details&nbsp;here</a>.  Work closely with DeFi projects. For each, get OCEAN as a first-class citizen, then follow up with datatokens. Conduct many experiments, from stablecoins to insurance, and double-down on what works&nbsp;best.  Data DeFi “snowballs”. Incentivize DeFi applications that make more money with more data, leading to a positive feedback loop on Ocean DeFi usage (“snowball effect”). This includes arb bots, trading systems, and yield farming tools that use AI for decision&nbsp;making.  <p>These traction pillars complement each other. All three have real-world use cases. All three involve users that have data, and want data. Bottom-up has low latency in feedback (hours or days), enabling rapid improvements in the products. Its exponential nature promises huge impact over the long term. Top-down demonstrates use cases on large brand names, typically has large numbers attached, and the added credibility helps influence policymaking around data. While top-down may not scale as well, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">doing non-scalable things</a> can really help traction in early days. DeFi has some of the best aspects of the others: like bottom-up it’s low latency and exponential in nature, and like top-down it has large numbers attached. And, it’s&nbsp;fun.</p> 2021 Ocean Product Roadmap, by&nbsp;Quarter <p>With the traction-oriented KPIs and traction hypotheses in hand, the Ocean core teams for product, ecosystem, etc did extensive planning. We reconciled this with the needs of our enterprise collaborators.</p><p>Below is what we arrived at, for our 2021 plans, organized quarterly. These plans support the three traction pillars, and in turn (we hope) help to drive the KPIs. We also reserve the right to change our plans based on learnings in the rapidly evolving crypto environment.</p><p>The plans focus on Ocean products; dovetailing this there are extensive activities in ecosystem, enterprise, and communications towards the 2021 traction&nbsp;goals.</p> Q1/2021 Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q1/2021. The highlight is fixing gas costs, and Compute-to-Data in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p>  Fix gas costs. Gas costs on Ethereum mainnet have become exceedingly high <a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1358110993495318528">and may not abate</a>. We are addressing this by deploying Ocean contracts and running Ocean Market on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">&gt;1 chains</a>. <a href="https://www.purestake.com/news/moonbeam-and-ocean-protocol-partner-to-bring-a-new-data-economy-to-the-polkadot-ecosystem/">Moonbeam</a> and other chains are in the works. Each chain will include an OCEAN bridge to Ethereum mainnet. At least one will be ready by end of&nbsp;Q1.  Ocean Market: has <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a>. This enables buying &amp; selling of private data from Ocean Market webapp&nbsp;itself.  Ocean Market: allow more than one pool for each datatoken. This helps migrating from one pool to another, and is a first step towards Ocean Market linking to other AMM pools, order book based exchanges, and&nbsp;more.  Ocean Market: fewer bugs, faster. This includes continued bug fixes, use TheGraph for Total Value Locked (<a href="https://messari.io/article/how-to-interpret-total-value-locked-tvl-in-defi">TVL</a>), and&nbsp;more.  OceanDAO: streamline flow to reduce friction for people creating proposals and voting. Grow the amount of funding, while <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/On-ROI">ensuring quality projects</a>.  Ecosystem, enterprise and communications activities that dovetail the products. This includes experiments in DeFi initiatives using OCEAN or datatokens.   Q2/2021 Targets <p>We have the following goals for Q2/2021. The highlights are the first deployment of Data Farming, an OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Ocean Market, and supporting more than one datatoken type.</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a>: first deployment. This program incentivizes data consume volume. We will start by allocating a modest amount of OCEAN, then allocate more in each cycle as data consume volume grows. As we learn, we will refine the&nbsp;program.  OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Ocean Market. Having prices and liquidity set (optionally) in a stablecoin reduces variance due to fluctuations in OCEAN. A stablecoin backed by OCEAN, like <a href="https://medium.com/opendao/ocean-opendao-uma-a-new-stablecoin-269241dd8c5d">$OceanO by OpenDAO</a>, helps align interests between Ocean Market users and the broader Ocean community.  Architecture for more than one datatoken type. This refactor includes smart contract changes and a security audit. It allows us to move metadata to the ERC20 contract itself, which we will also do. The added flexibility will make possible a variety of datatoken types, including more fine-grained permissions, fee rate flexibility, and&nbsp;more.  Multi-chain: improve support by deploying to more chains, and enabling Ocean Market users to see data assets across several chains at once. Over time (not necessarily this quarter) support bridges for datatokens and cross-chain liquidity by leveraging developments in cross-chain technology.  OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.   Q3/2021 Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2021. The highlights are ramping up Data Farming, fine-grained permissions, and supporting more data services.</p>  Ramp up Data Farming. We will build on the learnings from Q2 to further scale up the OCEAN allocated, to further catalyze data consume&nbsp;volume.  3rd Party Markets: fine-grained permissions using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role-Based Access Control</a> (RBAC) while retaining datatoken ERC20 mental model. Helps marketplace instances to control which actors can publish assets in that marketplace instance, view assets, and consume data assets. This is for 3rd party markets; Ocean Market will remain as open-ended as possible.  Data Services: support two more data services as data assets. Possibilities include WebSockets (streaming data), Chainlink, TheGraph, Streamr, GraphQL streaming data, and more; we will prioritize as we&nbsp;go.  Multi-chain, OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.  <p>Q4/2021 Targets</p><p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q4/2021. The highlights are better staking and helping the community to monetize&nbsp;better.</p>  Better staking. People can stake OCEAN in data pools without having to buy the data asset in the process. This will use Balancer V2. In general, it will better align the incentives of publishers, consumers, and liquidity providers / stakers / curators.  Help community monetize. For people running their own marketplaces (as dedicated apps, or in wallets, etc), enable potential for fees in publishing, swapping, staking, and consuming, with flexibility on setting the&nbsp;fees.  Market: trustless &amp; convenient urls, to retain Ocean Market’s current convenience while removing its having brief custody of&nbsp;urls.  Data Farming, Data Services, Multi-chain, OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.   Conclusion <p>Up until the end of 2020, our goal was to get initial product-market fit for Ocean (0→1). Now that we have a foothold on that, our focus going forward is traction (1→N). This article presented our KPIs, our hypotheses of how to achieve those, and finally specific product plans towards implementing hypotheses.</p> Appendix: Roadmap with Dependencies <p>The following image illustrates the roadmap presented above, but adding dependency information.

Enter: MIMOSI&nbsp;Health.</p><p><a href="https://peerledger.com/mimosi-health">MIMOSI Health</a> was developed with the goal of preventing community spread of COVID-19. It is a digital platform providing real-time data on disease spread, testing, recovered cases and vaccinations. MIMOSI Health unifies stakeholders in public and private sectors by bridging disparate systems and providing the big picture data needed to make timely, informed decisions.</p> Focused on privacy and&nbsp;security <p>MIMOSI Health supports safe return to work by providing digital, verifiable proof of testing or vaccination. The simple, intuitive design makes it easy for you to book appointments for testing and vaccinations, or upload the results of at-home tests. Simply access your test results via email using 2-factor authentication.</p><p>MIMOSI Health only collects data relevant to COVID-19 testing and vaccination, meaning your personal medical history is never at risk. All demographic data is immediately anonymized before being aggregated into dashboards. Role-based access control (RBAC) limits the data visible to authorized users based on their job functions. User roles are customizable to accurately reflect testing and vaccination workflows.</p><p>MIMOSI Health is not a Personal Health Record (PHR) or Electronic Medical Record (EMR). It is a standalone solution that can easily integrate with existing health management systems. MIMOSI Health supports a holistic approach to the fight against COVID-19 by creating a seamless and secure way to keep everyone informed and protected.</p> MIMOSI Health vs. PHRs &amp;&nbsp;EMRs <p>*Authorized users&nbsp;include:</p><p>Regulators can access visual analytics for current/recovered cases, number of appointments booked and much more. Regulators can also access the MIMOSI Health Heat Map, which provides a concise overview of where positive test cases are self-isolating.</p><p>Nurses and Contact Tracers can access the patient’s contact information and testing&nbsp;history.</p><p>Community Testers record patient information and schedule testing appointments. Community testers are authorized to access the mentioned information.</p><p>Lab Technicians can access a patient’s testing&nbsp;history.</p><p>Patients can securely book appointments for testing or vaccinations and record the results of at-home tests on the system. Patients access test results and vaccination status in real-time via protected 2-factor authentication.</p> Stay connected. Stay immune. Stay&nbsp;safe. <p><a href="https://peerledger.com/request-demo">Contact us</a> to request more information or schedule a demo. We are ready to help&nbsp;you!</p>
