<p>Next.js has emerged as a trailblazing framework for building decentralized applications, owing to its robust architecture and versatile features. Next.js provides developers with the right tools to create their latest project, and it can be very simple to install Sign-In with Ethereum in your Next.js app by using SSX. </p><p>This guide will show you how to set it up in just a few steps:</p>  Creating your Next.js project - you can skip this step if you already have one  Adding SSX dependencies - how to install the dependencies on your project  Setting up the Backend - how to configure your backend  Setting up the Frontend - how to configure your frontend  <p>So, let’s dive in.</p> 1) Creating a Next.js project <p>Note: if you already have a Next app, you can skip to the next section.</p><p>First, create a new Next app by running this command:</p> <code>npx create-next-app@latest
</code> <p>In this tutorial, we are using a project with the following configuration:</p> <code>✔ What is your project named? … my-ssx-dapp
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? … No
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … No
✔ Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? … No
✔ What import alias would you like configured? … @/*</code>  2) Adding SSX dependencies <p>To use the SSX library, you must install the <code>@spruceid/ssx</code> dependency for the frontend, and <code>@spruceid/ssx-server</code> for the backend. To add it, navigate to your app’s directory and use the following command like so:</p> <code>cd my-ssx-dapp
npm install @spruceid/ssx @spruceid/ssx-server
</code>  <br>3) Setting up the Backend <p>Let's start by adding a helper file on our code so that we don't have to instantiate a new SSX Server object directly every time. Create the file <code>pages/api/_ssx.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { SSXServer } from "@spruceid/ssx-server";

const ssx = new SSXServer();

export default ssx;
</code> <p>For more information about configuring SSX Server, you can check out our <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server?ref=blog.spruceid.com">documentation</a>.</p><p>Second, create an API route for generating a random nonce. This is used to identify the session and prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack?ref=blog.spruceid.com">replay attacks</a>. Create the file <code>pages/api/ssx-nonce.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import ssx from "./_ssx";

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const nonce = ssx.generateNonce();
  req.cookies.nonce = nonce;
  res.status(200).send(nonce);
}
</code> <p>Third, add a sign-in API route. This route will do all necessary checks in the SIWE message, ensuring it's valid. All checks occur inside the <code>ssx.login()</code> function. Create the file <code>pages/api/ssx-login.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import ssx from "./_ssx";

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  res.status(200).json(
    await ssx.login(
      req.body.siwe,
      req.body.signature,
      req.body.daoLogin,
      req.body.resolveEns,
      req.cookies.nonce || "",
      req.body.resolveLens,
    )
  );
}
</code> <p>Finally, create the sign-out API route. &nbsp;Create the file <code>pages/api/ssx-logout.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import ssx from "./_ssx";

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  res.status(200).json({ 
    success: await ssx.logout() ?? true
  });
}</code> <p><br>You can find more information about <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server/ssx-server.ssxserver/ssx-server.ssxserver.generatenonce?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx.generateNonce</a>, <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server/ssx-server.ssxserver/ssx-server.ssxserver.login?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx.login</a>, and <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server/ssx-server.ssxserver/ssx-server.ssxserver.logout?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx.logout</a> in the SSX documentation.</p> 4) Setting up the Frontend <p>First, we will create a new SSXComponent to wrap the sign-in/out logic. Create a new folder called <code>components</code> in the root directory, create the file <code>components/SSXComponent.tsx</code>, and add the following to it:</p> <code>import { SSX } from "@spruceid/ssx";
import { useState } from "react";

const SSXComponent = () =&gt; {

    const [ssxProvider, setSSX] = useState&lt;SSX | null&gt;(null);

    const ssxHandler = async () =&gt; {
        const ssx = new SSX({
            providers: {
                server: {
                    host: "http://localhost:3000/api"
                }
            },
        });
        await ssx.signIn();
        setSSX(ssx);
    };

    const ssxLogoutHandler = async () =&gt; {
        ssxProvider?.signOut();
        setSSX(null);
    };

    const address = ssxProvider?.address() || '';

    return (
        &lt;div className="App"&gt;
            &lt;div className="App-header"&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;SSX Example dapp&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            {
                ssxProvider ?
                    &lt;div className="App-content"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;
                            Account Info
                        &lt;/h2&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                            {
                                address &amp;&amp;
                                &lt;p&gt;
                                    &lt;b&gt;Address:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;code&gt;{address}&lt;/code&gt;
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                            }
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;button onClick={ssxLogoutHandler}&gt;
                            Sign-Out
                        &lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt; :
                    &lt;div className="App-content"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;
                            Connect and Sign-In with your Ethereum account.
                        &lt;/h2&gt;
                        &lt;button onClick={ssxHandler}&gt;
                            Sign-In with Ethereum
                        &lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
            }
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
};

export default SSXComponent;
</code> <p>This SSX configuration assumes you are running the Next.js dapp using the default port (3000). If you are running in a different port, change the <code>providers.server.host</code> in the SSX config. For more information about SSX client configuration, you can check out our <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx/ssx.ssxclientconfig?ref=blog.spruceid.com">documentation</a>.</p><p>Finally, let’s update the <code>pages/index.tsx</code> file with the following code. Add the additional imports specified, and if you generated your app using the create-next-app tool, replace the existing <code>export default function Home() {}</code> with the following:</p> <code>import SSXComponent from '@/components/SSXComponent';
import type { NextPage } from 'next'
import Head from 'next/head'


const Home: NextPage = () =&gt; {

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;SSX Next Dapp&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;
      &lt;SSXComponent /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}

export default Home;
</code> <p>That's it! Now you can run the dapp by using <code>yarn dev</code> or <code>npm run dev</code>. </p><p>If you want to add some style to your new dapp, add the following to your <code>styles/globals.css</code>, but this step is completely optional:</p> <code>body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen',
    'Ubuntu', 'Cantarell', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue',

<p>One of the most distinguishing things about our federal government is its broad scope of services. No other institution is responsible for doing so much for so many, so quickly, in an ever-changing landscape. No other institution must respond simultaneously to such a breadth of challenges that have only been amplified over the last few years.</p>



<p>In response to the COVID-19 crisis, many federal agencies kicked their digital transformations into high gear to help enhance public services, embrace a remote workforce and better secure data with trust and transparency. While positive momentum on modernization grows, so does external pressure as citizen expectations rise and new threats multiply.</p>



<p>However, it’s difficult for federal agencies to harness the potential of technology and data within a legacy IT infrastructure that struggles with data fragmentation, a lack of interoperability and vulnerability to cyber attacks. Uneven budget cycles and challenges focusing dollars on modernization compound these factors.</p>



<p>The US government’s IT modernization efforts are still lagging, especially when considering the improved productivity, speed and lowered risk that cloud computing offers to help address the security and citizen service challenges impacting trust in government today.</p>



<p>Congress and successive administrations have acknowledged these challenges with mandates like the recent <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/">Customer Service Executive Order</a>. Last year’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/01/25/what-the-quantum-computing-cybersecurity-preparedness-act-means-for-national-security/?sh=5184806e368a">Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act (P.L. 117-260)</a>, the recently released <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Cybersecurity-Strategy-2023.pdf">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf">federal zero trust mandate</a> require agencies to prioritize system and data security.</p>



<p>IBM has built a diverse ecosystem of partners to help government effectively use the cloud to address these challenges. Bringing government solutions derived from an ecosystem of partners is critical because no single IT provider can solve today’s government challenges alone. We <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-ecosystem-federal-market/">continually evolve our partner ecosystem in response to public sector challenges</a>, bringing forward collaborative teams from a full spectrum of industry players from global cloud service providers to small businesses.</p>



<p>From this perspective of partnership, IBM offers five recommendations for federal agencies to use the cloud to accelerate modernization:</p>



 
 Think hybrid multi-cloud first. Hybrid cloud is the only infrastructure and application development framework that’s flexible, adaptable and elastic enough to support the variety of programs and services needed today. Therefore, agencies should not orient modernization toward a single cloud service provider, nor should they always rely entirely on the cloud. 



 Support the mission out to the edge. Edge computing is a strategy for securely extending a digital environment out to the user. Americans expect to engage with government via their phones and tablets. The military needs global access to data and intelligence systems in remote locations. Government workers must deliver services in remote health clinics, far flung national parks and border control stations. Government accomplishes its mission “on the edge,” and we must secure applications and data where the mission is happening. Cybersecurity should be <a href="https://www.ibm.com/policy/the-ibm-policy-labs-10-recommendations-for-stronger-cloud-security-policies/">baked in from the initial design</a> to maximize seamless risk mitigation and to minimize the end user burden. 



 Reorient incentives to modernize business processes, not infrastructure. We must deemphasize counting data centers closed each year, or which legacy applications shift to the cloud. It’s not just about technology, it’s about improving citizen services, security and enabling the mission. Agencies should prioritize optimizing business processes that impact service and how work is done. Federal IT budgets and score cards should incentivize this. 



 Apply an open ecosystem approach to improving how work is done. The challenges facing government can’t be met with just one company’s tools. Federal agencies must work with multiple cloud and infrastructure vendors to demand interoperability. Agencies should focus on solutions by challenging vendor teams to help redesign how work is done. To emphasize this, cloud infrastructure contracts should be expanded to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/virtual-enterprise-platforms-ecosystems">encourage partner ecosystems</a> to deliver cloud native solutions as services. Whenever possible, build once and use everywhere. 



 Streamline FedRAMP certification. FedRAMP is the default federal information security requirement. Congress recently reaffirmed its importance by passing the <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/blog/2023-01-11-announces-passing-fedramp-auth-act/">FedRAMP Authorization Act (P.L. 117-263).</a> However, it remains far too difficult to move cloud solutions needed to modernize through FedRAMP certification. In fact, some see FedRAMP and a major hurdle. FedRAMP must become fully automated, the sponsorship burden reduced or eliminated, approvals must reciprocate between agencies, and the FedRAMP Program Office must be funded on par with its role supporting modernization.&nbsp; 
 



<p>IBM looks forward to continuing to expand our collaborations within our partner ecosystem to support the digital transformation of government even better through connectivity, partnerships, and open technologies. Success is a team sport. We are confident that working together as a collaborative ecosystem of partners, there is no challenge to which we cannot rise together.</p>

<p>My kids wanted to go to the international ice sculpture festival in Breckenridge Colorado, near where we live. The event was free, but they made us register online to get QR tickets which nobody looked at. I just wanted to get the tickets. Instead, I was forced through their painful registration process. I quickly made up a username and password and got my tickets. Did I mention that no one looked at them? And there it is. Another digital representation of me, floating around the digital ether. </p>

<p>In business (and personal life) I buy and sometimes just register for tools to solve problems. I hand over information and access to vendors who I think will help me run my business and life. The problem is: I never check up on that access. I don’t go back and delete my “account” or revoke permissions. I might question for 30 seconds, "am I giving out too many credentials or too much access?" but then I forget.</p>

<p>Google Workspace is powerful and allows you to move fast. Often that means security and IT processes take a backseat. The bigger you grow, the more people you have and the more suppliers you rely on (see my post <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/starting-up-a-pain-the-saas">,Starting Up: A Pain in the SaaS</a>). The more people, the more likely that someone will leave or be found unsuitable. That’s when that IT and security debt comes due.</p>

<p>IT and security debt can cause real problems.</p>
<p>According to these statistics (<a href="https://www.strongdm.com/blog/small-business-cyber-security-statistics">,35 Alarming Small Business Cybersecurity Statistics for 2023</a>) I should be alarmed. For example:</p>
<p>Fact 1: 61% of SMBs were the target of a Cyberattack in 2021</p>
<p>Fact 2: 80% of all hacking incidents involve compromised credentials or passwords.</p>
<p>Fact 3: 95% of cybersecurity incidents at SMBs cost between $826 and $653,587.</p>

<p>Smaller businesses ignore security &amp; smoother IT operations. Why?</p>
<p>We are busy with other things. Founders fall into the role of Unexpected Google Admin™. We are busy. We figure out Google Workspace enough to get by. If we consider using a packaged security solution, we don’t want to talk with a salesperson in order to try the product. We want to try it out in our own time.</p>

<p>If a tool isn’t simple, we don’t use it. When we’ve tried using a packaged security or admin solution we’ve discovered that many are not easy to use. Of course. They’re built with large enterprises in mind because that’s where the problems are biggest and that’s where the money is. They assume that the user has IT and Security experience. Or that they have time to read documentation or hire a team to do this new job. We don’t have time (see paragraph above). We want it to be intuitive and “just work” so we can get it and set it and (mostly) forget it.</p>

<p>We don’t like spending lots of money. We don’t yet have economies of scale. We have to run lean. Most packages are expensive. Most pricing on websites (if listed) is meant to be negotiated. We don’t have a procurement function to help us negotiate and we don’t have time to do it. We expect a reasonable price listed online that targets us.</p>

<p>How can we fix the problem?</p>
<p>The answer for SMBs is obvious: build a product that does the opposite of everything I wrote above. More specifically:</p>

<p>Make it easy. Simplify the discover-to-try-to-buy path. Get out of the way. Let someone try it when they want with no commitments and no friction. Let them buy it with a credit card.</p>

<p>Build with smaller companies in mind. Assume that the person using the product isn’t an IT Pro, doesn’t want to be an IT Pro, and has way way way more important things to do than learn your product. Don’t give them 10,000 dials to set (or decide not to set). Build in best practices by default so it is easy to set up and get value immediately. </p>

<p>Price it for startup teams and SMBs. Be thoughtful about pricing. Don’t charge people at smaller companies to solve a problem that they don’t have yet. If the SMB has under 10 employees, give it to them for free. Once they are past 10 people and up to 100 people, make sure the price is something that is so easy to swallow that they just enter in their credit card number.</p>

<p>A new world for smaller companies, with IT and security built in from the start.</p>
<p>We imagine a world where founders feel it is easy, cost-effective, and can get immediate value from putting identity and access management in place early. They just need to find someone who is building a solution for them and who understands how to add features and scale with them on the journey. A company that believes that it should be easy and affordable for every company to care about IT and security from the start.</p>

<p>That’s us.</p>

   Process and technology have never been so closely linked, and process excellence has never been as vital as it is in this age of digital transformation.

<p>What do a Canadian energy company, a Dutch coffee retailer and a British multinational consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have in common right now? All are transforming their procurement operations by leveraging state-of-the-art process mining and intelligent automation technology.</p>



 Why process excellence matters 



<p>A mid-size organization will spend the equivalent of several billion U.S. dollars annually in direct or indirect procurement. For this reason, it’s worth examining how efficient the sourcing process is, how to control maverick buying and reduce revenue leakage and how to create a standardized buying experience across the organization. Additionally, compliance requirements around sustainable procurement need to be addressed based on supplier’s sustainability posture around logistics and distribution. An efficient sustainable supply chain process with optimized CO2 footprint is an enterprise requirement as well as a societal need.</p>



 Process excellence in action 



<p>This discussion is inherently connected to the 21st century challenges and solutions related to process excellence. Process excellence is an intersectional play in the age of digital transformation. It requires a combination of capabilities around process optimization. The application of exponential technologies to digitally discover the process realities and technologically transform those processes for the best outcome. Along with defining and operationalizing the right level of governance across organizational layers for efficient value orchestration and continuous improvement. Let’s consider a few examples:</p>



 At a materials engineering corporation 



<p>An American materials engineering corporation, a global leader in the semiconductor industry, has been driving finance transformation through automation in partnership with IBM so the business can grow, even with a fixed finance headcount. With the success of initial automation deployment, the focus has shifted to optimization of adjacent business-critical processes, e.g. service order management, reverse value chain, and more, for cycle time reduction and quality improvement. A Process Mining exercise drawing data from enterprise SAP has helped measure KPI performance and define the transformation roadmap.</p>



 At a multinational financial services company 



<p>In another engagement, an American multinational financial services company leveraged IBM’s process excellence capabilities to investigate the internal journal transfer process that uncovered the potential for up to 50% reduction in rework rate and a 40% reduction in rejection rate.</p>



 Additional examples 



 
 European Oil &amp; Gas company transforming Enterprise Asset Management 



 Multinational Bank transforming Fraud Operations process 



 Global Travel booking company optimizing Talent Acquisition process 



 Global Brewing company in value orchestration journey as part of S/4 Hana rollout 



 Japanese auto manufacturer transforming Procurement and Logistics processes 



 Leading US Reinsurance company transforming Claims, Payment and Policy Maintenance 
 



 Process excellence for enterprise transformation 



<p>While examples are endless, the common theme is enterprise transformation, the primary use case for the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/automation">IBM Process Excellence offering</a>. In a world that’s still recovering from the impact of a pandemic, facing economic uncertainties, geopolitical crises, and extreme climate change—all of which disrupt traditional value chains—the need for enterprise-scale transformation is a key imperative for global business. Shared Service Operations like Finance, Supply Chain, Procurement, HR, and Enterprise IT are the relevant horizontal domains to engage. At the same time, focused Industry processes with front-to-back office operations are also candidates for transformation prioritized by business owners (e.g., Lending, Customer Onboarding, Claims, Fraud Operations, etc.).</p>



<p>Process and Technology have never been so closely linked. Enterprise workflows are often distributed across the entire application landscape, managed by different departmental IT teams and process owners with siloed focus. With the advancement of Process Mining technology, it’s now possible to virtualize and visualize the end-to-end workflow, drawing execution data from the underlying systems of record (aka enterprise applications) and even augment that with the process operator’s local desktop-level task execution view, digitally captured through Task Mining.</p>



<p>This technology-driven process visualization is revolutionizing the way we look at processes. For the first time, we can see intricate and complex processes clearly in action, identifying where they operate effectively and where they can best be simplified, optimized and automated.</p>

<p>In a scene from the 1980s hit movie Back to the Future, Marty (played by Michael J. Fox) does a rock guitar rendition at his parents 1950s high school dance. Leaving the crowd puzzled, he closes by saying, “you might not be ready for this yet, but your kids are going to love it.” As we look back at the evolution of hardware security modules (HSMs), innovative features have come as a result of changing security needs, and some have taken time to be widely adopted. Since their inception, HSMs have underpinned many of the technologies we now take for granted, and as they continue to evolve, they will undoubtedly play a key role in protecting the new technologies that we will depend on in the future.</p>
<p>This blog post examines how processing speed, robust security, the ability to securely run applications, deployment options, and support for strong quantum-resistant algorithms will continue to make on-premises and cloud-based HSMs indispensable components of enterprise cybersecurity strategies for generations to come.</p>
<p>A look back</p>
<p>On-premises HSMs have been around for decades, providing a root of trust to protect and manage underpinning cryptographic keys used for encryption and signing processes. They have often been perceived as mysterious devices sitting in back offices and data centers, working behind the scenes to protect everything from sensitive data to software downloads. HSMs have evolved over the years to meet the changing needs of the security landscape; most notably their design has addressed scalability, tamper protection, and ease of use and integration with the applications they support. Tamper-proofing has enabled HSMs to detect attempts to physically access or modify them, making it virtually impossible for attackers to get to the sensitive keys they store. Other aspects of their evolution have included performance improvements and support for new symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to stay up to the latest standards.</p>
<p>As the need for stronger cryptographic security grew, HSMs became more sophisticated, adding feature capabilities such as on-board secure execution that enabled complete sensitive applications to run inside their protected certified boundary. With the recent migration to cloud-based deployments, the traditional on-premises HSM model has also been transformed. Cloud-based HSM-as-a-service models are now available, offering enterprise customers the ability to consume cryptographic services without having to own and maintain the physical HSMs.</p>
<p>Today’s environment</p>
<p>A fast-paced digital environment requires organizations to process data quickly and securely. High-performance, crypto-agile HSMs provide rapid processing speeds and support for multiple hashing mechanisms and encryption algorithms. Today’s HSMs can also be configured to support custom algorithms, making them versatile for enterprises that require high levels of security and flexibility. As the need for data security continues to grow, the importance of high performance and cryptographic agility will continue to increase, making HSMs a valuable investment for enterprises that need to keep up with the latest security standards.</p>
<p>Modern HSMs also increasingly find themselves in use cases beyond traditional cryptography. These include securing more advanced applications such as blockchain, secure storage for sensitive data in cloud computing environments, and 5G cellular communications where security has been stepped up due to known vulnerabilities and potential man-in-the-middle attacks. With the rollout of 5G networks, hybrid symmetric/asymmetric algorithms, designed to validate user identity and to protect against unauthorized access, authenticate exponentially growing number of subscribers and devices. Running these algorithms within the tamper-resistant environment of an HSM has become critical for the security of these rollouts. Typically offered as certified devices, HSMs have also evolved to meet the changing needs for compliance to regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The quantum threat</p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of quantum computing poses a new threat to the security provided by HSMs. Quantum computers have the potential to break many of the cryptographic algorithms (specifically asymmetric algorithms including elliptic curves) that are commonly used to secure data today. Because quantum computers can solve problems that had been considered intractable for classical computers, such as factoring large integers and solving discrete logarithm problems, the need to ensure that HSMs are ready for a post-quantum world is increasingly top of mind for many organizations.</p>
<p>To address this threat, new algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers are <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">already in development</a> under the leadership of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
<p>Way forward</p>
<p>In Back to the Future, the crowd at the dance was not yet ready for the future, but Marty was already ahead of the times. Having a unique perspective can make all the difference when it comes to preparing for evolving challenges. Today, organizations need to make the most of new revolutionary technologies such as cloud, blockchain, and others, while ensuring that their sensitive data stays safe and secure.</p>
<p>With the right security strategy and solutions, organizations can chart a secure future that addresses the performance, certifications, and cryptographic agility needs for today and tomorrow. The newly launched Entrust nShield 5 builds on the proven nShield HSM capabilities to provide enhanced performance, compliance with the latest Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 140-3, certification expected Summer 2023) cryptographic robustness requirements, secure execution, and support for the new NIST-shortlisted quantum-resistant algorithms.</p>

 Here’s what crypto asset service providers need to know about the newly ratified MICA crypto regulatory framework. 



 



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a>) regulation, which received a majority 517 votes from European Parliament lawmakers in favor of the crypto licensing regime in April 2023, aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto asset sector. MiCA is also likely to attract operators and users to the market, as it is the first regulatory framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) at EU level. &nbsp;</p>



 What is the meaning of MiCA?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA is a regulatory framework for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">crypto assets</a> traded on digital platforms. It covers three types of crypto assets: Utility tokens, which provide access to goods or services;- payment tokens, which are used as a means of payment or can be traded for other MiCA-regulated tokens; and e-money tokens, which are backed by fiat currencies and used to make electronic payments.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the main objectives of MiCA?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has established rules for the issuance, admission to trading, and operation of crypto assets, as well as requirements for the providers of crypto asset services. The European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) has been set up to specifically promote cooperation between member states on blockchain technology.</p>



  Provide legal certainty for crypto assets that are not covered by current European financial regulation;  



  Bring all crypto-asset issuers and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under one regulatory&nbsp;licensing&nbsp;framework;  



  Replace current national regulation for crypto-assets&nbsp;that are&nbsp;not covered by European regulation;  



  Create a specific regulatory framework for stable coins.  



<blockquote><p>Regulations will still need to be enforced&nbsp;by competent authorities designated by each member state,&nbsp;that will be&nbsp;overseen by&nbsp;both the&nbsp;European Securities and Markets Authority&nbsp;and the European Banking Authority. MiCA and TRF will add greater transparency to the crypto space, and the aim is to reduce risks the market, the overall economy, and future investments.</p>Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



 What are the benefits of MiCA?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has a number of benefits, including better regulatory clarity for CASPs in the EU, improved investor protection, enhanced financial stability, and the promotion of innovation. MiCA will also make it easier for member states to cooperate on blockchain technology, as the EBP will provide a forum for discussion and exchange of best practices.&nbsp;</p>



 Who will MiCA impact?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will impact all CASPs offering services to clients in the EU. This includes exchanges, custodian wallet providers, issuers of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other CASPs. MiCA will not apply to persons who buy or sell crypto assets for their own account.</p>



 What does this mean for non-European crypto service providers?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will not apply to non-European crypto service providers unless they target EU investors or offer their services in the EU. However, national competent authorities in the EU may require non-European crypto service providers to obtain a MiCA authorization if they provide cross-border services into the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses.</p>



 



 

 



 How will MiCA play into AML regulation?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will complement the EU’s existing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD)</a> by providing a specific regulatory framework for crypto-assets. MiCA will require CASPs to put in place <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML measures</a>, such as Customer Due Diligence and reporting of suspicious transactions. MiCA will also allow national competent authorities to exchange information on suspected money laundering or terrorist financing activities involving crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses. However, CASPs will need to ensure that they comply with MiCA’s rules and requirements when they come into effect.&nbsp;</p>



 When will MiCA come into effect?&nbsp; 



<p>The MiCA crypto regulation is still subject to approval by the European Parliament and the European Council. The European Commission will also need to implement further acts to specify certain technical requirements for MiCA-regulated activities. It was ratified by the European Parliament in April 2023, and is expected to come into effect by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CASPs are recommended to stay up to date with MiCA, and consult with a legal advisor to ensure they remain compliant.</p>

<p>Learn how we set out to build a plugin for musicians and ended up creating a progressive file system that grows with the user's needs.</p> Ditto <p>Our Fissioneers love pushing the boundaries of the <a href="https://odd.dev/">Webnative SDK</a> to unlock new features and use cases. Recently, engineers Brian and Andy did just that with Ditto. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/ditto">Ditto</a> is a VST delay plugin. Users can create their own delay presets in the app and use the <a href="https://long-round-glass-crow.fission.app/">Ditto Companion</a> web app to share and collect Ditto presets.</p> Elementary <p>Ditto uses <a href="https://www.elementary.audio/">Elementary</a>, a JavaScript framework and high-performance audio engine that makes developing audio plugins using web technologies easier. </p><p>Ditto uses the <a href="https://www.elementary.audio/docs/packages/plugin-renderer"><code>@elemaudio/plugin-renderer</code></a>, which runs a web app in WebView inside of a VST binary. The WebView gives us a browser environment where we can run Webnative. This makes development much more accessible because you don't need to know C++ - only JavaScript.</p><p>Here is the Ditto plugin loaded into Bitwig Studio:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6f3036f4dd375f4551bc0fad11ec0a7dc8975c66.jpeg"></a> Preset Manager <p>Audio plugins typically have a system for saving presets, which captures plugin state and metadata about the preset. We implemented presets in Ditto that store plugin state, notes, tags, and favorite status:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/7/750a2700e7adda90112770ccfc621218141bf319.jpeg"></a><p>The presets interface is organized by categories, including All, Favorites, and categories automatically generated from preset tags.</p> Progressive File System Enhancement <p>Plugin users expect plugins to store presets without signing into an account. To match those expectations, our first experiment with Ditto was to implement a local-only file system that does not require sign-in and an optional synced file system that requires an account. When a user decides to create an account, their presets are copied from the local-only file system to a file system associated with a username and persisted to Fission IPFS nodes.</p><p>Each file system is associated with an app namespace to keep them separate in browser storage. We determine which file system to use by checking whether the user has created an account.</p><p>In application programming, we're often trained to think about how we will serve users now and how we want to serve them down the line. We build the infrastructure to allow us to introduce new planned features without creating more work for us later on. </p><p>This is sensible, but what if, as a developer, you want to ship your minimum viable product now, gather feedback, and then add syncing and sharing later? &nbsp;</p><p>Users are also tired of signing up for endless platforms, not knowing if it will be the right tool for them. Why not give them the option to get hands-on with the tool first, and if/when they decide to access more features, you ask them to make an account (a password-less one, of course!)?</p><p>Building using a progressive file system not only reduces the scope of an MVP, it also removes a common barrier to adoption!</p> Connecting to Ditto Companion <p>When the user is ready to go beyond the local-only file system, they can create an account and connect to the <a href="https://long-round-glass-crow.fission.app/">Ditto Companion app</a>.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/a/adcd97c9b813df99d7764181ee528fd76c187b82.png"></a><p>First, they create a username and select "connect." Then they are given a QR code and a connection link. </p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/e/eade68717a724783a861afe9a16929749f5d6ca1.png"></a><p>The QR Code and connection link open Ditto Companion and use the AWAKE protocol to begin device-linking.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a3593ae2830f971552ba340092d99d3ee60f0908.jpeg"></a><p>The user enters the code shown in Ditto Companion into Ditto:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4e1c83397d3afb9650b15807a2363befcbef6e71.png"></a><p>After entering the code, Ditto shows the user a message confirming they have connected with Ditto Companion:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/5/55ea0bcdd6e46b7c6917cdddf0b6e922d893cb6a.png"></a><p>The user can connect again later if they would like to connect to another browser or device.</p> Namespaces <p>The Ditto plugin and Ditto Companion use distinct app namespaces. However, by using UCAN authorization and transmitting the user's WNFS encryption key, the Ditto Companion app shares the synced file system with the Ditto plugin.</p><p>Having multiple namespaces also makes it possible for users to work on several apps locally. It used to be that you could only work on one app at a time on <code>localhost:8080</code> for example, but namespacing puts them each in their own box, so to speak, and you can switch from one app to another without thinking about it.</p> Sharing and Collecting Presets <p>As mentioned earlier, Ditto Companion is a web app for sharing and collecting presets.</p><p>We started Ditto Companion from the <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">Webnative App Template</a>. Our connect flow is simplified compared to the complete feature set provided in the template - we only link from the plugin to the companion app. This simple model meant we could remove quite a bit from the template for our use case.</p><p>Our second experiment was to implement a lightweight share and collect system in the companion app. Shared presets are stored in the public WNFS tree. Presets that are not shared are in the private tree. Users share presets in the companion app:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3a03525569c3c68a608cf2fb3671291cbac2ce7.png"></a><p>They can also collect shared presets from other users. After selecting the plus button, they enter the username they want to collect from:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7886e573933b43872414af9ef280fbc27fa30653.jpeg"></a><p>Ditto Companion then checks whether a file system exists for the user. If a file system exists, we get a link for the public tree and check for a presets directory.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1488b82f4087b4e340dab4bdca22161489701740.jpeg"></a><p>If presets are found, we add them to the Collect tab:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1367134c2e5dcb7e7ab91dcedc93ba475254f38f.png"></a><p>Users collect presets by checking the Collect checkbox for the preset. Collected presets are copied into the user’s file system, and the user can load them in the plugin after a refresh.</p><p>This sharing mechanism is very exciting because it searches for and scans public IPFS data and saves it to the user's file system, adding a level of interactivity to non-blockchain-based decentralized web apps. And because users can move their data to any Webnative-enabled app, there are many opportunities for collaboration and remixing of data.</p> <p>Here is a full walkthrough of Ditto and Ditto Companion:</p><p>What do you think of Ditto? Are you building an app that would benefit from a progressive file system? Join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/daDMAjE">Discord</a> community and share your feedback and thoughts!</p>

<p>The last decade has seen an unparalleled level of digital transformation, which soared to even greater heights during the last three years. Across industries, the exponential growth of technologies such as hybrid cloud, data and analytics, AI and IoT have reshaped the way businesses operate and heightened customer expectations.</p>



<p>Businesses are now entering an even greater digital era marked by broader applications of AI, including generative AI models. Combined with ongoing supply chain issues, sustainability mandates, evolving regulations, cybersecurity threats and other complexities, industries and enterprises around the world are facing a staggering number of challenges. With such overwhelming change occurring, companies need to go even further with their business and technology transformation journeys to meet customers’ needs and create further value.</p>



<p>Major industries, such as financial services, healthcare, retail and telecom and media, made their initial leap to cloud over a decade ago. Now we are at a moment in history where advanced technology is propelling a new round of hybrid cloud and AI-driven transformation.</p>



 A holistic approach to complex transformation 



<p>This new technology revolution is impacting core business applications across every sector. For instance, the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry is racing to infuse hybrid cloud, AI, IoT and other technologies into their core workloads to deliver the 24/7 omnichannel experiences customers now demand from their global supply chains. AI-driven insights and automation are no longer an option but must-haves in industries like aviation, to achieve predictive maintenance of complex aircraft systems for improved safety and cost reduction and for energy companies to optimize production while reducing their carbon footprint.</p>



<p>This latest wave of transformation extends throughout the entire value chain and is more complex to carry out than ever before as it addresses core business capabilities and technologies and not just systems of engagement. To help businesses succeed, teams need to bring forth new technology in areas such as automation, data and AI, Security and Hybrid Cloud platforms, all in the context of the business outcomes they must achieve.</p>



<p>For over 20 years, IBM has been helping companies across industries meet their evolving digital transformation goals. With deep technical <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting">and consulting</a> experience and world-renowned <a href="https://research.ibm.com/">R&amp;D</a> behind them, IBM’s industry experts deliver technology innovation and transformation engagements and solutions, with the ability to scale across an organization so it can stay competitive in this fast-changing environment.</p>

 Co-innovating with DISH Wireless to bring 5G services on demand 



<p>For telecommunication companies, next-generation transformation means stepping&nbsp;fully into the age of 5G. At the enterprise level, 5G can transform operations, create new business models and generate new revenue across industries.</p>



<p>This past year, DISH Wireless’ 5G network became the US’s first public cloud deployment of a cloud-native greenfield 5G network, made available in over 120 cities. <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/DISH-5G-Network-Now-Live-For-More-Than-20-of-the-U-S-Population-Whats-Next">To help achieve this groundbreaking milestone, DISH Wireless partnered with IBM Consulting</a>, which provided its deep telco experience, along with IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-pak-for-network-automation">IBM Cloud Pak for Network Automation</a>&nbsp;software and AI-powered automation technology.</p>



<p>The next phases focus on network and service expansion followed by commercial and wholesale market entrance. DISH Wireless will leverage advanced network slicing, which overlays multiple virtual networks on top of a shared network domain allowing it to be the first 5G carrier to make 5G network slicing a reality. With the wholesale and commercial market entrance, IBM together with DISH Wireless are reimagining what the customer onboarding experience will be, enabling a new best-in-class ability for MVNOs or enterprises to take advantage of 5G, whether it be a system of collaborative robots on a factory floor or a metaverse gaming experience with unparalleled network control and scalability.</p>



 Collaborating with CaixaBank on next-generation retail banking 



<p>To provide customers with omnichannel experiences and stay ahead of potential disruptions, the banking industry must continue to transform business models for both front-facing and back-office operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/caixabank-watson">Together with IBM, CaixaBank, the leading financial group in Spain, worked to transform its omnichannel operations.</a> The engagement unified more than 50 different customer support channels into a single platform, dramatically improving both the customer and agent experience. Through the new platform, CaixaBank now provides employees with the right tools and information to make the best recommendations and build customer relationships.</p>



<p>CaixaBank now uses AI, including chatbots powered by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson">IBM Watson®</a>, to answer basic inquiries, direct customers to live agents when appropriate and surface answers during customer interaction to reduce case time to resolution.</p>



<p>To improve the bank’s back-office productivity, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/salesforce">IBM collaborated with ecosystem partner Salesforce</a> to automate workflow processes. The Salesforce platform provides consistent customer service journeys while reducing redundant workloads for agents.

<p>The world of business demands the right decisions to succeed. For <a href="https://www.alrabie.com/">Al Rabie</a>—a prominent juice manufacturing company in the Middle East—their reality was no different. However, their manual planning and budgeting process in spreadsheets posed several challenges, including lack of control, delayed data, poor execution, and the need for continuous follow-up with IT for actual data. They faced obstacles such as a prolonged budget process, manual forecasting, and no product profitability. To address these challenges, Al Rabie partnered with <a href="https://1directionglobal.com/">1Direction Global,</a> a top solution provider in Financial and Operational Performance Management and Consulting, and a Gold Business Partner with IBM since 2018. This partnership has proven to be long-lasting.</p>



 Revolutionizing the FMCG industry with integrated business planning 



<p>Each business in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry has its own unique set of rules, variables, and limitations, and Al Rabie Saudi Foods Co. Ltd was no exception. To meet their specific needs, the experts at 1Direction Global, comprised of certified accountants and engineers, turned to IBM Planning Analytics for Watson, a flexible and powerful planning and analysis tool. By leveraging this technology, they developed custom budget models for sales performance, human resources planning, operating expenses, and a complete profit and loss statement. Additionally, dashboards and reports were crafted based on the budget models and conducted variance analysis for specific areas. The implementation process was done in several stages, from January 2019 and until August 2022, with product profitability being added in the final phase.</p>



<p>Al Rabie Saudi Foods Co. Ltd adopted an integrated business planning approach to take control and streamline their planning and budgeting process. This approach was done in stages, implementing each module at a time, which ensured minimal impact on operations and allowed teams to adopt new models and workflows efficiently.</p>



 Sales performance planning 



<p>AL Rabie needed precise <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics/sales-planning">sales volume planning</a>, considering different variables like products, channels, and location. The solution allowed to automatize the conversion of sales volumes planned in cases to liters, accounted for discounts and incentives, and generated accurate contribution margins and reports for key customer groups and categories.</p>



 Raw materials and production management planning 



<p>AL Rabie sought estimation models for managing raw materials and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics/supply-chain-planning">production planning</a> in their juice production. The system provided price sensitivity analysis and facilitated monitoring the impact of raw materials and production management real-time on the basis of product recipes and their associated costs in the budget.</p>



 Human Resources planning 



<p>A cost-based <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics/workforce-planning">HR planning model</a> was deployed within their existing framework, incorporating factors like salaries and bonuses for employees and contractors, which included a vacancy plan for accurate budgeting and forecasting.</p>



 Operating expenses 



<p>The model was deployed to manage fixed and variable overhead cost including the necessary cost allocation logic to enable users to select fixed or variable overhead and dynamically allocate drivers for a fast and accurate budgeting process.</p>



 Profit &amp; Loss statement 



<p>The system provided a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics/financial-planning-analysis">complete profit and loss statement</a> with the capacity to plan both budget and actual scenarios. The implementation also provided an enterprise-level profit and loss statement with the facility to include corporate expenses such as depreciation, taxation, etc.</p>



 Dashboards and reports 



<p>The system included reports and dashboards based on deployed budget models. Variance analysis was provided for selected areas, and management profit and loss and other reporting were done as per business requirements. The system calculated the base budget data based on trend as a starting point for the budgeting exercise, with multiple versions provided for better control and movements.</p>



 The power to take informed decision 



<p>Al Rabie was able to achieve accurate forecasting during uncertain market conditions by developing 24-month rolling forecast models. In August 2022, they implemented product profitability by allocating common costs at the product and channel level, which provided immediate management decision-making capabilities.</p>



<p>Planning Analytics for Excel (PafE) user interface allowed business users to input budget numbers and make updates easily directly in Excel™, and input of data was widely simplified by the spreading out functionality. The Planning Analytics Workspace is another popular web interface that provides a unified platform for reporting and management of the budget process. The ad hoc quick analysis using drag and drop functionality of dimensions in a cube has enabled them to perform quick analysis and make informed decisions.</p>



 According to Shaker Hazaimeh, the PMO Manager at Al Rabie: 



<p>“When the company decided to improve and enhance their budgeting system, different solutions have been evaluated. The most fulfilling solution has been selected was IBM Planning Analytics with Watson. And from IBM partners, 1 Direction Global has been selected for their experience in IBM products, their commitment and dedication. It was a pleasure to work with 1 Direction Global on this project as they were very cooperative and very helpful. Both teams have done a great job in managing this project, meeting business expectations, and achieving its success.”</p>



 According to Bruno Albi CA, the Director Financial Reporting Analysis at Al Rabie: 



<p>“IBM Planning Analytics with Watson implemented by 1Direction Global has enabled the business to reduce the cycle times for budgeting and forecasting due to its powerful capabilities of capturing changes and updating all the budget modules to the profit and loss statement.&nbsp; By eliminating error prone and manual processes previously done using excel files and reliant on multiple data sources and over reliance on the IT department, the time to complete the annual budget was reduced from typical 60 days to 15 days.&nbsp; All analytics and presentations are also now linked to Planning Analytics Engine (TM1) and therefore any change flows through seamlessly within a short time.&nbsp; Likewise, the monthly forecast process has become highly efficient and granular – sales and contribution can be drilled down by product, channel, geographical location, and this greatly helps with profit planning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Planning Analytics’ profitability analysis module that was implemented by 1Direction Global expert team helps to analyze profitability by each SKU by channel and GEO and identify opportunities for profit improvement and take corrective action.</p>



<p>Future project on the cards is to automate the cash flow planning using IBM Planning Analytics with Watson capabilities.”</p>



 In my words as the Co-founder and Managing Director at 1Direction Global: 



<p>“Al Rabie IT &amp; Finance team approached us for issues using spreadsheets for Budgeting &amp; Forecasting process and did not have integrated solution for actual figures. By using our expertise knowledge and best practices we built multiple models successfully.”</p>



<p>The success of Planning Analytics has encouraged Al Rabie to expand the solution to other departments and use cases such as Outsourced planning, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow model.</p>



<p>The story of Al Rabie is a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation. By adopting an integrated approach to planning analysis and reporting, they were able to overcome their budgeting and forecasting challenges and achieve their goals. Their partnership with 1 Direction Global and IBM has enabled them to stay competitive and adapt to changing market conditions. Al Rabie and their commitment to excellence is an inspiration to us all.</p>

<p>Trust is the cornerstone on which the banking industry is built. When consumers lose trust in a bank’s ability to manage risk, the system stops working. We’ve seen what follows—financial crises, bailouts, destruction of capital, and losses of jobs. Put simply, consumers trust banks to keep their money safe and return the money when requested.<br><br>But there’s trust on the business side, too. Banks and their employees place trust in their risk models to help ensure the bank maintains liquidity even in the worst of times. This trust depends on an understanding of the data that inform risk models: where does it come from, where is it being used, and what are the ripple effects of a change?</p>



 Maintaining trust in data 



<p>Today, large banks are implementing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/journey-to-ai/2021/07/how-do-banks-deliver-governed-data-access-across-their-organization/">data governance solutions</a> to streamline data discovery, ensure the quality of data assets and manage data privacy. Moreover, banks must stay in compliance with industry regulations like BCBS 239, which focus on improving banks’ risk data aggregation and risk reporting capabilities. To help stay compliant, these organizations need to verify the accuracy and completeness of the data elements used in risk models. This can ensure that the decisions made are reliable and of high quality.</p>



<p>Before a bank can start the process of certifying a risk model, they first need to understand what data is being used and how it changes as it moves from a database to a model.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-51583">Read this e-book on building strong governance foundations</a>



 Why automated data lineage is crucial for success 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lineage">Data lineage</a>, the process of tracking the flow of data over time from origin to destination within a data pipeline, is essential to understand the full lifecycle of data and ensure regulatory compliance. The value of data lineage applies across all industries, but there are three key focuses when you consider it for banking use cases:</p>



 1. Mapping data movement 



<p>Data lineage solutions help banks map data movement from source systems and databases through processing and transformation pipelines to end use in risk models or reports. With an accurate view of the entire system, banks can more easily track down issues like missing or inconsistent data.</p>



 2. Auditing processes and impact analysis 



<p>With an automated lineage solution, banks can audit their processes and complete impact analysis to identify potential compliance violations before they become a problem by delivering a comprehensive view of data. This level of visibility also helps ensure that changes made over time don’t introduce new risks into the organization, can make it easier for banks to stay within regulatory guidelines, and helps ensure banks can respond quickly to changing business needs.</p>



 3. Maintaining precise risk management reports 



<p>An automated data lineage solution allows banks to maintain a high level of precision in their risk management reports without the need to manually crawl through source code. This is crucial for helping comply with regulatory principles, such as the ones outlined in BCBS 239, that require banks to generate risk data accurately and in a timely fashion.</p>



<p>Data lineage solutions provide banks with the tools and technology to ensure compliance, maintain data trust, and improve their risk models. By understanding the flow of data throughout the organization, banks can be more confident that they are accurately reporting on risks. This level of transparency is essential to maintaining consumer confidence in banking institutions around the world.</p>



 IBM’s data lineage solution for banking regulatory compliance 



<p>For helping clients take advantage of data lineage, we recommend <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data">IBM Cloud Pak for Data</a> for several reasons. Data engineers can scan data connections into&nbsp;IBM Cloud Pak for Data&nbsp;to automatically retrieve a complete technical lineage and a summarized view including information on data quality and business metadata for additional context. Users can capture data lineage consistently and accurately through automated scanning of 3rd party technologies like databases, ETL jobs, and BI tools using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/K3ZXDZNW">Data lineage in Watson Knowledge Catalog</a>, which is included in IBM Cloud Pak for Data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, with the data lineage capabilities of Cloud Pak for Data, every operation—whether in a database, integration, or an analysis tool—is reverse-engineered to create a map telling the story from data source to end application providing the deep technical lineage that data engineers need, historical versioning to view changes over time, and business context so that any user can quickly understand the journey of the data used in a risk report.</p>

			 Transform the Data Into a JSON That Maps to the Credential Template  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Then we loop over each row of user information, storing each property in &nbsp;<code>credentialValues</code>&nbsp; that corresponds with the credential template we previously defined. In the next step this JSON blob will be signed and become a verifiable credential.</p>

<p>At this year’s National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) convention, the <a href="https://theemmys.tv/tech-74th-award-recipients/">IBM sports and entertainment team accepted an Emmy® Award</a> for its advancements in curating sports highlights through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).</p>



<p>The Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy awards recognize individuals or organizations whose work provides “extensive improvement on existing methods” or whose contributions are “so innovative in nature that they have materially affected television.”</p>



<p>IBM was granted the award for an ensemble of AI and ML technologies that help people consume broadcast content in new ways. These include computer vision and sound recognition systems that help automate curation and editing of exciting moments in sports; systems that extract summaries or factoids from vast amounts of structured and unstructured natural language data; and systems that forecast and predict player performance and winners. These technologies have also enabled “second screen” synchronization that now routinely complements broadcast television on linear channels.</p>



<p>These innovations create a symbiotic relationship between content and the audience, on-air talent and production and post-production workflows for many of the world’s most high-profile sports and entertainment events. These include the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sports/masters/">Masters</a>, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sports/grammys/">GRAMMYs</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sports/usopen/">US Open Tennis</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/campaign/wimbledon">Wimbledon</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sports/fantasy/">ESPN</a>.</p>



 Long-term partnerships foster innovation 



<p>Though organizations can quickly realize business value by adopting high-impact technologies such as hybrid cloud or intelligent automation, the kind of industry-changing transformation that the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences (NATAS) has recognized doesn’t happen overnight. It requires forethought, planning and collaboration.</p>



<p>“The IBM sports and entertainment team got to take home the Emmy, but credit for the award should be shared with the many client organizations who trusted us and collaborated with us to build and implement their technology roadmaps over the longer term,” said Noah Syken, Vice President of Sports and Entertainment Partnerships at IBM. “When clients set a goal two or three years down the line, we can bring all the pieces together incrementally and tap into technologies as they emerge. They also get to collaborate with the great minds on our team who understand how to bring these capabilities to life in new and amazing ways.”</p>



<p>Over decades of long partnerships with its clients, IBM Consulting has developed a proven collaborative approach that delivers similarly impactful results in many sectors, though most go unrecognized by a statuette. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage">IBM Garage™ methodology</a> integrates business strategy, design and technology to help organizations transform their business from ideation to building to scaling.</p>



 Dreaming big with the Masters 



<p>Many of the technologies recognized by NATAS were embodied in IBM’s work with the Masters Tournament. For example, in the Masters app, the My Group feature lets viewers create a personalized highlight reel of their favorite golfers, powered by AI.</p>



<p>How did this come about? Syken recalls a pivotal collaborative session with the Augusta National Golf Club. “In one of our IBM Garage sessions we had with the Masters team, around 2015, we encouraged them to dream up a crazy idea, no idea too outlandish, let’s put them up on the board.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;One idea was creating an AI director that could understand what was happening on the course and who was competing, and then contextualize and prioritize the highlights for broadcast viewers. This idea became a North Star that helped the IBM Consulting and Masters teams build out their technological capabilities. They realized the system would not only need to capture and analyze every shot from every hole, it would also need to capture other data that improved understanding, such as the level of crowd noise.</p>



<p>Though these capabilities didn’t exist in 2015, the IBM team, led by Stephen Hammer, Sports CTO and Distinguished Engineer at IBM Consulting, Monica Ellingson, Sports Practice Lead, and Aaron Baughman, Distinguished Engineer of AI and Cloud at IBM Consulting, could begin guiding the research to make the dream a reality.</p>



 Exploring trends and leveraging technologies for clients 



<p>Another integral role that the IBM team takes on in its partnerships is to identify marketplace trends: how other organizations are aggregating data and adding value, and how IBM can incorporate these advances in unique ways.</p>



<p>“Through our partnership with ESPN we recognized that fifteen million people play on their fantasy football apps every week, and we could add value with AI,” says Syken. “Aaron Baughman and the team started to think about how we can enrich that experience, and that led to our ability to provide analysis and predictions and context to fantasy football players to help them make better selections.”</p>



<p>“Our work on ESPN Fantasy Football ended up advancing the broadcast TV experience, because the ESPN commentators would use some of our work to figure out what to say on-air,” says Baughman. “They would look at the boom-and-bust projections, figure out which players were most likely to play with hidden injuries or play in meaningful minutes, what their score spread would be, which players were most likely to be traded—then put commentary around it.”</p>



<p>“The technologies we invented and created together became a beachhead that helped IBM change the way broadcast TV is consumed and ultimately enjoyed,” says Baughman. “The innovations around AI and automatic workflows that aid in predictive analysis for football can also apply to coverage of other sports. The computer vision and sound technology that we developed for golf could be applied to tennis and soccer broadcasts.”</p>



 Pioneering use of unstructured text data 



<p>For over a decade, IBM has been gathering insight from unstructured data (such as that used in large language models) to provide real-time insight to its sports and entertainment clients and to enhance predictive analysis.</p>



<p>“Sports fans are very accustomed to the numbers: the facts and figures, how far did the ball go, how fast did the athlete run, how much do they win or lose? And those are the things that determine ranking,” says Syken. “That’s only good to a point, because when you get up to the tournament time, how they’re playing right now is really important. The reporter who says or writes, you know, I watched a player in practice yesterday and her ankle’s hurting—that can have a real impact. Our systems let us incorporate that report with structured data to make better predictions.” Such systems that combine structured and unstructured data are used in the US Open and Wimbledon apps to deliver better predictions about player performance.</p>



<p>These technologies also improve the second screen experience, where viewers refer to their mobile device or computer while watching a live broadcast. “A fan watching the US Open can look at a player’s likelihood to win and say, wait a second, why is this player supposed to lose this match?” says Baughman. “They can read media mentions or look at ‘by the numbers’ where we write sentences based on past performance in the current tournament. All these insights are put together to tell the story around a tennis player to augment their broadcast TV experience.”</p>



<p>“We also use unstructured data for the GRAMMYs, using a technology called extractive summarization,” says Baughman. “We burn factoids into the live stream that pop up in the video as the artists walk down the red carpet.”</p>



 An honor beyond technology 



<p>“Though the Emmy award IBM received is for technology and engineering, we also see it as a validation of our human-centered processes and the IBM Garage approach,” says Syken. “As teams from IBM Consulting build capabilities through each client engagement, they also build trust that enables long-term partnerships. And that leads to innovations that can change an industry.”</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Why it’s time to move to high assurance passwordless MFA with physical proximity.</p>
<p>The most common MFA authenticators are vulnerable because they do not have a proximity-based factor as a requirement.</p>
<p>The cybercrime marketplace of offering stolen credentials to enable access-as-a-service attacks continues to dominate the <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/sale-of-stolen-credentials-and-initial-access-dominate-dark-web-markets">market with a 6 fold increase in number of credentials stolen by malware</a>.</p>
<p>Passwords as the single factor of authentication has become a thing of the past and many security conscious organizations have now adopted multi-factor authentication (MFA) as the standard. MFA incorporates the use of multiple factors when authenticating a user, such as knowledge (something a user knows), inference (something a user is), and possession (something a user has).</p>
<p>However, as the threat landscape grows we have seen from <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/uber-breach-external-contractor-mfa-bombing-attack">recent cyber-attacks</a> in the news that MFA is no longer enough to prevent breaches from account takeover (ATO) attacks. In addition to username passwords, attackers are also gathering contextual information such as browser version and geographical information to enable MFA bypass attacks. Some common MFA-based attacks are the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM swap attack</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/09/vulnerable-mfa-mfa-prompt-bombing/">MFA prompt bombing</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-aitm-phishing-attack/">Adversary in The Middle</a>&nbsp;(AiTM). These attacks are getting more sophisticated and successful at breaching an organization’s defense.</p>
<p>Why physical proximity should be a required MFA factor</p>
<p>As seen in most of the attacks that overcome MFA, these attacks are launched remotely and are able to bypass MFA controls in place. Having a requirement of physical proximity as a required factor for MFA, in addition to the other factors of knowledge (something a user knows), inference (something a user is), and possession (something a user has) helps protect against remote based ATO attacks.</p>
<p>If we look at some of the most common MFA authenticators, we can see that most of these are vulnerable as they do not have a proximity based factor as a requirement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, high assurance PKI-based mobile smart credential login, FIDO2 keys and passkeys (FIDO2 multi-device credentials) all require physical proximity as a requirement to authenticate a user. In addition, these authenticators eliminate the use of passwords, instead using the concept of cryptographic key pairs to authenticate a user.</p>
<p>Consider PKI based mobile smart credential and passkeys below:</p>
<p>PKI based mobile smart credentials – This high assurance <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login?utm_source=CSO-Online&amp;utm_medium=ext-site&amp;utm_campaign=Mar23-IAM-Passwordless-CSO-Blog-Link&amp;utm_content=Passwordless&amp;edc_sfid=7015Y0000044VhEQAU">passwordless authentication</a> works by installing a digital smart credential on a user’s smartphone transforming their smartphone into a trusted device. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udGrvxPWW4k">When a user wants to authenticate to a device</a> such as a laptop, desktop or other workstation and are in close physical proximity to this device, they are prompted to authenticate themselves using biometrics on their smartphone, with the mobile smart credential. Once authenticated with biometrics, they gain access to the laptop or desktop and can also gain access to all apps and accounts using single sign-on capabilities. When they walk away from their laptop or desktop, they are automatically logged off. The process of triggering authentication on the user’s smartphone happens via Bluetooth, ensuring the user in close physical proximity to the device they are logging on to, protecting against remote based ATO attacks.</p>
<p>Passkeys – <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passkeys?utm_source=CSO-Online&amp;utm_medium=ext-site&amp;utm_campaign=Mar23-IAM-Passwordless-CSO-Blog-Link&amp;utm_content=Passkeys&amp;edc_sfid=7015Y0000044VhFQAU">Passkeys</a> let you sign in or log on to applications and services without passwords or even usernames if configured that way. They are digital credentials in the form of cryptographic key pairs, with the public key stored on the application server and a private key stored on your device that can be accessed via biometrics authentication on your device. Using passkeys to log in to applications and services make it seamless and easy to use, just like you would unlock your phone with Face ID or other biometrics. When a user tries to log in to an application, the application issues a security challenge to the user’s registered device via Bluetooth. The user is then prompted to authenticate via biometrics to accept the sign-in request, which is signed with the private key on the user’s registered device and sent back to the application to be verified with the corresponding public key, after which the user is signed in if successful.</p>
<p>The above high assurance authenticators combine the best of both worlds – MFA and passwordless and utilizes cryptographic key pairs and proximity factor to ensure a phishing resistant and seamless user experience for users to authenticate themselves.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve moved on from plain passwords to MFA and the bad actors have also caught up to finding ways to beat the traditional MFA configurations, it’s time to move to high assurance passwordless MFA with physical proximity as a required factor.</p>

<p>“If you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy.” ~ Ann Cavoukian</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Dr Ann Cavoukian is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts. Dr Cavoukian served an unprecedented three terms as the Information &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. There she created Privacy by Design, a framework that seeks to proactively embed privacy into the design specifications of information technologies, networked infrastructure and business practices, thereby achieving the strongest protection possible. In 2010, International Privacy Regulators unanimously passed a Resolution recognising Privacy by Design as an International Standard. Since then, PbD has been translated into 40 languages! In 2018, PbD was included in a sweeping new law in the EU: the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>Dr Cavoukian is now the Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design Centre. She is also a Senior Fellow of the Ted Rogers Leadership Centre at Ryerson University, and a Faculty Fellow of the Centre for Law, Science &amp; Innovation at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.</p>

<blockquote><p>“One of the really challenging things about privacy and security is if you don’t bake it in at the lower layers, if you don’t build that foundation, it’s really hard to go back and put it into a product or service afterwards.” ~ Katryna Dow</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Katryna Dow&nbsp;is the founder and CEO of&nbsp;Meeco; a personal data &amp; distributed ledger platform that enables people to securely exchange data via the API-of-Me with the people and organisations they trust. Katryna has been pioneering personal data rights since 2002, when she envisioned a time when personal sovereignty, identity and contextual privacy would be as important as being connected. Now within the context of GDPR and Open Banking, distributed ledger, cloud, AI and IoT have converged to make&nbsp;Meeco&nbsp;both possible and necessary.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Today we’re happy to bring you a new episode of our Identity Stories Series. Privacy by Design has just become an ISO standard, which we want to celebrate, so let’s go back in time and hear moments of this journey.</p>
<p>Let’s first hear from Privacy by Design’s creator herself, Dr Ann Cavoukian. She is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts and she served an unprecedented three terms as the Information &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Dr Ann Cavoukian welcome back to Let’s talk about digital identity.</p>
<p>Ann Cavoukian: Thank you so much Oscar. It’s a pleasure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Use a time machine and bring us to the moment in which you started writing Privacy by Design.</p>
<p>Ann: We’ll have to go back to the nineties. So, I was first appointed Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada, and I think ‘97. And when I was appointed commissioner, I joined the office, which consisted of brilliant lawyers, and they took, of course, a legal approach to protecting privacy, applying the law after a privacy harm had arisen.</p>
<p>But you see, I’m not a lawyer. I’m a psychologist. I took a very different view of how we should protect privacy in addition to legal means. I wanted something that would prevent the privacy harms from arising. I wanted to have a model of prevention that was proactive, baked into the code, baked into your operations, so that ideally, we can have fewer privacy infractions and data breaches.</p>
<p>And this is a very different approach to the legal one. So literally at my kitchen table over three nights, I created Privacy by Design, and then I took it in, and I sold it to my lawyers. And it didn’t take long, but it was a different approach. And I said, look, this will complement regulatory compliance, which is after the fact, applying a privacy law, after a privacy harm has arisen.</p>
<p>That’s very, very valuable. But I want ideally to minimise the number of privacy harms that arise. And that’s what Privacy by Design is all about. So, they got that. It was a win-win and they liked it. And away we went. And Privacy by Design has grown dramatically since then. It’s been translated into 40 languages. We’ve had great success with it.</p>
<p>Oscar: How was the whole journey since that time until now, 2023? Has the road to becoming an ISO standard been a bumpy road?</p>
<p>Ann: It’s always a bumpy road, there’s no question. But I had great fortune. I was very lucky in 2010. Privacy by Design was unanimously passed as an international standard by the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection authorities in Brussels. So immediately in the privacy community, it grew enormously. And then when, the new law in the European Union, the General Data Protection regulation, was introduced or came into effect in 2018.</p>
<p>My Privacy by Design was included in the GDPR as well as privacy as the default, which is the second of seven foundational principles of Privacy by Design. This was huge. It being recognised like that was just such a huge development and it took hold globally because everyone around the world wants to do business with Europe and engage in business and trade with the European Union.</p>
<p>So, lots of countries started doing Privacy by Design. And whenever there was a new law that was developed, a privacy law like Brazil last year, they included Privacy by Design in it. So, it really took off. So, when ISO started considering including it as an international standard, that took years in the making. I mean, it just came into effect this year.</p>
<p>But my colleague Michelle Chibba, who’s amazing, I mean, she’s been sitting on committee meetings for the past, I don’t know, three, four or five years with ISO in, in an effort to make Privacy by Design an ISO standard. But we succeeded and that’s the whole thing. It is now an international standard, ISO 31700. And it’s all over the world.</p>
<p>It’s already becoming embraced by countries who recognise the value of ISO standards. So literally, I’m delighted by this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. I can hear your, your voice of success when you are sharing this journey. And congratulations for that, of course.</p>
<p>Ann: Thank you.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: If you were wondering what are these ‘7 principles’, let’s hear now Dr Ann Cavoukian explaining the 7 foundational principles of Privacy by Design.&nbsp;Starting with Principle #1 Proactive not Reactive.</p>
 
<p>Ann: The first one ‘prevent the harms. You want to be proactive so that you could prevent the harms from arising. It’s very, very clear.</p>
<p>The second one is privacy as the default setting. And that’s– I talked about that quite a bit. It’s absolutely critical, in fact, it’s considered to be so important. When they enacted the GDPR in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, they included not only my Privacy by Design, but specifically privacy as the default setting as well. So that’s very important.</p>
<p>The third one embedded in design is absolutely critical. If it’s not baked into the code into your operations, it’s going to be overlooked.</p>
<p>The fourth one you have to have, what I always say full functionality. Get rid of the zero-sum mindset of privacy versus security, or privacy versus data utility. It can’t be either, or, win, lose. It has to be win-win, privacy and data utility. You make a positive sum, and you get multiple positive gains, privacy and security always intertwined.</p>
<p>And the next one talking about security. While the term privacy subsumes a much broader set of protections and security alone, in this day and age of daily hacking and phishing, if you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end, with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy. So, start with a solid foundation of security throughout your entire organisation.</p>
<p>Give individuals access to their own data. I always say to companies and governments, you may have custody and control of someone’s data, but it doesn’t belong to you, it belongs to the data subject. So, give them the right of access that they have, allow them to gain access to personal information you have on them. And companies actually have come back to me, companies that are certified for Privacy by Design, and they say, “We love this. We love this principle. Because once we give customers access to their own data, they come back to us and say – No, no, that’s no longer the case. That was true about me two years ago, here’s what’s going on now.” So, they correct the information. They increase the accuracy of the information we hold. And it increases the quality of the data we have. So, they love it.</p>
<p>And the last principle, keep it user centric. When you keep it focused on the user, all of this flows out. Because it should all be around the individual, when it’s personal information you’re dealing with. Because personal information is about identifiable individuals. So, you have to keep it focused on the user, and what they permit, what they don’t permit, things of that nature. So that’s it. Seven foundational principles by design.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Despite all the recognition that Privacy by Design has received for two decades, and the influence it has had in regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, we saw that the vast majority of Internet products and services still didn’t use the seven foundational principles. An urgent push was necessary. What would help us make waves of such magnitude? Nothing better than a global standard published by the International Organisation for Standardisation, the ISO.</p>
<p>ISO standards are recognised by governments, regulatory bodies, and industry associations around the world, so becoming an ISO standard would increase the adoption of Privacy by Design and it would be recognised globally. It is not easy to become an ISO standard, with thorough review processes including, expert opinions, public consultation, and a vote by ISO members.</p>
<p>On 2018, a technical committee called ISO/PC 317 Consumer protection: Privacy by Design for consumer goods and services was created. Four more years, and all the efforts of this group of motivated and brilliant minds from all over the world came to fruition. On February 8th, 2023, the standard was published with the name “ISO 31700-1:2023 Consumer protection — Privacy by Design for consumer goods and services”.</p>
<p>Let’s now hear from another guest a perspective of a tech entrepreneur who has been incorporating Privacy by Design in their products.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: We are welcoming back Katryna Dow, who is CEO and founder at Meeco. Hello, Katryna.</p>
<p>Katryna Dow: Hello. It’s nice to be back. Thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Katryna, how has Privacy by Design influenced you?</p>
<p>Katryna: Well, I’m very privileged. If I think back to when Ann Cavoukian and the Canadian government were at the forefront of bringing the concept of Privacy by Design into the world. I was the recipient of an early Privacy by Design Ambassador Award and I think that was twofold.</p>
<p>One, because after reading about the principles of Privacy by Design, we immediately decided to bake those things into the development of Meeco as a product. So architecturally, to adopt them. And secondly, we were invited, around 2016, to submit a consultation to the Canadian government in support of Privacy by Design, and really in support of why it was important from a technology design perspective and actually how it could make a difference.</p>
<p>We all remember, a lot of this thinking was pre GDPR. This was kind of at the forefront of the concept of considering for citizens. Initially, Canadians and now all around the world, this idea of taking a principle of privacy and considering it in every aspect of the design of a product or service.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you. And on your opinion, how has Privacy by Design influenced digital identity as an industry?</p>
<p>Katryna: So, I think it’s an interesting question about digital identity. Optimistically, I guess what we’ve seen with the advent and the evolution and the maturing of Self-Sovereign identity. At the heart of that are principles around human centred design and control. So, I think there are great parallels with Privacy by Design. However, if we step back and look at the whole digital identity landscape, I’m not sure that it has had a wide enough impact in the design of systems.</p>
<p>Certainly, large tech platforms or even some governments have not really thought about that human centred Privacy by Design, progressive disclosure, anchoring core part. And as a result of that, I think in the digital identity landscape, we have lots of really great systems and solutions, but they’re not always designed from a human centric or Privacy by Design point of view.</p>
<p>And I guess one topical example of that recently with the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and then opening up Twitter blue for everyone and not having a proper process in place for verification or identity protection in any way. We all saw that. That was a very short-lived example of what happens if you don’t understand some of the foundation principles of identity privacy, and if you don’t design from that perspective of understanding, you want to in one way protect the individual, but another way to be able to open up that identity for authentication, authorisation or access to trusted parties in a progressive way.</p>
<p>So, I think sometimes that balance, we don’t see enough in the design of digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: If you have some final idea, you would like to share about Privacy by design?</p>
<p>Katryna: I think one of the things that we’ve noticed just recently, being involved in a community project, where privacy and security were acknowledged to be important, but not enough to slow down architecture and design. So, the desire was to be able to build something really quickly and get it out into the community.</p>
<p>And one of the really challenging things about privacy and security is if you don’t bake it in at the lower layers, if you don’t build that foundation, it’s really hard to go back and put it into a product or service afterwards. I sometimes think about building a house. You imagine if you, if you didn’t put down a strong foundation and you were building on sand and then you went back later and you wanted to try and reinforce that structure, it’s not impossible, but it’s costly.</p>
<p>It takes time and it creates all sorts of adjacent problems, particularly if you’re building a digital system. So, I think I would encourage people to think it may slow down architecture, it may slow down consensus, it may slow down the beginning of a project, but it means you can go much, much faster once you’re up and running. And it also means that you’ve not created technical debt, policy, debt, compliance, debt that you will have to circle back and address later on.</p>
<p>So, it’s definitely worth investing that time upfront and building on a strong foundation.</p>
<p>Oscar: I couldn’t agree more. There was an excellent analogy in the very visual analogy that help us understand the importance of Privacy by Design.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: The stories that Katryna Dow just shared with us might sound like we’re still in a sombre passage of this journey. But it shouldn’t surprise us. Designing Internet services is only getting more complex: tight deadlines, limited budgets, scarcity of technical experts, all this determines and shapes the outcome. And those new applications are built to help the lives of millions of citizens, students, patients, and people of all ages.</p>
<p>At this crossroads, how can we make sure that this ISO standard builds the required momentum so what we’ll see in the next years is an avalanche of services that really protect our privacy?</p>
 
<p>Oscar: So now that it has become an ISO standard, what is the impact of having Privacy by design an ISO standard?</p>
<p>Ann: I think the impact will be significant because you see we’re struggling right now at a time where surveillance is mounting steadily mounting on a daily basis. We need massive intervention to put the brakes on it. And with Privacy by Design, being recognised as an ISO standard, that will draw so much more attention to privacy, embedding it proactively into the design of your operations. Into AI, artificial intelligence. We have to embed privacy into this from the beginning in order for it to take.</p>
<p>And that’s why I’m so excited about the timing of this, because it will attract a lot of attention to privacy, and privacy forms the foundation of our freedom. If you want free and open societies, you have to have freedom. And this will help to preserve freedom. So, ISO standards, marrying with Privacy by Design. The sky’s the limit – privacy and freedom. </p>
<p>And also, privacy and security go hand in hand. While privacy subsumes a much broader set of protections than security alone in this day and age of massive phishing and ransomware attacks, and all this, if you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy. So, you have to have privacy and security by design.</p>
<p>Oscar: No doubt. Is there something else you would like to tell or share?</p>
<p>Ann: And what I want to remind people is please don’t be alarmed by the odds. Meaning people say to me, you know, I tweet every morning, I have a large Twitter following and I tweet about the latest stories of the day. And someone invariably will come back to me and say, Lady, give it up. That ship has had sailed.</p>
<p>Privacy is dead. And I go back again. Another friggin ship. You don’t give up on privacy. You don’t give up on freedom just because the odds are small. They’re getting bigger. But you look at what is important to preserve. Freedom is the most important thing to me to preserve. I’m Armenian. I come from a background, in 1915, 1.5 million Armenians were killed.</p>
<p>It’s you don’t give up. You know, that’s the whole point. You always come back. You never give up on freedom. And so, I just urge people don’t be alarmed at the odds that it seems to be overwhelming that we can’t do this. Yes, you can. We can do this. We have to do this. We want to preserve freedom for ourselves, for our children, for the future. We must do this. So please stay with me and embed privacy into your operations.</p>
<p>And one last thing. If you do shopping, either online or in real stores physically, if you express an interest in privacy, you will get so much more protection. You can imagine I always ask what they’re going to do with my information. I’m at a store, they’re asking for my postal code or this or that, and I say, “Oh, and how will you be protecting my privacy?” The guy I’m dealing with doesn’t know, but he’ll go get the manager, and the manager will say, “Oh, you care about privacy. Here’s what we can do. Boom, boom, boom.” And immediately the protections go up.</p>
<p>So just express your interest in privacy and see how much more protection it will lead to. It’s a win-win.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Privacy is not only an Internet issue, a technology issue, it follows us everywhere we go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a kitchen table to an ISO standard, the world just saw how Privacy by Design arrived to this elusive, but crucial destination.</p>
<p>What’s our next milestone on this journey? The road that will come can be long and bumpy but as Dr Ann Cavoukian said, it’s never time to give up.</p>

<p>#BendNotBreak</p><p>In this series of 4 blogs we are exploring the emerging work that we are undertaking in partnership with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a>. The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. As always, we would welcome your comments and feedback so please do get in touch if you would like to contribute.</p> Blog 2 (of 4): Zooming out: thinking about the transition constraints and responses in the context of the wider political economy <p>“If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.” — Einstein</p><p>In the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">first blog</a> of this series, we explored how using different filters can help us to identify the constraints (and related opportunities) that exist in relation to a just transition. In this next reflection we would like to shift our attention, to consider the wider socio-economic context in which the built environment is&nbsp;nested.</p><p>As we zoom out to the broader context, what does this signify for the dominant trends? What happens when we combine a requirement (or even desire) for using less energy with a financial system that is tethered to that same resource? How realistic is dematerialisation as a response to increasing resource pressures, when this kind of strategy flies in the face of the prevailing economic logic? Improving resource use efficiency in manufacturing processes might align with reducing costs, but simply leaving minerals in the ground and thus forgoing or delaying profits does not. However much we disagree with this worldview, economic value is a reality that we must explain and understand if we want to build effective strategies. It is easy to shrug our shoulders and make comments like ‘it’s just the way it is’ or ‘capitalism is the problem’, but what exactly do we mean when we make such statements? What are the dominant forces or dynamics that are holding this kind of logic in&nbsp;place?</p><p>In our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">previous blog</a> we highlighted a concern about excluding an inequality filter from our constraints analysis. We would therefore like to pick this up here, by exploring some system dynamics that are fundamental to holding the current imagined order¹ and crippling levels of inequality in place. When we use the term system dynamics, we are referring to patterns and forces that play out across multiple areas of the systems that we interact with (e.g., political, ecological, cultural, physical).</p> Two examples of powerful system dynamics that are driving increasing levels of inequality and volatility <p>There are many excellent resources that consider these types of dynamics in depth (we can recommend some focused texts if you would like to look into anything mentioned in more detail), but the following examples highlight some key drivers and practical illustrations of how they manifest in the built environment.</p>  The finance / power / inequality dynamic  <p>‘It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.’ — Henry&nbsp;Ford</p><p>The fact that most of the money used in our economy is essentially created out of thin air, by bankers tapping digital numbers into existence, has been well documented². Less well publicised however, is the link between the seemingly benign mechanism of money creation and rising housing inequality. A good example of how this occurs is the practice of quantitative easing (QE) that began in Japan and has been used extensively by the Bank of England, the ECB and the American Federal Reserve. QE involves a Central Bank creating new digital money and using it to buy back government and corporate bonds (IOUs). The idea behind this process is to reboot a sluggish economy by reducing interest rates and making it easier for people to take out loans. Irrespective of whether this actually works, the process also results in the value of bonds rising (as the supply of bonds decreases the value of those that remain goes up). It also causes a general inflation of asset prices, as investments in the stock and property markets are closely linked to the bond markets. In short, those who are already wealthy and own assets benefit from QE, whilst those that don’t fall further behind. For&nbsp;example:</p>  In the 12 years since the financial crisis where QE has been liberally deployed, UK house price increases have far outstripped the growth in wages, with the UK first time buyer house price to earnings ratio rising from 4.3 to 5.6 in the past&nbsp;decade³.  In August 2020 at the height of the first Covid lockdown, western economies slumped to levels beyond the crash of 1929, whilst the FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 rose dramatically. On the face of it this made no sense — how could share prices be rising when the entire global economy had been put into standby? The answer was that the newly created credit was predominantly lent to large corporations, who as they didn’t need the money, used it to buy back their own shares. These buy-backs inflated both the company share prices and the management bonuses that were linked to them⁴. Many of those bonuses were used to buy additional properties, thus creating further upward pressure on house prices and compounding existing housing inequalities.  <p>In both of the above examples, the prioritisation of investors and asset prices over businesses and livelihoods was not a decision taken by citizens on behalf of society. It was a judgement made by bankers on behalf of existing asset holders, that dramatically increased both social and housing inequalities across the continent.</p><p>2. The energy / debt / growth&nbsp;dynamic</p><p>In our view this is one of the most important drivers in our current global economic and ecological situation, with severe consequences for the just element of Europe’s decarbonisation challenges. We see this as a chain of interlinked factors that will ultimately lead to increased economic volatility, with potentially devastating consequences for the most vulnerable members of&nbsp;society:</p>  Firstly, GDP (a proxy for the sum of everything that is bought and sold in the economy) is currently 99% correlated to energy consumption, whilst the relationship to material use is more like 100%. This means that at current economic forecasts of 2–3% GDP growth per year, we will double our energy and material use every 25 years. It is important to note that many prominent economists such as Dianne Coyle⁵ and Thomas Piketty⁶ have provided robust challenges to GDP being used as a measure of societal progress at all. However, as GDP growth is currently still the dominant measure of economic success globally, its correlation to resource use remains a central consideration.  To date, absolute decoupling of GDP from energy on a global scale has not been achieved, despite dramatic technological and efficiency gains⁷. This is largely driven by a rebound effect (often referred to as Jevron’s Paradox), whereby improvements in technological efficiency result in increased demand and greater resource consumption overall⁸. A good example of this can be seen in improved refrigeration technologies, because as the price of fridges has decreased our overall use of them has escalated (the average garage now offers more refrigerated goods than a supermarket would have stocked in the&nbsp;1970s).  <p>The Jevons paradox for energy consumption in the EU-27, 1995–2019</p>European Environment Agency&nbsp;[<a href="http://Figure%201.%20The%20Jevons%20paradox%20for%20energy%20consumption%20in%20the%20EU-27,%201995-2019">EEA</a>]  An additional issue is the impact of new debt which creates a future claim on energy, as its creation is currently entirely decoupled from our physical reality. To clarify, the creation of new debt does not automatically lead to growth; without the accompanying strategies proposed by MMT proponents such as <a href="https://stephaniekelton.com/">Stephanie Kelton</a>, the creation of new money would simply result in inflation. Instead, the availability of credit (and its associated interest) creates a future need to generate income by producing a good or service. This in turn equates to a forward claim on the energy that will be required to bring it into being. Thus, despite finance itself being a system without biophysical boundaries, the physical claims coded into its creation are essentially a contract with the future of the&nbsp;Earth⁹.  The levels of debt relative to GDP have steadily increased globally over the last decade (debt is doubling c.8.5 years compared to 25 years for GDP), showing that we are already struggling to service existing debt with current economic activities. As energy and resource costs rise and the quality of energy available decreases this issue will be magnified, fundamentally threatening the legitimacy of the global financial system.  <p>What happens when the music stops and we can’t make good on those embedded energy claims? Who will be the losers? After the 2008 crisis it was the lower income mortgage holders and general taxpayers who took the hit. As energy becomes scarce and expensive how will the risks be allocated? If we fail to address people’s needs at a rapid and inclusive scale (for example by implementing a continent-wide equitable repurposing of vacant space) it will be the poorest citizens of Europe who suffer the most. Unless we can fundamentally shift the relationship between how we finance real estate and its intrinsic value to society, initiatives aimed at repurposing space and retrofitting existing homes will remain as marginal interventions.</p> Introducing the economic matrix framework <p>“Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own.” ― Donella Meadows, Thinking in&nbsp;Systems</p><p>Thinking about these kinds of dynamics in addition to the constraint filters, whilst trying to make anything happen day to day, can leave our heads spinning. It feels impossible to know where to begin or which thread to pull at first. For us at least it doesn’t feel humanly possible, so we have tried to create a framework to pull everything together. By doing so, we have of course been forced to simplify and use reductionist assumptions. We are aware of the irony of trying to illustrate complex systems by putting things into conceptual boxes. We would ask you to hold it lightly, taking what’s useful and leaving what’s&nbsp;not.</p><p>In designing this model we have drawn on extraordinary thinkers from diverse disciplines. If you are interested in exploring this work in more depth, then we wholeheartedly recommend the following: Professor Beinhocker’s <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/files/Beinhocker-2020-Ontological-Frmwrk.pdf">Ontological stack</a>, Marvin Harris’s <a href="https://anthropology.ua.edu/theory/cultural-materialism/">Cultural Materialism</a>, <a href="https://civilizationemerging.com/media/">Daniel Schutemberger’s</a> analysis of our political economy, the International Futures Forum’s <a href="https://medium.com/activate-the-future/the-three-horizons-of-innovation-and-culture-change-d9681b0e0b0f">3 Horizons model</a> and of course Donella Meadows’ <a href="https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">Points to Intervene in a&nbsp;system</a>.</p><p>Part 1: framing our responses</p><p>The following 3 by 3 grid provides some prompts to think through how we can design responses to the different constraints, in the context of the systems we are working&nbsp;within.</p><p>On the vertical axis we have the different domains (or levels) of the system. We have summarised these into three umbrella domains to make it easier to visualise:</p>  The cultural suprastructure: this relates to the values, wisdom, spirituality, ways of being and ways of knowing that are dominant in our culture. This domain results in the collective sense-making of what it means to live a good life and it is this value system that then shapes the political and economic structures below.  Political &amp; economic domains (governance &amp; jurisprudence, finance &amp; investment, market logic and ownership patterns): these are the institutions and processes that determine how we organise society. They provide the system’s overall goals, rules, decision making structures, patterns of behaviour and information flows.  Physical domains (resource &amp; land use): The physical domains represent the material and ecological economies and ground the socio-economic and ontological domains in the systems’ biophysical reality.  <p>Across the horizontal axis we can start to think about specific constraints and responses:</p>  Constraints: these blocks can be viewed as physical (e.g. biodiversity, energy, labour, materials), structural (e.g. money creation, embedded inequality, private property rights) or psychological (e.g. failure of the imagination).  Systemic capabilities: to unlock and repattern the structural blocks, we will need to create new capabilities in the system. Examples could include democratising money creation, embedding beyond GDP metrics in national policy, creating a new material economy or reimagining land as a common&nbsp;asset.  Pathways: these are the practical tools and pathways that can be used to start building towards the systemic capabilities.  <p>Once we have identified a constraint, we can use the matrix to think more granularly about the implications for a just transition. To bring this idea to life we have worked through two potential strategies that were highlighted in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">Blog 1</a> of this series, to give examples at each intersection of the&nbsp;matrix:</p><p>(A) Consider a no (or low) build future: If we can’t build the required volume of low carbon homes, how can we intensify our use of existing&nbsp;ones?</p><p>This strategy suggestion was driven primarily by physical constraints; i.e. intensifying pressures on energy and material resources. It was also however in consideration of inflated land and asset prices, which are excluding increasing numbers of people from home ownership.</p><p>(B) Embrace low-tech dematerialisation: If we cannot feasibly mine or recycle the materials needed, how can we radically adapt the way that we use&nbsp;them?</p><p>Reducing our material throughput cannot be left to individual choice alone as people still have to live and operate in the existing system. Instead, we need to recognise the main factors that are holding a linear material economy in place, so that we can think practically about how they can be&nbsp;shifted.</p><p>Part 2: visualising the response pathways over different time&nbsp;horizons</p><p>A second step that we find helpful in looking for response pathways is to think about the desired capabilities over different timeframes. Some issues are immediately threatening and require rapid mitigation responses, whilst others will play out over the longer-term and invite us to think more tactically. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.internationalfuturesforum.com/three-horizons">IFF’s 3-Horizon model</a>, we have begun to think about these time-bound responses in three tranches, that intersect vertically through the system domains as shown in the following matrix:</p><p>Taking the example above of dematerialisation we can break the potential response pathways down by timeframe. For example, if we take the pathway of citizen engagement:</p>  A mitigation response to the cost of living and energy crisis might be to ask citizens to temporarily reduce their electricity consumption;  A more transitional approach may be to introduce wide scale citizen assemblies, to debate how to live better with&nbsp;less;  A transformational pathway could be to work towards a new form of democracy, where citizens’ views on limited resource use are continuously consulted using digital technologies.  <p>Or, if we are thinking about promoting a circular&nbsp;economy:</p>  An immediate response could be to provide easily accessible recycling facilities for household devices;  An example of a transitional initiative can be seen in France where they have introduced an obsolescence law, which requires manufacturers to comply with a repairability index¹⁰;  In terms of a transformational strategy, we could start thinking about a planetary level governance mechanism for total material use, to bring it back inside the earth’s carrying capacity.  Combing the the 3*3 grids to illustrate the full response&nbsp;matrix<p>We do not believe that each type of response will intersect with every level of the system. In some triage situations for example, the appropriate response may be limited to an immediate governmental intervention, such as imposing lockdowns during the Covid crisis. Furthermore, in categorising the pathways, we are not attempting to create a hierarchy of responses, or to prioritise transformational pathways over mitigation tools. In our view, we will need to think and act over multiple timeframes using diverse system leverage points. Our goal with this framework is to probe the problem space, to try and make different elements of the system easier to visualise and thus to interact with. We hope that by doing this we can begin to identify gaps in the existing response landscape, thus promoting flexible precision in the response pathways we choose to pursue. As always we would welcome your feedback and suggestions so that we can modify and improve this conceptual tool.</p><p>In our next Blog (3 of 4) we will introduce an emerging community of just transition practitioners, that we have had the privilege of engaging with during this project. This has been both a challenging and exciting journey, where we have embraced the idea of working out loud, using the framework introduced above to guide our work. We will endeavour to share what we have learned so far, together with areas of our analysis that require strengthening and developing.</p><p>The Dark Matter project team who co-authored this blog are Emily Harris (emily@darkmatterlabs), Aleksander Nowak (Aleks@darkmatterlabs), Vlad Afanasiev (vlad@darkmatterlabs) and Indy Johar (indy@darkmatterlabs).</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) The ‘imagined order’ is a term used by the Oxford economist <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/events/new-economic-and-moral-foundations-for-the-anthropocene-with-prof-eric-beinhocker/">Eric Beinhocker</a> to describe a series of stories told by the elite to justify their position in&nbsp;society</p><p>(2) <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-in-the-modern-economy-an-introduction">https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-in-the-modern-economy-an-introduction</a></p><p>(3) <a href="https://www.nationwidehousepriceindex.co.uk/resources/ftb-hper-by-region">https://www.nationwidehousepriceindex.co.uk/resources/ftb-hper-by-region</a></p><p>(4) <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?dfMaqQ">The future of the Left in Europe with Yanis Varoufakis | Ep.33’.

 <p></p><p>You may know what a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> is or even how to generate one, but you may be wondering: what’s the point of yet ANOTHER way to identify myself? To get a better sense of the why behind decentralized identifiers, we’ll discuss the real problems society faces today when it comes to identity, and why DIDs are an enormous practical solution to a pervasive set of problems.</p> Identity<a title="Direct link to Identity">​</a> <p>Whether or not you consider yourself an “online” person, there are a million ways we currently identify ourselves. Do you have an email address? That’s an identity. A driver’s license? Another one there. A Twitter handle? An Instagram account? A phone number? Check, check, check. There are a seemingly incalculable number of ways we can be identified and reached in today’s day and age.</p><p>Today, however, our identities are deeply entangled with services and the companies that own them. Your Twitter handle, for example, is exclusive to Twitter - good luck trying to get the same username on Instagram. Want to view your text messages alongside your Facebook messages with a person? Not happening. Lastly, good luck trying to recover your data if your service of choice suddenly were to shut down. To put it even more simply, Bob may be able to say “hi my name is Bob” on one social network A, but the name “Bob” may be reserved on social network B, preventing him from claiming the same name or handle over there. Moreover, if Bob has been a long time user of music app A and decides one day to migrate to music app B, he’ll need to go through the painful process of migrating all his playlists and songs over to the new service.</p> The Data Problem and Solution<a title="Direct link to The Data Problem and Solution">​</a> <p>
So what’s the fundamental issue DIDs are trying to solve? Simply put, users don’t own their data - services do - and their identity is fragmented across a host of handles, cards, and more. Ideally, we’d have a single form of identification with strong authentication and deep ties to data ownership, rather than scattered identities, lost passwords, and data owned by someone else. All of these concerns are valid and, it’s important to note, not simply hype around a shiny new toy.</p><p>DIDs solve these problems by coming alongside something called a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Node (DWN)</a>. Think of DIDs as the identifiers that will allow you to have a truly universal single sign-on experience, while DWNs are a form of data storage that will permit you to own your data while simultaneously being able to use and enjoy all the same kinds of services you currently do.</p><p>DIDs are, as the name suggests, decentralized - so they’re inherently not controlled, operated, or regulated by a centralized authority like our current identifiers are. You can have as many DIDs as you’d like, but you can also have a main DID act as a controller for your other DIDs to help consolidate or partition data when needed, as well as enforce limitations when appropriate. The implications of both decentralization and a controller paradigm are enormous for a vast number of use cases.</p> Life, Decentralized<a title="Direct link to Life, Decentralized">​</a> <p>Consider this: Bob has a single DID that acts as his main identifier, but he wants to detangle his work and personal identities to avoid having everything come into the same inbox on weekends. He creates two new DIDs that are controlled by his main identity, and labels them as “personal” and “work.” All of his work emails, calls, texts, and notifications are connected to his work DID, and he can easily silence that noise come Friday night. He can still authenticate to all of those services and own all of that data through his primary DID since it’s the controller, but can also easily filter through his data since he’s filed his work things under a separate DID. On the personal side of things, Bob can sign up for new services every day without worrying about migration because he owns all of his data: the second he signs up for a new service, like a social network, he can grant that app access to the media stored on his DWN and that service can act as a presentation layer for his data. Even better, his employer can also act as a controller on his work DID, allowing them to enforce enterprise requirements while keeping completely siloed from his personal data.</p><p>In this paradigm, Bob doesn’t worry about remembering a million passwords or losing his data to a service. The new “password” for Bob’s life is access to his main DID, which is protected by his private keys that can be stored in a number of secure ways, including on a physical drive or in a secure digital wallet. Just as significantly, Bob can keep his personal and work lives separate while allowing there to be appropriate separations of authority over his different data silos.</p> Identity Reinvented<a title="Direct link to Identity Reinvented">​</a> <p>So why do you want a DID? Really, the question is, why do you want to shift to a Web5 paradigm? Because identity portability and data ownership are massive yet silent problems we deal with every day. And how will this shift happen? Through the proliferation and adoption of DIDs, the popularization of DID controller paradigms and DWNs, and the availability of mass-appeal wallets to enable secure usage of DIDs. The general public wouldn’t ever be expected to have a technical understanding of these concepts, but their proliferation will depend on new and existing apps integrating this tech and presenting it to consumers in an easily-digestable way. We don’t just have to limit ourselves to imagining using this design to separate personal and work life - we can use it to allow for advanced parental controls, role access, and more.</p><p>If a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub</a> or join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Access to clean water is essential for the survival and growth of humans, animals and crops. Water technology companies worldwide provide innovative solutions to supply, conserve and protect water throughout the highly complex and technical water cycle of collection, treatment, distribution, reuse and disposal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a series of international acquisitions, a leading water technology company formed an Assessment Services division to provide water infrastructure services to their customers. Through the formation of this group, the Assessment Services division discovered multiple enterprise resource planning instances and payroll systems, a lack of standard reporting, and siloed budgeting and forecasting processes residing within a labyrinth of spreadsheets. It was chaotic.</p>



<p>These redundant manual processes slowed the organization and resulted in inaccuracies and lack of clarity around what data could be trusted enough to use. Internal and external stakeholders of the publicly traded company felt the impact via late and misguided profit and loss forecasts. As a result, the new department was under heavy pressure to produce timely and accurate financial reports and projections for stakeholders. They were also expected to improve and deliver upon earning targets.</p>



 How IBM and ActionKPI improved financial reporting and streamlined operations 



<p>The Assessment Services division turned to ActionKPI and IBM to help solve their massive data problems. First, the partnership developed an integrated business planning roadmap, including a comprehensive strategy to address data and organizational challenges. Once the partnership completed that work, IBM, ActionKPI and the Assessments Services team kicked off the first phase of their two-phase project.</p>



<p>The water company first needed to standardize its monthly financials and management reporting for the solution to work. This work involved creating a single set of definitions and procedures for collecting and reporting financial data. The water company also needed to develop reporting for a data warehouse, financial data integration and operations.&nbsp;</p>



 Phase One 



<p>Once the partnership established a data warehouse, the water company had a central repository for the organization’s data. They could store financial data from every business unit and create reports showing the organization’s financial performance from those various business units.</p>



<p>The next step of this phase was to create a system for integrating financial data from different sources and automating financial operations, making it possible to collect and report financial data more quickly and accurately.</p>



<p>Phase One resulted in standardized financial definitions, procedures and reports, as well as a data warehouse and a system that allowed the organization to improve its financial reporting and make better decisions.</p>



 Phase Two 



<p>Phase Two focused on standardizing their budgeting and forecasting process, moving from a complicated, interwoven one-hundred-and-forty-tab Excel model into IBM Planning Analytics. Part of this process involved refining and creating new strategies to align with the CFO’s vision and to establish a monthly rolling forecast process owned by the business.</p>



<p>The partnership created several models to transition Excel business logic and calculations to IBM Planning Analytics. These models included employee-level workforce planning, high-level project forecasting and the organization’s driver-based and line-item detailed operating expenses, all integrated directly into the P&amp;L to provide real-time forecast updates.</p>



<p>With the forecast model established, the next step was to integrate financial and payroll data into the forecasting model from the data warehouse. The partnership set up the data integration to update actuals from ERP to Datawarehouse to IBM Planning Analytics in near real time and on demand, which is critical for month-end reporting deadlines. This integration enabled the water technology company to reduce month-end reporting cycles, free up time to conduct better analysis and provide a well-thought-out forecast to the business, all within essential reporting timelines.</p>



<p>By centralizing actuals, budget and forecasting information in Planning Analytics, finance business partners could analyze the business faster, allowing the company to make decisions mid-month and influence month-end results (instead of just reporting results without any actionable recommendations) and moving decision making from hindsight to foresight.</p>



<p>As the finance teams began providing information analysis and insights, the whole organization started to see the value of their investment. Hitting this project goal was an essential milestone, and the momentum began to build and prepare the organization for the next phase.</p>



<p>Outcomes of this phase included a higher degree of transparency and forecast accuracy. In addition, they moved from being the last division to submit budgets and forecast results to corporate to the first.</p>



 Phase Three 



<p>Phase Three of the project involved transitioning core sales, operational processes and weekly forecast reporting from Excel to IBM Planning Analytics.</p>



<p>The new system required integrating data from multiple sources, such as Salesforce, ERP, Workday and Excel spreadsheets. In addition, a change management strategy was implemented to ensure everyone involved in the project was on board with the transformations.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700058122585280&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw27mhBhC9ARIsAIFsETEA-dsix3ZVUvUz9jkr_98sQ3aUcZqgGoSxd5qFwUWbfOtPD1ngK0AaAuRBEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM Planning Analytics</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cognos-analytics?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700050328201982&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw27mhBhC9ARIsAIFsETHyn2mCeJiBecIdFxTaxt0f9z_VGDAMeOf7iYVKsvFGUX8yxumrVI4aAurbEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Cognos®&nbsp;Analytics</a>, the team transformed the core workings of the Assessment Services division, bringing a sense of order and a single source of truth to multiple departments throughout the organization.</p>



<p>The Vice President of the water services company <a href="https://actionkpi.com/download-profitability-architect-playbook/">reports</a>, “Integrated Business Planning has allowed us to dive in and signal risk … resulting in proactive action plans that steer our bottom line. We no longer debate who has the right information, because we operate on a single source of truth, instilling trust in our process and underlying data.”</p>



 Better decision-making through increased transparency and trust in data 



<p>The partnership’s resulting technology and process optimization improved forecast accuracy and reduced the time to forecast from 4 months to 1 week. Decision makers can now consider the potential risk and rewards of different options to make choices with the best chance of achieving their desired business outcome. Greater transparency and trust in data provide a central project management solution for project forecasting and P&amp;L Reporting.</p>



<p>This process optimization also produced the following significant results:</p>



 
 A deeper understanding of the financial performance of projects and their associated project managers 



 Transparent quarterly targets and forecasts for sales reps to achieve 



 An easier way to set client and forecast risk expectations at the corporate level 



 A better way to determine resource capacity, risk and revenue backlog 



 An efficient method to guide sales efforts and client negotiations based on capacity and insight into margin details 
 



<p>By combining integrated business planning with smarter analytics, the water technology company was able to operate more efficiently and unlock profit potential, all while protecting one of the world’s most precious resources.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.iso20022.org/">ISO 20022</a> is a global standard for financial messaging that aims to standardize electronic data interchange between financial institutions.</p>



<p>It provides a structured way of exchanging data for financial transactions, including payments, securities and trade services. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the standard, which is being adopted by countries and financial institutions worldwide. Real-Time Payments, for example, have widely adopted ISO 20022 across many countries, and Wire Payments networks are also announcing their support plans, including Fedwire, Lynx and SWIFT, by the end of 2025. Given these ISO 20022 payment scheme announcements, the question is: is your financial institution ready?</p>



 ISO 20022 data improves payment efficiency 



<p>The impact of ISO 20022 on payment systems data is significant, as it allows for more detailed information in payment messages. In contrast to older messaging standards, ISO 20022 provides a more comprehensive and structured data model, which makes it easier and more efficient for different financial institutions and payment systems to communicate with each other. For example, ISO 20022 includes new data fields that provide more information about the transaction, such as the purpose of the payment, the type of payment and any associated fees or charges. This increased data granularity can help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of payment processing, enabling faster and more reliable settlement of payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For payment systems to leverage ISO 20022, the architecture must support ISO 20022 data to those components that can leverage the expanded data set, including Fraud System, Sanctions Screening, Regulatory Reporting, and Payments Archive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, ISO 20022 enables interoperability between different payment systems, which is critical in today’s global financial ecosystem. With ISO 20022, financial institutions can communicate with each other using a common data language, making it easier to conduct cross-border transactions and ensuring a higher level of standardization across different payment systems (e.g., Real-Time Payments and Wire Transfer).</p>

<p>The convergence of wire transfers and real-time payments to ISO 20022 is transforming the payments industry by enabling faster, more secure and more efficient payments. Wire transfers are traditional bank-to-bank transfers that are typically processed in batches and can take a day to several days to complete. On the other hand, real-time payments are complete within a few seconds, allowing for the near-instantaneous transfer of funds between bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some ways in which the convergence of wire transfers and real-time payments to ISO 20022 improves the payments industry. Are your payment systems ready to reap these benefits?</p>



 
 Faster and more efficient payments: With the adoption of ISO 20022, wire transfers and real-time payments are processed more quickly and efficiently, reducing processing times and costs. 



 Improved customer experience: The convergence of wire transfers and real-time payments to ISO 20022 improves the customer experience by providing faster, more convenient and more secure payment options. These can help to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. 



 Increased automation: ISO 20022 provides a more structured way of exchanging payment data, enabling greater automation and reducing the need for manual intervention, all of which help reduce errors and improve overall payment processing efficiency. 
 



 ISO 20022 drives improved analytics and new revenue opportunities 



<p>ISO 20022 enables more sophisticated payment analytics by providing a richer data set for analysis. With more detailed information about each transaction, analysts can develop deeper insights, which can help to improve risk management, fraud detection and compliance with regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These deeper insights can help financial institutions identify opportunities for new revenue streams. Are your payment systems ready for these new opportunities?</p>



 
 Improved Analytics: financial institutions can access more detailed information about each transaction, enabling more sophisticated payment analytics. Helping to identify new revenue streams and improve customer engagement by offering more targeted and personalized products and services. 



 Enhanced Risk Management: better identify and manage risks, such as fraud, credit risk and operational risk. Helping to reduce losses and improve overall financial performance. 



 Compliance: ISO 20022 can help financial institutions comply with regulatory requirements by providing a more comprehensive data set for reporting purposes and helping to reduce compliance costs and improve regulatory oversight. 



 Product Innovation: use transaction data to create new products and services that meet the needs of their customers. For example, banks can offer personalized financial advice based on transaction history or develop new payment products that provide better user experiences. 



 Partnerships: increase collaboration to create new data-driven products and services that drive innovation and create new revenue streams for both parties. 
 



<p>Overall, the convergence of wire transfers and real-time payments to ISO 20022 will transform the payments industry by enabling faster, more secure and more efficient payments. As more financial institutions adopt ISO 20022, we will see increased innovation, usage of data analytics, automation, AI and competition in the payments space, leading to a more dynamic and efficient payments ecosystem. Financial Institutions that view ISO 20022 as a strategic opportunity and act now to modernize their payment systems to support ISO 20022 will be ready to support the future of payments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How can we overcome existing structural challenges to reach investment readiness for the long-term stewardship of Nature-based Solutions in&nbsp;cities?</p><p>During the past two years, TreesAI — an initiative of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://lucidminds.ai/">Lucidminds</a> — have been running a pilot alongside Glasgow City Council and a number of public and private stakeholders to collectively raise capital for delivering Nature-based Solutions in the city. This is our interim learning&nbsp;report.</p><p>How can public organisations and private companies co-invest in urban Nature-based Solutions? During the past two years, we have been developing a pilot alongside Glasgow City Council and a range of public and private actors (Scottish Water, FloodRe, Nationwide, Clyde Climate Forest, Scottish Flood Forum and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) to design and develop innovative processes and mechanisms to collectively channel capital for the delivery and long-term maintenance of urban Nature-based Solutions (NbS) — that reduce flood-related risks and generate environmental benefits in the Glasgow&nbsp;region.</p><p>Our pilot tests the hypothesis that public and private entities can co-invest in Nature-based Solutions (e.g. street trees, sustainable urban drainage systems) that strategically provide Natural Flood Management (NFM) and Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), enhancing the performance of grey infrastructure. Using NbS for flood management is essential in the context of the UK, with w<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64866058">arming temperatures raising UK flood damages by 20%</a> and with <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/292928/geho0609bqds-e-e.pdf">1 in 6 properties in England being at risk of flooding</a> today. Beyond increased flood resilience, NbS can help cities and organisations adapt to various other climate-related risks (such as heatwaves) while hitting net zero and nature-positive targets while improving the health and well-being of both human and non-human dwellers.</p><p>Throughout the development of this work, we have observed that public and private organisations are aware and keen to explore possibilities for investing in NbS to tackle climate-related risks in cities. For example, water utilities are interested in using NbS to reduce risks in internal property sewer flooding; the (re)insurance sector is interested in reducing flood risk in properties and, lenders are interested in lowering long-term physical flood risks, which can cause property devaluation — while increasing investments in resilient and low carbon infrastructure assets that add to climate transition investment portfolios.</p><p>However, when it comes to execution, the reality of co-investing is more complicated. The challenges to funding adaptation are numerous: slow procurement and legal agreement processes to carry out transactions, a lack of technical skills and location-specific datasets to prove impact, along with a <a href="http://climatereadyclyde.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Annex-3-Resource-Mobilisation-Plan.pdf">mismatch between capital expenditures and return</a>. In this interim report, we discuss the challenges, findings and learnings that we have come across during the development of the pilot and offer possible solution pathways that could allow similar pilots to scale across Scotland and the UK, creating a market for urban&nbsp;NbS.</p><p>In this first series of learning reports, we set out three macro-challenges &amp; learnings (i.e. the strategic issues in reaching co-investment). These are not comprehensive but are those that we have felt most keenly throughout the&nbsp;pilot.</p>  We need to develop new forms of financing practices and the supporting tech infrastructure to scale investments in Nature-based Solutions.  We need novel public sector organisational structures which enable innovative processes and methodologies to invest in&nbsp;nature.  We need to build better market incentives, contracting &amp; regulatory frameworks for organisations to gain the practices, confidence and trust to co-invest in&nbsp;nature.  <p>In the following paragraphs, we outline the details of the above three learning outcomes.</p>Who could benefit from Nature-based Solutions (e.g. street trees, sustainable urban drainage systems) that provide Natural Flood Management? 1 | We need to develop new forms of financing practices and the supporting tech infrastructure to scale investments in Nature-based Solutions. <p>The capital gap required to tackle cities’ adaptation needs is huge — accounting for about £10 billion per year in the UK and approximately <a href="https://www.sniffer.org.uk/blog/closing-the-adaptation-finance-gap-in-scotland">£184 million a year in the Glasgow City Region alone.</a> However, the possible financial risks associated with not addressing this gap, and the subsequent negative feedback loops, dwarf this figure — for example as warned by Moody, cities’ <a href="https://impactalpha.com/bond-investors-are-getting-smarter-about-flood-risks-9af06bf7089a/">“credit rating will directly be tied to their flood prevention policies</a>”.</p><p>From innovative grants like the <a href="https://www.nature.scot/funding-and-projects/irns">Investment Ready Nature Scotland (IRNS</a>) and the <a href="https://www.nature.scot/funding-and-projects/firns-facility-investment-ready-nature-scotland">Facility for Investment ready Nature in Scotland (FIRNS)</a> grant schemes focused on supporting innovation and pilots, to institutions to support with first loss capital to support in taking on the risk of demonstrating the soundness of emerging business models. The UK Infrastructure Bank set out in this<a href="https://www.ukib.org.uk/sites/default/files/2022-11/Natural-capital-discussion-paper.pdf"> discussion paper</a> its role across three target markets (of which water is one) and has recently committed <a href="https://highgrowth.scot/uk-infrastructure-bank-announces-first-natural-capital-transaction/">£12M to Highland Rewilding</a>, and natural capital was underscored in the <a href="https://www.thebank.scot/">Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB)</a> <a href="https://www.thebank.scot/sites/default/files/2022-10/snib003-mission-report-2022-final-010422.pdf">mission&nbsp;report.</a></p><p>Getting NbS projects off the ground is as challenging as ensuring these thrive over their lifetime (i.e. avoiding greenwashing and over-crediting). If we want to ensure these interventions lead to a real impact, we need to provide financial contributions across the lifespan of projects. In the pilot, time and time again partners have stressed the importance of early-stage studies to find the most suitable intervention sites. This requires a level of analysis at the catchment level and is the only way to proceed with detailed planning on the local scale. Beyond this we hear time and again that, with budgets being cut, maintenance is one of the first types of funding that gets cut for the council — and so there is a reticence to invest in such visible&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Hence we need to be thinking about funding streams for various stages of the development of NbS: from strategic analysis, concept and detailed design, construction, maintenance &amp; monitoring of projects. For some of these stages, and especially in these early days of market development, foundational capital is&nbsp;key.</p>The figure above lays out the preliminary business model for TreesAI Glasgow&nbsp;Pilot<p>NbS are a different sort of asset class where returns will not be immediately, or comprehensively monetisable hence why a new Monitoring, Reporting &amp; Verification (MRV) strategy is so important.</p><p>Across the Pilot in Glasgow, we have run into some of the challenges underpinning our risk, forecasting and impact verification capacities. Currently, each organisation has their own modelling approach, which has been designed for specific purposes and is often built on proprietary software that is rarely interoperable. As levels of scale, granularity and calibration are dependent on uses, data can often not be extrapolated for shared endeavours like co-investing. These risk models are often black boxes that cannot be broken down to understand incremental improvements (for example outputs are risk ratings for properties) — whereas investing in nature requires an acceptance of a degree of uncertainty.</p><p>Beyond this, the lack of confidence in the ability of nature to provide ecosystem services often means that modelling consultants will (to be confident in their estimations) reduce the real impact potential — modelling trees as permeable surfaces rather than including their stormwater retention capacity from evapotranspiration. We need a modelling infrastructure to support common decision-making through open and Interoperable tools &amp; processes.</p><p>Over the past two years, we have been developing the tools and approaches to support the planning of NbS projects. Our team from Lucidminds have developed an open-source framework called <a href="https://greenurbanscenarios.com/">Green Urban Scenarios</a>, which uses agent-based modelling to assess potential impact across different scenarios — for more information see this <a href="https://lucidmindsai.medium.com/green-urban-scenarios-298d75b100b4">blog serie</a>s. We have recently kicked off a partnership with <a href="https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/digital-innovation/hartree-national-centre-for-digital-innovation/">HNCDI</a> to integrate these models through their geospatial discovery programme. Beyond this, we have also adopted the <a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/guidances/impact-and-vulnerability-analysis-of-vital-infrastructures-and-built-up-areas">IVAVIA methodology</a> to develop a GIS-based tool to provide projects with a location-specific score based on the location’s risk profile. These have been built as a modular cloud-based platform that is intended to be plugged into a variety of organisations and contexts.</p><p>Modelling on its own, however, will not prove sufficient for investment to happen. As we have seen in the recent carbon credits scandals, natural capital markets require transparent monitoring &amp; verification processes — less we risk overselling them. This is a real problem expressed by public and private stakeholders: the lack of evidence &amp; processes to prove the performance of NbS. A stark reality is that a number of NbS projects have been built in Glasgow, none of which have received enough funding to be monitored in a detailed manner to understand their performance over time. From the design stage, we need discussions around intended benefits and methods and metrics to measure them, along with baseline monitoring to ensure they are accurately captured. However, there is a lack of standards &amp; monitoring methodologies, data-sharing practices and protocols, along with a lack of funding earmarked for post-construction activities (see above). We hope to continue co-building an MRV strategy and to start monitoring a number of sites to build evidence datasets to help decision-makers.</p><p>But to achieve this, we need to create the structures for collaboration across organisations…</p>Screenshot of TreesAI platform interface powered by Green Urban Scenarios and Location Based&nbsp;Scoring |2| We need novel organisational structures which enable innovative processes and methodologies to invest in&nbsp;nature. <p>Overcoming challenges in investing in urban NbS requires more than financial resources and technological solutions. The benefits of nature are many, and so too are the beneficiaries. Growing this nascent field requires a whole new set of skillsets within organisations, an overcoming of inter-organisational silos and partnership working between stakeholders.</p><p>Green finance for NbS is a nascent field, and stakeholders are only now starting to grasp how this could work. In order to participate in NbS (from design to implementation), stakeholders require specific technical expertise — for example, we found a need for hydrological modelling which is costly and time intensive. On top of technical skills, investing in NbS for stormwater management requires financial and operational competencies. For example, whereas implementing a piece of tried and tested grey infrastructure enables them to use known project management (for instance, with contractors they’ve already worked with), there is a lack of understanding around the costs and risks of delivering NbS. But it is not just in project delivery that skills are needed, organisations require an in-house understanding of cutting-edge technologies, financial instruments and constantly shifting policy contexts to accelerate their ability for delivering NbS. We support the proposal, within the Climate Ready Clyde Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan for a regional Adaptation Finance Lab — which is still at the concept stage — to support the development of many of the required&nbsp;skills.</p><p>There is a lot of learning that needs to be developed, and possibly integrating individuals with the right skills and background in public organisations could be of benefit, training existing employees or improving our collective capacity through partnership working.</p><p>Throughout our pilot major barriers to innovation have been 1) the misalignment, overlap and lack of implementation clarity between multiple formal and informal planning guidance being developed by different city departments or organisations (e.g. the Forest and Woodland Strategy developed by the planning department and a more informal tree development directive developed by the Parks and Gardens Department); 2) the lack of council leadership especially when it comes to treasury functions (e.g. such as the capacity to underwrite private capital investments and deploy existing budgets in innovative ways); and 3) the significant lack of decision-making capacity. In the public sector, hierarchical structures and lack of resources have meant that there are not enough decision-makers in the room and individuals lack the bandwidth to focus on making the transition possible to scale urban&nbsp;NbS.</p><p>The pilot in Glasgow is a stark reminder that co-investing in NbS requires dedicated capacities and clear decision-making lines in the governmental sectors to ensure policy alignment inter and intra-organisationally. We hope that local authorities can step up in creating the proper political structures to take decisions on green economy matters across relevant departments since they need a structure and relevant posts to make decision-making possible. The city of Edinburgh, for example, has changed its structure in order to bring a more efficient decision-making process around NbS and could be a potential example of integrating green economy matters across councils. At the same time, we are hoping to follow closely and work alongside the development of the new NPF4 and related workgroups that we hope will help unlock capacity and align existing plans across the region and where necessary co-develop novel local plans in a truly collaborative manner across organisations.</p><p>The Glasgow Metropolitan Strategic Drainage Partnership (MGSDP) is perhaps one of the many examples of place-based institutions that have struggled to achieve transformative results — for more information see the <a href="https://www.crew.ac.uk/publication/taking-collaborative-approach-water-sector-review-metropolitan-glasgow-strategic">CREW review</a>. While it has delivered a multitude of impactful projects across Glasgow, just a small number of NbS projects have been delivered through co-investment ( e.g. ERDF, Water Environment Fund, Nature Restoration Fund, Sustrans), but none have yet attracted private investment. In fact, the spatial scale of NFM is such that interventions need to be truly aligned at a sub-basin level to be successful (e.g. we have encountered examples where upriver flooding will have an impact on the flood zone regardless of the NFM intervention). Barriers include the misalignment of liabilities, incentives and timeframes of multiple stakeholders in the partnership, for example between the national water utility company and the local authority.</p><p>But it is not just public-private partnerships that are needed when intervening in the urban built environment, communities as those who live closest to the problem and solution must be involved from the outset. Benefits of doing so range from the importance of incorporating local needs, increasing social capital and stewardship, with trees lasting much longer when involving communities in their maintenance (which has been shown to reduce the mortality rate from 30% to 5%). However, partners who are co-designing and delivering projects on the ground have encountered the challenge of raising awareness of the benefits of such schemes, for example when a swale in a local park will take away a ‘neat-looking lawn’ or when a woodland preservation scheme was understood to worsen flooding ‘as that’s where the water was seen to be coming from’. However, this is only part of the story with the recently launched <a href="https://peoplesplanfornature.org/">People’s plan for Nature</a>, created by a citizens’ assembly, includes recommendations for national legislation concerning the “right to equitable access to nature” and for local government and NGOs to act on this by bringing more nature into urban&nbsp;areas.</p><p>Our pilot has tried to highlight and work across some of these challenges by building a new partnership that can test new modalities to collaborate across sub-basins (other similar examples are the <a href="https://missionpossiblepartnership.org/">mission possible partnership</a> or the <a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/publications/public-common-partnerships-building-new-circuits-of-collective-ownership">Public-Common Partnerships</a>). We will continue to develop this new model, working hard to ensure the private sector is looped into the conversation and that local public institutions have the capacity to engage with&nbsp;them.</p><p>But without the enabling environment, these partnerships will not grow in hostile&nbsp;ground…</p>Governance structure of the TreesAI Glasgow Pilot Partnership |3| We need to build better market incentives, contracting &amp; regulatory frameworks for organisations to gain the practices, confidence and trust to co-invest in&nbsp;nature. <p>While there is increasing hype around investments in nature, private capital is still slow. This is in part due to the nascent nature of many of net-zero and nature-positive requirements facing the private sector with corporate boards only just beginning to integrate concepts like carbon accounting or consider biodiversity investment strategies (specifically in England &amp; Wales due to the legally mandated Biodiversity Net Gain, <a href="https://www.theplanner.co.uk/2022/04/10/biodiversity-enhancement-scotland-different-approach#:~:text=Unlike%20England%2C%20Scotland%20has%20not,national%20planning%20framework%20(NPF).">a version of which</a> Scotland will begin to consider). Beyond carbon and biodiversity, investing in nature with specific flood management outcomes is an even more nascent market. This is apparent through our pilot in Glasgow where public and private stakeholders are aware they should be making the transition to investing in NbS for flood mitigation, but current regulation does not address retrofitting through NbS to tackle flood risk and to justify investments through a clear business incentive. In this section, we set out three interventions we believe could support the development of this&nbsp;market.</p><p>Carbon and biodiversity are just two ecosystem services that require investment if we want to scale the transition and reverse losses to our natural environment. If we want to capture other vital ecosystem services (such as flood management &amp; temperature regulation) we need firstly standards specific to those services and secondly agreed to approaches for the stacking and bundling of multiple benefits to allow different sectors and industries to structure shared investments. This would support the generation of viable business models based on the parcelling out of the different benefits related to different beneficiaries.</p><p>We positively welcome Defra’s recently published <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1147397/nature-markets.pdf">Nature Markets Framework</a>, which starts to set out the much-needed principles, rules and requirements needed for market alignment across standards and ecosystem services — and includes the next steps to support BSI to develop standards for a range of ecosystem services.</p><p>While still in its infancy, we do see innovative first movers who are on a journey to understand how Natural Capital markets could enable flood risk to be recognised and mitigated and we aim to work alongside some of these. For example, the River Trust is developing ‘Replenish credits’ as a mechanism to finance natural solutions to improve water quality and reduce flood risk and the Forestry Commission is planning to develop a Woodland Water Code by 2025, to provide a standard for water-related benefits of woodland creation (from pollution mitigation to flood risk mitigation). We are also looking to work with other approaches to mainstream private finance into nature for example the <a href="https://www.naturanceproject.eu/">Horizon 2020 funded Naturance project</a> aims to explore over the next 3.5 years the technical, financial and operational feasibility and performance of solutions that integrate NbS into disaster risk financing — using investments in nature as ‘natural hedging’.</p><p>Currently, only some public organisations bear the risk of flooding in Glasgow, yet many players would benefit from flood risk alleviation. As private actors in the Glasgow partnership do not legally bear the risk there is no explicit incentive for investment in NbS and NFM especially at the individual organisation level. Even within the public sector, the distribution of liabilities across actors is a barrier to co-investment. For example, Glasgow City Council (GCC) are liable for surface water flooding whereas Scottish Water (SW) is liable for chronic sewer flooding — on top of this they each are concerned with different types of flood events. This makes it difficult to bundle risks and agree on a common&nbsp;pathway.</p><p>We need to standardise risk measurements and requirements across organisations in order to induce co-investments. A regulatory framework is required to crystallise shared risks and incentivise investments, both for the public and private sectors. Regulation around disclosure aligned to <a href="https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/">TCFD</a> are positive first steps which are not yet filtering into investment decisions and are only tangentially relevant to the conversations we are having with stakeholders.</p><p>Beyond this, we also need to translate those risks into clear targets that incorporate the multiple benefits of nature's positive risk mitigation strategies. In Glasgow for example we have seen how clearly defined targets related to active travel (for example reducing no. of car journeys) and carbon mitigation (net zero by 2030) provide a clear motivation for aligned planning and resourcing decisions. Whereas the lack of clearly articulated national and local targets for nature-based solutions and blue-green infrastructure means that what gets built is dictated by cost-benefit analyses, which rarely capture comprehensively the long-term and complex benefits delivered by&nbsp;nature.</p><p>In Scotland, we are looking to emerging policy windows that could offer opportunities to place Scotland at the cutting edge of regulatory innovation in this space. Over the next few months our partner Scottish Flood Forum will be involved in the consultations for the national <a href="https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2022/09/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-2022-23/documents/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-202223/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-202223/govscot%3Adocument/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-202223.pdf">Flooding Strategy</a> — stay tuned for the development of community engagement guidelines in the delivery of privately financed urban NFM so that the voice of nature and local residents can be embedded at the core of the project. We also are looking hopefully at the next Statutory Climate Adaptation programme — which will be published next year — where we expect to see more emphasis on clearer targets and monitoring/evaluation approaches, as advised by <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/is-scotland-climate-ready-2022-report-to-scottish-parliament/">the Climate Change Committee</a>. Another opportunity we see is the potential revision to Scottish Water’s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/principles-of-charging-2021-2027/">charging principles</a> which could offer an opportunity to incentivise the private sector to invest in BGI by potentially offering them a cost-saving on future water/drainage bills.</p><p>Beyond Scotland, we are pleased that the recently published <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1147377/mobilising-green-investment-2023-green-finance-strategy.pdf">UK Green Finance Strategy</a> provides a framework for scaling nature-based investment markets; putting adaptation higher on the political agenda and setting commitments towards the much-needed capacity building, training, skills, and wider net zero infrastructure (see C.1). However we are also aware that the outcomes of the Brexit Freedoms Bill, which will see the reform or removal of 570 environmental EU laws, might <a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/news/uk-setting-bonfire-of-environmental-regulations-alight-with-new-bill/">negatively reduce existing standards</a> (e.g. water quality) as well as <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2364782-brexit-law-change-could-restrict-access-to-uk-river-pollution-data/">restricting legal rights to access environmental information</a>, increasing burden on civil servants and uncertainty across businesses that will have to operate knowing that the “<a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/news/uk-setting-bonfire-of-environmental-regulations-alight-with-new-bill/">rules and regulations… could change dramatically within the next 14&nbsp;months</a>”.</p><p>While this level of regulatory reform is beyond the scope of the pilot, it provides the context for which the pilot will either thrive or&nbsp;fail.</p><p>A template contract for co-investments in NbS would allow the development of legal commercial agreements and necessary MoUs between stakeholders. In the absence of market standards, the ability to strike (and contract on) a deal is hindered by the lack of consistency in documentation, meaning actors need (with every new deal) to spend time and resources on drafting these. The template agreements shared by the<a href="https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.co.uk/gfihive/toolkit/establishing-legal-contracts-and-closing/wyre-river-natural-flood-management-project/"> Wyre River investment project</a> have proved a helpful starting point and — as per lessons learned from the Wyre River project — we are going to be working towards the negotiation of non-binding MoUs between all the pilot partners that will ultimately require them to contract with each other to co-invest and deliver urban NbS. This iterative process will allow us to surface the technical, legal and financial requirements of different partners.</p><p>Through the pilot, we are hoping to develop these contracts as multi-stakeholder value agreements (across multiple actors, roles, values and assets) which exploit interdependencies to unlock multiple shared values. This builds off work as part of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/BeyondtheRules">Beyond the Rules</a>, where we are developing standardised many-to-many agreements, organising and governance that aim to help fragmented actors to cross-boundary, systemic organising and governance.</p>Image from report Nature markets: A framework for scaling up private investment in nature recovery and sustainable farming, March&nbsp;2023 Call to&nbsp;action TreesAI team in&nbsp;Glasgow<p>The Glasgow pilot for co-investments in urban Nature-based Solutions is surfacing a number of structural learnings. The aforementioned challenges and suggested solution pathways are a call to action required at multiple levels and by different market stakeholders.</p><p>First of all, national governments need to develop clearer targets, regulations and standards to help organise &amp; transition public institutions, as well as implicating the private sector into environmental targets, to collectively address climate risks in&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Secondly, local governments and city councils should champion and lead cross-council institutions, building the necessary political momentum for scaling NbS.

 After numerous delays, the much anticipated government review and update of the Gambling Act 2005 is almost upon us. 



 



<p>It’s safe to say that the UK’s gambling industry has been in a state of turmoil for a few years now. In 2020, Boris Johnson launched a review of the Gambling Act 2005, raising concerns that the document might need to be updated to apply to the digital age. The review was expected to lead to a white paper outlining modifications to the act. It’s 2023, and the industry is still waiting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the white paper is finally released, it will likely have long-term implications for the sector. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the potential consequences for players and operators once released.</p>



 What is the UK gambling white paper? 



<p>The Gambling Act Review White Paper is an official publication that sets forth its approach to regulating the online gaming industry in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The document covers current policies, regulations, and changes for gambling services in the UK. Such gambling regulations and policies include ensuring the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">protection of consumers</a>, mitigating problem gambling, preventing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>, and making the enforcement of payment regulations easier.</p>



<p>The official document aims to provide an environment where players can safely partake in various forms of mainstream gambling, such as casino games, slots, lotteries, and sports betting. Gambling operators can continue providing the same products, but all games have to be within the regulatory limits.</p>



<p>Overall, the ultimate goal of this white paper is to promote transparency, fairness, and safety within all aspects of UK-based gambling activities.</p>



 Why has the white paper not been released yet? 



<p>Speculated by industry insiders to be the greatest reform in nearly two decades, the UK’s new gambling framework is expected to introduce various significant changes. However, the nearly three-year delay in reform has resulted in frustration and even inactivity in the gambling sector.</p>



<p>Initiated in December 2020, the review has been supervised by four culture secretaries, six gambling ministers, and three prime ministers, and its official release stalled four times throughout government turmoil and the pandemic. Considering the review has constantly been overseen with new eyes this could partially help explain the delay.</p>



<p>In February, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak revealed plans for a newly-formed DSIT (Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology) and a new “refocused” Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sunak’s recent cabinet shuffle has caused further frustration, especially since Paul Scully, who received praise from those within the gambling industry for listening to both sides of the argument as demonstrated by his views on <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/retail/2023/01/27/paul-scully-white-paper-will-see-finance-risk-checks-not-affordability-checks/">affordability checks</a>, was then appointed to another post. On the 7th of February, Scully took up his new position as Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy.</p>



<p>It is important to remember that in the last few years a cost of living crisis, the war in Ukraine, and rising energy prices have also been more pressing concerns for the current government resulting in this review into the Gambling Act being low down on the list in priority.</p>



<p>Rumors regarding new taxes, affordability checks, and stringent spending restrictions have prompted operators to introduce changes to their platforms, resulting in critical reductions in profit and, consequently, tax revenue.</p>



<p>The official release of the white paper will provide additional clarity to operators and investors. However, it will not be the end of the gambling reform process, at least according to Paul Scully, who made these claims during his reign as Gambling Minister while addressing BGC members at the trade association’s AGM held in January.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The amount of negotiation that goes into such a paper must also be considered. Stakeholders within the gambling industry realize the devastating consequences these reported new initiatives could have, so they are still fighting for the best potential outcome for the health of the gambling industry.</p>



 When is the white paper expected to arrive? 



<p>Newly appointed Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer predicted in March that the document should arrive close to Easter. This has now passed, but speculation is rife that the paper should still be released in <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/gambling-white-paper-released-monday/">April 2023</a>. As mentioned, Frazer recently took over the DCMS, the 12th leader in 13 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael Dugher, Chief Executive Officer of the Betting and Gaming Council <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/welcome-lucy-frazer">stated</a> that he&nbsp; hopes she will pay attention to the feedback over the disputable affordability checks the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) wants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of late March, the Parliamentary Under Secretary for DCMS has also revealed that the long-awaited document is nearly ready.</p>

 Why is the UK gambling white paper important? 



<p>Overall, the UK gambling white paper is important in terms of providing much-needed regulatory clarity, and helping establish the social and legal framework of the gambling sector in the UK. By suggesting various measures to ensure consumer protection standards and mitigate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a> and cybercrime, the document is expected to offer guidance and direction on how operators should facilitate fair, transparent, and safe services. According to Frazer, the white paper also aims to protect individuals that are vulnerable to addiction and harm without affecting the overall experience of the majority. As other regulators often look to the UKGC to see where gambling regulation is headed, the UK gambling white paper is likely to affect many global markets, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/dutch-online-gambling-2022/">Netherlands</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/">Ontario</a>.</p>



<p>Essentially, the white paper will guarantee an overall safe experience for everyone involved in the gambling sector by establishing a transparent legal framework and providing support services wherever necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As stated, the white paper aims to change the online gambling industry and will likely have a sweeping impact on operators and gamblers alike. Upon the document’s release, operators will likely implement considerable changes to their services and operations, from more active measures in managing problem gambling behavior to increased minimum standards for protection and safety for players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Potential implications for gamblers include more comprehensive access to information regarding their gambling activities, improved customer support processes, new limits on stake levels, more straightforward registration processes, and more robust consumer protection standards.</p>



<p>Despite the apparent need to help tackle issues surrounding problem gambling, people within the industry argue that intrusive affordability checks and betting limits could unfairly impact the enjoyment of your everyday punter.</p>



 The demand for more regulations. 



<p>Britain has the world’s largest iGaming market, not to mention one of the most liberal. UK-based regulatory authorities primarily outsource consumer protection to problem gamblers, who are thus expected to “self-exclude” from gambling platforms should they suspect problem gambling patterns in their own behavior. They can do so through a platform established and funded by the gambling industry in 2018: Gamstop. That said, anti-gambling lobbyists argue that it is unreasonable to expect addicts to make sound decisions for themselves, and it should be accepted that they require guidance. Many addiction clinics in the UK have reported an upsurge in gamblers seeking treatment for deterioration in <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2022/11/nhs-opens-two-new-gambling-addition-clinics-amid-record-referrals/">mental health</a>.</p>



<p>The horse racing industry in the UK has also suffered partly due to the delay in the white paper’s release. In December 2022, representatives of the British racing industry met with gambling officials outlining their concerns affordability checks will have on the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the sport has always been popular in the country, it has lost at least <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/features/series/the-40-million-blow-how-affordability-checks-are-already-hitting-horseracing-aqfKc4Z8eMEU/">£40 million in revenue</a>, according to the industry. The UK Gambling Commission has also increased restrictions, causing shifts in betting sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, prominent operator Entain <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/business/affordability-checks-hit-entain-revenues-by-100-million-as-annual-results-released-av3z35a3pdzd/">reported a loss</a> of £100 million due to a significant drop in gambling activity led on by the UK Gambling Commission’s restrictions and the rumor of affordability checks in the white paper. According to the operator, the drop is because more players are headed toward platforms not enforcing as much oversight.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/black-market-world-cup">Betting and Gaming Council</a>, 250,000 bettors visited black market betting sites in December (during the World Cup 2022), up from 80,000 during the same month in 2021. Betting fraud affects all countries regardless of their legal stance on gambling.</p>



 What will the white paper include? 



<p>The UK gambling white paper is set to update the Gambling Act 2005 established by the then-acting Labour government, which set forth rules for the industry before the proliferation of smartphones and online gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The white paper aims to promote responsible gaming and a transparent environment via several measures. Aside from the proposed ban on loyalty programs that can lead to impulse spending, a £2 – £15 bet limit on online slots and introducing more powerful “safer gambling” slogans have also been proposed in drafts of the document. According to leaked Cabinet Office papers, only individuals under 25 will be impacted by the new £2 limit. Gamblers over the age of 25, on the other hand, will have a limit of £15 per spin.</p>



<p>In regards to <a href="https://focusgn.com/new-details-of-uk-gambling-white-paper-emerge">affordability checks</a> on players, sector insiders have revealed that the controversial measures are still being discussed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to insiders, the suggested £125 limits on monthly wagering losses and £500 on yearly wagering losses prior to the rolling out of affordability checks – proposed in a prior version of the document’s draft – may be winnowed down.</p>



<p>In April 2023, it was announced that from the 2026/27 season onwards, Premier League clubs would no longer play with gambling sponsors on the front of their shirts. Although this decision was made independently by the Premier League, rumors have abounded for&nbsp; many years that this would be a part of the new white paper recommendations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anti-gambling lobbyists acknowledged that this was a massive step forward, but said they were not completely satisfied since it would still be possible for footballers to wear gambling advertisements on their sleeves, and advertising hoardings can still include gambling sponsorships.</p>



 How to prepare for the white paper. 



<p>There has been various speculation regarding the delay of the white paper. The UK has become the world’s most prominent regulated iGaming market, with a total GGY of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/467892/gross-gambling-yield-in-total-in-great-britain/">£14 billion</a>. Despite its impact on UK society – both positives and negatives – it is still held back by restrictions that the white paper’s release could correct.</p>



<p>Cabinet reshuffles led by Prime Minister Sunak have implied a further delay in the white paper’s release, leading to growing frustration in the gambling sector.While we can make predictions, there will remain uncertainty until the full white paper is released. One thing’s for sure – gambling platforms will likely have to ensure they’re protecting their users, especially those problem gamblers resulting in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> procedures becoming even more important.</p>

<p><br>
Northern Block and Canadian Bank Note enthusiastic about delivering a more convenient and intuitive solution for Canadian citizens, by unifying mDLs and Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.northernblock.io/">Northern Block Inc</a>. and<a href="http://www.cbnco.com/"> Canadian Bank Note Ltd. (CBN)</a> are working together to create a more convenient and user-friendly solution for Canadians by combining different types of digital credentials, such as Mobile Driving Licences (mDLs), AnonCreds and JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials (VCs), using Hyperledger Aries technology. They plan to first focus on integrating mDLs and JSON-LD VCs into Hyperledger Aries wallets, and then work on offline verification using NFC and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transfer.</p>
<p>Both companies recognize that different credential technologies are suitable for different use cases and have varying levels of adoption in the industry. Therefore, to make it easier for citizens and ensure interoperability, a consistent approach across all technologies is essential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Hyperledger Aries and various verifiable credential formats, such as AnonCreds and JSON-LD VC, is a great choice for government programs that aim to provide citizens with privacy-preserving high-assurance personal identity credentials. Aries is a technology that is well-suited for digital interactions where citizens want to build different types of relationships with their peers. Citizens can use the same set of VCs for various purposes, and these VCs may need to support privacy preservation or not, depending on the type of relationship they want to build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile Driver’s Licences (mDLs) are gaining widespread acceptance and becoming more practical due to their standardization under ISO/IEC 18013-5 and the forthcoming 18013-7, which establish a unified framework for their development, issuance, and verification. As a focused use case, mDLs are specifically designed to address the unique requirements of driver’s licence management, including distinct data attributes, security features, and regulatory compliance needs. Consequently, they are better equipped to tackle the specific challenges and requirements of this application, offering increased utility in this context.</p>
<p>Northern Block actively engages in open source, standards, and conformance criteria communities, participating in organizations such as the Hyperledger Foundation, Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP), the Digital Identity and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC – PCTF), and the Digital Governance Standards Institute. Northern Block recently showcased multi-VC format issuance and presentation flows, using AnonCreds and W3C JSON-LD credentials, as part of their commitment to interoperability, supported by funding from the Ontario Government. Northern Block is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario (<a href="http://www.northernblock.io/">www.northernblock.io</a>).</p>
<p>CBN, a security solutions provider to over 40 jurisdictions operating in the passport, driver’s licence, and identity market, deployed the world’s first mDL for live transactions and was awarded the contract to supply an mDL to the Commonwealth of Virginia. CBN is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada (<a href="http://www.cbnco.com/">www.cbnco.com</a>).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an essential component of IT security today, enabling organizations to control access to their systems and data by managing user identities, access entitlements and authentication. The importance of IAM continues to grow as cyber threats continue to evolve and data privacy regulations become more stringent.</p>
<p>According to a recent survey conducted by KuppingerCole Analysts, nearly 95% of organizations have an IAM solution in place. Most medium-sized to large organizations, factually, have multiples different IAM solutions in place for providing different IAM capabilities. This clearly shows the increasing importance of IAM in today's IT security.</p>
 Trends, facts and figures 
<p>The shift to cloud-based IAM solutions, also commonly referred to as IDaaS (Identity as a Service), which offer greater scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness than traditional on-premises solutions, is one of the key trends driving the growth of the IAM market. As more organizations adopt cloud computing, IDaaS is gaining popularity. Moreover, integration of IAM with additional security solutions, such as Endpoint Protection, Detection and Response (EPDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, is a trend. This integration enables organizations to adopt a more holistic security strategy by monitoring user activity across all systems and applications and detecting and responding to threats in real time. This demonstrates the importance of IAM within cybersecurity strategies.</p>
<p>The IAM market is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace, driven by factors such as those mentioned above, but also others. Regulations require a strong Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) posture. Cybersecurity and Zero Trust initiatives drive the demand for advanced authentication mechanisms&nbsp;such as passwordless authentication and adaptive access controls. KuppingerCole Analysts predicts that the IAM market volume will reach 35.58 billion USD by 2025, representing a CAGR of 16.8%, which is a clear indicator of this strong market growth.</p>
<p>IAM solutions are relevant across the globe. The largest revenue share comes from North America and EMEA, which approximately have a similar share of the global market across the various IAM subsegments. A smaller portion comes from APAC and LATAM, which have lower adoption rates, but we expect to see significant growth in these regions in the coming years.</p>
 A closer look into IAM subsegments 
<p>IGA is a core component of IAM, focused on managing users and their access to systems and data in accordance with policies and regulations. This market is expected to expand in the coming years as organizations seek to streamline identity management processes and ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. In addition, IGA solutions have begun to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate identity-related tasks and increase productivity. It is possible to learn more about this market segment in the Leadership Compass published by KuppingerCole (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81107/identity-governance-and-administration-2022">Identity Governance and Administration 2022 | KuppingerCole</a>).</p>
<p>Biometrics and adaptive access control is another growing area. The goal is to provide enhanced security and user experience over traditional password-based authentication. Their importance continues to grow in the context of Zero Trust initiative and for better protecting against cyberattacks targeting users, their digital identities, and credentials such as passwords.</p>
<p>Finally, Zero Trust security models are driving IAM adoption, requiring strong and continual authentication and authorization for verifying users and their devices. We also expect to see an increase in the adoption of decentralized identity solutions that allow users to reuse identities and associated identity proofs across multiple organizations, systems and applications. Warwick Ashford explained about the future using decentralized identity in his blog post (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023/blog/future-with-decentralized-identity">Gear Up for the Future with Decentralized Identity (kuppingercole.com)</a>.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We expect continued growth in all IAM subsegments. While some are expected to show a good and stable CAGR around 10% others are expected to grow significantly faster. At the upcoming EIC (European Identity Conference), which will take place in Berlin in mid-May, we have several tracks where we will discuss topics such as trends in IGA, maturity levels of Identity Fabrics and the challenges of moving to passwordless authentication. As every year, there will be plenty interesting sessions at EIC. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023/agenda">Agenda | EIC 2023 (kuppingercole.com)</a>.</p>

<p>Since its inception, Aftermath Islands has taken its own, unique path to providing a Web3 experience by developing and incorporating leading technologies that have created an open world platform that confirms, through its partnership with Liquid Avatar, that everyone on the platform can control and manage their digital footprint using biometrics with no username or password for signing into the platform.&nbsp; The Liquid Avatar Mobile App, available in over 100 countries and regions globally via the Apple Store and Google play, provides a Proof of Humanity process, the Meta Park Pass TM, which creates a high level of assurance that all players are individual, real people, reducing fraud, fake and duplicate accounts, and bots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands has generated over $2 million in retail sales, over 7,800 platform purchases, and provided high-fidelity gaming graphics for a real-world virtual experience with no download, making it accessible by a wide variety mobile, tablets and computers.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands has successfully launched its first servers and has incorporated Artificial Intelligence ChatGPT3 to enable Non-Player Characters (NPCs) to engage with players as subject matter experts.&nbsp; The platform also allows instant connections to legacy Web2 websites, eCommerce platforms, search engines, ticketing systems, gaming platforms, educational institutions, social media and more to create a holistic 360-degree experience for consumers and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late October 2022, Aftermath Islands launched its first Play to Earn (P2E) game, Lost Kingdom of T’Sara, (“LKoT”) allowing players to collect resources and exchange them for Resource Pack NFTs that can be used inside the open world platform to create value.&nbsp; To date, users have collected over 3.9 billion resources, successfully created over 4.7 million Resource Pack NFTs and user engagement is upwards of 70 minutes per day, with outliers spending several hours a day playing LKoT.</p>



<p>“The investment in Aftermath Islands open world concept with high fidelity graphics, no download and proven revenues supports our ability to move forward expeditiously and continues to gain momentum and traction in market,” commented David Lucatch, CEO of Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. and Managing Director of Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited. “As a Web3 pioneer and supporter of legacy Web2 platforms, Aftermath Islands has created a unique environment that provides users with a high-fidelity graphics experience with no download, creating a platform similar to the major streaming services but with multi-player usability.&nbsp; We believe that this approach is the launch point to integrating the future of online technologies, engagement, and commerce, while respecting and including today’s vast network of online properties.”</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 10th April to 16th&nbsp;April <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap that focuses on some crucial regulatory developments and their potential effect on the ecosystem. This week, we cover the US setting its regulatory crosshairs on stablecoins, the IMF renewing calls for regulating crypto by citing the FTX collapse and turmoil in the banking sector, an SEC Commissioner blasting the agency’s heavy-handed approach toward the crypto industry, and India’s Finance Minister calling for globally coordinated crypto regulation at G20 meetings.</p> The US has set its Regulatory Crosshairs on its Next Target: Stablecoins <p>Since the FTX debacle, the United States has gone into an overdrive mode to regulate cryptocurrencies, with industry stakeholders raising the alarm and terming the government’s action “Operation Chokehold 2.0.” And now, its focus is on stablecoins.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1635964585621745665?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>A recent regulatory draft proposal detailed provisions stating that insured depository institutions issuing stablecoins would be subject to oversight by corresponding regulatory authorities. The hearing on the proposed stablecoin bill is scheduled for 19&nbsp;April.</p><p>If approved, non-bank institutions would come under Federal Reserve scrutiny, and foreign issuers would need to register to conduct business within the&nbsp;US.</p><p>However, approval of stablecoin issuance would depend on several factors, such as maintaining adequate reserves, including USD or Treasury&nbsp;bills.</p><p>The possible impact of this proposed regulation on the crypto ecosystem and users could be both positive and negative.</p><p>On the positive side, the increased transparency and oversight may foster trust and confidence in stablecoins, leading to broader adoption and utilization in various use cases, such as cross-border transactions and a store of&nbsp;value.</p><p>It could also help prevent fraudulent activities, protect investors, and contribute to a more stable financial system by reducing the likelihood of market manipulation and “black swan”&nbsp;events.</p><p>Conversely, the proposed regulations could have negative consequences, too, for crypto users and the ecosystem at&nbsp;large.</p><p>For instance, the stringent regulatory framework might push some companies to seek friendlier jurisdictions, leading to market fragmentation and creating challenges for global cooperation.</p><p>The regulations might even impose limitations on the privacy and autonomy of users, as increased monitoring and reporting requirements could affect the decentralization aspect that attracts many to cryptocurrencies in the first&nbsp;place.</p> IMF Renews Calls for Regulating Crypto Citing FTX Collapse &amp; Turmoil in Banking&nbsp;Sector <p>The International Monetary Fund called for regulating digital assets and strict prudential requirements for stablecoin issuers in its “Global Financial Stability Report.”</p><p>The IMF believes there should be comprehensive and consistent regulation and supervision in the crypto-asset ecosystem.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/ilker_zorlu_/status/1646517523372982277?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The report emphasizes the failures of FTX and crypto-friendly banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, as reasons to stress the need for adequate supervision and regulation.</p><p>However, these claims are unsubstantiated, as cryptocurrencies did not play a role in the banks’ failures. In fact, the true causes for these failures lie elsewhere, which calls into question the rationale for increasing supervision and regulation specifically targeting the crypto industry, citing recent bank failures.</p> SEC Commissioner Blasts Agency’s Heavy-Handed Approach Toward Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>Hester Peirce, the Commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), criticized the agency for being too rigid in regulating new technologies and punishing entrepreneurs who try to innovate, including those in the crypto industry.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/remer_eth/status/1647283342491123715?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>“Today’s Commission tells entrepreneurs trying to do new things in our markets to come in and register. When entrepreneurs find they cannot, the Commission dismisses the possibility of making practical adjustments to our registration framework to help entrepreneurs register and instead rewards their good faith with an enforcement action. Today’s Commission treats the notice-and-comment rulemaking process not as a conversation, but as a threat,” said&nbsp;Peirce.</p><p>She argued for the need to balance fostering innovation and protecting investors. Her comments come amid criticism of the SEC’s slow guidance and enforcement actions regarding cryptocurrencies and related activities.</p> India’s Finance Minister Calls for Globally Coordinated Crypto Regulation at G20&nbsp;Meetings <p>India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, attended G20 meetings in the US and urged for a globally coordinated approach to regulate crypto assets due to their potential to cause macroeconomic instability.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1647606092745023490?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>G20 members agree on the need for globally coordinated regulation of crypto assets to deal with related challenges, according to Sitharaman.</p><p>She added that under India’s G20 presidency, a “synthesis paper” will be prepared on crypto assets following discussions between finance ministers and central bank governors from member countries.</p> Introducing Veriscope’s New Feature: Bloom Filter for Deposit Addresses <p>We’re excited to unveil our latest feature: the Veriscope Bloom Filter for deposit addresses.</p><p>This Redis Bloom-based innovation streamlines deposit address management and attestation events for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), enhancing their experience and simplifying their workflow.</p><p>By using the Veriscope Bloom Filter, VASPs can easily upload their deposit addresses, which narrows NEW_ATTESTATION events to only those specific addresses.</p><p>This means less manual work and a more efficient way to identify and respond to relevant attestations.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-releases-bloom-filters-a-game-changer-for-vasps-to-identify-address-relevant-attestations">Visit our blog post</a> to discover more about the Veriscope Bloom Filter and how it can transform your VASP experience.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">G7’s Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC&nbsp;Adoption</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1645955195837267974?s=20">Japan is taking major steps to boost its crypto&nbsp;industry</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1646189406217285632?s=20">France is considering extending proposed crypto laws to include&nbsp;DeFi</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>It has been a very long time since the last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-0-is-here/">Dev Pulse</a> — almost three months, in fact! And you know what? It’s kind of been a good thing! In keeping with our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-released/#what-does-app-stability-mean-for-devs">promise</a>, the last four releases of Holochain 0.1 have had no breaking changes for hApp developers and users, so the changelogs haven’t had much to report on. This has meant that devs can keep focusing on the thing that matters most to them — their app — rather than worrying about how we’re changing things on them yet again this week.</p><p>And things won’t be changing much even in Holochain 0.2. There are very few breaking changes, and almost none of them will be in your hApp code. With that said, the most significant breaking change is the replacement of QUIC transport with WebRTC — but remember that, true to our six-month promise, we’ll still keep running our QUIC proxy relay server for Holochain 0.1 until July 15th, and our bootstrap server now supports both QUIC and WebRTC.</p><p>Holochain 0.2.0’s <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.0-beta-rc.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">first release candidate</a> was published on 16th March, the full-feature release candidate <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.0-beta-rc.4?ref=blog.holochain.org">0.2.0-beta-rc.4</a> was published on 13 April, and the final release will be published on 27 April. I’ll share all the release notes on that date.</p><p>With that, let’s see what’s happened since 0.1.0 was released!</p> Holochain 0.1.1 to 0.1.4: Bug fixes and backports <p>Rather than report on each release individually, I’ll just give you the full list of changes for all four releases. Although we’re still on the 0.1.x series, we did introduce two very minor breaking changes which should take mere moments of code refactoring.</p>  Breaking (hApp manifests): The <code>version</code> field of a DNA section in a hApp manifest has been renamed to <code>installed_hash</code> and is now a single optional hash rather than an optional list of hashes. This field can be used to verify the integrity of a DNA at hApp install time. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2157?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2157</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2180?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2180</a>)  Bugfix, breaking (HDI, host API): Validation of DHT operations for private entries would <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/1861?ref=blog.holochain.org">fail</a> for the <code>StoreEntry</code> op which would put the entry in the author’s own store. This has now been fixed. As the changelog says, this is a ‘slightly’ breaking change because <code>FlatOp</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1909?ref=blog.holochain.org">previously</a> <code>OpType</code>, see below) has some new enum variants that your validation code may need to match against. The compiler will tell you if your code needs to be refactored! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1910?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1910</a>)  New: <code>OpType</code> is renamed to <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.3.0-beta-rc.3/hdi/flat_op/enum.FlatOp.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>FlatOp</code></a>, and the <code>Op::to_type()</code> helper is renamed to <code>Op::flattened()</code>. This enum is used in validation callback to simplify otherwise complex <code>switch</code> code paths. The old names still exist as aliases to the new ones, so this isn’t a breaking change yet. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1909?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1909</a>)  New: Certain conductor API methods that can return <code>CellMissing</code> errors now return <code>CellDisabled</code> when the cell is present but disabled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2092?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2092</a>)  New: Enabling or disabling a clone cell is now idempotent — if you try to enable an already enabled clone or disable an already disabled one, it’ll return a successful result rather than an error. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2093?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2093</a>)  New: The conductor can now be compiled to support tx5, the new WebRTC-based transport protocol to be used in 0.2.x. Note: This doesn’t mean that 0.1.x conductors can talk with 0.2.x, and is mostly for development purposes. Please don’t use this if you’re compiling your own conductor! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1741?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1741</a>)  Performance: When the last instance of a hApp is removed from a conductor, the shared DHT data is deleted to clear storage space. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1805?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1805</a>)  Performance: Performance of zome calls, particularly remote ones, has improved dramatically due to optimisation of capability lookups. Previously, mere hundreds of calls would show a noticeable slowdown as more commits were made to the source chain; now thousands of commits only affect zome call time by about a millisecond. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2097?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2097</a>)  Bugfix: When uninstalling the last instance of a hApp, locally stored DHT data is now cleaned up. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1805?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1805</a>)  Bugfix: Attempts to create duplicate clone cells (that is, clones of a DNA within one hApp with identical DNA hashes) are now rejected. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1997?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1997</a>)  Bugfix: The <code>name</code> field in a DNA manifest or definition incorrectly affected the DNA hash; this has now been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2099?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2099</a>)  Bugfix: The network seed was ignored for DNA roles whose provisioning was set to <code>None</code> in the hApp manifest at install time; this bug has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2102?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2102</a>)  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main-0.1/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org#20230203200648">full changelog</a> for the 0.1 series.</p> JavaScript client 0.12.1 to 0.12.5   Update: Changes to the admin API’s <code>NetworkInfo</code> endpoint have been integrated, making JS client 0.12.1 the first release fully compatible with Holochain 0.1. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/172?ref=blog.holochain.org">#172</a>)  Development: The development environment for working on the repo has changed from nix-shell to a Nix flake; if you’re contributing to client development, you can now use <code>nix develop</code> in the root of the repo. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/175?ref=blog.holochain.org">#175</a>)  Improvement: When a websocket closes, reject pending API requests. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/178?ref=blog.holochain.org">#178</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/179?ref=blog.holochain.org">#179</a>)  Bugfix: Attempting to call a zome function by role name when giving a provenance now fails with an error. (Note: this change may be reverted in a future release.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/176?ref=blog.holochain.org">#176</a>)   Rust client 0.3.1   Development: The development environment for working on the repo has changed from nix-shell to Nix flakes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/pull/12?ref=blog.holochain.org">#12</a>)   Tryorama 0.11.1 and 0.11.2   Development: Similar to the client repos, the development environment for working on this repo has changed to a Nix flake. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/pull/166?ref=blog.holochain.org">#166</a>)  Improvement: Conductor logging now outputs at the <code>info</code> log level. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/commit/96bd726944da2f573943eaebe9f838a62adef496?ref=blog.holochain.org">96bd726</a>)   Launcher 0.9.1 to 0.9.3 <p>These releases bring all sorts of UX improvements:</p>  Improvement: The Launcher can now auto-update to the newest version.  Improvement: Windows <code>.msi</code> installer files are now code-signed.  Improvement: A 404 page is now shown for an improperly formed UI (that is, one without an <code>index.html</code> file).  Improvement: Support for multiple languages has been added, with German as the first alternative to English.  Improvement: The cell info card now shows the network seed.  Improvement: The arrival of new data in the app library is more obvious.  Bugfix: A bug on macOS has been fixed where Holochain processes would keep running after the Launcher was quit.  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">release notes</a> for full changelogs and known existing issues.</p> Around the community <p>Folks, the thing I’m most excited about right now is not beta releases — it’s the ways in which the developer ecosystem is growing and blooming (I guess I’ve got springtime on my mind <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-developer-ecosystem-in-full-bloom/">again</a>).</p><p>Developers are busy learning how to build hApps — the Holochain Foundation, in collaboration with our education partner Mythosthesia, ran an <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-training-recap/">online course</a> last month, and the quality of commitment among participants was encouraging. These folks are going places. There are already some exciting demo projects and plans for mature apps built on Holochain.</p><p>We’re starting to see in-person meetings happen around the world; there was a Holochain hackathon in <a href="https://twitter.com/Holochain/status/1644611045695127553?ref=blog.holochain.org">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Neighbourhoods</a> meetups in <a href="https://twitter.com/Neighbour_hoods/status/1641499291800723458?ref=blog.holochain.org">Wellington and Auckland</a>. Online events like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@holochain-in-action?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain in Action</a> co-learning meetings are starting again too.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XONE88KkbQk&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">most recent</a> Holochain in Action featured a demo of Neighbourhoods’ Social Sensemaker DNA.</p><p>This coincides with the first public release of the first developer preview of their Social Sensemaker.

<p>On July 27th, 2021, the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, announced the creation of the FTX Climate Program. Showing its commitment to fight climate change with a nicely designed website, presenting a well-thought out and wide list of strategies and projects.</p>
<p>However, in November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy after the world discovered massive wrongdoings – a fraud only comparable to Bernie Madoff’s multi-billion-dollar Ponzi scheme that hit Wall Street fifteen years ago. After the collapse, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried admitted that the FTX Climate Program was just a façade. A scam to attract environmentally conscious people.</p>
 Sustainability requires trust 
<p>With sustainability scams like this, how can you as an individual or a business leader spend any money on sustainability?</p>
<p>Personally, I have offset flights when I couldn’t avoid flying, and supported reforestation projects at other times. I did this because I believe we must do something now to avoid a climate disaster. But at the precise time I was typing my credit card details, did I know if those euros would reach the correct destination to have a positive impact? I had no choice but to simply trust that they would.</p>
<p>If you offset a flight, you trust in the airline. But does the airline really know if those carbon credits you bought will lead to a real offset? Do they know the whole supply chain of actors (companies, auditors, projects, field operators) for those carbon credits?</p>
<p>The harsh answer is No. Today hardly anybody can say for sure where the money will end up.</p>
 Transparency in the voluntary carbon market 
<p>Today, both individuals and companies that wish to reduce the devastating effect of the climate crisis can buy different types of carbon credits (e.g. offset a flight) to reduce their carbon footprint. All these transactions are made in the voluntary carbon market, so called because the purchases are made without any obligation, such as a government mandate.</p>
<p>At this point, hundreds of innovative companies have appeared with the promise of using the best of today’s technology to catalyse the voluntary carbon markets. Bringing transparency is a promise these ventures overwhelmingly have in common. Such services are tackling this problem through different fronts, for example:</p>
 
 A carbon accounting SaaS application that helps a company measure, report, and reduce carbon impact from a single web user interface. Such an application would help a company with their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting. 
 A platform that “tokenises” carbon assets, so carbon credits are listed on blockchains. 
 A game-like app that makes it very easy to buy carbon credits, paying with either fiat or cryptocurrencies. 
 
<p>In these cases, the services rely on several 3rd party actors (partners), for instance: reforestation projects, carbon removal companies, laboratories, marketplaces, auditors, and more. These partners have to be vetted and onboarded. If—as the end buyer—I see a list of some of these partners, can I really know who I’m transacting with? No. Do I know how their identity is being verified? No. Even though these services claim to be using the latest technology, the identity verification doesn’t seem to be based on digital identity’s latest standards.</p>
 Environmental, social, and governance 
<p>Where ESG (environmental, social, and governance) is concerned, as GLEIF’s Clare Rowley said in our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/history-of-lei/" title="History of LEIs Podcast Episode">History of LEIs Podcast Episode</a>, “data is core to addressing the question of sustainability and the current climate crisis.” Publicly traded companies are already publishing these ESG reports, which are read by different regulators, existing and potential investors, the media, and consumers. Such reports include traditional financial information on their investments, but the missing piece is that they should also include a verified profile of the company and their partners. Otherwise, we don’t know whom we’re doing business with, and the data is indeed insufficient. Also, in the same interview, Clare shared that, “As the world around sustainability reporting becomes more standardised, we expect the LEI there growing as a tool to connect.”</p>
 How verified digital identities can help 
<p>Verified digital identities are a crucial element to solve this problem, which, strictly speaking, has two main elements:</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must verify the real identity of every organisation globally. Regardless of whether it’s a startup, listed company, non-profit, educational institution, or alternative. Every time you interact or do business with a company, even on the other side of the globe, you must be 100% sure it’s a real company. If real, you must then be sure that the person you are talking with has the right to legally represent that company, and that you can know who the owners of that company are. The LEI (<a href="https://rapidlei.com/knowledge-base/what-is-an-lei-code/">Legal Entity Identifier</a>) is the only technology that can make this happen and must be incorporated in every sustainability solution.</p>
<p>The second part of the solution is verifying the real identity of the person behind every transaction, as that builds trust. In the Nordics, bank authentication is widely available and popular. Other countries have similarly highly assured identification methods. The European Union’s eIDAS 2.0 will come soon to fill this gap at a European level, and we must embrace similar initiatives globally.</p>
 Bringing together sustainability and transparency 
<p>We need verification of both companies’ and individuals’ identities, for the whole supply chain, of every carbon credit. This is the only way to add real transparency and build the trust that we need for both businesses and individuals to embrace sustainability.</p>
<p>Using the word transparency in a company’s motto or putting it in bold fonts on a flashy website, is not enough. Sometimes I feel that companies trying to build sustainability solutions and talking about transparency provide the argument that “we are a web3 solution, therefore trust us.” Instead, trust is built on concrete actions, not with ethereal visions. The good news is that today we have the right tools at our disposal.</p>
<p>Without verified digital identities, sustainability will lose its battle. And this battle must be won, and we all must help to win it.</p>

  The G7 countries under Japan’s presidency, are emphasizing tighter cryptocurrency regulations to address digital technology challenges and protect the global crypto community.  One of its key objectives is to help developing nations adopt CBDCs, as the G7 members believe it could foster financial inclusivity.  At the same time, increasing political resistance and privacy concerns around CBDCs highlight the need for preserving privacy, which is a strong point of cryptocurrencies.  <p>As Japan takes on the presidency of the G7 this year, the Group of Seven countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S., along with the European Union — are set to address the challenges posed by fast-moving digital technology.</p><p>Japan’s Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs, Masato Kanda, emphasized the need for tighter cryptocurrency regulations in light of last year’s collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, which reportedly served as a “serious wake-up call” for policymakers worldwide.</p><p>With varying viewpoints on cryptocurrency assets among nations, the G7 seeks to cultivate international agreement on the importance of more robust regulatory frameworks.</p><p>The group believes that implementing these enhanced regulations will safeguard the global crypto community from market instability and cybersecurity risks while reducing the potential for misinformation and minimizing social and political rifts stemming from digital advancements.</p><p>More on the topice: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-sneak-peek-into-japans-cbdc-program">A Sneak Peak Into Japan’s CBDC&nbsp;Program</a></p> CBDC: A Magical Pill to Empower Developing Nations? <p>Seeing CBDCs as a superior alternative to cryptocurrencies in terms of fostering financial inclusivity, the G7 plans to assist developing nations in adopting CBDCs consistent with international standards.</p><p>And how would they do so? By addressing potential risks associated with CBDC development through G7’s public policy principles for retail CBDCs, such as transparency and sound governance.</p> Political Resistance and Privacy Concerns Around&nbsp;CBDCs <p>While many governments and financial institutions worldwide are exploring the potential of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), not all politicians are on board with this innovation.</p><p>For instance, in the United States, a group of Republican Representatives, led by majority whip Tom Emmer, introduced the <a href="https://emmer.house.gov/2023/2/emmer-leads-effort-to-squash-financial-surveillance-state-initiatives">CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act</a> in February this year. This legislation aims to halt the efforts of the Federal Reserve in developing a CBDC that could potentially strip Americans of their financial privacy.</p><p>These politicians argue that a CBDC would create significant privacy concerns, as the government could potentially use this digital currency to monitor citizens’ transactions. They believe that, if implemented, a CBDC could lead to greater government surveillance and control over individuals’ finances, following in the footsteps of authoritarian regimes like China and&nbsp;Russia.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/624159">a petition against introducing a “programmable” CBDC</a> has garnered attention in the United Kingdom. Opponents believe such a currency would grant the issuer excessive control over how individuals use their&nbsp;money.</p><p>In response, the UK government clarified that it has no plans to program any future CBDC or restrict how the currency is&nbsp;spent.</p><p>These political debates and public concerns around CBDCs underscore the delicate balance that must be struck between innovation and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As G7 nations strive to support developing countries in implementing CBDCs, they must also address these privacy concerns and work towards building a financial landscape that ensures both innovation and individual sovereignty.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/cbdcs-101-understanding-the-basics-of-central-bank-digital-currencies">CBDCs 101 — Understanding the Basics of Central Bank Digital Currencies</a></p> CBDCs vs. Cryptocurrencies: What You Should&nbsp;Know? <p>While both Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and cryptocurrencies leverage the power of blockchain technology, there are some key differences that set them&nbsp;apart.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies emphasize decentralization, providing users with anonymity, and can serve as both an investment vehicle and transferring value. On the other hand, CBDCs, being government-backed digital money, prioritize centralization and are mostly focused on transferring value.</p><p>CBDCs are also more likely to utilize private, permissioned blockchain networks, whereas cryptocurrencies are most likely to operate on permissionless, open networks. Additionally, CBDC transactions are tied to users’ bank accounts and personal information, unlike the anonymous transactions typical of cryptocurrencies.</p> Impact scenarios <p>As the G7 addresses the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), both positive and negative consequences emerge for crypto users and the broader ecosystem.</p><p>Enhanced regulations offer stability, user protection, and financial inclusivity through CBDC implementation in developing nations, while adherence to international standards fosters responsible, transparent digital asset governance. However, concerns around privacy, government surveillance, and potential abuse of power cannot be overlooked.</p><p>With the G7 striving to foster innovation and collaboration, finding a balance between the regulations and protecting individual freedoms remains critical. As such, the G7’s actions should prioritize the needs of citizens, ensuring that the development of a digital financial landscape respects privacy rights and empowers users in the rapidly changing world of cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;CBDCs.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption-617c544a9e9b">G7’s Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC Adoption</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Learn how Fission is making it possible to query decentralized data with RhizomeDB.</p> What is RhizomeDB? <p>RhizomeDB is a protocol that executes a local-first edge database for querying decentralized data. It extends our <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative">Webnative SDK</a> with support for concurrent access to structured and unstructured data distributed in content-addressable networks and enables the creation of decentralized, collaborative applications 🤯. </p> How Does RhizomeDB Work? <p>RhizomeDB is built from the ground up for interoperability between applications, with a focus on real-time collaboration. One way of looking at Rhizome is a framework for CRDTs powered by a database engine. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a>, or Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types, offer eventual consistency without coordination between replicas, algorithmically resolve any inconsistencies, and guarantee that any replicas with different states will eventually converge into the same state. </p><p>RhizomeDB is also a tuple store. There are many <a href="https://www.upgrad.com/blog/list-vs-tuple/">benefits to using tuples</a>, one of which is immutability. Every entry in the system must be entered in a consistent format, thereby vastly decreasing the number of mistakes that can be made that would interfere with the schema-building and querying process. It also makes it very easy to change how you view the data at read-time and even view your data as tables, graphs, columns, time series, etc. </p><p>In addition to the typical entity-attribute-value tuple of many stores, Rhizome includes a "causal" link that points to the data that the entry depends on. Most data don't directly depend on each other, but some, like the output of an analysis that uses other data, do. This causal link has a couple of advantages, including making the structure BFT, or Byzantine Fault Tolerant. It's a way of "showing your work" so to speak, so that if some nodes go down or malicious actors attempt to input false information, the system won't collapse. </p><p>The causal link also allows RhizomeDB to express Operations-based CRDTs, or CmRDTs, which can change operations that don't affect the end result. An added benefit is it can reduce the amount of necessary compute power.</p> What Makes RhizomeDB Special? <p>As far as we're aware, RhizomeDB is the first system that will combine encryption, CRDTs, and local-first database functionality (we're still building out the encryption part). Another way to look at is that RhizomeDB is a CRDT framework built on top of well-understood database tech. This means we can apply lots of optimizations over time, such as incremental view maintenance, precomputing strategies, distributed indexing, and more.</p><p>For developers, RhizomeDB means they no longer need to worry about consistency, synchronization, and data privacy when building apps with decentralized data - a huge win! &nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, developers can interpret data according to their own needs. For example, say you wanted to build your own decentralized social network. RhizomeDB, in a sense, enables a BYOA (Bring Your Own Algorithm) approach to this type of project because it is customizable and prioritizes local-first data. If you wanted your social network to be a community solely focused on 1970s disaster films, you could input the relevant data and use tailored variables to query it. Then as mentioned previously, the CRDTs will use their built-in algorithm to do the rest of the heavy lifting and guarantee consistency. You can also remix and evolve your data over time.</p> RhizomeDB To-Do List Demo <p>Here is a proof-of-concept demo that Applied Researcher Quinn Wilton created.</p><p>Other potential use cases are a CRM, a shared media library...there are so many possibilities! </p> What is RhizomeDB's Current Status? <p>RhizomeDB is still in its early days and is a work in progress. However, it can already do impressive things like query and compute over multiple sources and users in a content-addressed store. It doesn't (directly) help you find the data you're looking for, but you could build an indexer out of RhizomeDB and <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a> to accomplish that.</p> Open-Sourcing RhizomeDB  <p>At Fission, we believe working in public is the quickest way to test, iterate, and build a successful protocol. Therefore, today we are officially open-sourcing RhizomeDB under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache license</a>! If you'd like to explore the code, head to the <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">GitHub repo</a> and wade in! Please be advised that there is currently no documentation, the codebase is unfinished, and it is not yet production-ready. All of this will come as soon as it's ready, but if you're intrepid and want to dive right in, have at it!</p> Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 + Causal Islands <p>Quinn will present at <a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing</a> in the Interplanetary Databases track and at <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/quinn-wilton">Causal Islands</a>. Here is the talk abstract:</p><p>Querying Decentralized Data in Rhizomatic Systems with Quinn Wilton</p><p>Shifting storage and compute toward the far edge reflects an extreme departure from traditional cloud-based architectures, bringing with that shift a new set of challenges for application developers. Rhizome is a decentralized database for InterPlanetary Linked Data that embraces these challenges to open up new ways of thinking about consistency, interoperability, and privacy. This talk introduces the ideas underpinning Rhizome, and demonstrates how they come together to empower developers to build and reason about new types of peer-to-peer and decentralized applications.</p><p>If you are attending these conferences, we look forward to hearing your ideas and feedback on RhizomeDB! Can't make it? Don't worry - the talks will be recorded and shared here on the blog. </p> What's Next for RhizomeDB <p>Building and documentation will be our focus going into the coming months. We also have plans to make RhizomeDB real-time and encrypted!</p><p>You can follow our progress by reading <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/weekly-notes-quinn/3873/4">Quinn's weekly notes</a> and visiting the <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">repo</a>.</p>

 Introduction <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py">ocean.py</a> is a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ocean-lib/">Python library</a> to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume data, using <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/getting-started-with-ocean-py-part-1-introduction-installation-530295c3d3b4">Part 1</a> of this series introduced ocean.py, and described how to install it. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/getting-started-with-ocean-py-part-2-set-up-locally-e232dc8d8182">Part 2</a> described how to set up for local testing, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/getting-started-with-ocean-py-part-3-set-up-remotely-a3cfec47a3fa">part 3</a> for&nbsp;remote.</p><p>This post is a fun one! We pick up where part 2 &amp; 3 left off, and walk you through the main&nbsp;flow:</p><p>In this post, you’ll publish a data asset, post for free / for sale, dispense it / buy it, and consume it. We’ll closely follow ocean.py’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md">main-flow.md</a>.</p> Background: Ocean&nbsp;Basics <p>This post assumes a basic understanding of Ocean data NFTs and datatokens. If you don’t yet know about these, we recommend learning about those first, by text or&nbsp;video.</p>  To learn by text: start with the simple description at <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/data-nfts-and-data-tokens">oceanprotocol.com main site</a>. If you want to dive deeper yet, then check out Ocean docs on <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/architecture">architecture</a> and <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/datanft-and-datatoken">Data NFTs &amp; datatokens</a>.  Or, check out the video version&nbsp;👇.   Main Flow:&nbsp;Video <p>Here’s a video version this post 👇. Or, jump straight into the text content&nbsp;below.</p> Main Flow:&nbsp;Text <p>Steps in the&nbsp;flow:</p>  Alice publishes dataset  Bob gets access to the dataset (faucet, priced,&nbsp;etc)  Bob consumes the&nbsp;dataset  <p>Let’s go!</p><p>(Note: this blog post is up-to-date as of Apr 2023, but if 2+ months have passed, we recommend using the READMEs directly for up-to-date instructions. )</p> 1. Alice publishes dataset <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4pp3qyq5tc&amp;ab_channel=Smokie-Topic">Alice! Alice! Who the f*** is&nbsp;Alice?</a></p><p>Well, for the steps below, you are Alice!&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/girl/">👧</a></p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> #data info<br>name = "Branin dataset"<br>url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trentmc/branin/main/branin.arff"<br><br>#create data asset<br>(data_nft, datatoken, ddo) = ocean.assets.create_url_asset(name, url, {"from": alice})<br><br>#print<br>print("Just published asset:")<br>print(f"  data_nft: symbol={data_nft.symbol}, address={data_nft.address}")<br>print(f"  datatoken: symbol={datatoken.symbol}, address={datatoken.address}")<br>print(f"  did={ddo.did}") <p>You’ve now published an Ocean&nbsp;asset!</p>  data_nft is the base (base&nbsp;IP)  datatoken for access by others (licensing)  ddo holding&nbsp;metadata  <p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-publish-details">Appendix: Publish Details</a>.)</p> 2. Bob gets access to the&nbsp;dataset <p>If you’ve ever spent time in the world of crypto, or cryptography:</p><blockquote>Wherever there’s a Bob, there’s always an&nbsp;Alice</blockquote><p>OK, OK. So yes, there’s a Bob. He wants to consume the dataset that Alice just published. The first step is for Bob to get 1.0 datatokens.</p><p>Below, we show four possible approaches:</p>  A &amp; B are when Alice is in contact with Bob. She can mint directly to him, or mint to herself and transfer to&nbsp;him.  C is when Alice wants to share access for free, to&nbsp;anyone  D is when Alice wants to sell&nbsp;access  <p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> from ocean_lib.ocean.util import to_wei<br><br>#Approach A: Alice mints datatokens to Bob<br>datatoken.mint(bob, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br><br>#Approach B: Alice mints for herself, and transfers to Bob<br>datatoken.mint(alice, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br>datatoken.transfer(bob, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br><br>#Approach C: Alice posts for free, via a dispenser / faucet; Bob requests &amp; gets<br>datatoken.create_dispenser({"from": alice})<br>datatoken.dispense(to_wei(1), {"from": bob})<br><br>#Approach D: Alice posts for sale; Bob buys<br># D.1 Alice creates exchange<br>price = to_wei(100)<br>exchange = datatoken.create_exchange({"from": alice}, price, ocean.OCEAN_address)<br><br># D.2 Alice makes 100 datatokens available on the exchange<br>datatoken.mint(alice, to_wei(100), {"from": alice})<br>datatoken.approve(exchange.address, to_wei(100), {"from": alice})<br><br># D.3 Bob lets exchange pull the OCEAN needed<br>OCEAN_needed = exchange.BT_needed(to_wei(1), consume_market_fee=0)<br>ocean.OCEAN_token.approve(exchange.address, OCEAN_needed, {"from":bob})<br><br># D.4 Bob buys datatoken<br>exchange.buy_DT(to_wei(1), consume_market_fee=0, tx_dict={"from": bob}) <p>You may not realize it, but you just covered a crazy amount of ground!! You just went through four different ways to share data! Minting, transferring, faucets, and&nbsp;selling!</p><p>What made this possible is that the access control to the data is tokenized, via datatokens. Then you were basically using the tools of crypto to move those datatokens around.</p><p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-faucet-details">Appendix: Dispenser / Faucet Details</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-exchange-details">Exchange Details</a>.)</p> 3. Bob consumes the&nbsp;dataset <p>Bob now has the datatoken for the dataset! Time to download the dataset and use&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> # Bob sends a datatoken to the service to get access<br>order_tx_id = ocean.assets.pay_for_access_service(ddo, {"from": bob})<br><br># Bob downloads the file. If the connection breaks, Bob can try again<br>asset_dir = ocean.assets.download_asset(ddo, bob, './', order_tx_id)<br>import os<br>file_name = os.path.join(asset_dir, "file0") <p>Let’s check that the file is downloaded. In a new&nbsp;console:</p> cd my_project/datafile.did:op:*<br>cat file0 <p>The beginning of the file should contain the following contents:</p> % 1. Title: Branin Function<br>% 3. Number of instances: 225<br>% 6. Number of attributes: 2<br>@relation branin<br>@attribute 'x0' numeric<br>@attribute 'x1' numeric<br>@attribute 'y' numeric<br>@data<br>-5.0000,0.0000,308.1291<br>-3.9286,0.0000,206.1783<br>... <p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-consume-details">Appendix: Consume Details</a>.)</p> Conclusion / Next&nbsp;Step <p>You’ve now done a walk-through of the main flow, congrats! As Alice, you published a data asset, posted for free / for sale, and had that Bob guy dispense it / buy it and consume&nbsp;it.</p><p>Have questions? <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/720631837122363412">Here’s</a> the Ocean Protocol #dev-support channel on&nbsp;Discord.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Identity, for the most part, is not natively digital. We have digital artifacts that refer to real-world physical credentials, like driver's licenses and passports. Identity, however, is at the core of most of our interactions in daily life, both physically and digitally, with ever-increasing dependency on digital interactions. </p><p>However, since the internet was built without an identity layer natively baked in, significant coordination and collaboration efforts are required to ensure what is built and adopted can serve use cases across the internet, spanning various industries across the public and private sectors.</p><p>Spruce participates in various working groups of global standards bodies and foundations to champion open-source, interoperable solutions that help create a more privacy-forward, user-centric internet. We have also implemented and architected multiple global emerging identity standards, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials, Sign-In with Ethereum, and more.</p><p>Here are non-exhaustive highlights from our participation in the first quarter of 2023:</p> Global Working Groups: <p>W3C Working Groups: We continued participating as co-editor in the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group to work on the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM) v2.0 standard</a> where we are also leading the holder binding discussion that will contribute to more secure digital credentials for pure online use cases and interactions with digital identity documents. Additionally, we are actively contributing to the definition of the formal semantics for the new RDF 1.2 quoted triples in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/08/rdf-star-wg-charter/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">W3C RDF-star Working Group</a>.</p><p>ISO Working Groups: We continued our participation in <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 Cards and security devices for personal identification</a> in WG4 and WG10 as delegated experts to work on ISO 18013-7, a specification to securely exchange mobile Driver’s License (mDL) online, and on ISO 23220 which is a series of specifications for building blocks for mobile identity documents (mdoc).</p><p>OpenID Foundation Working Groups: We continued our participation in the OpenID Foundation AB/C Working Group as co-editor and contributors. We helped to publish the second implementer’s draft of <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP)</a> and contributed to <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Credential Issuance (OpenID4CI)</a> to get it closer to the first implementer’s draft.</p><p>Additional Working Groups: We joined the <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Open Wallet Foundation (OWF)</a>, a project of the Linux Foundation Europe, as a founding member and are working to stand up its first Technical Advisory Committee with some of the world’s largest digital identity technology and solutions providers. You can learn more about the OWF here: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">  Spruce Joins the OpenWallet Foundation  We’re pleased to announce that Spruce has joined the Open Wallet Foundation, a new open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation Europe, as a founding member.  SpruceSpruce    </a> Ethereum Standards: <p>At the end of 2022, Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE), or <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-4361</a>, moved from “Draft” to “Review” and we are currently incorporating feedback from the community to improve the specification. We are actively working on advancing the specification to the next stage.</p><p>After we authored and published a draft for Sign-In with Ethereum Capabilities, or ReCaps (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-5573</a>), we received significant interest from the Ethereum Magicians and Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance (CASA) communities. As one of the outcomes, we updated the specification to align it more closely with the User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) Specification for interoperability and composability reasons.</p> Authorship and Events: <p>In February, we finalized and published our <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/final-documents/identifier-binding.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT) whitepaper</a> on holder binding from RWOT XI: The Hague, which is co-authored by people from the Federal Printing House of Germany, TNO, Danube Tech, and other leaders in the identity standards community.</p><p>Across the world, there are various digital credential and digital identity guidelines currently being considered for various purposes, like official government-issued documentation, learning and employment records, and more. As contributors to many of the standards paving the way for global adoption, we are thoughtful in reviewing and submitting comments to improve specifications where feedback or formal comments are requested. </p><p>We recently submitted comments for the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/news-events/news/2021/national-technical-specification-for-digital-credentials-provide-greater-privacy-and-security-for?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Canadian National Technical Specification for Digital Credentials and Digital Trust Services</a>. We also intend to provide comments for the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">NIST SP 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, which had its latest major revision in 2017 to accelerate the adoption of the work that is happening across the other various working groups, such as ISO and W3C, that we participate in.</p><p>And last, but certainly not least, next week, we will have a live demonstration of interoperability with Microsoft and Ping Identity at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> in Mountain View, California. This quarter, we continued our engagement in the DIF JWT Interoperability Presentation Profile Initiative, and at IIW, we will demonstrate interoperability based on the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials specifications. We look forward to meeting you there!</p><p>We fundamentally believe this work to champion global standards is core to the success of further adoption of digital identity, allowing for more secure and privacy-preserving, yet seamless interactions that build digital trust across the web. </p><p>If you're interested in discussing or contributing to any of our work outlined above, please contact our team. </p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>There are several ways that hackers can steal passwords, and even encrypted credentials might be vulnerable to attacks.</p>
 What Is a Rainbow Table Attack? 
<p>A rainbow table attack is a type of attack used to crack password hashes through the use of a table of common passwords, hashed, allowing an attacker to discover the original password. Password databases typically “hash,” or irreversibly encrypt, passwords so that they cannot be used to sign into user accounts if that database is stolen. Rainbow table attacks rely on precomputed tables called rainbow tables containing these hashes. By using these tables, an attacker can reverse a hashed password back to its plaintext form more efficiently than by using brute-force methods or simple lookup tables.</p>
<p>A rainbow table is a precomputed set of hash values used to crack password databases that do not store their information as plaintext. These tables allow attackers to access secure systems without guessing a password.</p>
<p>The attacker first creates a “chain” of hash values to generate a rainbow table. This is done by starting with a known value and applying the hash function to get the corresponding hash value. The attacker then compares hashed values from the table against hashed values from a database to look for a matching hash value. When a matching hash value is found, the attacker can use the corresponding password to log in to the target system or access the user’s sensitive information.</p>
<p>Rainbow tables are practical because they can be pre-computed for a specific hash function and password length and reused across multiple targets using the same hash function. This means the attacker doesn’t need to generate new Rainbow Tables for each target, making the attack more efficient.</p>
 What Are Some Real-World Examples of Rainbow Table Attacks? 
 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack">LinkedIn</a>: In 2012, hackers accessed a database containing over 6.5 million hashed passwords from the social networking site LinkedIn. They then used rainbow tables to crack the passwords and leaked them online, exposing millions of user accounts. 
 <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/adobe-online-attack-was-bigger-than-previously-thought/">Adobe Systems</a>: In 2013, hackers accessed a database containing over 150 million encrypted passwords from Adobe Systems. The passwords were encrypted using a weak hashing algorithm, making them easy to crack using Rainbow Tables. 
 <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/07/ubuntu-forums-hacked-2-million-usernames-stolen">Ubuntu Forums</a>: In 2013, the Ubuntu Forums website was hacked, and the attackers obtained a database containing over 1.8 million usernames and hashed passwords. They used brute force and Rainbow Tables to crack the passwords and gain access to the user accounts. 
 
 How Can I Protect Against Rainbow Table Attacks? 
<p>There are several ways to protect against Rainbow Table attacks:</p>
 
 Use Good Password Hygiene: The strength of a password is crucial in protecting against Rainbow Table attacks. The longer and more complex a password is, the more difficult it will be for attackers to guess or crack it. It’s also important to use a different password for each account so that the others will still be secure if one password is compromised. 
 Use Hash Salting: A salted hash is a password combined with a random value before being hashed. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to use precomputed Rainbow Tables to crack passwords because the salt value will differ for each password, even if the passwords are identical. 
 Use a Strong Encryption Method: When storing passwords or other sensitive information, use a robust encryption method to protect it. Algorithms like AES or RSA can provide strong protection against unauthorized access and should be used in conjunction with other security measures. 
 Implement Multi-Factor Authentication: Two-factor authentication adds extra security to the authentication process by requiring users to provide a second piece of information in addition to their password, such as a one-time code generated by a smartphone app or sent via SMS. 
 Update Database and Encryption Software: Attackers can exploit software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems or information. It’s important to keep all software and systems up to date with the latest security patches and updates to prevent Rainbow Table attacks and other types of cyber attacks. 
 
 How Do Rainbow Table Attacks Differ From Other Forms of Cracking? 
<p>Rainbow tables, brute force, and dictionary attacks are methods used by attackers to crack passwords, but they differ in their approach and effectiveness.</p>
 
 A brute force attack works by trying all possible combinations of characters in a password until the correct password is found. This method is very time consuming, as it can take a very long time to try all possible combinations. However, it can still be effective against weak passwords. 
 A dictionary attack, on the other hand, works by trying a list of commonly used passwords, dictionary words, or variations of these words. This method is faster than a brute force attack because it only tries some possible combinations, but it’s less effective against complex or unique passwords. 
 
<p>As we can see, the rainbow table doesn’t rely on “guessing” in the same way as brute force or dictionary attacks. Also, rainbow tables, unlike the other two options, can potentially break through protective cryptography.</p>
 Strengthen Authentication Against Rainbow Table Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>One of the key weak points of an identity management system is the database–specifically, when a hacker gets access to a database dump where they can run different techniques, like a rainbow table attack, against that information.</p>
<p>1Kosmos mitigates these issues by decentralizing identity management. Our decentralized blockchain system removes database honeypots while placing ownership of identity back into the hands of users. The result? Strong, compliant authentication that’s secure today, tomorrow, and into the future.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos BlockID, you get the following security and usability features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.

<p><br>
At Northern Block, our primary goal is to facilitate the orchestration of trust tasks as seamlessly as possible. We aim to make it easier for our partners, customers, and the entire world to engage in digital interactions with trust embedded into the fabric.</p>
<p>The concept of a “trust task” was first introduced to me in the Trust over IP Foundation’s Technical Architecture Specification, but the term was originally coined by Daniel Hardman, who describes it very nicely in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V3v3-g6pAR8oMhk0Az-pheFM7PRCxJO9OsonH7STi5I/edit#slide=id.g2082f750436_0_349">recent presentation of his</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trust tasks differ from applications in important ways: they are multi-party, and they should be composable.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really liked how Daniel displayed trust tasks within the ToIP hourglass model, as it really showcases its composable nature. I’ve taken the liberty of adapting his slide in the context of Northern Block to showcase where we are focused within the large spectrum of digital trust.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You’ll observe that there is a trust task called “ask trust registry.” To support this task, we have been dedicating efforts into developing the necessary supporting systems to ensure its smooth operation.</p>
<p><br>
What is a Trust Registry?<br>
</p>
 
 A trust registry essentially serves as a source of truth and authoritative information. The governance framework behind a trust registry is what makes it authoritative for its trust ecosystem. If there is confidence in the governance framework, it naturally leads to confidence in the authority imposed by the governance body within the trust registry or source of truth. 
 It’s crucial to recognize that a verifiable data registry (such as a blockchain or DLT) doesn’t always provide a source of truth. These registries can serve as storage for information related to a public entity’s decentralized identifiers, DID documents, schemas, credential definitions, and more. Although they offer immutable data storage with resolution and discovery capabilities, they may not always deliver authoritative information. 
 This is where the trust registry comes into play. By providing authoritative information backed by a strong governance framework, trust registries support the attainment of digital trust and ensures that the entities participating in an ecosystem are reliable and credible. If you’d like to learn more about the role of governance, I highly recommend listening to the insightful <a href="https://northernblock.io/governance-and-trust-with-scott-perry/">podcast conversation I had with Scott Perry</a>, a colleague in the digital trust space. Scott chairs the Governance Stack Working Group at the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation, and our discussion delves into this important topic. 
 
<p>​​Within a typical credential acceptance trust task within <a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/">Orbit Enterprise</a>, several sub-trust tasks may need to be orchestrated in order for a party to accept a credential offer. These may include peer connections, secure messaging, negotiations, and the consultation of external supporting systems such as trust registries.</p>
<p></p>
 <p>The holder receiving a credential offer may want to invoke other trust tasks to assist them in making the decision to accept the credential offer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Northern Block has been collaborating closely with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueslatour/">Jacques Latour</a>, Chief Technology &amp; Security Officer at the <a href="https://www.cira.ca/">Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA)</a>, which manages over three million .ca domains as the .ca top-level domain (TLD) registry. Together, we’ve been exploring how the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure can enable digital trust, particularly in the context of trust registries and their role in maintaining authoritative records for .ca domain owners. We recently co-published an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-latour-dns-and-digital-trust/">IETF Working Draft</a> of our work if you wish to have more information.</p>
<p>When an entity is presented with a verifiable claim, there are three things they will want to ensure:</p>
 
 That a claim hasn’t been altered/falsified at any point in time (cryptographic verifiability, verifiable data registries) ✅ 
 That a claim has accurate representation (DID authentication, accurate representation) 🤨 
 That a claim has authority (authorization, authority) 🤨 
 
<p>While cryptographic verifiability is a fundamental aspect of verifiable credential exchange protocols, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee the accurate representation or authority of a specific public key or decentralized identifier (DID).</p>
<p>To address this human trust issue, we’ve utilized the decentralized DNS infrastructure to create a flexible linkage between issuing bodies’ domain names and their DIDs, which doesn’t impose a specific DID method. By enabling issuers to edit their DID documents with pointers to their DNS records, our approach allows for various DID methods to leverage the DNS infrastructure for added assurance.</p>
<p><br>
Why DNS?</p>
 
 The Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure is considered global, unique, resilient, and highly secure, particularly when the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are utilized. As a global system, DNS operates across the internet, mostly known for ensuring that domain names are translated into IP addresses, making it easier for users to access websites and online services. The uniqueness of the DNS lies in the fact that each domain name corresponds to a unique label such as trustregistry.nborbit.io, avoiding any confusion or conflicts. The DNS infrastructure is resilient, as it relies on a distributed hierarchical structure, which minimizes the risk of a single point of failure. Finally, the security of the DNS is significantly enhanced by the implementation of DNSSEC, which provides cryptographic signatures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data within the DNS, preventing attacks such as DNS spoofing or cache poisoning. 
 The exclusive write access granted to domain name owners for their DNS records, coupled with the proper implementation of DNSSEC, enhances the records’ authoritative nature, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the information they provide. This write access is cryptographically verifiable through a chain of trust that, in the Canadian context, flows from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA), and then further down to the .ca domain owners. 
 Beyond the cryptographic trust, CIRA has established processes and agreements with domain name registrars to ensure that .ca domain names meet specific criteria, such as having a Canadian presence. The registry operated by CIRA can be considered sources of truth because they are authoritative in the context of .ca domain names and are connected to existing governance mechanisms managed by CIRA (more details on CIRA governance <a href="https://www.cira.ca/about-cira/board-and-governance">here</a>). This governance structure further reinforces the trustworthiness of the registries, making them reliable sources of information for .ca domain names and their associated entities. 
 
<p><br>
We’ve enabled Orbit Enterprise users to update their DID Documents with pointers to their domain names. Consequently, when someone resolves an issuer’s DID document, they can extract the issuer’s domain from the document and query the issuer’s DNS for additional information addressing the two concerns mentioned earlier. This integration provides a more comprehensive and reliable way of verifying issuers and their authority.</p>
<p></p>
 <p>A credential issuer can ensure that certain information is synced up with their DNS records.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two things that this implementation facilitates for parties are:</p>
 
 To authenticate the DID against a second source, to achieve greater assurance that the DID owner is indeed the same party that owns the domain. This added layer of trust strengthens the overall reliability and security of the system. 
 To get information related to trust registries that the DID claims to be listed in. This enables the discoverability of trust registries that may have been unknown prior. 
 
<p>Orbit Enterprise users can utilize the Trust Decision Helper to assist with the aforementioned points. In the screenshot below, you can observe how a holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records to verify if there’s a match between the DID presented in the DID Document and the DID written in their DNS. Additionally, the holder can query trust registry locations that the issuer directs them to.</p>
<p></p>
 <p>A holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records using the Trust Decision Helper. They are offered with information that can be used as inputs to inform their trust decision.</p> 
<p><br>
With hundreds or thousands of trust registries in existence, it becomes virtually impossible for a central entity to manage their locations and purposes. Furthermore, having a central entity overseeing all global trust registries is not ideal for promoting privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Currently, there are numerous identity systems functioning within specific ecosystems, each serving as a source of truth within their respective contexts. Centralizing the management of these systems is not practical. The challenge lies in discovering the presence of trust registries and understanding their associated governance frameworks. This is where DNS comes in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we trust that an entity is accurately represented by their DID, they should be able to guide us towards sources of truth or trust registries in which they are listed. This decentralized and privacy-preserving approach enables direct interaction with the entity, instead of relying on a central authority. By leveraging the widespread adoption and trust established within the DNS infrastructure, we can discover relevant trust registries and gather inputs to inform our trust decisions.</p>
 <p>The holder was able to validate that the issuer who offered them a credential has authority to offer said credential within a specific trust registry.</p> 
<p><br>
In the final screen which completes the flow, a few key points are evident. Firstly, additional assurance is achieved by validating the match between the DID written in the DNS system and the one presented, enabling cross-verification through two distinct trust systems. Secondly, verification is conducted within a trust registry that the issuer directed the holder to. A third check is performed against the same DID presented in the document, which is also listed in both the DNS records and the specific trust registry. The holder is also given the confidence that, based on this trust registry, the issuer possesses the authority to issue the credential they initially offered.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: we could have presented the holder with the trust registry’s referenced governance framework as well. Something to add in future iterations of the Trust Decision Helper.</p></blockquote>
<p>With these additional inputs, the holder can exit the Trust Decision Helper flow and return to their credential negotiation workflow. They may choose to engage in further trust tasks, such as sending secure messages to the issuing body if they have questions, concerns, or wish to negotiate further. Alternatively, they may be satisfied with the inputs received and feel comfortable making their trust decision and accepting the credential offer.</p>
<p>By incorporating the DNS and trust registry functionality into Orbit Enterprise, we aim to facilitate the scaling of trust registries while enhancing their discovery and usage. The joint presentations between CIRA and Northern Block at IdentityNorth and ICANN have garnered positive feedback, and we continue to actively participate in the Trust Over IP Foundation’s Trust Registry Task Force as well as the Identity Lab of Canada’s Trust Registry Community of Practice. </p>
<p>We will be presenting this work at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> next week, and look forward to engaging in interesting conversations and further advancing what we think to be an important initiative.&nbsp;</p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">Leveraging DNS in Digital Trust: Credential Exchanges and Trust Registries</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.<p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">Leveraging DNS in Digital Trust: Credential Exchanges and Trust Registries</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Just recently, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>, a new security offering based on a combination of the GPT-4 language model, the well-known technology provided by OpenAI that also powers ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing, and Microsoft’s own technology, data, knowledge, and security-specific model from their ongoing global threat intelligence.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, the new solution, which is not publicly available yet, is positioned as a “copilot” augmenting the security analysts in SOCs (Security Operations Centers) / CDCs (Cyber Defense Centers) and empowering them.</p>
<p>A use-case specific application of GPT-4</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot resembles ChatGPT to a certain extent, but also vastly differs from it. The users can prompt the solution and receive answers. These answers are not just text, but also contain flowcharts/visuals that detail the anatomy of the incident that is researched. All or selected parts of the analysis can be stored in a pinboard that summarizes an investigation and that can be shared with others.</p>
<p>The solution also comes with predefined promptbooks. Promptbooks are pre-engineered collections of prompts for various use cases such as malware analysis. Thus, the user must not think about the right questions (or prompts) but can rely on preconfigured analytical steps. Microsoft provides promptbooks, but users can add their own ones and share them.</p>
<p>Log analysis, context, and resolutions</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot analyzes log files and uses the data from Microsoft’s global threat intelligence. It helps in identifying affected systems and accounts and reengineering attacks so that the accounts that had been compromised first can be identified. It currently works closely with Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender, with other integrations to be added. With the multitude of security tools many organizations have deployed, openness for integration to other vendor’s solutions would be something I’d like to see in the future.</p>
<p>All that is done in a way that still requires some level of security skills, but way less than a manual analysis would require. While being somewhat skilled in security, I wouldn’t claim to be capable of doing threat analysis and investigation myself. However, in the demo I received from Microsoft, there was nothing in any of the responses I did not understand. In other words: The Security Copilot would have turned me into a security analyst, by augmenting me.</p>
<p>The tool can even create a PowerPoint file with the condensed results of an investigation, for instance, for reporting to the management. As mentioned, the solution will become integrated with all major Microsoft security services but remain a separate offering.</p>
<p>Augmenting Intelligence</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot, even while being just announced and, as of now, being integrated with only some of the Microsoft security products, is an impressive showcase for the benefit and business value AI can deliver. It can help in closing the skills gap in security and speeding up security analysis. This is done by using a specific model and a vast amount of global data and applying them to the concrete log information of a customer. The customer data is not shared and is not used for machine learning purposes. However, users can rate the quality of responses.</p>
<p>I must admit that I’m impressed by what I have seen so far: A solution delivering tangible benefits and empowering and augmenting human analysts instead of threatening to replace them. This is exactly what we should expect from emerging AI applications, in cybersecurity and in general.</p>

<p>There’s been some movement in state and federal data privacy laws in the United States. Here are three things to know about the regulatory landscape in 2023:</p>



 1. More states are introducing data privacy laws 



<p>The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">says</a>&nbsp;state-level momentum for comprehensive privacy bills is at an all-time high.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;(CPRA) became fully effective on January 1, 2023. This Act is an amendment of the pioneering California Consumer Privacy Act which has been around since 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also on January 1, 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/">Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act</a>&nbsp;came into effect, while the<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-190">&nbsp;Colorado Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB00006&amp;which_year=2022">Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act</a>&nbsp;both take effect on July 1 this year.</p>



<p>Utah will join the states leading the way on data privacy when the&nbsp;<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/SB0227.html">Utah Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;takes effect on December 31, 2023.</p>



<p>Follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">tracker</a>&nbsp;for a clear picture of the current state of play:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">IAPP</a>



<p>We believe one reason for increased state momentum is probably the stalling on a federal data privacy law (see point 3). Some states have no doubt realized that their citizens can’t wait any longer. And that leads us to point 2 …</p>



 2. Protecting privacy through law is a growing priority for Americans 



<p>We’ll let the IAPP’s infographic speak for itself:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">IAPP</a>



<p>Consumers globally have been growing louder in their demands for data privacy for some time.</p>



<p>In 2020 we&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">reported</a>:</p>



 
 High profile, significant, and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;have spooked consumers.&nbsp; 



 Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data.&nbsp; 



 Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can. 



 Levels of consumer trust for brands is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">generally low</a>.&nbsp; 



 Consumers will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a>&nbsp;brands or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay&nbsp;purchases</a>&nbsp;where they perceive a risk to their personal data. 



 The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers. 
 



<p>Indeed, privacy is the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue</a>&nbsp;of this decade that we predicted it would be. So it’s good news that …</p>



 3. A federal data privacy law is (finally) looking more likely 



<p>The US is one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;strong&nbsp;national privacy laws&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While hopes for a federal data privacy law in the US have been raised and dashed many times over many years,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/topics/adppa/">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a>&nbsp;has progressed further than any other attempt at a US federal data privacy bill and is looking increasingly likely to pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two sticking points have been whether bills would pre-empt state law or enable enforcement of a private right of action. Democrats argue for a private right of action that will give consumers legal rights if government fails to enforce the federal law, while Republicans want a federal law to pre-empt state laws to end the patchwork of compliance obligations on business. A counterpoint on the Republicans’ pre-emption position is that some states with strong laws, such as California, may end up with weaker protections if a federal law pre-empts&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">CPRA</a>.</p>



<p>The ADPPA is a compromise position. It’s worth viewing the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/us_federal_privacy_legislation_tracker.pdf">IAPP’s Federal Data Privacy Tracker</a>&nbsp;to understand the details of ADPPA and each of the other privacy-related bills proposed in Congress to date.</p>

<p>“Please come into my office,” the boss said. “Sit down. I have some bad news…”</p>

<p>Getting fired is rough. So is getting laid off. RiFfed. Downscaled. Downsized…</p>

<p>Giving someone the news is also rough--but not as rough as getting it. The people reading this blog are more likely to be givers of that kind of news than getters. And, in particular, are likely to be responsible for the digital side of the process.</p>

<p>Seems like it should be easy. Your employee is no longer a part of your organization, and whoever is the unexpected admin just needs to go to the admin console and delete their account, which controls their corporate identity and access. You know, Google, GitHub, AWS, Intercom, HubSpot, Figma, Zoom, Slack, Datadog, PagerDuty, Notion, Zendesk, and on, and on.</p>

<p>Now, all you have to do is press one button… I mean, go app by app and press one button… I mean, go app by app, and in each app follow the process you created just for this time… Just as soon as you find out who the heck is the admin for half of those. </p>

<p>Once you figure that out, just go to the app, like Google Workspace, and click one button to delete the account… I mean, press a few buttons to first route all new emails going to that email address to someone else like the manager, and then another button (or two or three) to transfer ownership of the Google Drive files to the poor soul who might be running low on storage. Oh, and don’t forget - if things were bad, you need a few more buttons to keep the emails aside for a while. </p><p>GitHub is easy, too: Remove the user from the organization (which will automatically remove them from all teams and revoke access to private repositories). Update and secure any access tokens, deploy keys or secrets the user had access to, and monitor for unauthorized activities.</p>

<p>Now, as for Slack, Zoom, Notion – What? Ok, okay! It’s a blog, not a book. Sheesh.</p>

<p>By the way, if you gave someone access to email, you should know it may be considered personal information, and the employee can demand proof of deletion in some, well, many cases.</p>

<p>You’re here to save time, not get scared of how all your problems are because you didn’t buy some vendor’s software. We have a business to run! So, bottom line: there are a metric ton of regulations – GDPR, SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, PDPB, SLSA. It might seem too much but at the end of the day, we both care about privacy.</p>

<p>TL;DR? Here’s a 63-second clip of what happened to a CEO who delegated too much: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFf7QuauY60">,A weird administrator of the dungeon</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, back on topic: Sad day. You need to let someone go, and you want the digital process to be as smooth as the human process. Just make sure you log everything in one place, keep it up to date, don’t overshare it as it might be sensitive data, but also don’t be the bottleneck, and adjust it for every SaaS app you use. Here’s a checklist – GOOD LUCK!</p> 
   User Verification and Logging 
   Log the termination type (voluntary or involuntary). 
  
   Account and Token Management 
   Reset the user's password to a randomly generated password. 
   Remove all app-specific account passwords, delete MFA recovery codes, and delete all security keys and OAuth tokens. Generate a new set of MFA recovery codes for the user. 
   Remove all email delegations. 
  
   Email and Directory Settings 
   Remove all forwarding addresses, disable IMAP, disable POP, and hide the user from the directory. 
  
   Group Management 
   Remove the user from all groups they belong to. 
  
   Data Transfer and Retention - If suspend is selected. 
   Transfer Google Drive and Documents ownership to the employee's manager. 
   (Business and higher editions) Use Google Vault to set a retention policy or hold on the user's data (emails, chats, Drive files) for compliance, legal, or other purposes. 
  
   Account Suspension and Organization Management 
   Suspend or Delete the user's account. If the termination type is involuntary, grant email delegation access to the employee's manager and move the user to the 'Involuntary Terminations' OU. If the termination type is voluntary, move the user to the 'Voluntary Terminations' OU. 
  
   Device Management 
   (If using an MDM) Wipe device profiles and remove Google accounts from all mobile devices associated with the user using an MDM solution. 
  
   Third-Party Integrations 
   Deprovision the user in any third party app (Slack, Github, Zoom, etc.) 
  
 <p>If you don’t have all that centralized, documented, (automated?) and up-to-date - you are not alone. Let me tell you a secret: we didn’t have that either… Ok, ok, we’re still working on it! It’s all a spreadsheet now, and it’s probably already outdated (welcome, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yeshid_yeshid-ux-frontend-activity-7051569587129131008-hlvL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">,Harjeet</a>!)

<p>Predict-ETH Round 4 just completed and we’re ready to announce the winners — drumroll, please! First, second, and third places go to Soptq ($2500), Cheloco Barrios ($1500), and Jesus Valle ($1000) respectively. Each of the winning predictions showcases how to monetize data successfully using Ocean Protocol’s open source tools for the blockchain. Congratulations to&nbsp;all!</p><p>Predict-ETH is a recurring data challenge to predict the price of ETH and win prize money, using the ocean.py library. Accurately predicting ETH can be a valuable tool in buying and selling ETH, DeFi trading, yield farming, or DeFi protocol development. If your predictions are consistently on point, then you can sell them as a data feed on Ocean Market, earning you even more&nbsp;income.</p><p>Of course, predicting ETH is no walk in the park. It’s a complex task that requires skill, knowledge, and a bit of luck. But that’s exactly why Ocean Protocol hosts regular Predict-ETH competitions — to help you sharpen your machine learning skills, learn from others, and potentially make some cash along the&nbsp;way.</p> Predict-ETH Round 4&nbsp;Setup <p>Predict-ETH Round 4 kicked off on March 7th, 2023. The Round 4 README guided contestants how to make their submissions. <a href="https://desights.ai">Desights</a> was used to host the competition in a decentralized fashion. We held regular workshops with the community for anyone working on the Predict-ETH challenge who wanted facetime with the Ocean core&nbsp;team.</p><p>The submission deadline was April 5th, 2023, at 23:59 UTC. Competitors had to make predictions for ETH price up to 12 hours into the&nbsp;future.</p> Predict-ETH Round 4 Evaluation <p>We streamlined the evaluation criteria for winning in this&nbsp;round.</p><p>The winner = whoever has lowest prediction error (normalized mean-squared error, or NMSE). That’s all. There is no subjectivity.</p><p>To be eligible, competitors must have produced the outcomes that the README&nbsp;guides:</p><p>✅ Signed up to Desights platform, and registered for this competition</p><p>✅ Created an Ocean data&nbsp;NFT</p><p>✅ On the data NFT, set a value correctly: correct field label, correct # predictions, prediction values following correct formatting, predictions encrypted with proper encoding on judges’ public&nbsp;key</p><p>✅ Transferred data NFT to Ocean judges before the submission deadline</p><p>✅ Submitted txid of this transfer to the Desights&nbsp;platform</p><p>✅ All on Mumbai network, not another&nbsp;network</p> Predict-ETH Round 4&nbsp;Winners <p>We’re proud to announce winners for Predict-ETH Round&nbsp;4:</p><p>First place ($2,500) goes to&nbsp;Soptq.</p><p>Second place ($1,500) goes to Cheloco&nbsp;Barrios.</p><p>Third place ($1,000) goes to Jesus&nbsp;Valle.</p><p>Great work, Soptq, Cheloco Barrios, and Jesus&nbsp;Valle!</p><p>Round 3 Statistics: Table of NMSEs, Ranks,&nbsp;etc</p><p>The following table shows the NMSE and NMSE rank by competitor’s data NFT&nbsp;address.</p> Conclusion <p>Crypto price prediction can be an interesting and fun task — better yet, it can be monetized immediately!

 DID, GLN, DUNS, BIC, TIN, and LEI 
<p>Organisation identifiers are essential tools in the modern business world where B2B value is high and trading across borders and supply chain management is complex. Such organisation identifiers help streamline transactions, communication, trust, and collaboration between different parties by identifying and connecting the parties involved. </p>
<p>This blog post will provide an overview of six common organisation identifiers: Decentralised Identifier (DID), Global Location Number (GLN), Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS), Bank Identifier Code (BIC), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). We will also look briefly at their respective real-world use cases.</p>
<p>All these identifiers, except DUNS, are identified in the World Trade Organisation’s <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/standtoolkit22_e.htm">Standards Toolkit for Cross-border Paperless Trade</a>.</p>
 Decentralised Identifier (DID) 
<p>DID is a framework and container for identity, but not an identity scheme. DIDs are often used in conjunction with distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain. It allows individuals, organisations, and things to be identified and connected without the need for a centralised authority, and enables privacy protecting systems.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: DID can be used to store or reference verifiable digital identities for people, organisations, and devices, enabling secure and private communication, transactions, and authentication in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>
 Global Location Number (GLN) 
<p>GLN is a proprietary 13-digit unique identifier developed by GS1. GLN allow organisations to identify physical locations, legal entities, or functions within their organisation. The identification data is supplied by the entity.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: GLN is used to manage and track the flow of goods and services in the supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors to retailers. </p>
 Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) 
<p>DUNS is a proprietary nine-digit identifier assigned and managed by privately owned Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). The DUNS number is used to identify businesses, primarily being used to provide a method for tracking and assessing the creditworthiness and financial health of organisations. Once considered the “standard” for organisation identification, as of April 2022 the DUNS ceased being used by the US federal Government.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: DUNS numbers are commonly used by businesses and governments to evaluate potential suppliers, partners, and customers. They help organisations make informed decisions about credit risk, procurement, and market research. </p>
 Bank Identifier Code (BIC) 
<p>BIC, also known as the SWIFT code, is an entity-supplied alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies financial institutions and sub-elements within the organisation. It is used for international wire transfers and messages between banks, ensuring accurate routing of transactions. </p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: BIC is crucial for cross-border transactions, such as international wire transfers, securities trades, and foreign exchange transactions. </p>
 Trader Identification Number (TIN) 
<p>Trader Identification Number (TIN) is a unique identifier assigned to Authorised Economic Operators. An Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) is a party involved in the international movement of goods that has been certified by a national Customs administration. TINs are assigned by national bodies, typically governmental, for the purposes of customs processing of import and exports. TINs are not publicly available or referenceable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>See: <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/standtoolkit22_e.htm">WCO Guidelines on Trader Identification Number</a></p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: TINs are used by importers to enhance the data quality of Customs clearance processes, improve the visibility and transparency of supply chains, and enable Customs to enhance supply chain security.</p>
 Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) 
<p>LEI is a 20-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies legal entities and group structures in a live, publicly accessible database. It was introduced by the supra-national not-for-profit Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) under the direction of the G20 and Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a single identifier to enhance transparency of “who is who” and “who owns whom”, to identify counterparties and reduce risk in transactions. Over 300 regulations require or recommend the use of LEI. LEIs are only issued by GLEIF-accredited LEI Issuers.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: LEI is used to identify parties involved in financial transactions, including banks, investment firms, and corporations. It helps regulators monitor systemic risks, reduce financial fraud, and increase transparency in financial markets. More recently the LEI has been incorporated into innovative new use cases including entity data management, digital signing, B2B Identity &amp; Access Management and others.</p>
 Conclusion – the case for the LEI 
<p>Organisation identifiers evolved for jurisdictional or vertical markets, historically leading to an over-complex and confusing choice for businesses. The LEI is designed to simplify the concept of organisation identity by providing both accessible identity reference data, and acting as a “connector” to other specific-purpose identifiers. For example, a partnership between the GLEIF and SWIFT to publish BIC-to-LEI mapping demonstrates the flexibility of the LEI to co-exist alongside legacy identifiers, to simplify otherwise costly entity data management processes. </p>
<blockquote><p>The one global identity behind every business.<br>
LEI is the linchpin that connects the dots across the universe of entity identification.<br>
Global LEI Foundation</p></blockquote>
<p>Global trade needs a standardised organisation identifier, and fortunately the LEI is well on the way to making the case to be the one.</p>

<p>Dock has just released a Credential Template Builder in <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a> that enables users to create custom credential templates to accommodate their specific needs and a variety of use cases. Before this feature was added, if users wanted to issue credentials using other than our pre-built templates such as University Degree and Proof of Employment, they would have to use the API to create a custom template (schema) and define the custom attributes they wanted a credential to have, which requires more technical knowledge. The Credential Template Builder is a no-code feature that allows anyone to choose which details they would like to add on their credential such as license number, area of concentration on a university degree, and membership type. </p><p>Nick Lambert, CEO of Dock said, “The Custom Credential Builder was added in response to the growing demand from our customers for a customizable and easy-to-use solution that accommodates a diverse range of use cases. Our team has worked tirelessly to create a solution that doesn't require technical expertise, enabling organizations of all sizes to build and issue custom credentials efficiently, cost-effectively, and for those credentials to be interpreted by any entity verifying them.”</p><p>This feature can be used to define custom attributes on documents that can be issued as <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credentials</a> for a variety of use cases, including:</p>  Identity documents  Professional licenses  Membership associations  Training certificates  Employment records   Benefits of the Credential Template Builder for Issuing and Verifying Organizations   Efficient: With a no-code credential builder, issuing organizations can create custom credentials without needing to know how to code. This makes it much easier for organizations to efficiently create and issue credentials.  Cost-effective: Using a no-code verifiable credential builder can be much more cost-effective than hiring developers to build a custom solution.   Reliable data from custom credentials: Verifying organizations such as employers or financial institutions can be assured that the data on the custom credentials is reliable, unaltered, and valid  <p>Complete Guide on the Credential Template Builder</p><p><a href="http://www.dock.io/guides/custom-credential-template-builder?ref=blog.dock.io">Click here to see the step-by-step guide</a> on how to use this feature.</p><p>About Dock</p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently and securely.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m Emilio and I’m from&nbsp;Spain.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? Do you have any pets? What are your hobbies? What is your superpower? <p>I studied electrotechnical systems, but as I like everything related to new technologies, I have trained myself in different areas, as new technologies and innovations appeared. I like many different sports including kitesurfing, surfing, and snowboarding. I also love animals and I have a dog and two cats. If I had to think of a superpower I already have, it’s my ability to have a go at everything in any field, professional or personal, no matter how challenging it might be — although, sometimes I think this is also a weakness because I don’t focus my skills on any one thing in particular.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology at its inception therefore I had the opportunity to see the birth of its MainNet almost 5 years ago. Many projects were taking their first steps then around that time, and then the initial coin offering (ICO) fever arose and many of those projects disappeared. However, thanks to the continuous work of the Ontology team, the Ontology project is still going&nbsp;strong.</p><p>I work as an administrator for the Hispanic Ontology community. I resolve concerns within the community and keep the community informed of the progress of the project. I also look for synergies with other projects in the sector, to possibly integrate with Ontology solutions. I keep up to date with all the news and developments surrounding the crypto sector, so that I can inform the Ontology community of new updates and discuss these updates with other community members. Some of my day-to-day duties include monitoring and updating social networks, translating content, and looking for opportunities to cooperate with other projects to perform AMAs or integrate ontology solutions.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Contacting other blockchain developers and finding synergies and ways to integrate Ontology’s solutions is exciting, but at the same time very complicated. With that said, it’s something I do enjoy very&nbsp;much.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In five years, I expect massive adoption of Web3. I would like to see major companies choosing to integrate Ontology’s digital identity solutions (DID) and data (DDXF) solutions to achieve that adoption. It would be great if I could play a part in&nbsp;this.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-community-administrator-emilio-bur-d07338913bea">Meet the Team: Community Administrator, Emilio Bur</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Maintaining the privacy of our personal data is crucial for our safety and the safety of our loved ones as we navigate the online world. However, the question arises: how anonymous can we be before losing our sense of “self” in the sea of faceless identities?</p>
<p>SelfKey introduces a possible solution with Customizable <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NTFs), called Normies.</p>
<p>SelfKey iD may be the best approach to managing digital identities with the data owner at the helm. And, by attaching Normies to a SelfKey iD, individuals may be able to build the outer layer of their online identity. With a wide variety of digital assets that can be combined in countless ways, Normies can be designed directly by the user, so that they will fit the user’s personal preference or needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, individuals may continue to express their personality and creativity online, while keeping the security of their valuable, private information.</p>
<p>In this article, we will thoroughly explore the possibilities SelfKey’s NFT packs offer, as well as how to obtain and mint them.</p>

 SelfKey iD and NFTs 
 A brief introduction of SelfKey iD 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative approach to online identity verification which may be a better solution than traditional KYC (know your customer) checks. It emphasizes digital security and privacy, so that individuals may safely navigate the online world.</p>
<p>One of the key <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">benefits</a> of SelfKey iD is its ease of use and affordability, which may make it more accessible to users. The overall process is streamlined and easier, removing the need for complex and time-consuming traditional KYC checks. This may not only save time for users but also reduce costs associated with the verification process.</p>
<p>Additionally, the onboarding process with SelfKey iD is quick and efficient, which may enable users to establish their online identity swiftly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, SelfKey iD eliminates the need for repeated collection and storage of personally identifiable information (PII). Existing KYC checks are reused, which may lower the risk of PII display and reduce the potential for identity theft. This may enhance the overall security and privacy of users' personal information, which is crucial in today's data-driven world.</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey iD may provide a more accessible, efficient, and secure solution for establishing online identity while enhancing user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
 SelfKey iD and NFTs 
<p>The ability to customize one's digital identity can be a powerful tool for self-expression. Individuals may be able to showcase their personality, creativity, and style in the online world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To increase user-friendliness, SelfKey introduces a unique feature that allows users to attach a distinct NFT series to their SelfKey iD profile picture. This innovative component may not only add a touch of personalization and originality to the user's digital identity but it also reflects the growing trend of NFTs in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By embracing the boundless possibilities of this new element, individuals may have the opportunity to develop a digital avatar that perfectly aligns with their unique preferences and interests.</p>
<p>This customization aspect may empower users to truly own and personalize their digital presence. Such an element may result in a sense of ownership and confidence in their virtual identity. Furthermore, it may lead to a more immersive and enjoyable user experience. Members can express themselves in a way that reflects their individuality while increasing their privacy.</p>
<p>The addition of the NFT series feature to the SelfKey iD platform is a testament to SelfKey's commitment to user-friendliness, personalization, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
 SelfKey’s Customizable NTFs 
 The Normies Project 
<p>The Normies Project aims to offer individuals an unparalleled experience in the world of digital assets. It consists of two well defined NFT collections, each with its own unique features and offerings:</p>
 
 Base NFTs 
 Wearables 
 
 What are Base NFTs? 
<p>Base NFTs are equipable avatars that can be personalized with wearables to dress up one’s Normies. With Base NFTs, all verified users&nbsp; may have the power to mint their own avatar. As there is no maximum supply, Base NFTs allow for limitless creativity and customization.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, every SelfKey iD owner will receive one free Base NFT, making it accessible to all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may express their individuality by customizing their own avatar with a wide range of wearables. Furthermore, they may use their Normies in virtual spaces, social gatherings, and gaming adventures.</p>
 How to obtain a Base NTF Avatar 
<p>Obtaining a Base NTF Avatar may be an exciting step towards personalizing your virtual identity in the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process is rather simple:</p>
 
 To begin, you'll need to go through a simple <a href="https://selfkey.org/a-guide-to-using-selfkey-id-for-digital-identity-verification/">verification process</a>. 
 Once you're verified, you'll gain access to the standard customizations available for your Base NFT Avatar. This may allow you to create a unique digital representation of yourself. 
 After customizing your Base NFT Avatar, you can mint it for free, making it officially yours in the virtual world.&nbsp; 
 With your Base NFT in hand, you have the option to further enhance your avatar by purchasing wearable packs. Community members may sell these packs, along with individual NFTs, on OpenSea and other popular NFT marketplaces. 
 
<p>These wearables and NFTs may help you express your personality, interests, and style within the metaverse. Likewise, they may add a layer of originality and individuality to your digital presence.</p>
 What are wearables? 
<p>Wearables are an exciting addition to the world of NFTs, offering users the ability to further customize and personalize their Base NFT avatars.</p>
<p>From hairstyles to shirts, hats, and beyond, wearables come in various categories, allowing users to express their individuality and style in the metaverse. By adding wearables to their Base NFTs, users can increase the rarity of their NFTs, making them even more unique.</p>
<p>Obtaining wearables is typically done through NFT packs. These packs may contain a wide selection of digital items that users can add to their avatars. The packs may also allow users to acquire new wearables to enhance their Base NFT avatars. This way, users may feel a thrilling experience of discovery.</p>
<p>With wearables, users have the power to transform their digital personas into something truly one-of-a-kind. This gives users a good opportunity to showcase their creativity and personality in the metaverse. All in all, wearables are a key tool in personalizing Base NFT avatars to make them truly original and special. Customization includes, but is not limited to: trendy hairstyles, stylish shirts, or fashionable hats. All of which may make your NFT reflect your uniqueness.</p>
 NFT Packs and How to Obtain Them 
 Purchasing NFT packs 
<p>Users have the option to purchase NFT packs, which contain a curated selection of wearables to customize their Base NFT avatars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the chosen pack, users may reveal up to 10 different wearables, from hairstyles to shirts, hats, and more. The number of packs users can buy have no limits, which may offer members endless chances to design their NFTs.</p>
<p>Users can buy NFT packs, or redeem NFT packs using SELF tokens, minted by performing tasks that benefit SelfKey DAO. This unique approach allows users to actively participate in the community. Active participants may mint tokens that can be used to obtain NFT packs and further customize their Base NFT avatars.</p>
 Alchemy 
<p>Members have the option to use their duplicate wearables for a chance to generate super rare wearables, adding an exciting element of rarity and exclusivity to the customization process. By utilizing duplicates, users can participate in a special feature that regulates the number of wearables in existence. This element may make them even more original.</p>
<p>This feature adds an element of gamification to the NFT experience, allowing users to engage in strategic decision-making to potentially unlock unique and highly coveted wearables.</p>
<p>Such an innovative approach may encourage users to actively manage their collection. Simultaneously, it contribute to the rarity and scarcity of certain wearables, making them highly desirable among collectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be an exciting way for users to participate in the evolution of their NFT ecosystem and potentially obtain one-of-a-kind, super rare wearables to further customize their Base NFT avatars.</p>
 Expansion Packs 
<p>With changing seasons, exclusive and time-limited collectible NFTs may be introduced into the packs. These limited-edition NFTs offer a unique opportunity for users to acquire rare and highly sought-after digital assets that are only available for a limited time.</p>
<p>With each new period or season, the NFT packs may be updated with a fresh batch of exclusive collectibles. This may add excitement and anticipation to the design process. These limited-edition NFTs may feature special designs, themes, or functionalities that are only available for a specific timeframe. This method may create a sense of urgency and exclusivity among collectors.</p>
<p>Users who are eager to expand their collection and obtain unique NFTs may be motivated to keep an eye out for these periodic updates and seize the opportunity to acquire these exclusive assets before they are no longer available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dynamic and ever-changing aspect of the NFT ecosystem adds a layer of excitement and rarity to the customization experience, allowing users to continually enhance and evolve their Base NFT avatars with new and exclusive collectible NFTs.</p>
 NTFs and Web3 
<p>In the future, Normies may play a significant role in Web3 games, granting access to exclusive areas within the games and providing bonuses to the play-to-earn rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These digital assets will serve as keys to unlock special traits, areas, or uses that are otherwise out of reach to regular players. By owning specific NFTs, players may gain entry to exclusive areas of the game world, revealing hidden treasures, unique challenges, or rare resources and bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This integration of NFTs in Web3 games may add a new side of ownership and utility to these digital assets. Furthermore, it may allow players to not only design their Base NFT avatars. At the same time, it may also enhance their gameplay and overall experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It creates a favorable relationship between NFT holding and in-game achievements. This may incentivize players to collect and utilize these digital assets to gain an edge in the virtual world.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>SelfKey iD may offer a diverse range of assets that can be utilized for customization, allowing us to express ourselves freely in the online world while striving to safeguard our private information from prying eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With SelfKey iD, we may confidently navigate both Web2 and Web3 spaces, knowing that our data may remain under our personal control and ownership. However, we can still make ourselves stand out and be recognized by our unique and one-of-a-kind NFTs.</p>
<p>By utilizing SelfKey iD, we may strike a balance between privacy and self-expression, creating a personalized online presence while increasing control over our sensitive information. Overall, it may be an ideal way to operate in the digital world with confidence and freedom.</p>

<p>Ethereum Shapella Hard Fork is a major milestone in the Ethereum<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain,</a> especially with its migration to proof-of-stake. This upgrade brings several benefits to the network like increased security, improved scalability and higher throughput, but the most important thing is the ability to pay ETH staking rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To become a validator on the Ethereum network, users must have at least 32ETH. Those who can’t afford that amount of Ether can join shared staking pools like Lido or Rocket Pool. In such pools, rewards are proportionally smaller but still profitable as long as users remain staked for an extended period of time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the biggest changes for validators introduced in Shapell is the ability to pay rewards for their work, which has not been possible since Merge.&nbsp;Rewards are now paid out to actual validators (instead of being split between them and end users). However, this doesn’t mean that end users won’t see any reward from their staked Ether – it simply means that their reward will come from the pool operators they stake their ETH with via smart contracts instead of directly from the Ethereum protocol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important feature of Shapella is that up to 1800 validators per day can fully unstake, which would equate to 57,600 ETH (~$113 million). This allows for a gradual release of rewards and prevents serious price drops due to drastic dumps by large investors. Additionally, in each block up to 16 validators can make withdrawals which creates even more liquidity on Ether and helps prevent bank-runs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The example below shows how ETH rewards payments are handled in Coinfirm Analytics Platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to its records, one specific address (0xcfc7E96Be27d836b034b37132052549611341108) received one reward which can be seen in its balance graph on the AML Report. It also affects the overall address balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As this is not a typical “transaction”, this transfer does not have a transaction<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/hash/"> hash </a>and was not sent from a regular ETH address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To handle this, all rewards made after Shapella, appear on Coinfirm Analytics Visualiser under the synthetic address 0x00000000000000000000000000000WITHDRAWALS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shows how Coinfirm Analytics tools keep track of all transaction movements related to Ethereum Shapella Hard Fork, no matter if it comes from or goes into this synthetic address or other ETH addresses associated with participants in the network.&nbsp;</p>

 Takeaways from the webinar — The Implementers Guide: PDG Blueprint on Credentialing Spherity &amp; Legisym co-hosted webinar key takeaways<p>The PDG Blueprint is a functional design recommendation for the pharmaceutical industry to meet DSCSA compliance. But what does it mean for my DSCSA project? That’s what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georg-j%C3%BCrgens/">Georg Jürgens</a>, Spherity, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwkessler/">David Kessler</a>, Legisym, discussed in our co-hosted webinar.</p><p>As co-chairs of the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative’s </a>Steering Committee, Georg and David explained the <a href="https://dscsagovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PDG-Blueprint-Chapter-6.pdf">PDG Blueprint chapter “Credentialing and User Authentication”</a> and demonstrated how using OCI-specified credentials can positively impact a trading partner’s DSCSA project. They also shared their practical experience and knowledge acquired over the years to solve the challenge for Trading Partners to authenticate and authorize their counterparties in DSCSA-related Product Verifications.</p><p>We’ve put together a few key takeaways from the&nbsp;webinar.</p> #1: A network of systems requires interoperability. <p>Each participant in the supply chain has the choice between a multitude of systems and solution providers. These must be able to communicate with each other to meet DSCSA requirements. We need to ensure that all the participants are interoperable with each other, from pharmacies to manufacturers to protect healthcare supply chain security. This is why PDG collaborated with various stakeholders on the ‘Foundational Blueprint for DSCSA 2023 Interoperability’ to address TI/TS data exchange, product verification and tracing, authorized trading partner authentication and other key DSCSA requirements.</p>Source: Partnership for DSCSA Governance, PDG Blueprint #2: Credentialing as a security and authentication layer in electronic interactions. <p>While GLNs are re-usable enterprise identifiers, they are publicly available and, thus, cannot sufficiently identify trading partners in electronic interactions on their own, nor do they prove “authorized” status. That’s where OCI-aligned credentialing comes into play and closes the compliance gap. Credentialing adds a layer of security without changing current standards and provides digital evidence of who the interacting trading partner is and that they have the proper license or registration to be considered an Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) as defined by&nbsp;DSCSA.</p> #3: Compliance decision: Automated or manual ATP&nbsp;checks? <p>If you opt for manual checks, you should understand that these are not compatible with VRS-based interactions. That means, the response can’t go back through the VRS process and turns into a manual process for both sides, requiring emails, phone calls, or other methods to facilitate the line of questioning: Who is the Trading Partner? Is the Trading Partner authorized? Is it really the Trading Partner who’s interacting with me at this very moment? It can turn into a very labor-intensive method. In contrast, if you have a credentialing process in place, the verification happens within far less than a minute. The decision to choose between these compliance options is up to each trading&nbsp;partner.</p>Automated ATP checks through OCI Credentialing for DSCSA Compliance.<p>If you made it this far and would like to get more guidance on OCI-specified credentials in the context of DSCSA, you might want to watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/GbrVcIb7Bcg">webinar recording</a> for more insights.</p><p>If you’re curious to see how the OCI-aligned credentialing works in action, get access to our <a href="https://www.caro.vc/register">demo&nbsp;now</a>!</p> Further reading <p>If you’re already familiar with the Open Credentialing Initiative (<a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">OCI</a>), Verification Router Services (VRS), <a href="https://dscsagovernance.org/blueprint/">PDG Blueprint</a>, <a href="https://www.spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, or <a href="https://legisym.com/">Legisym</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/how-centralized-atp-repositories-complicate-dscsa-regulated-product-verifications-dc51a8bc672e">this article </a>is valuable for you to learn more about ATP&nbsp;checks.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/spherity/takeaways-from-the-webinar-the-implementers-guide-pdg-blueprint-on-credentialing-a67b25fcbaac">Takeaways from the webinar — The Implementers Guide: PDG Blueprint on Credentialing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">Spherity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With online gambling the preferred method for gaming in today’s society, both operators and players want to feel safe as the popularity of online betting continues to increase. However, with that comes certain responsibilities from both the operator and the player. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market">With 2022’s global online gambling market valued at $63.53 billion</a>, online casinos want to guarantee that their players are practicing responsible gaming through developing information solutions that support and assist gamblers, safeguard the authenticity of gambling activities, and prevent fraudulent activities, thus giving players the assurance of using a safe online gambling site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there might come reservations from both parties that their time and efforts must be sacrificed in order to practice safe gaming, but that’s quite the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What is responsible gaming and why is it important?&nbsp; 



<p>Responsible gaming is all about prevention. Players want to enjoy themselves, but sometimes things can go too far, or individuals might take advantage of the system. Instead, responsible gaming is a concept that encompasses several policies and requirements which apply to gambling stakeholders. These policies and requirements make sure operators adhere to the highest standards of quality, while offering a safe user experience that protects people from the potential negative consequences of online gambling.</p>



<p>The creation and maintenance of a socially responsible gambling environment and the provision of tools to support gamblers with their gambling behavior lies at the core of the <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2022/02/Consumer-Protection-in-Online-Gambling-Regulation-Jan31-EGBA-Final.pdf">European Commision’s Recommendation</a> principles. Although it is up to the individual players to take advantage of the tools being offered, it is up to the Member States to ensure that appropriate tools that facilitate safer gambling practices are available. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, ”the Recommendation specifies that online gambling operators should be required to allow players to set their own financial and temporal limits, to offer time-outs, temporary breaks and long-term self-exclusion schemes, to provide gamblers with information regarding their playing and expenditure patterns, and to initiate engagement with any customers whose playing patterns give indication of the potential development of gambling problems.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it is suggested that gambling websites should display links to relevant support helplines and other details of support organizations in order to ensure responsible gambling. Furthermore, Member States are urged to&nbsp;create national self-exclusion registers that would enable players to exclude themselves from all online gambling operators licensed in that jurisdiction and to ensure that all operators have access to such registers.&nbsp;Through this encouragement, the number of Member States that offer national self-exclusion registers has actually increased over the past three years&nbsp;to a total number of 16. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus,&nbsp;gambling operators have the opportunity to give their customers all the tools they need to practice responsible gambling. However, it isn’t only through self-exclusion and monitoring gambling behavior that this will be achieved. It&nbsp;also&nbsp;entails a few more aspects on the side of the stakeholder. Here is a list that operators should be aware of and implement in order to establish responsible gaming:&nbsp;</p>



  Protecting vulnerable gamblers with responsible gaming tools and self-exclusion lists&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">Preventing underage gambling</a>&nbsp;  Incorporating safety measures to fight criminal activities&nbsp;such as i.e. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/chip-dumping/">chip dumping as part of money laundering schemes</a>  Providing an information policy&nbsp;  Having an online payment protection&nbsp;  Maintaining a secure online environment&nbsp;  Complying with ethical and responsible marketing&nbsp;  



<p>The importance is therefore driven home through the above practices. Thus, companies in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">online gambling</a> sector who implement the above measures act as role models when it comes to the importance of responsible gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Underage gambling and fraud prevention. 



<p>Not only are vulnerable gamblers protected, as well as underage gamblers, but by having a safe online gambling site it allows the operator to fight criminal activities, which put not only the company in jeopardy, but also its players. With underage gambling becoming more popular, with <a href="https://www.roulettesites.org/blog/responsible-gambling/underage-gambling.php">nearly 40% of 11-16 year-olds wagering their own money</a> in the UK, this is one of the many reasons why <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-regulations-uk/">countries such as the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">Germany place heavy restrictions</a> on online gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, in the case of criminal activities, fraud is a serious problem in many aspects of the online world, not excluding online gaming. This is particularly the case when big sports events occur and operators see an increase in user activity. <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2022/04/29/62427-digital-gambling-fraud-rate-grows-50--in-q1-industry-marks-secondhighest-increase">Just in the first quarter of 2022, the global online gambling fraud rate grew to 50%</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In consequence, safe online gambling sites are required to verify the identity of their players in order to prevent such cases, both fraud and underage gambling alike, from happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What does responsible gaming or safe gambling mean for gambling operators? 



<p>No matter the jurisdiction, responsible gaming is at the core of all regulated operators. This means that operators must ensure that their customers gamble in a safe and controlled environment by implementing practices to prevent and combat gambling addiction.</p>



<p>Thus, when looking at responsible gaming from an operator’s perspective, KYC is an important part of the matrix due to getting an overall picture of the players on their sites. Without identifying a player, monitoring that individual’s gambling behavior would not be possible. As such, KYC is crucial when it comes to responsible gaming because it helps prevent addiction, protects vulnerable players, as well as reduces fraud all by identifying players before they start gambling. In short, responsible gaming with the help of KYC is a crucial aspect of gambling operations that emphasizes the need for safe and sustainable gambling practices and will help secure a company’s reputation.</p>



 Securing players &amp; platforms. 



<p>With KYC a major part of responsible gaming, gambling operators need to secure not only their players but also their platform. Many operators face the challenge of performing the regulatory requirements correctly due to lack of knowledge or solutions. With jurisdictions having varied regulations such as those <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">across the EU</a>, it can be quite overwhelming to know <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gaming-regulation-in-europe-an-overview/">what needs to be included</a>. However, what responsible gaming comes down to is securing players and the platforms they use.</p>



<p>Thus, each market has different levels of importance for what triggers responsible gaming. Some may set more importance on Loss Limits, Deposit Limits or Time Limits with imposed monetary or time values. Some may focus on affordability of an individual player, multiple accounts, or regular changes in payment options. All of these data points tie into an overall player profile and from that an operator can assess if any interactions are required to either prevent a player from increasing their risk levels, a time-out (cool down period) is required, or changes in marketing towards a player (no bonus marketing, and more of a safe gambling marketing approach is required) or in some extreme circumstances closure of accounts.</p>



 How ID verification can assist in responsible gaming. 



<p>When it comes to online gambling and identity verification, many companies and players are turned off by the requirements. However, this need not be the case. Businesses can incorporate responsible gaming while keeping player conversions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to such success is through a user-friendly verification process that also prohibits fraud. By providing such an experience, huge sporting events such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/qatar-2022-show-red-card-betting-fraud/">FIFA World Cup</a> or any gaming event can become perfect examples and opportunities for operators to showcase what they are able to do for their players.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By giving players options on how to identify themselves, like with&nbsp;automated identity verification&nbsp;options provided by IDnow, it takes into consideration background checks that take place before the ID verification, and what browsers and devices might be used by the players to meet customer demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">through the use of NFC</a>, operators are able to quickly scan an NFC document which requires less human intervention, thus improving gross margins for the company and more convenience for the end-users. And not only that, it provides a higher level of security for the company through the reading of the chip, with more regulators accepting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This in turn uncovers a new wave of sophisticated crime that is only detected through ID verification. Because when visual security features on an ID document, like holograms and watermarks, are forged to perfection it requires verification solutions that look beyond visual security features, like with NFC.</p>



<p>In the end, ID verification is a win-win for both the gaming operators and sports fans alike by providing high levels of security for the company and a fast and convenient onboarding process for customers. In fact, <a href="https://www.transunion.co.uk/blog/2021-igaming-fraud-report">83% of operators believe smooth digital transactions have become essential to business survival</a>. Trust is consequently forged between the operator and its players.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>13th April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform and main contributor to the protocol, announced that the version 4.0 of the T-REX implementation of the ERC3643, the open source blockchain protocol for tokenizing real-world assets, underwent a thorough security audit conducted by the leading Web3 auditor, <a href="https://hacken.io/">Hacken</a>. The results of the audit yielded a flawless score of 10/10, serving as a testament to the high level of security and integrity that the protocol offers.</p>

		 
	 
                      
	 
		 
			<p>The full score from Hacken builds upon the proven track record achieved by its previous version, which has received similar approval from the reputable third-party auditor, Kaspersky. Over the years, the protocol has undergone multiple developments to enhance its capabilities and cater to the needs of the tokenization ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ERC3643 is the leading token standard for permissioned tokens. It provides a comprehensive framework for token issuers to enforce compliance and control, making it the most suitable standard for tokenization of real-world assets and financial instruments. With its proven track record of five years, it has become the de facto standard for tokenization. In fact, more than $28B of assets around the world have been tokenized using the protocol, including open-ended funds (UCITs and REITs), alternative funds, asset-backed securities, debt, real estate, equity, trade finance, with much more in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The key enabler of the compliance framework is ERC3643’s built-in decentralized identity (DID) framework, ONCHAINID. It provides a reliable way to ensure compliance by verifying the identity of token holders via verifiable credentials. As a result, this solution allows users to retain full custody of their assets, providing a high level of security and control all within a compliant environment, even on a public blockchain. Notably, the ONCHAINID standard was audited in parallel and earned as well a 10/10 security score from Hacken’s audit.</p>
<p>Hacken’s position as a top tier security auditor for blockchain protocols is indisputable. Its extensive portfolio includes conducting security audits for numerous high-profile crypto exchanges, underscoring their profound comprehension of the security necessities of blockchain-based systems. With both protocols earning 10/10 security audit scores from Hacken, users can trust that they are reliable and secure options for asset tokenization and identity verification.</p>
<p>The release of ERC3643 V4 is Tokeny’s latest contribution to the standardization of tokenization for capital markets. These upgrades are also open source. By making sure that the main token standard for tokenized securities is always up-to-date with the latest innovations, Tokeny aims to accelerate the growth of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Read the full audit report of ONCHAINID <a href="https://tokeny.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tokeny_ONCHAINID_SC-Audit_Report.pdf">here</a> and the T-REX implementation of the ERC3643 standard <a href="https://tokeny.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Tokeny_TREX-v4_SC_Audit_Report.pdf">here</a>.</p>

		 
	 
    Receiving a 10/10 security audit score for the T-REX implementation of ERC3643 from Hacken is a testament to our commitment to providing the highest standards of security and compliance. This achievement not only furthers the growth of the tokenization ecosystem, but also instills confidence in our customers and partners that we prioritize their safety and security above all else  Joachim LebrunHead of Blockchain of Tokeny       We are pleased to have worked with Tokeny on this security audit, and we are impressed with the level of maturity and security that the open source ERC3643 protocol provides. These smart contracts are designed to ensure that security tokens are issued and managed in a secure and reliable way, which is crucial for the success of any tokenization project.

<p>Munich, April 12, 2023 – IDnow, a leading European platform provider for identity proofing, has recorded an increase in transactions with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/produkte/idnow-eid/">German online ID function (eID)</a> by more than a factor of four for the year 2022. This means that eID usage at the Munich-based identity expert is growing much faster than the nationwide eID transaction figures, which increased by around 19% from 2021 to 2022, according to the <a href="https://dashboard.ozg-umsetzung.de/">OZGDB</a>. </p>



<p>When reading out sensitive eID data, IDnow can rely on its own eID authorization certificate, issued by the Federal Office of Administration (Bundesverwaltungsamt). The certificate allows IDnow, in cooperation with the Federal Printing Office (Bundesdruckerei), to read out the eID online ID card function in accordance with the Identity Card Act (Personalausweisgesetz, PAuswG) for identity verification. </p>



<p>Electronic ID card: Advantages of NFC technology</p>



<p>At IDnow, growth has been driven primarily by the more highly regulated industries such as the financial and eGovernment sectors. It is in these sectors, in particular, that the electronic ID card with its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">NFC-based (near field communication)</a> online ID function can show its strengths. Fraud prevention with this method is particularly high because the chip integrated in the ID card is extremely forgery-proof. Thanks to the high level of security, the solution is compliant with both the German Money Laundering Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/glossary/geldwaeschegesetz-gwg/">Geldwäschegesetz, GWG</a>) and the Telecommunications Act (Telekommunikationsgesetz, TKG).</p>



<p>As a sovereign-notified procedure, the eID online ID function offers the highest level of security among identification procedures. In addition, the identity check with the eID takes only a few minutes and is fully automated, i.e., it can be processed without service employees.</p>



<p>Only 8% of the population have used the eID</p>



<p>Despite the recent positive developments, the penetration rate of this identification method among the German population remains at a low level. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/digital-identity-index-2023-study-future-germany/">IDnow’s Digital Identity Index 2023</a> recently showed that even more than 10 years after its introduction, the eID function is hardly used on a broad scale. According to the YouGov survey, only 8% of the population has ever used it.</p>



<p>Private identification solutions such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">video identification procedures in a video chat</a> (38%) or on-site identification in a post office branch (40%) continue to dominate the German market.</p>



<p>One reason for this is the unfamiliarity of the eID solution – according to the Index, only 7% of the German population has any idea what the term “eID” means. The lack of use cases in everyday life, as well as the comparatively poor user-friendliness of the solution, also contribute to the fact that the method is used so little. Both a 6-digit PIN and an NFC-enabled smartphone are required. Data transmission via the NFC interface often causes users problems when reading it out.</p>



<p>“To counteract the low level of awareness of the solution, Germany needs extensive marketing and awareness campaigns by politicians and the private sector on the one hand. On the other hand, financial service providers, mobility providers, and telecommunications companies must dare to implement the solution in their onboarding processes. An increased range of use cases will automatically have a positive effect on awareness of the eID. All players, politics as well as businesses, must work closely together to make the eID a success after all,” explains Armin Bauer, co-founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow.</p>



<p>Platform approach allows integration of different identification solutions</p>



<p>In the future, IDnow expects a further increase in the number of eID users due to various political decisions such as the Online Access Act (Onlinezugangsgesetz, OZG), the introduction of the BundID in additional federal states and the flat-rate energy fee for students. The higher penetration rate of NFC-enabled smartphones and onboarding in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> planned by the EU will also have a positive impact on penetration in the future.</p>



<p>“We see ourselves very well equipped for these developments with our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">platform approach</a>. After all, there will never be one, dominant solution in identity verification, as the needs of younger, older, tech-savvy or less-savvy people differ greatly. Instead, we rely on a wide range of different identification solutions to address all citizens’ needs,” Bauer continued. “If the user has misplaced their PIN or the smartphone’s NFC interface doesn’t work, for example, they can seamlessly switch to an alternative identification solution like VideoIdent on our platform and reliably complete the onboarding process.”</p>

<p>After developing a machine learning model, you need a place to run your model and serve predictions. If your company is in the early stage of its AI journey or has budget constraints, you may struggle to find a deployment system for your model. Building ML infrastructure and integrating ML models with the larger business are major bottlenecks to AI adoption [1,2,3]. IBM Db2 can help solve these problems with its built-in ML infrastructure. Someone with the knowledge of SQL and access to a Db2 instance, where the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=learning-prerequisites-machine-in-db2">in-database ML</a> feature is enabled, can easily learn to build and use a machine learning model in the database.</p>



<p>In this post, I will show how to develop, deploy, and use a decision tree model in a Db2 database.</p>







<p>These are my major steps in this tutorial:</p>



 
 Set up Db2 tables 



 Explore ML dataset 



 Preprocess the dataset 



 Train a decision tree model 



 Generate predictions using the model 



 Evaluate the model 
 



<p>I implemented these steps in a Db2 Warehouse on-prem database. Db2 Warehouse on cloud also supports these ML features.</p>



 The machine learning use&nbsp;case 



<p>I will use a dataset of historical flights in the US. For each flight, the dataset has information such as the flight’s origin airport, departure time, flying time, and arrival time. Also, a column in the dataset indicates if each flight had arrived on time or late. Using examples from the dataset, we’ll build a classification model with decision tree algorithm. Once trained, the model can receive as input unseen flight data and predict if the flight will arrive on time or late at its destination.</p>



 1. Set up Db2&nbsp;tables 



<p>The dataset I use in this tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/IBM/db2-samples/blob/master/In_Db2_Machine_Learning/Building%20ML%20Models%20with%20Db2/Datasets/FLIGHTS_DATA_V3.csv">here</a> as a csv file.</p>



 Creating a Db2 table 



<p>I use the following SQL for creating a table for storing the dataset.</p>



 <code>db2start
connect to &lt;database_name&gt;

db2 "CREATE TABLE FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3  (
ID INTEGER NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
YEAR INTEGER ,
QUARTER INTEGER ,
MONTH INTEGER ,
DAYOFMONTH INTEGER ,                       
DAYOFWEEK INTEGER ,                       
UNIQUECARRIER VARCHAR(50 OCTETS) ,               
ORIGIN VARCHAR(50 OCTETS) ,                      
DEST VARCHAR(50 OCTETS) ,                       
CRSDEPTIME INTEGER ,                       
DEPTIME INTEGER ,                       
DEPDELAY REAL ,                       
DEPDEL15 REAL ,                       
TAXIOUT INTEGER ,                       
WHEELSOFF INTEGER ,                       
CRSARRTIME INTEGER ,                       
CRSELAPSEDTIME INTEGER ,                       
AIRTIME INTEGER ,                       
DISTANCEGROUP INTEGER ,                       
FLIGHTSTATUS VARCHAR(1) )
ORGANIZE BY ROW";</code> 



<p>After creating the table, I use the following SQL to load the data, from the csv <a href="https://github.com/IBM/db2-samples/blob/master/In_Db2_Machine_Learning/Building%20ML%20Models%20with%20Db2/Datasets/FLIGHTS_DATA_V3.csv">file</a>, into the table:</p>



 <code>db2 "IMPORT FROM 'FLIGHTS_DATA_V3.csv' OF DEL COMMITCOUNT 50000 INSERT INTO FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3"</code> 



<p>I now have the ML dataset loaded into the FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3 table in Db2. I’ll copy a subset of the records from this table to a separate table for the ML model development and evaluation, leaving the original copy of the data intact.&nbsp;</p>



 <code>SELECT count(*) FROM FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3</code> 



<p> — — — <br>1000000</p>



 Creating a separate table with sample&nbsp;records 



<p>Create a table with 10% sample rows from the above table. Use the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=functions-rand-sysfun-schema">RAND</a> function of Db2 for random sampling.</p>



 <code>CREATE TABLE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA AS (SELECT * FROM FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3 WHERE RAND() &lt; 0.1) WITH DATA</code> 



<p>Count the number of rows in the sample table.</p>



 <code>SELECT count(*) FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA</code> 



<p>— — —&nbsp;<br>99879</p>



<p>Look into the scheme definition of the table.</p>



 <code>SELECT NAME, COLTYPE, LENGTH
FROM SYSIBM.SYSCOLUMNS
WHERE TBCREATOR = 'FLIGHT' AND TBNAME = 'FLIGHTS_DATA'
ORDER BY COLNO</code> 







<p>FLIGHTSTATUS is the response or the target column. Others are feature columns.</p>



<p>Find the DISTINCT values in the target column.</p>







<p>From these values, I can see that it’s a binary classification task where each flight arrived either on time or late.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Find the frequencies of distinct values in the FLIGHTSTATUS column.</p>



 <code>SELECT FLIGHTSTATUS, count(*) AS FREQUENCY, count(*) / (SELECT count(*) FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA) AS FRACTION
FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA fdf
GROUP BY FLIGHTSTATUS</code> 







<p>From the above, I see the classes are imbalanced. Now I’ll not gain any further insights from the entire dataset, as this can leak information to the modeling phase.&nbsp;</p>



 Creating train/test partitions of the&nbsp;dataset 



<p>Before collecting deeper insights into the data, I’ll divide this dataset into train and test partitions using Db2’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-warehouse?topic=functions-idaxrandom-sample-random-sampling">RANDOM_SAMPLING</a> SP. I apply stratified sampling to preserve the ratio between two classes in the generated training data set.</p>



<p>Create a TRAIN partition.</p>



 <code>call IDAX.RANDOM_SAMPLE('intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA, fraction=0.8, outtable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN, by=FLIGHTSTATUS')</code> 







<p>Copy the remaining records to a test PARTITION.</p>



 <code>CREATE TABLE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST AS (SELECT * FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA FDF WHERE FDF.ID NOT IN(SELECT FT.ID FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN FT)) WITH DATA</code> 



 2. Explore&nbsp;data 



<p>In this step, I’ll look at both sample records and the summary statistics of the training dataset to gain insights into the dataset.</p>



<p>Look into some sample records.</p>



<p>SELECT * FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY</p>







<p>Some columns have encoded the time as numbers:</p>



<p> — CRSDEPTIME: Computer Reservation System (scheduled) Departure Time (hhmm)</p>



<p> — DepTime: Departure Time (hhmm)</p>



<p> — CRSArrTime: Computer Reservation System (scheduled) Arrival Time</p>



<p>Now, I collect summary statistics from the FLIGHTS_TRAIN using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=exploration-idaxsummary1000-summary-up-1000-columns">SUMMARY1000</a> SP to get a global view of the characteristics of the dataset.</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.SUMMARY1000('intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN, outtable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000')</code> 



<p>Here the intable has the name of the input table from which I want SUMMARY1000 SP to collect statistics. outtable is the name of the table where SUMMARY1000 will store gathered statistics for the entire dataset. Besides the outtable, SUMMARY1000 SP creates a few additional output tables — one table with statistics for each column type. Our dataset has two types of columns — numeric and nominal. So, SUMMARY1000 will generate two additional tables. These additional tables follow this naming convention: the name of the outtable + column type. In our case, the column types are NUM, representing numeric, and CHAR, representing nominal. So, the names of these two additional tables will be as follows:</p>



<p>FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000_NUM</p>



<p>FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000_CHAR</p>



<p>Having the statistics available in separate tables for specific datatypes makes it easier to view the statistics that apply to specific datatype and reduce the number of columns whose statistics are viewed together. This simplifies the analysis process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check the summary statistics of the numeric column.</p>



 <code>SELECT * FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000_NUM</code> 







<p>For the numeric columns, SUMMARY1000 gather the following statistics:</p>



 
 Missing value count 



 Non-missing value count 



 Average 



 Variance 



 Standard deviation 



 Skewness 



 Excess kurtosis 



 Minimum 



 Maximum 
 



<p>Each of these statistics can help uncover insights into the dataset. For instance, I can see that DEPDEL15 and DEPDELAY columns have 49 missing values. There are large values in these columns: AIRTIME, CRSARRTIME, CRSDEPTIME, CRSELAPSEDTIME, DEPDELAY, DEPTIME, TAXIOUT, WHEELSOFF, and YEAR. Since I will create a decision tree model, I don’t need to deal with the large value and the missing values. Db2 will deal with both issues natively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, I investigate the summary statistics of the nominal columns.</p>



 <code>select * from FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000_CHAR</code> 







<p>For nominal columns, SUMMARY1000 gathered the following statistics:</p>



 
 Number of missing values 



 Number of non-missing values 



 Number of distinct values 



 Frequency of the most frequent value 
 



 3. Preprocess data 



<p>From the above data exploration, I can see that the dataset has no missing values. These four TIME columns have large values: AIRTIME, CRSARRTIME, DEPTIME, WHEELSOFF. I’ll leave the nominal values in all columns as-is, as the decision tree implementation in Db2 can deal with them natively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Extract the hour part from the TIME columns — CRSARRTIME, DEPTIME, WHEELSOFF.</p>



<p>From looking up the description of the dataset, I see the values in the CRSARRTIME, DEPTIME, and WHEELSOFF columns are encoding of hhmm of the time values. I extract the hour part of these values to create, hopefully, better features for the learning algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scale CRSARRTIME COLUMN: divide the value with 100 gives the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN SET CRSARRTIME = CRSARRTIME / 100</code> 



<p>Scale DEPTIME COLUMN: divide the value by 100 gives the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN SET DEPTIME = DEPTIME / 100</code> 



<p>Scale WHEELSOFF COLUMN: divide the value by 100 will give the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN SET WHEELSOFF = WHEELSOFF / 100</code> 



 4. Train a decision tree&nbsp;model 



<p>Now the training dataset is ready for the decision tree algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I train a decision tree model using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=functions-idaxgrow-dectree-build-decision-tree-model">GROW_DECTREE</a> SP.&nbsp;</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.GROW_DECTREE('model=FLIGHT.flight_dectree, intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN, id=ID, target=FLIGHTSTATUS')</code> 



<p>I called this SP using the following parameters:</p>



 
 model: the name I want to give to the decision tree model — FLIGHT_DECTREE 



 intable: the name of the table where the training dataset is stored 



 id: the name of the ID column 



 target: the name of the target column 
 



<p>After completing the model training, the GROW_DECTREE SP generated several tables with metadata from the model and the training dataset. Here are some of the key tables:</p>



 
 FLIGHT_DECTREE_MODEL: this table contains metadata about the model. Examples of metadata include depth of the tree, strategy for handling missing values, and the number of leaf nodes in the tree.&nbsp; 



 FLIGHT_DECTREE_NODES: this table provides information about each node in the decision tree.&nbsp; 



 FLIGHT_DECTREE_COLUMNS: this table provides information on each input column and their role in the trained model. The information includes the importance of a column in generating a prediction from the model.&nbsp; 
 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=trees-model-table-data-formats">This</a> link has the complete list of model tables and their details.&nbsp;</p>



 5. Generate predictions from the&nbsp;model 



<p>Since the FLIGHT_DECTREE model is trained and deployed in the database, I can use it for generating predictions on the test records from the FLIGHTS_TEST table.</p>



<p>First, I preprocess the test dataset using the same preprocessing logic that I applied to the TRAINING dataset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scale CRSARRTIME COLUMN: divide the value by 100 will give the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST SET CRSARRTIME = CRSARRTIME / 100</code> 



<p>Scale DEPTIME COLUMN: divide the value by 100 will give the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST SET DEPTIME = DEPTIME / 100</code> 



<p>Scale WHEELSOFF COLUMN: divide the value by 100 will give the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST SET WHEELSOFF = WHEELSOFF / 100</code> 



 Generating predictions 



<p>I use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=functions-idaxpredict-dectree-apply-decision-tree-model">PREDICT_DECTREE</a> SP to generate predictions from the FLIGHT_DECTREE model:</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.PREDICT_DECTREE('model=FLIGHT.flight_dectree, intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST, outtable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_PRED, prob=true, outtableprob=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_PRED_DIST')</code> 



<p>Here is the list of parameters I passed when calling this SP:</p>



 
 model: the name of the decision tree model, FLIGHT_DECTREE 



 intable: name of the input table to generate predictions from 



 outtable: the name of the table that the SP will create and store predictions to 



 prob: a boolean flag indicating if we want to include in the output the probability of each prediction 



 outputtableprob: the name of the output table where the probability of each prediction will be stored&nbsp; 
 



 6. Evaluate the&nbsp;model 



<p>Using generated predictions for the test dataset, I compute a few metrics to evaluate the quality of the model’s predictions.</p>



 Creating a confusion matrix 



<p>I use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=evaluation-idaxconfusion-matrix-build-confusion-matrix">CONFUSION_MATRIX</a> SP to create a confusion matrix based on the model’s prediction on the TEST dataset.&nbsp;</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.CONFUSION_MATRIX('intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST, resulttable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_PRED, id=ID, target=FLIGHTSTATUS, matrixTable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_CMATRIX')</code> 



<p>In calling this SP, here are some of the key parameters that I passed:</p>



 
 intable: the name of the table that contains the dataset and the actual value of the target column 



 resulttable: the name of the table that contains the column with predicted values from the model 



 target: the name of the target column 



 matrixTable: The output table where the SP will store the confusion matrix 
 



<p>After the SP completes its run, we have the following output table with statistics for the confusion matrix.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FLIGHTS_TEST_CMATRIX:</p>







<p>This table has three columns. The REAL column has the actual flight status. PREDICTION column has the predicted flight status. Since flight status takes two values – 0 (on time) or 1 (delayed), we have four possible combinations between values in the REAL and the PREDICTION columns:&nbsp;</p>



 
 TRUE NEGATIVE: REAL: 0, PREDICTION: 0 — The model has accurately predicted the status of those flights that arrived on schedule. From that CNT column, we see that 11795 rows from the TEST table belong to this combination. 



 FALSE POSITIVE: REAL: 0, PREDICTION: 1 — these are the flights that actually arrived on time but the model predicted them to be delayed. 671 is the count of such flights.&nbsp; 



 FALSE NEGATIVE: REAL: 1, PREDICTION: 0 — these flights have arrived late, but the model predicted them to be on time. From the CNT table, we find their count to be 2528. 



 TRUE POSITIVE: REAL: 1, PREDICTION: 1 — the model has accurately identified these flights that were late. The count is 4981.&nbsp; 
 



<p>I use these counts to compute a few evaluation metrics for the model. For doing so, I use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=me-idaxcmatrix-stats-calculate-classification-quality-factors-from-confusion-matrix">CMATRIX_STATS</a> SP as follows:</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.CMATRIX_STATS('matrixTable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_CMATRIX')</code> 



<p>The only parameter this SP needs is the name of the table that contains the statistics generated by the CONFUSION_MATRIX SP in the previous step. CMATRIX_STATS SP generates two sets of output. The first one shows overall quality metrics of the model. The second one includes the model’s predictive performance for each class.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First output — overall model metrics include correction predictions, incorrect prediction, overall accuracy, weighted accuracy. From this output, I see that the model has an overall accuracy of 83.98% and a weighted accuracy of 80.46%.&nbsp;</p>







<p>With classification tasks, it’s usually useful to view the model’s quality factors for each individual class. The second output from the CMATRIX_STATS SP includes these class level quality metrics.&nbsp;</p>







<p>For each class, this output includes the True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), Positive Predictive Value (PPV) or Precision, and F-measure (F1 score).&nbsp;</p>



 Conclusions and key takeaways 



<p>If you want to build and deploy an ML model in a Db2 database using Db2’s built-in stored procedures, I hope you’ll find this tutorial useful. Here are the main takeaways of this tutorial:</p>



 
 Demonstrated a complete workflow of creating and using a decision tree model in a Db2 database using in-database ML Stored procedures.&nbsp; 



 For each step in the workflow, I provided concrete and functional SQL statements and stored procedures. For each code example, when applicable, I explained intuitively what it does, and its inputs and outputs.&nbsp; 



 Included references to IBM Db2’s documentation for the ML stored procedures I used in this tutorial.&nbsp; 
 



<p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise-2022/">O’Reilly’s 2022 AI Adoption survey</a>[3] underscored challenges in building technical infrastructure and skills gap as two top bottlenecks to AI adoption in the enterprise. Db2 solves the first one by supplying an end-to-end ML infrastructure in the database. It also lessens the latter, the skills gap, by providing simple SQL API for developing and using ML models in the database. In the enterprise, SQL is a more common skill than ML.</p>

Human &amp; automated moderation systems working together. Image generated by Midjourney.
<p>Moderation is a necessary feature of social spaces. It’s how bad behavior gets constrained, norms get set, and disputes get resolved. We’ve kept the Bluesky app invite-only and are finishing moderation before the last pieces of open federation because we wanted to prioritize user safety from the start.</p>
<p>Just like our approach to algorithmic choice, our approach to moderation allows for an ecosystem of third-party providers. Moderation should be a composable, customizable piece that can be layered into your experience. For custom feeds, there is a basic default (only who you follow), and then many possibilities for custom algorithms. For moderation as well, there should be a basic default, and then many custom filters available on top.</p>
<p>The basics of our approach to moderation are well-established practices. We do automated labeling, like centralized social sites, and make service-level admin decisions, like many federated networks. But the piece we’re most excited about is the open, composable labeling system we’re building that both developers and users can contribute to. Under the hood, centralized social sites use labeling to implement moderation — we think this piece can be unbundled, opened up to third-party innovation, and configured with user agency in mind. Anyone should be able to create or subscribe to moderation labels that third parties create.</p>
 An Ecosystem of Moderation Labeling 
<p>Here’s the way we’re designing an open, composable labeling system for moderation:</p>
 
 Anyone can define and apply “labels” to content or accounts (i.e. “spam”, “nsfw”). This is a separate service, so they do not have to run a PDS (personal data server) or a client app in order to do so. 
 Labels can be automatically generated (by third-party services, or by custom algorithms) or manually generated (by admins, or by users themselves) 
 Any service or person in the network can choose how these labels get used to determine the final user experience. 
 
<p>So how will we be applying this on the Bluesky app? Automated filtering is a commoditized service by now, so we will be taking advantage of this to apply a first pass to remove illegal content and label objectionable material. Then we will apply server-level filters as admins of bsky.social, with a default setting and custom controls to let you hide, warn, or show content. On top of that, we will let users subscribe to additional sets of moderation labels that can filter out more content or accounts.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the layers here. Centralized social platforms delegate all moderation to a central set of admins whose policies are set by one company. This is a bit like resolving all disputes at the level of the Supreme Court. Federated networks delegate moderation decisions to server admins. This is more like resolving disputes at a state government level, which is better because you can move to a new state if you don’t like your state's decisions — but moving is usually difficult and expensive in other networks. We’ve improved on this situation by making it easier to switch servers, and by separating moderation out into structurally independent services.</p>
<p>We’re calling the location-independent moderation infrastructure “community labeling” because you can opt-in to an online community’s moderation system that's not necessarily tied to the server you're on.</p>
 Community Labeling 
<p>Community labeling can be done by automated systems, or it can consist of humans manually labeling things. The human-generated label sets can be thought of as something similar to shared mute/block lists.</p>
<p>Here’s how we think a manual community labeling system will work:</p>
 
 Anyone can create a label set, then add admins or mods to help manage it 
 Mods can add labels that the set defines to accounts or content (“rude”, “troll”, etc.) 
 Anyone can subscribe to the set and have the labels be applied to their experience 
 
 What's Ahead 
<p>We’re landing a first pass on automated filtering in the app today, and will improve it based on user feedback. Community labeling is still in the works. We’ll be publishing more details soon.</p>
<p>Through this approach of a composable, customizable moderation system, we aim to prioritize user safety while giving people more control. An open labeling system for moderation contributed to by both developers and users will allow for innovation, transparency, and agency in this critical piece of social networking infrastructure where technical and social systems collide.</p>

     <p>It was a power packed day for Digital Trust today with 22 speakers joining us from around the world to share the latest in the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>It was a big – dare we say exciting – day for our community. We shared that after more than 10 years of growing and building the IdentityNORTH community focused on identifying how digital ID technology might be able to solve issues by rolling out socially beneficial distributed Digital ID. While we still don’t have those systems, we realized that the digital ID systems themselves were just the tip of the iceberg, we needed to be having broader conversations, talking about what would inevitably be built on top of these systems, how society would evolve, and how to ensure that safeguards and values are built into whatever we allow to be built. Most importantly, we felt it important to be bringing more perspectives to the conversations than were present before. Technology and how it affects us is evolving at an incredible pace. Conversations about harnessing tech and regulating it need to evolve too.</p>
<p>Starting this June, EXCITE will be where thousands of change-makers come together to advance the future of digital trust and ignite innovation. With a focus on Advancing Digital Trust, EXCITE events and content will focus on three key streams:</p>
 
 Advancing New Models of Trusted Service Delivery 
 Advancing Cybersecurity 
 Advancing Digital Talent &amp; Inclusion 
 
<p>EXCITE SUMMIT events will continue to bring together professionals and experts from both public and private sectors to collaborate, learn, and innovate on critical issues arising from the increasing digitization of our world: privacy, cybersecurity, inclusion, skills development, identity and access management, and data protection.</p>
<p>With the move to EXCITE, we plan to continue the beloved traditions from our community – creating discussion and networking opportunities to provide time for learning, collaboration, seeing how we can support each other’s work across industry and government here in Canada and around the world, honoring the leaders in our shared efforts, and of course providing great swag…</p>
<p>We will start new traditions to support us on this path and welcome your ideas and referrals as we are expanding to bring more individuals and organizations from different sectors into our community.</p>

   Managing multiple tiers of identity can help boost brand management, yield security gains, and uncover revenue opportunities  

<p>Does the following sound anything like your organization? A complex, layered enterprise with many different business units (BUs). Inside these BUs are different departments. Inside of some of these departments exist different brands or products that need to be discretely managed to present unique digital experiences for customers.</p>

<p>If so, you are part of a growing cadre of organizations managing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/multi-brand">multi-brand</a> experiences.</p>

<p>Traditional approaches to identity and access management (IAM) tend to break down when faced with these types of advanced multi-brand identity hierarchies. In the following paragraphs, I’ll explain why — and what you can do to prepare your organization for next-level success</p>

 Managing identity in a multi-brand environment 

    
<p>The term "multi-brand experience" fits neatly at the intersection of IAM and customer success.</p>

<p>On the IAM side, the challenge is granting the right users (internal workforce users and end-user customers) access to the right digital properties or assets needed to do their job or to complete their purchases — and in a timely manner</p>

<p>Take internal users. If too much access is given — for example, you grant users in Brand 4 access to resources in Brand 1 — you can unnecessarily and unwittingly expose part of the business to employees who do not need those resources to do their jobs. Worse, you can potentially open up a greater footprint of your business to hackers or malicious insiders.</p>

<p>On the customer success side, knowing a user is a consumer of Brand 5 leads to all sorts of interesting possibilities for going deeper on that interaction and the customer’s user experience. You can, for example, present a highly personalized shopping experience on that preferred brand or introduce a loyalty program for users of a particular brand. You can even strategically micro-target products and services that the consumer may be interested in. Or do both, why choose? The key is all about having an elegant, frictionless experience that starts with identity</p>

<p>“Customers” can also be internal workforce users requiring access to new applications and services. Being responsive to their needs in a timely fashion is critical for maintaining a productive and satisfied workforce.</p>

 Why delegated administration has failed to address the multi-brand challenge 

<p>The way organizations have traditionally attempted to handle multi-brand experiences is through the use of groups.</p>

<p>The logic goes like this: when you onboard internal users, the admin assigns them to one or more groups. For example, one user gets assigned to human resources, another to marketing, and another to finance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Groups can cover the gambit, including location, projects, specialties, geography, and more. So, one user can be a member of the “Cleveland Plant” and another employee a member of the “Manchester Office.” Almost everyone is a member of multiple groups. Various admins (through delegated administration) then manage access to the groups, either allowing or denying the members of those groups access to various resources.</p>

<p>But then things get complicated. Companies grow, reorganize, and go through all manner of&nbsp; change over time, throwing the task of managing by groups and delegated administration into chaos. Groups are suddenly left without an admin. I have talked with customers who are managing up to 30,000 groups within their organization! Of course, nobody can actually manage 30,000 groups or do it well in any kind of fashion. What you end up with is the illusion of control without having any ability to drive the business forward.</p>

<p>The B2B2C business model (that is, business-to-business-to-customer) has moved to the fore. This means that multi-brand requirements now extend to business partners or vendors — intermediaries — who have contact with the end-user customers. Being able to control access to applications and services using this model, through the partner, and right on down to the end customer is imperative, and cannot be done effectively with groups and delegated admin</p>

 Addressing the multi-brand challenge with organizational model 

<p>A better way to manage complex hierarchical identity requirements, including B2B2C, is through the use of an organizational model</p>

<p>An organizational model is first and foremost a data model. It is a structure that mirrors the actual organization itself (hence, the term “organizational model”). Rather than diving right into the typical IAM minutia of what groups, roles, and entitlements an individual user should be assigned to (all very important, by the way), an organizational model starts at the business level. By mirroring the way your business looks and operates, this model allows you to use identity more effectively and strategically to help the organization meet its business objectives.</p>

<p>An organizational model starts with a single organization, the top tier of the hierarchy. Then other organizational units (locations, brands, sub-groups, business units) can be flexibly built, assigned, and re-assigned across the organization as circumstances change. An almost infinite number of sub-organizations can be instantiated. Administrators are then assigned to each organizational unit, with the admins above having total visibility and control of other admins and members in the sub-orgs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How does an organizational model differ from delegated administration? Here are a few differences (a non-exhaustive list)</p>

  Utilization of non-technical admins – Typically, administrators need to have some IT and identity chops, or at least be part of the IT org. But with an organizational model, admins are presented with a simple portal to support access requests within their particular organization. This portal is convenient for assigning admin rights to a department owner who needs to make quick access decisions for direct reports. It also makes it possible to assign admin rights for onboarding users within a vendor, partner, or supplier. 
	 Supports full inheritance and visibility – Changes made to the top-level org, such as new access policies or authentication requirements, can automatically get pushed down to the sub-orgs without requiring admin intervention. This ensures that no group gets left behind, including B2B2C partners and vendors, when security decisions get made at the top. All access decisions are logged for visibility and assistance in passing audits and meeting compliance requirements down the road. 
	 Greater span of control – Who knows the access needs of users better than the application owner, business owner, or department head? An organizational model puts control into the hands of these users, while keeping IT in the driver’s seat. It can also speed decision-making.  
	 Better enforcement of least-privileged access&nbsp;– Rather than spraying broad access rights across the organization, members of each group are confined to just what is in their particular organizational area. In complex organizations with many BUs, this means reducing the surface area of a potential attack. 
	 Better support of a B2B2C model – In the past, extending access to partners and your partners’ customers was usually a one-off operation, with the necessary application sitting unmanaged within a department. With an organizational model, these projects are folded into the overall identity framework, meaning they are fully supported and secured within the same identity stack as the other users and applications.

<p>The past three months have been transformative for the IBM Ecosystem. Our investment in the ecosystem is deeper than ever before, and momentum is accelerating across all partner types as they continue to scale and innovate. This demonstrates their commitment to clients, deep expertise and hunger to collaborate and co-create with us. Thanks to each of our partners and the many IBMers working alongside them, we’ve accomplished some incredible things. Here are some key takeaways on just how far we’ve come together.</p>



 1. Programs for partners must be built with partners 



<p>The role of partnership is more important than ever today, especially when it comes to bringing client solutions to market faster. This is why we have accelerated the expansion of our ecosystem and taken major steps to make it easier for partners to work with IBM.&nbsp;Chief among these steps was the launch of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/">IBM </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/">Partner</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/"> Plus™</a> in January. IBM Partner Plus is the catalyst for our accelerated investment and growth in the IBM Ecosystem for 2023 and beyond.&nbsp;The program reimagines how we engage with partners by providing more access, enhanced support and benefits, and competitive incentives (whether they build, sell or service IBM technologies) across software and infrastructure. This was created for our partners, with our partners.</p>



<p>No matter a partner’s size or location, they will all experience an integrated and transparent program designed to give partners more control of their growth by deepening their technical expertise, accelerating time to market and winning with clients. For example, we are now giving our partners more expertise through skilling (providing the same training and sales enablement that IBMers have access to) at no cost to them. Gaining expertise or building solutions is core to the new program, which helps partners unlock specialized benefits and demand generation programs that offer up to a threefold increase in total investment from IBM.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Early numbers are encouraging 



<p>Part of getting “it” right for our new program was defining a focus, and our focus is our partners. To demonstrate, I want to share some highlights that have encouraged me:</p>



 
 It’s been one year since we introduced deal sharing, and since then, we have integrated partners into more than 23,000 deals valued at over USD 2.8 billion. 



 Our new skilling has created more opportunities for partners looking to grow their expertise, to the tune of almost 45,000 individuals starting their learning journey since launch. 



 We’ve also seen the addition of over 1,400 registered partners since the new program was announced. 
 



<p>These highlights are a powerful testament to the work our partners are doing to grow and create momentum for themselves and their clients.</p>



 3. This is a journey—with exciting updates along the way 



<p>This month we’re launching new parts of our program. Based on partner feedback, we’ve created a simple incentives stack across software and infrastructure that maximizes transparency and predictability. It provides a clear line of sight into how a partner’s business decisions impact the incentives they receive, including how to maximize incentives and eligibility.&nbsp;Partners can start earning in the new incentives program on day 1 of joining as an IBM partner, making it easier than ever to scale their growth. Partners can also maximize new program offerings through the new Value Seller Tool, which provides upfront discounts on infrastructure and services.</p>



<p>Partner Plus hasn’t just added to and simplified an existing partner program; it is a significant change in how we work together:</p>



 
 We’ve increased the resources supporting the IBM Ecosystem. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/qa_kate_woolley/">Last year we doubled the amount of brand-specialized resources and increased our technical resources by 35%. In January of this year, we increased resources by another 50%.</a> 



 We’ve amplified our marketing efforts by increasing the direct investments we’re making in the demand generation program campaigns and giving our partners access to our Demand Engine and our Marketing Kits. 



 The IBM Partner Portal rounds out the partner experience and is a critical tool for how we engage moving forward. Some recent updates that partners can enjoy include visibility into how they are scaling through the program tiers and access to a live dashboard that shows how much they are earning. 
 



 4. Our partners value transparency and simplicity 



<p>You’ve heard my thoughts on how the new program is coming to life, but I thought it’d be helpful to share perspectives from others in the IBM Ecosystem:</p>



<p>“IBM Partner Plus demonstrates that IBM listened to the partner experience and designed a modern program with us in mind. They are supporting partners through new avenues, such as upskilling our sales teams, increasing visibility into tier progression and earning opportunities, and providing access to new business that can help drive our growth. It’s clear that IBM is investing in its partners’ success, and I look forward to our continued work together.”</p>



<p>-Bo Gebbie, President of Evolving Solutions</p>



<p>“I believe that IBM Partner Plus, designed to help business partners to gain skills, grow faster and earn more, is a turning point in the relationship with IBM and their committed partners, like Integra … It is early still, but I believe that the new program is an important step in the IBM strategy of focusing on their ecosystem, simplifying and putting the partner as the pillar of the relationship with the customer. That’s something that partners like us were demanding from IBM.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>-Felix Gil, CEO of Grupo Integra</p>



 5. The best is yet to come 



<p>I’m really energized to share these highlights on behalf of my team. Investing in our partners’ sustained success is a priority to me, and I hope many partners will see that mirrored in IBM Partner Plus. The program is our way forward, from its interconnectivity to IBM’s company priorities, to designing it with partners in mind and partner feedback at the forefront. We are continuously updating, but I am confident that we’re on the right track and we’ve created something that will help many partners.</p>



<p>I am motivated to continue our journey and see what success we can achieve together this year. When our partners win, we win. And this is just the beginning.</p>

				  With ChatGPT 4 expanding its functionality through plugins, the emergence of AI virtual assistants capable of performing delegated tasks through text and voice input in a realistic human way is increasingly likely. In a new position paper, we look at a hypothetical “Chat Valet” booking a flight in order to illustrate why continuous verifiable identity is essential to managing the process.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The current inability to know how ChatGPT 4 formulates a specific answer to a specific question as it learns from answering questions successfully has created an outpouring of speculation as to what this all means for the future of business (the end of many jobs) to the future of humanity (the end, period).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as ChatGPT cannot give an account of its evolution in advance of evolving, we need to: anticipate how, realistically, the technology is most likely to be used in the near future, assess where problems may occur, and suggest solutions that, probably, should be adopted in advance of the problems occurring.</p>
<p>Here, the advent of plugins for ChatGPT gives us a useful prompt: If we combine the ability to “understand” text or verbal requests with a learning capacity to deliver successful responses and then add more ways to learn through plugins that <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/chatgpt-plugins-explained">expand functionality</a>, we can see how a chatbot could become a more adept <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-03/chatgpt-s-plugins-may-be-ai-s-iphone-moment-and-threat-to-google-search">virtual assistant</a> with the ability to act on its user’s behalf.</p>
<p>The following position paper explores this idea in more detail. It anticipates using a ChatGPT-like virtual assistant to book an airline flight in a fully delegated way that results in a “beautifully frictionless process.”</p>
<p>But it also imagines what “a compromised AI virtual assistant could do with access to all your accounts AND a predictive understanding of your behavior and preferences.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be able to take advantage of AI, this systemic risk needs to be addressed with some urgency; and to that end, we illustrate how open-source decentralized identity provides one way to tackle these problems. If we are to delegate tasks to an AI assistant, we need continuous, mutual verification between ourselves and the assistant. It must be able to trust that it is dealing with us as much as we must be able to trust that we, and we alone, are dealing with our assistant.</p>

  At Spruce, our core drive revolves around a world where users have full control over their identity and data in their digital interactions. What does it take to create a user-friendly "self-eject button" from applications on the internet?

<p>At Spruce, our core drive revolves around a world where users have full control over their identity and data in their digital interactions. However, this shouldn’t be at the expense of user experience in applications, or user experience around the control of said information. </p><p>To start with, let’s take a look at the web as it stands now. Current regulations governing user data protections have left us in the following state, which includes an illusion of choice - namely that one can leave, but not in any meaningful way.</p><p>For example, I can always export my data from Twitter or Google, but can I honestly do anything meaningful? I can scroll through endless machine-readable CSVs and marvel at my own witty fodder, but beyond that, there’s not much I can do with it. The goal for any system geared toward user control should be to answer the following questions:</p>  Can a user leave an app or service?  Can they have control over their information?  Can they user their information elsewhere?  <p>We believe that it all starts with a user being able to meaningfully leave a service.</p> Can I Leave an App or Service? <p><br>One of the first core tenets of user control is that, at any time, users should be able to eject from any system or application they don’t wish to use and have complete control over all of their generated data. Whether in the context of a social media platform, a banking website, or even productivity applications, the user, as the sole generator of information, should always be taken care of. </p><p>This is one of the cornerstones of the web3 movement regarding assets and identifiers. Your public key is an identifier under your control, and your on-chain activity translates across dapps.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/decentralized-identity-and-web3/">  Decentralized Identity and Web3  Decentralized identity is the continual catalyst that will unlock a new host of use-cases on top of those existing paradigms.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>Giving users control is not as easy as clicking a button to export data, as it will require various ways of representing different pieces of information that can be useful in other contexts. It will also require industry groups to coordinate and agree upon standard representations of different forms of data. Right now, the rights afforded to users mainly serve the purpose of not drawing the ire of regulators, by allowing users to export poorly formed files to let them know how they are being tracked. </p><p>Once granted control in the form of useful data exports and data custody, our goal should be to continually let users leave these existing platforms while granting the expectation that the experience will be nearly the same in a different context. </p><p>Thankfully, we’ve reached a point, especially with those working on the fediverse, web3, and more, that looks a lot like this:</p><p>Incredible steps have been taken across the space in key management, signing, and more to make this possible. We’ll always continue to commend those that came before us and those we collaborate with now on these complex problems. </p><p>However, the next step is the user experience around the control of this information.</p> Can I Have Control Over My Information?<br> <p>Now that we’ve established that the “can I leave” problem should always be answered with “yes,” the next question should be around how much control a user has over said exported information. Our goal as an organization is to never compromise on the user having the ability to take full control over their interactions but also to tip the scale in favor of user experience while we do it. Every organization philosophically aligned with this concept should be building toward this same type of outcome.</p><p><br>If a user could usefully export their data from an app or service but was limited to only using a large tech provider to continue to custody that data, then we haven’t really achieved user control and instead have just shuffled our trust assumptions. When thinking about decentralized data, it isn’t necessarily just about leaving that user at the whim of a decentralized network, but rather, giving the user control to specify where they custody their information and how they present it. </p><p>When considering this problem space, the following question should be the core litmus test of user control: can a user kick a custodian out and easily take custody of their own data? </p><p>We understand that some users will go with existing providers that they trust, but our goal is to also avoid situations where everyday users have to use complex systems to manage their own information. We want to see a world where a user can always control the governance of their data, specifying anything from a group of custodians to even the server in their basement as to where that data lives.</p><p>Additionally, as mentioned earlier, if a user were to ever self-custody their data, we want to avoid the situation where a user is forced to wrangle with a command line to get started.</p><p>And instead, have interfaces they recognize, while knowing users are storing and managing their own data:</p><p>Finally, now that we have exports that users can command, and custody users can achieve, we have to answer the final question.</p> Can I Use My Information Elsewhere?<br> <p>Finally, the last question in our for user-controlled data is, “Can a user now take this data under their control to different apps and services and use it there?” Users should be able to opt out of one service and replace it with a competitor. </p><p>This would result in a future where tech companies and services compete on user experience, rather than holding user content hostage as their primary competitive edge.</p><p>This is demonstratable in the world of social media. Content creators have built personal brand empires across social media platforms, including Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and more. These content creators are at the mercy of each independent social media platform, without a clear way to export their self-generated content, social graph, and brand relationships if one of those platforms shuts down (or becomes banned, as has recently been a concern with TikTok in the United States). This “profile hostage” situation happens across almost every service we use across the internet, but it requires a radical shift in how we collectively, across every industry, think about consumers’ relationships with companies.</p><p>This requires collaboration across public and private sectors to agree on common representations of specific data. User data could be anything from how a post is represented in the context of a user’s social graph, to even a credential linking a Twitter account to an Ethereum account. </p><p>At Spruce, we’re working on a lot of these core primitives, and want to build a world where all three questions aren’t just acknowledged, but answered.</p> <p>If you're curious about integrating Spruce's technology into your project, come chat with us in our Discord:</p><a href="https://discord.gg/spruce?ref=spruce"></a><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>

<p>We're making progress on IPVM! Learn more about our project to bring open and decentralized compute to IPFS.</p> What is IPVM? <p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, or the InterPlanetary File System, is a protocol and P2P file-sharing network that leverages content addressing for file identification and verification. <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, is Fission's effort to bring computation to IPFS using Wasm, SPKI, and object capabilities. Furthermore, IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability.</p> How Does IPVM Work? <p>Fission's Co-Founder and CTO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a>, gave an introductory presentation at IPFS Thing 2022. She explained how content-addressed data yields hashes, known as CIDs. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. This means we can compute over that data without needing a centralized server. And when combined with <a href="https://ghost.fission.codes//Wasm">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm), mobile compute even becomes possible. </p><p>And that's not all. The IPVM structure paves the way for several exciting features, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optimization">adaptive/hot spot optimization</a>, allowing us to work more efficiently. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> How Does it Differ from Other Decentralized Compute Options? <p>Unlike other VMs, consensus is not required because no two machines running IPVM have to know that the other exists, which tasks they're running, or what the results were. IPVM lets the knowledge of the result of a computation propagate just to the other machines that ask for the results directly (unlike a blockchain where everyone is entirely up to date on all of the data). </p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a></p>  Extends IPFS with computation  Runs anywhere, including the edge, locally, and in the browser  No consensus required  Its primary use case is running Wasm and enabling interoperable services  Asynchronous  <p><a href="https://fvm.filecoin.io/">FVM - Filecoin Virtual Machine</a></p>  Runs computations for Filecoin  It’s blockchain-based and runs to consensus  Its primary use case is smart contracts and bringing user programmability to Filecoin  Synchronous  <p><a href="https://fluence.dev/docs/learn/overview">Fluence</a></p>  Serverless platform and computing marketplace  It's blockchain-based  Runs in-browser  Off-chain compute with on-chain validation  It's not designed for large-scale data persistence  Its primary use is for data caching, indexing, processing, and querying  <p><a href="https://docs.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a></p>  Compute over Data using Docker containers and Wasm images as tasks  It's main use case is running compute over large datasets by sending most jobs to providers across the network  Can't run in-browser   What is IPVM's Current Status? <p>Since IPFS Thing 2022, Fission has been hard at work making IPVM a reality. In October of last year, we <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">updated the spec's README</a>. </p><p>In Q1, we focused on research and design and began to develop an MVP. Named <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/">Homestar</a>, this open-source implementation of IPVM (and an IPVM runtime) is geared toward Wasm execution in Rust and the browser. In February, we also held a three-day in-person IPVM workshop for our working group collaborators. </p><p>Entering Q2, we're working on discovery, first-class effects, and finalizing spec-level interop with several providers. We're also spreading awareness about IPVM at conferences like IPFS Thing, Causal Islands, and CoD Summit^3.</p> Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 + Causal Islands <p>Speaking of conferences, Brooklyn will present IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World as part of the Decentralized Compute and AI track at <a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing 2023</a> and Seamless Services for an Open World at <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/brooklyn-zelenka">Causal Islands</a> (Fission's first-ever conference!). </p><p>IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World with Brooklyn Zelenka</p><p>Curious about the latest from the IPVM WG? This talk presents updates from the working group: a high-level overview of IPVM, standards to date, the latest roadmap, and lessons learned so far. This includes invocation and workflow models, a (pluggable) effect system, a principled approach to partial failure, open interop, kernel functionality, private data handling, and the most common question: what IPVM is *not*!</p><p>Seamless Services for an Open World</p><p>The advent of TCP/IP and the web produced an explosion of innovation by radically lowering the barrier to entry to connect over the network. Thanks to new technical and social innovations, we now have the building blocks for the next generation of open services: location-free verifiable data and computation.</p><p>‍Verifiable computation opens the door to content-addressed function invocations, results, and workflows. This radically lowers the complexity of historical architectures (e.g. the LAMP stack), networked, and distributed systems. Not only is this easier to reason about, but it also (paradoxically) enables superlinear scaling: the more it gets used, the more efficient it becomes!</p><p>This talk presents UCAN Invocations and the Interplanetary VM (IPVM). Code in this model can run anywhere (even offline), respects data privacy, and services interoperate seamlessly out of the box without pre-negotiation. Since computation doesn't happen in a vacuum, we will also describe how the workflow planner interacts with existing services and how to lift them into this seamless paradigm.</p><p>Zeeshan Lakhani will also present on Homestar at IPFS Thing. </p><p>Foundations for Open-World Compute: Homestar, an IPVM Tale with Zeeshan Lakhani</p><p>At Fission, we've been laying down the groundwork for an IPVM implementation called Homestar, a distributed compute engine built with IPFS and IPLD at its core, along with first-class support for the Wasm (WebAssembly) Component Model and Interface Types, a vision for managed effects, and primitives for open-world replayability, capability discovery (UCAN capabilities specifically), and execution coordination. In this talk, we'll predominantly focus on the deterministic Wasm subset of the engine, particularly on why we've sided with the Wasm Component model, how we bidirectionally translate between IPLD and Wasm Interface Types at runtime and aim to achieve a legitimate write once, run anywhere ethos. We'll also dive into approaches related to the monumental challenge involving open-world interoperability, especially in the context of other distributed workflow frameworks and toward the goal of fault-oblivious computing.</p><p>Brooklyn and Zeeshan will present at <a href="https://www.codsummit.io/">CoD Summit^3</a> as well, with more details to come. </p> <p>If you are attending these conferences, we look forward to hearing your ideas and feedback on IPVM! Can't make it? Don't worry - the talks will be recorded and shared here on the blog. You can also participate in IPVMs development by joining the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM working group</a>.

 How artificial intelligence is likely to affect the online world of crime,&nbsp;and why we must act now. 



 



<p>If history has taught us anything, it is that with every innovation and development, whether technological or otherwise, there comes a new criminal endeavour to exploit suddenly created regulatory gaps and legal loopholes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT, which seemed to appear out of nowhere from the Tech Gods at the latter end of 2022, has been met with unbridled excitement, cautious trepidation, and most recently in Italy, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11925623/ChatGPT-BANNED-Italy-privacy-fears.html">outright ban</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the weeks since the launch of ChatGPT 4.0, LinkedIn was quickly awash with ways that artificial intelligence could be used to supercharge operations; taking creativity to the next level by outsourcing the grunt work of actually doing it to AI, leaving humans with the important stuff like… erm… strategy, budget, and making a perfectly crafted coffee every time (although there are tools for those too).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media users on less business-focused platforms saw things less optimistically and stopped just short of predicting the imminent End of Days. Many argued that if we rely too heavily on artificial intelligence for creating content and take our hands off the wheel for too long, then this would weaken the argument for wrestling power back. Some even questioned whether we would even be capable after ceding generational creative control.&nbsp;</p>



 The next step in AI? 



<p>Despite such emotional public reactions, huge corporations including Apple, Microsoft, Google and HubSpot have all jumped on the ‘AI bandwagon’, or at least planning to embark very soon, and have announced that they will implement AI technology into its products in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to some tech titans and academics, however, humanity itself could be at risk if AI continues to advance too rapidly without proper and adequate guardrails. This could explain why many experts, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, are calling for a six-month ‘time out’ on the AI arms race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>AI labs [are] locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.</p><a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter</a></blockquote>



<p>They argue that rather than continue to build even more powerful AI systems, all parties should pause work on development, and instead shift focus to making systems more accurate, safe, trustworthy and loyal, while ensuring problematic forms of bias are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/31/uncovering-the-different-types-of-chatgpt-bias/?sh=4b9c53a571bb">eradicated.</a> It would also, of course, allow time for policymakers and regulators to roll out governance.</p>



 What is the AI Act? 



<p>The European Commision is the first major governing body to formally attempt to regulate AI. In its proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206">Artificial Intelligence Act</a>, it warns of the need to monitor and “curtail’ AI use in social scouting, manipulation, and some uses of facial recognition (referred to as ‘high-risk’ AI). It also mentions General Purpose AI (GPAI) large language models like ChatGPT, which have applications in a wide variety of use cases. EU lawmakers have thus proposed an amendment to the Act, which would require GPAI providers to comply with the same standards and restrictions as “high risk” AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>March 2023 also saw the release of Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/Tech%20Watch%20Flash%20-%20The%20Impact%20of%20Large%20Language%20Models%20on%20Law%20Enforcement.pdf">‘ChatGPT: The impact of Large Language Models on Law Enforcement’</a> report, which detailed how artificial intelligence systems were currently being used by criminals and highlighted potential future misuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what exactly have regulators got to fear?</p>



 The corruption of innovation. 



<p>While there is clearly excitement regarding how ChatGPT can boost productivity and supercharge operations, it is only a matter of time before criminals start using AI for nefarious activities, such as fraud, impersonation and social engineering. In fact, scammers are already utilizing the powerful technology on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/phishing">phishing</a> to churn out avalanches of fake documents (invoices, financial statements, contracts, transaction records) that are often more personalized and accurate than man-made documents (which often contain grammatical and other semantical errors). GPAI models can also be used to reproduce realistic language patterns to replicate the idiosyncrasies of individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Europol, one of the other major misuses of ChatGPT, and other artificial intelligence systems, is the potential for criminals with little technical knowledge to engage in cybercrime. This is because as well as being able to draft human-like language, AI can quickly produce (and correct) code in different programming languages. With relatively little effort, bad actors can easily create malware, malicious VBA scripts, and realistic AI chatbots that can assist in priming victims for the scammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Over the last decade, AI-powered software has achieved significant progress, taking the technology to the next level and offering increasingly robust solutions in many aspects of our daily lives. However, these advancements have also created opportunities for malicious use.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research and Development at IDnow.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>With the rapid improvements in generative AI (a type of artificial intelligence that can create a wide variety of data, such as images, videos, audio, text, and 3D models), it is not inconceivable that we are only a few months away from scammers using AI to create realistic looking passports and official sophisticated documents in any language, with correct letterheads and security features, such as holograms at scale, within a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verifying which documents are authentic, and in the case of deepfake technology, which people are real, are likely to cause problems for companies without the most rigorous of Liveness checks and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">facial recognition technology</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT also poses clear concerns over data and privacy, as evidenced in March 2023, when Italian Data Protection Authority provisionally took the platform offline until it <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11925623/ChatGPT-BANNED-Italy-privacy-fears.html">“respected privacy”</a> and fixed a bug where other users’ chat history, and personal identifiable information (PII) was visible. Some major banks, including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, have also broken ranks and taken steps to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/02/24/workers-chatgpt-use-restricted-at-more-banks-including-goldman-citigroup/?sh=281cac676cf4">limit staff utilizing ChatGPT</a> and similar platforms until research can be carried out on ways of ensuring “safe and effective usage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Controlling who has access to information, and whether that information is a) accurate and b) unbiased will be a top priority. Of course, this has always been a concern when using the internet, but the danger of unsubstantiated “fake news” is likely to grow exponentially alongside the increasing volume of content. For example, according to a recent ChatGPT enquiry, Aung San Suu Kyi was sanctioned by the European Union. Companies are therefore advised to not soley rely on ChatGPT for Sanctions and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> checks.</p>



 Knowledge is power: Fighting fire with fire. 



<p>There are clearly dangers when ChatGPT is in the wrong hands. However, in the right hands, AI can also be used for good, and to battle digital fraud, and other types of financial crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasing numbers of organizations, including IDnow are utilizing artificial intelligence to help digitize their Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and help to prevent fraud. Whether your business is in the Mobility, Financial Services, Gaming, or Crypto sector, if you need to onboard customers and need verify their identity, then there are major benefits of implementing an AI-enabled identity proofing service:&nbsp;</p>



  The most important step for any organization that wishes to protect its business from monetary and reputational harm is its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC process</a>. AI can help automate much of the analysis, including the processing of customer data, personal information, and transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  AI can process huge swathes of information and verify customer identities, quickly, effectively, and securely. By automating tasks, bottlenecks in customer onboarding can be removed, allowing the company to scale at an unprecedented rate.  



  Check customers against sanctions and PEP lists (using a dedicated sanctions or PEP platform).<br>  Using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, AI can flag potential fraud in real-time. For example, AI can detect suspicious user behavior and alert the a platform’s security team, such as someone with the same identity using different gambling platform accounts to place bets at the same time.<br>  Multinational organizations can focus on servings its international audience, safe in the knowledge that they re compliant with complex and disparate regulatory requirements.<br>  By combining AI with anti-fraud technology, organizations can analyze vast volumes of data, including transactions, locations and times to identify suspicious patterns and activity.&nbsp;  



<p>The coming years will be crucial regarding the development, use and regulation of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Concerning KYC, the primary danger is identity theft and obfuscation. Specifically, generative models have enabled the creation of relatively user-friendly tools for generating more and more realistic attacks on both identity documents and biometric characteristics. This same technology is an important asset that we consider fighting efficiently against different kinds of fraud.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research and Development at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Dystopian days. Utopian bytes. 



<p>The threat posed by artificial intelligence is likely to be less Terminator, more Wall-E, so we shouldn’t necessarily be worrying about losing our clothes, boots and motorcycles, but more our creativity, autonomy and will to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clearly, there is no putting the ChatGPT genie back in the bottle now, even if we wanted to. We must learn to live with it, and learn from it, like it learns from us. Only then will we realize its [and our] true potential.<br></p>

 🇺🇸 U.S. Department of the Treasury 



<p>On April 6th, the U.S. Department of the Treasury published <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf">a report</a> on illicit finance risk assessment conducted on DeFi.</p>



<p>The report starts off by explaining key terminology and aspects of the virtual asset market such as technical elements used in DeFi, types of DeFi services and intrinsic characteristics and levels of decentralization of DeFi services.</p>



<p>It carries on by listing facets of DeFi that attract criminals to support their activities:</p>



  DeFi services that aid Money Laundering techniques:
  DEXs and Cross-Chain Bridges 



 Mixers 



 Liquidity Pools 
  



 Move funds obtained from Ransomware attacks: 



 Steal funds by exploiting:
  vulnerabilities of smart contracts 



 low-security levels used by companies and individuals 
  



 DeFi services proved to be lucrative in committing Fraud 



 Laundering proceeds from Drug Trafficking 



 Exploiting DeFi services to sustain a flow of funds destined for financing the acquisition and development of weapons of mass destruction 
 <p>DeFi services are found to be vulnerable to criminal use mainly because a link between the individual using them and the virtual asset transactional activity cannot be made. Reasons for this are:</p>



  DeFi services are not obliged entities due to their technical nature and AML/CFT regulations do not apply to them, thus users cannot be KYC’ed. 



 Direct peer-to-peer transactions are possible as there is no need for an intermediary due to the lack of a need for an account or custodial relationship. 



 Some DeFi services fall under FATF’s definition of a VASP. Jurisdictions with gaps in their AML/CFT regime are a safe heaven for such DeFi services which have no intent to abide by AML law. Topped with the cross-border and almost instantaneous nature of VA transactions some of such services are structure from the get-go as a front for money laundering or service created to assists criminals. 



 Some DeFi services are prone to fall victim of cyber-attacks due to the lack of requirements for cybersecurity and audits in the DeFi space. 
 <p>A set of Mitigating measure for the identified vulnerabilities are laid out surrounding:</p>



  Regulatory Frameworks

<p>In Australia, Binance faced a targeted review conducted by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) which resulted in its financial services license for derivatives being withdrawn on April 6th as <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-091mr-binance-australia-derivatives-afs-licence-cancelled/">related by the Authority</a>.</p>



<p>ASIC opened the investigation into Binance’s local financial services business and discovered that some retail investors were misclassified as wholesale. Oztures Trading Pty Ltd is the legal entity trading as Binance Australia Derivatives. On April 5th the Authority received a license cancel request from the entity which was accepted and will come into effect on April 14th 2023. As a result, “clients will not be able to increase derivatives positions or open new positions with Binance; Binance will require clients to close any existing derivative positions before 21 April 2023; on 21 April 2023, Binance will close any remaining open positions.”</p>

<p></p>  TBD’s pilot with Yellow Card establishes proof-of-concept to facilitate cross-border payments and fiat off-ramps to benefit the financial lives of people in the Global South  Yellow Card signs on as a launch partner for Web5 and the tbDEX liquidity network  <p>Block’s TBD, a developer platform focused on making the decentralized financial world accessible for everyone, today announced a partnership with Yellow Card to unlock a network of global fiat on- and off-ramps that bridge traditional payments rails to stablecoins and bitcoin. This partnership builds towards TBD’s vision of developing global on- and off-ramps — alongside open standards and open source technologies — with the goal of enabling the mainstream adoption of bitcoin and stablecoins in commercial and financial applications at scale. Yellow Card, which offers payments via stablecoins and bitcoin to banks and mobile money operators in 16 countries across Africa, will be one of TBD’s first partners to enable global payments and fiat off-ramps for end consumers to send U.S. dollars (USD), stablecoin, or bitcoin and receive payments in local fiat currencies.</p><p>Despite significant volume in the region, cross-border payments to and amongst countries across the continent incur fees of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/03/15/keep-remittances-flowing-to-africa/">nearly 10 percent on average</a> and can take several days to clear. TBD, in partnership with Yellow Card, has designed infrastructure that leverages the benefits of bitcoin and stablecoin to make cross-border payments and liquidity exchanges more accessible and affordable to the African diaspora, while designing for compliant cross border payments and fiat off-ramps. In a proof of concept that took place in March 2023, TBD and Yellow Card successfully tested payment rails from the United States to Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya, in real time.</p><p>In the background, TBD provides API(s) and developer services that abstract away the complexity and make it easy for app developers to embed functionality that enables these transactions to happen in real time for their end consumers. Senders are able to initiate a remittance in USD and their intended recipient is able to receive local fiat currency in real time into bank accounts or mobile money wallets, such as M-PESA and MTN. In the background, TBD converts the USD into bitcoin or stablecoin, and works with a network of partners to create liquidity between digital assets and local fiat currencies.</p><p>Alternatively, recipients may choose to forgo conversion into local currency and hold their value in bitcoin or USD stablecoins. This is particularly valuable if they live in regions impacted by local currency volatility or hyperinflation. When the holder of digital assets seeks to off-ramp into local currency (e.g., in order to pay rent or purchase food), TBD facilitates these exchanges via its fiat off-ramps. This process is accomplished in partnership with a value chain of regulated, compliant entities</p><p>TBD’s next goal is to establish decentralized identity, trust, and transaction protocols that enable a ubiquity of decentralized and trusted exchanges to happen, streamlining payments and commerce globally. These protocols - including <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects">Web5 and tbDEX</a> are currently under development, with releases scheduled over 2023 and 2024.</p><p>"We're thrilled to work with TBD and the Block team on tbDEX and their global payments initiatives,” said Chris Maurice, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Yellow Card. “The international payments space, especially in Africa, is in dire need of the innovative solutions we are building together, and this is the culmination of the vision behind Block’s initial investment in Yellow Card in 2021."
“We’re focused on advancing Block’s purpose of economic empowerment by breaking down the barriers to financial access across the Global South,” said Emily Chiu, TBD’s Co-Founder &amp; Chief Operating Officer. “For TBD, this starts with driving more affordable cross-border payments and commerce to bring us closer to a more efficient and inclusive global economy. Yellow Card’s shared passion and expertise across the African continent makes them a partner we’re excited to accomplish this with.”
For wallets, fintech applications or liquidity platforms looking to connect with TBD to participate in an ecosystem of global on- and off-ramps that bridge the worlds of digital assets and fiat, please contact <a href="mailto:partnerships@tbd.email">partnerships@tbd.email</a>.</p> <p>About TBD</p><p>As one of four businesses at Block (fka Square), TBD is focused on creating a decentralized future that returns ownership and control over your finances, data, and identity. Guided by this vision, TBD is building an open source developer platform and infrastructure that enables everyone to access and participate in the global economy.</p><p>About Yellow Card</p><p><a href="https://yellowcard.io/">Yellow Card</a> is the largest and only licensed cryptocurrency exchange on the African continent. Operating across 16 countries, Yellow Card offers exchange, easy cross-border payments powered by crypto, and an API suite for companies to on-and-off-ramp anyone on the continent into the crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p>By Jess Turner, Executive Vice President of Global Open Banking and API at Mastercard&nbsp;</p>



<p>So much has changed over the last 20 years in payments that it’s hard to imagine the way the world used to be. A world where booking a trip or shopping for everyday needs required visiting a local travel agent or a grocery store in person, using paper currency for every transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we’ve become used to an ever-expanding menu of payment choices. Different circumstances call for different types of payments — the convenience of cards for everyday purchases and extended payment terms; bill pay and account-to-account for recurring payments; installments plans for larger purchases spread over a few months. All of these options have emerged as money has become an increasingly digital or data-driven experience, and they are only expected to become more popular in the coming years. According to the results of <a href="https://www.finicity.com/blog/five-key-trends-to-consider-when-integrating-digital-payments-into-fintech-innovations/">Mastercard’s 2022 New Payment Index Report,</a> 85% of consumers made at least one digital payment in the past year and 93% expect to in the next 12 months. Consumers are also increasingly adopting alternatives such as digital wallets (35%), digital credit or debit cards (32%) and digital money transfer apps (31%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>We all saw the impacts of COVID when we needed to be socially distanced. Electronic payments played a key role in keeping life and the economy running. Now, those digital experiences are supercharging other activities. Open banking lets people and businesses safely share their financial data with forward-thinking organizations in order to access new and improved financial experiences like digital payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going forward, consumers will likely have access to even more sophisticated payment solutions. Mastercard’s 2022 Index Report also showed that:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Nearly 60% of consumers are open to connecting their bank account to other financial services to enable automatic repayments for installment plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 More than half of consumers have already used a merchant-specific currency, including loyalty points, store credit or “in-game” money.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Younger generations are more likely to explore payments in emerging spaces – 48% of Gen Z and millennials are interested in being able to purchase virtual products in the metaverse.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The financial data that’s now delivered from open banking was historically available to the consumers themselves – on a computer screen or a paper statement – but traditionally has been cumbersome and complex to use. Yet, with open banking, consumers can now take advantage of new services that make their daily lives easier and with higher levels of safety by opting to share their data with a host of financial institutions and third parties, ranging from billers, merchants, fintechs and digital platforms.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Open banking can help build an economy that works for everyone. Data is at the heart of every financial experience, from lending to money management to payments and beyond. It can also help the under-banked or those with thin or no credit files by providing easier access to financial data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world is still in the early days of open banking. As an industry, we’re connecting to additional financial data types (sometimes referred to as Open Finance) such as investments, retirement, payroll, and utilities. Financial institutions and fintechs are continuing to innovate financial experiences. In the ecosystem of payments, we’re dramatically expanding choices for consumers and businesses to pay or get paid how, where and when they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>As an industry, we’re increasing payment choice, but we’re also optimizing these experiences. Our Smart Payment Decisioning Tools integrate consumer-permissioned data in the account-to-account payment experience, providing billers with indicators of payment success likelihood. Then enhancing payment processing options based on factors like speed and confidence. We are working with our partners to modernizing account-based payments to provide the best outcome for consumers, banks and merchants. It can ensure a higher level of completed payments, supporting stronger impact for consumers and operational efficiencies for banks. Some of these data services are delivered through Finicity, a Mastercard company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As open banking-enabled financial services proliferate and their use impacts our daily lives, we as consumers and businesses will expect the same security, protections, and confidence we’ve come to expect of our other financial experiences. We will also see that our ability to control and safely share our data using bank accounts, Pay-by-Bank, blockchain, cards and digital wallets will be transformational to our money experience – making it easier to understand our financial fitness and gain the insights needed to make the best financial decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To deliver on its promise, open banking requires the most advanced principles and technology in data privacy and security — to provide an easy and effective way to verify account ownership and identity. The open banking ecosystem is rapidly expanding, ushering in the next wave of systems that scale. Players with deep expertise are injecting further trust for even greater adoption. Early results indicate that we’ve got a bright future ahead – more choice in lending and payment types, more control over our financial data and more insights to help us achieve our financial goals.&nbsp; Learn more about our Mastercard Open Banking solutions for <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">payments</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/secure-account-opening/">account opening</a>.</p>

<p>After diving into the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/the-science-behind-quantum-computers/">science of quantum computing</a> in the second episode, the Entrust Engage podcast moves toward the world of blockchain and the impact of quantum computing on it in the third episode. Providing commentary on this topic was Jon Geater, Chief Product and Technology Officer at RKVST, and Pali Surdhar, Director of Product Security at Entrust. The intersection of blockchain and quantum computing is quite fascinating, and that’s exactly what this episode explores. Here are the four key things I learned from this conversation:</p>
<p>#1: What is blockchain? </p>
<p>Before we go further into how quantum computing impacts blockchain, it’s important to have a foundational understanding of just what this technology is. As this episode explains, blockchain is ledger-based, decentralized, and built on high-integrity cryptography. It features two crucial properties: Control is spread around to a number of participants, and accountability is shared and decentralized. Built on the foundation of cryptography and fair-access principles, blockchain ensures fair access, good control, and knowledge of trustworthiness of the data.</p>
<p>#2: Is blockchain at risk from quantum computing?</p>
<p>In blockchain, the threat from quantum computing has more to do with the integrity of historic ledger records than the decryption of data. If a bad actor was able to back-date data and effectively rewrite history by leveraging quantum computing, it would break the blockchain principle of ensuring the truthfulness of data.</p>
<p>While this could be a potential vulnerability in the future, at present blockchain happens to be partially quantum-resistant already. Even if the technology were to be compromised, it could only happen at one point in time, in one place, on one computer, and in one piece of memory. And then after that, the computer must convince the other participants in the consensus that this is the correct version of history to accept. In a sense, the decentralized nature of blockchain networks has some built-in quantum resistance.</p>
<p>#3: In that case, does blockchain need to be prepared to mitigate risk?</p>
<p>There’s a significant overlap between what’s being required by regulatory bodies and the capabilities of blockchain-based architecture. Since there’s already some resistance in blockchain to quantum attacks, is there any urgency to transition to quantum-safe techniques? This can depend on the use case, but the answer is probably yes.</p>
<p>In blockchain, if the use case involves a confidentiality requirement, key exchanges are occurring, and there exists the same vulnerability as in the wider internet. Another important consideration is the data inside the blocks themselves; users need to make sure the chain references or digests can’t be faked. That’s another situation in which it is useful to have quantum-resistant algorithms deployed.</p>
<p>#4: When should blockchain prepare for the quantum threat? </p>
<p>To paraphrase our experts: Prepare now but know you’re not alone. Blockchain creates accountability for its shared infrastructure. Blockchain users would be wise to update their cryptography and transition their algorithms to <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">quantum-safe options as outlined by NIST</a>. They exist in a community; the best advice is for users to come to a consensus about protecting assets and joint histories for the road ahead.</p>
<p>To hear all about the intersection of blockchain and quantum computing, have a listen to the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/post-quantum-and-the-impact-on-blockchain/">third episode</a> of Entrust Engage.

				 <p>DIDComm — short for Decentralized Identifier Communication —&nbsp;is a new protocol for anyone or anything with a Decentralized Identifier to communicate directly with another Decentralized Identifier — and it has the capacity to change how we interact and create digital relationships</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>DIDComm is catching on. Just like when the internet was just becoming widely available and few were even aware of it — let alone knew what to fully expect — we are seeing similar potential in the way we securely communicate digitally.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identifier Communication (DIDComm), is a method for creating a direct, encrypted line of communication between the owners of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs, are a recent W3C standard, and can be thought of as global digital addresses for identity, though they are more than that. The key point is that they are decentralized — unlike the centralized identifiers we presently use in the form of emails or user accounts with logins and passwords. In these centralized forms of identity, your data is stored and managed by a third party from whom you “lease” an identity. You don’t actually own your email address. By contrast, you do own and control your DID; you can create any number of them; they are permanent for as long as you wish, and they can refer to organizations and things as well as people.</p>
<p>Because you can prove you are the controller of a DID, digital identity no longer needs centralizing authorities to prove your identity online, a process that has proven highly susceptible to hacking, impersonation and fraud. identity has been decentralized, and in this process, many of the problems around digital privacy and security disappear because you can now use a DID to share information that is held and controlled only by you.</p>
<p>The channel that does this sharing is created by DIDComm. In short, it’s a way for the owners of DIDs to communicate directly with each other.</p>
<p>New ways to digitally interact create new kinds of digital relationships</p>
<p>Here’s what makes DIDComm powerful: It allows a mobile device to function in a way that is currently impossible — as if it had a highly secure API that it could interact with in a highly available, highly efficient way. This liberates mobile devices — and their users — to interact with servers (We explain the significance of this in greater detail in “The DIDComm Economy”). Second, DIDComm is transport agnostic, meaning communication can be through a website, email, mobile push notifications, QR codes, or a text message. Third, each owner of a DID must agree to accept a connection to enable communication along that channel. This means you will always have confidence in the identity of who you are interacting with.</p>
<p>Comparing DIDComm to the internet</p>
<p>The focus of both DIDComm and the Internet is communication and relationships. The internet enabled people anywhere in the world to interact with one another without ever needing to meet or even exchange contact information. Unfortunately, no one anticipated just how successful the Internet would become as a way of networking billions of people, companies, and entities — and why, at scale, identity verification would be essential to trusted interaction online.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials were introduced to solve this problem, allowing you to store all of your personally identifiable information locally, under your control, and to share it as you see fit to prove who you are in a decentralized, frictionless way.</p>
<p>Too often when we discuss decentralized identity the focus is on these verifiable credentials, which is not unwarranted, as they are the means by which we store and share information in verifiable ways; but it is important to remember that, just like the internet, they are a means to an end, not the end. The end is a variety of rich activities that become possible once you have created a trusted digital relationship — such as messaging, video chatting, and file sharing. DIDComm is what truly enables these end-goal activities, and while messaging is where DIDComm is finding its footing, it is useful for so much more.</p>
<p>How will it impact you and when?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been several recent events to support the idea that people are taking notice of decentralization technology, and more specifically, DIDComm. Last year, <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/w3c-launches-decentralized-identifiers-as-a-web-standard">W3C launched Decentralized Identifiers as a web standard</a>, meaning that there will be more support for the solutions across the internet, and they note that some integrations are already underway. <a href="https://www.lissi.id">Lissi</a> also <a href="https://twitter.com/lissi_id/status/1639182249475313664">recently announced</a> that they are hard at work on adding a messenger feature based on DIDComm to their digital wallet. And lastly, Indicio is also proud to say that our wallet, <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, allows for secure messaging through DIDComm. As more people become aware of what this powerful technology can provide we expect to see more solutions looking to make use of DIDComm very soon.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in trying this technology for yourself you can find Holdr+ in the app store now on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.indicio.holdrplus">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/holdr/id1620628623">Apple Store</a>.</p>

<p>Encryption is a foundational tool to secure data from unauthorized disclosure and protect privacy for users and businesses.</p>
<p>What is private key cryptography? It is a form of encryption that uses a single private key for data encryption and decryption.</p>
 What Is a Private Key? 
<p>A private key is a cryptographic key used in an encryption algorithm to both encrypt and decrypt data. These keys are used in both public and private encryption:</p>
 
 In private key encryption, also known as symmetric encryption, the data is first encrypted using the private key and then decrypted using the same key. This means anyone with access to the private key can decrypt the data. 
 In a public-key system, also known as asymmetric encryption, data is encrypted with a widely-distributed public key. This data can only be decrypted with a corresponding private key that the user keeps secret. This makes it possible for anyone to send encrypted data to the owner of the private key, who can then decrypt it using their private key. 
 
<p>In both systems, the private key is kept secret and not shared with anyone else. It is used to decrypt and read encrypted messages. However, in a symmetric system, there is only a single key (the private key). In asymmetric systems, a message uses the public key to encrypt data that must then be decrypted using a private key.</p>
<p>Private key encryption is often used to encrypt data stored or transmitted between two parties. For example, when you log in to a website using a username and password, the password is often encrypted using a private key before it is transmitted to the web server.</p>
<p>While private key encryption is a simple and efficient method, it has limitations regarding secure data transmission over a network. Since the same key is used for encryption and decryption, two parties must securely exchange the key before data can be encrypted and transmitted. If an unauthorized party intercepts the key, they can easily decrypt the data.</p>
 Private vs. Public Key Encryption 
<p>As previously discussed, public and private key encryption differ on how they create and distribute keys. As such, there are several different applications of each approach.</p>
<p>Some examples of private key encryption include:</p>
 
 Block Ciphers: Block ciphers encrypt data in fixed-size blocks and typically use a single, private key. Examples of block ciphers include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Blowfish, and Triple DES. 
 Stream Ciphers: Stream ciphers encrypt data continuously and are commonly used in real-time communication, such as voice or video streaming. 
 Hash Functions: Hash functions are one-way functions that generate a fixed-size output from any input, allowing data recipients to verify the integrity of the data. Examples of hash functions include SHA-256 and MD5. 
 
<p>Some examples of public key encryption include:</p>
 
 Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA): RSA was developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman as an asymmetric encryption standard used for encrypting data as well as for digital signatures and key exchange. 
 Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): ECC is a modern asymmetric key encryption algorithm becoming increasingly popular for key exchange, digital signatures, and encryption. 
 Diffie-Hellman: Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm that is used to securely exchange keys for common applications like secure communication and virtual private networks (VPNs). 
 Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA): DSA is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm that is used for digital signatures. It is commonly used in programs like secure email and financial management. 
 
<p>Additionally, some applications use public and private key encryption combinations to secure data communications. Some of these include:</p>
 
 Pretty Good Privacy (PGP): This uses both private and public key encryption to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. It uses symmetric-key encryption to encrypt the data and asymmetric-key encryption to securely exchange the symmetric key between the sender and the recipient. 
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): SSL is a cryptographic protocol that establishes a secure and encrypted connection between a web server and a web browser. SSL provides a secure method of data transmission over the internet by ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the client and server. 
 
 What Is Private Key Management? 
<p>One of the most critical points of security failure around private key encryption (and encryption more broadly) is managing and protecting keys. If a key is compromised, then any data that uses that key is effectively open to the public.</p>
<p>This presents a problem, however, in that keys must be stored and, in some cases, transmitted so that users can decrypt information. Therefore, effective private key management is critical to maintaining the security and integrity of sensitive information.</p>
<p>Here are some best practices for private key management:</p>
 
 Secure Storage: Private keys should be stored in a secure location, such as a hardware security module (HSM), a smart card, or a secure file system. The storage should be physically and logically secure, and access should be restricted to authorized personnel only. 
 Key Rotation: Private keys should be rotated regularly to prevent any potential compromise. This can be done by generating a new key and phasing out the old one. 
 Access Control: Access to private keys should be strictly controlled, and only authorized personnel should be granted access. The access should be logged and monitored for any unauthorized activity. 
 Key Destruction: Private keys should be securely destroyed when they are no longer needed to prevent any potential compromise. This can be done by using a secure key destruction method, such as cryptographic erasure. 
 
 Generating and Finding Your SSL Key 
<p>The process of generating keys will differ depending on the application used and your proximity to key and encryption administration.</p>
<p>For example, the admin of an SSL server can generate a certificate using the software on hand. Likewise, the admin can use the URL they manage to request SSL certificates (which will generate public and private keys) from a certificate authority. These keys would be located on the server on which they are created… but aren’t available for general access.</p>
<p>Likewise, an application that uses PGP (like an email service) may create and store private keys in a local directory–again, in a location where normal users should not be able to access them.</p>
<p>The reality is that the key must remain private whenever a private key is generated. Therefore, these keys are often encrypted and protected behind strong authentication and access standards.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Private Key Encryption? 
<p>There are several benefits of private key encryption, including:</p>
 
 Performance: Private key encryption algorithms are easier to implement. Furthermore, these algorithms can encrypt and decrypt larger data blocks faster than their public counterparts. 
 Authentication: Private key encryption can be used for authentication by providing a digital signature that verifies the identity of the sender. Furthermore, different forms of authentication (passwords, etc.) can be used to authenticate a recipient before decryption. 
 Integrity: Private key encryption can ensure data integrity through message digests or one-way hashes by detecting any modifications or tampering that may have occurred during transmission.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 3rd–9th&nbsp;April <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we focus on IOSCO’s upcoming crypto regulation consultation paper, the US Treasury’s report emphasizing AML compliance for DeFi, the Indian government’s update on crypto regulations and fraud prevention, and ECB’s Elizabeth McCaul calling for strengthening MiCA provisions.</p><p>Before we move forward, let’s pledge to safeguard the ecosystem’s true ethos amid increasing calls for regulating the nascent crypto sector. This applies to both the industry stakeholders and the regulators, as only by working together can we ensure a balanced, secure, and thriving future for the world of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Let’s collaborate and make crypto a force for&nbsp;good!</p> IOSCO to Launch Crypto Regulation Consultation in Q2&nbsp;2023 <p>The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) plans to release a consultation report on regulating crypto assets in Q2 2023, with the final recommendations to be published by the end of the&nbsp;year.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/AleksandarRitt4/status/1644582437832499203?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>IOSCO’s Fintech Task Force has dedicated two major workflows to decentralized assets, covering digital assets and DeFi, focusing on investor protection.</p><p>The Commission has previously published reports on DeFi, stablecoins, and influencers, recommending national regulators acquire supervisory capacities such as regulatory channels for consumer complaints and evidence-tracking processes.</p><p>The organization also urged regulators to take a granular and holistic understanding of the DeFi market to create relevant legislation. IOSCO is an association of securities and futures regulators with a board of 35 regulators and top executives, including heads of the US CFTC, the US SEC, and the UK&nbsp;FCA.</p><p>This development will likely have significant implications for crypto users and the broader ecosystem. For instance, it can increase transparency, accountability, and investor protection, which may help mitigate risks associated with fraudulent activities, scams, and market manipulation, providing a more secure environment for investors.</p><p>However, some crypto enthusiasts fear that stringent regulations could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Compliance with new rules may also impose additional costs and administrative burdens on projects and startups, potentially leading to market consolidation, with smaller players struggling to&nbsp;compete.</p><p>Ultimately, the impact of IOSCO’s recommendations on the crypto ecosystem will depend on how national regulators implement and enforce these guidelines, with the potential to either strengthen investor confidence or inadvertently limit the industry’s potential.</p> US Treasury Department Emphasizes AML Compliance for DeFi in Risk Assessment Report <p>The US Treasury Department has released a report on the risks associated with DeFi, calling for implementing AML compliance under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). While the report does not establish new supervisory expectations, it highlights that even truly decentralized services should implement AML controls under existing BSA obligations.</p><p>The Treasury underscores that all individuals or entities providing financial services are subject to the BSA and its AML regulations.</p><p>The report calls for industry input and engagement as regulators seek to build potential industry guidance on AML for DeFi. The Treasury also suggests using emerging technology solutions, such as blockchain intelligence tools, digital identity, and zero-knowledge proofs, to support compliance with AML/CFT obligations while maximizing user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>This push for compliance may also have unintended consequences for the ecosystem.</p><p>For instance, smaller players in the DeFi space may face difficulties meeting the requirements, which could lead to consolidation and decreased innovation in the market. Moreover, the added compliance costs could deter new entrants and pressure existing projects.</p><p>With the Treasury seeking industry input and engagement, the extent of these challenges will depend on how flexible and accommodating the eventual guidance is and the effectiveness of emerging technology solutions in striking the right balance between AML/CFT obligations and user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Indian Government Provides Updates on Crypto Regulation and Fraud Prevention Efforts <p>India’s Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, addressed two sets of inquiries concerning crypto in the Lok Sabha, the country’s lower house of parliament.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/business_today/status/1503921022986514432?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The first set asked whether the government planned to legalize crypto and what impact it would have on the common people, to which the minister responded that crypto is currently unregulated. Any legislation for regulation or banning would require significant international collaboration.</p><p>Regarding crypto-related fraud, the minister said they are dealt with under existing laws against fraud and cybercrime, and he added that the Ministry of Home Affairs had launched a portal for the&nbsp;same.</p><p>Moreover, the Enforcement Directorate has been investigating cases related to crypto assets under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Foreign Exchange Management Act.</p> ECB Official Calls for Stronger Crypto Asset Safeguards <p>European Central Bank (ECB) supervisory board member Elizabeth McCaul has said that the European Union’s proposed regulations for crypto assets are insufficient and that safeguards need to be strengthened to address the risks involved.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1644325011107266561?s=20">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>The Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) bill, set to be voted on by the European Parliament later this month, is an important milestone but is not enough on its own, McCaul said in a blog&nbsp;post.</blockquote><p>She suggested that significant crypto-asset service providers should be subject to both stricter requirements and enhanced supervision and that new quantitative metrics are needed to consider the type of business.</p><p>McCaul also argued that thresholds needed to be measured at the group level rather than at the individual entity level to address the complexity of operations.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">The FATF Travel Rule: Implications for Privacy and Data Protection</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-block-perspective-march-2023">The Block Perspective: European Crypto Regulatory Climate and its Impact on Crypto Ecosystem — March&nbsp;2023</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Join us for Fission's first-ever conference! We're exploring the future of computing with experts in AI, programming language theory, computational media arts, and more.</p> Causal Islands: The Origin Story <p>Fission co-founders Boris and Brooklyn have been working together for quite a while on computing, distributed systems, and encryption in an effort to create developer tools that make building applications more accessible.</p><p>After attending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6fvZA0L-ok&amp;list=PLFkGFMxuCsI2hwxF0TjUVGq-iLmn3MkIb">BlueYard's EthCC side event</a> in 2022, they were inspired by the speakers and attendees who brought their diverse research interests and areas of expertise into the conversation. They realized that being able to connect with folks outside of their regular circle was invaluable, and decided that they wanted to hold a conference of their own. One where everyone could learn from each other and share their knowledge while working on the future of computing. </p><p>The name "Causal Islands" comes from physics. It refers to how information traveling at the speed of light hits a physical limit. In our distributed systems, we experience this physical limit as latency - a function of our proximity to data centers and the quality of our connectivity. Brooklyn has used this concept in several of her talks to highlight how edge compute plays a part in reducing latency.</p><p>As we thought about it, it seemed like a good metaphor: we can think of us as all existing on our own islands of information: building our tech stacks and pursuing research into different areas of the future of computing, each in our own direction.</p><p>The Causal Islands conference is designed to bring together and engage everyone interested in the future of computing, both to share what they're working on, and to learn and be inspired by cross-disciplinary approaches on other islands of focus.</p><p>Now that you know the origin and purpose of the conference, let's jump into some frequently asked questions!</p> Who is behind Causal Islands? <p><a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a> created Causal Islands with the generous support of <a href="https://www.blueyard.com/">BlueYard Capital</a> and <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>.

They also make really great flavoured sparkling water if you'd prefer!)</p><p>Brooklyn Zelenka, CTO and co-founder of Fission, Zeeshan Lakhani, staff research engineer at Fission and co-founder of Papers We Love Conference, and Chad Fowler, partner and CTO at BlueYard Capital, formed the programming committee that brought together our amazing set of speakers.</p><p>You can watch a recent AMA live stream with the programming committee below:</p> Where will this conference take place? <p>This is a three-day, single-track conference taking place in person April 25-27, 2023 at the <a href="https://paradiseonbloor.com/">Paradise Theatre</a> in Toronto, Canada, as well as virtually.</p><p>There is also an <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/program/party">evening social</a> at Lula Lounge for any of the Toronto tech community who can't make it to the conference, but would love to network and see some cool art + tech performances!

<p>Our founders attended the inaugural <a href="https://www.apacdigitalid.org/">APAC Digital Identity unConference</a> that took place in Bangkok, Thailand. It was an exciting one as expected that aimed to promote innovation and collaboration among new digital identity businesses and initiatives in the APAC region. Open Space <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unConferences</a> is a participatory event where attendees co-create the agenda together live each day of the event. The focus is on discussing the subject with professional colleagues from a variety of identification sectors, there are no keynotes or&nbsp;panels.</p><blockquote>Secure and interoperable identity is necessary for engaging with people to benefit on the problems in today’s world such as tracking trade, supporting labour markets, and crossing borders for a variety of reasons. Significant investments have been made into the development of interoperable standards, protocols, systems application layers, conceptual use cases, and more.<br>APAC Digital unConference is one such newly initiated forum where people from the region have a platform come together, brainstorm on such problems to find solutions to with the emerging trends &amp; technologies and most importantly, to collaborate — eventually, get benefitted.</blockquote> People behind the idea — unConference - <p>The people behind the idea of the APAC Digital Identity unConference are passionate professionals who believe in the importance of digital identity and its impact on society. The Internet Identity Workshop (<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a>) had a major inspiration for the APAC Digital Identity Conference. The APAC event was organised and hosted by the two IIW facilitators and producers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young (Identity Woman)</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-nobantu-saul-0291941/">Heidi Nobantu Saul</a>, in partnership with a nearby business, Newlogic. IIW is being facilitated &amp; organised since year 2005 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Phil Windley</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/docsearls/">Doc Searls</a> besides these two veterans.</p><p>The opportunity was to conduct an event for the APAC region in the same Open Space unConference style as the Internet Identity Workshop.</p> The new way of ‘Being Involved’! - <p>The new way of being involved is what makes the unConference unique. Unlike traditional conferences where attendees sit through pre-planned sessions, the unConference is a participant-driven event that empowers the attendees to take ownership of the agenda. It is a platform to share knowledge, ideas, and best practices in an open manner. All the sessions were led by experts in the field and moderated by volunteers from the community. The unConference is an event where the participants have the freedom to create their own agenda and ask questions, connect with others, and contribute to the conversation.</p> Glimpses of the topics covered&nbsp;- <p>The sessions were highly interactive, and participants had the opportunity to exchange answers to questions and get feedback.</p><p>Glimpses of the topics covered at the UnConference:</p><p>Day 1, Thursday, March 02,&nbsp;2023:</p>  Standards for Distributed ID for&nbsp;Asia  Sri Lanka Digital&nbsp;ID  Open Discussion: Navigating, Recognition Across&nbsp;Borders  What Constitutes Indigenous ID in SSI Approaches  Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF) Ecosystem  Pictures as Identifiers  How Cloud Wallet could act as a bridge in the SSI&nbsp;space  DCDR — Data-Centric Digital&nbsp;Rights  Singpass — Singapore’s National Digital&nbsp;ID  “Not QR” Codes + Civil Registration + Vital Statistics  <p>Day 2, Friday, March 03,&nbsp;2023:</p>  (ToIP) Digital Trust Ecosystems  Identity &amp; Domain&nbsp;Names  Whiteboard Session: Elements That Make APAC Trust Framework  Building Open Source Communities + New&nbsp;Ideas  Verifiable Identity: Social Media — “The Bali Process”&nbsp;Context  Blue Economy and Regional paperless trade  NFTs as an Identifier — Pro’s Con’s Is it worth&nbsp;it?  Verifiable Credentials — Exchange Protocol and Wallet Interaction   Key Takeaways - <p>There have been several key takeaways from the unConference. However, some of the key ones include&nbsp;-</p><p>1. There was a unanimous vote to have APAC level collaboration to draft a APAC Digital ID Trust Framework. This group can have the participants of the working group shared diverse operating realities, their learnings and interests in building a coherent method to trust each other’s <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital identity systems</a>. As a key conclusion on this, it was agreed to house meetings for this group under one of the Trust Over IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TOIP</a>) working&nbsp;groups.</p><p>2. It was encouraging to see that a few countries in the APAC have already embarked on the journey of building Digital Identities infrastructure for the nationwide benefit of its citizens. Couple of the examples were&nbsp;-</p>  Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of <a href="https://www.dhi.bt/">Druk Holding and Investments Limited</a> (DHI) — Bhutan’s investment arm, updated about Bhutan just launched a new national digital ID system (NDI). Bhutan NDI is Bhutan’s new National Identity System, developed by Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) for GovTech Bhutan. The NDI will have citizens eight years old and above enrolled into it. Apart from the ID card, the NDI wallet will carry other information including health, tax filings, education and census records as well as revenue and bank statements, and business documents.  Singapore (they are implementing <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main/">SingPass</a>). The representatives from the Singapore government who attended the unConference stated that with SingPass, the citizens can access over 2,500+ services by over 800+ government agencies and businesses at their fingertips  Sri Lanka government also leveraged an India based open source platform, MOSIP, to implement Digital identity management for its citizens.  <p>3. Decentralised Identity Foundation (<a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>) and Trust Over IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TOIP</a>) are the forums where most of the innovation is happening — innovation in terms of tech stack&nbsp;, frameworks, libraries and standards for Decentralised Identity, Trust Frameworks, Governance Frameworks, Trust Ecosystems, et. al. It was an opportunity for the first time attendees of such Digital Identity unConference to get first hand update about these two&nbsp;forums.</p><p>4. We urged the facilitators that the next APAC event should be hosted in India. Considering the vast diversified demography spawning across technology enthusiasts to unicorns to startups to government representatives to people from all walks of life, there will potentially be a huge attendance for the&nbsp;event</p> Benefit to participate in future&nbsp;- <p>Everyone should participate in the UnConference, especially those who are interested in digital identity, including individuals, practitioners, researchers, regulators, implementers, government leaders, technologists, digital and privacy rights activists. The UnConference is an excellent opportunity where individuals representing various standards, initiatives, and businesses can congregate, exchange knowledge, form relationships, and advance the&nbsp;cause</p> Proud Sponsors&nbsp;- <p>AyanWorks was honoured to be one of the sponsors of the inaugural APAC Digital Identity unConference. Companies that sponsored the event besides <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a> included <a href="https://gluu.org/">gluu</a>, <a href="https://newlogic.com/">Newlogic</a> and <a href="https://opendevelopmentmekong.net/">Open Development Initiative</a>.

</p><p>Blockchain technology offers huge benefits – decentralization, transparent interaction, high levels of security, and immutable record keeping. It has enabled a thriving crypto ecosystem to grow and support continuous technological innovation. However, one of the main problems with many blockchain networks is their scalability. Scaling is an issue when the amount of data passing through the blockchain hits a limit due to the insufficient capacities of the blockchain.</p>



<p>In an ideal case, a blockchain would be able to process countless transactions per second, also known as throughput or with the acronym TPS. However, the Bitcoin main chain can only handle about 3-7 TPS. By comparison, Visa can process more than 20,000 TPS using the VisaNet centralized electronic payment network. The difference is in the level of decentralization and privacy that Bitcoin and other blockchains aim to provide.</p>



<p>Similarly, Ethereum is coming to a point where it faces scalability challenges. As of summer 2022, Ethereum is processing an estimated 500,000 transactions per day, which equates to 30 transactions per second. By comparison, Visa's payment system can process up to 150 million transactions per day and 65,000 transactions per second. This far exceeds the processing power of Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0 is expecting it to increase to 20,000-100,000 transactions per second however it will take few years to reach that maximum capacity.</p>



 What Are Layer-2 Scaling Solutions? 



<p>Layer 2 refers to secondary frameworks or protocols that build on top of existing blockchain systems. The main purpose of these protocols is to solve the transaction speed and scaling problems faced by major cryptocurrency networks. It not only reduces workload on main net, but maintains the same security and decentralization standards as the underlying blockchain.</p>



 Layer-1 v/s Layer-2 Blockchains 



<p>Layer 1 blockchain refers to the underlying blockchain network architecture and protocols that serve as the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based use cases. It is the core layer of a blockchain system and consists of the basic building blocks that enable data storage, transaction processing, and consensus mechanisms.</p>



<p>Layer 2 blockchain solutions are technologies that build on top of existing layer 1 blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, to increase their scalability and efficiency. Layer 2 solutions allow for off-chain processing of transactions, which helps reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored on the main blockchain, thereby increasing its scalability.</p>



<p>One of the key differences between layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain technology is scalability. Layer 1 blockchain networks have limited transaction processing capacity, which can result in slow processing times and high fees during periods of high demand. Layer 2 solutions address this issue by reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on the main blockchain, thereby increasing its capacity.</p>



 Advantages of layer 2 blockchain solutions 



<p>Layer 2 blockchain solutions offer several advantages, including:</p>



 
 Scalability: Layer 2 solutions can help increase the transaction processing capacity of existing blockchain networks, making them more scalable and able to handle higher volumes of transactions. By offloading transactions from the main blockchain, layer 2 solutions can reduce congestion and increase throughput. 
 



 
 Speed: By processing transactions off-chain, layer 2 solutions can significantly reduce transaction processing times, resulting in faster and more efficient transactions. 



 Lower fees: Layer 2 solutions can help reduce the fees associated with blockchain transactions by reducing the workload on the main blockchain and reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on it. 



 Improved privacy: Layer 2 solutions can enable privacy-preserving transactions by using techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and state channels to keep transaction data off the main blockchain. 



 Interoperability: Layer 2 solutions can enable interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing for the seamless movement of assets and data between them. 



 Flexibility: Layer 2 solutions can be tailored to specific use cases and can be designed to work with a variety of blockchain networks, making them a flexible and versatile solution. 
 



<p>Overall, layer 2 blockchain solutions offer several advantages over traditional layer 1 blockchain networks, including improved scalability, speed, privacy, and interoperability, making them an essential component of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



 What Types of Layer-2 Solutions Out There? 



<p>There are several types of Layer 2 scaling solutions, each with its own approach to increasing the scalability of blockchain networks. Here are some of the most common types of Layer 2 solutions:</p>



 
 State Channels 



 Plasma 



 Rollups 
 



 State channels blockchain solution 



<p>State channels are a layer 2 blockchain solution that allows for off-chain transactions between two parties. State channels enable fast and cheap transactions by keeping most of the transaction data off the main blockchain.</p>



<p>Projects - Lightning Network, Celer Network, Trinity</p>



<p>Here's how state channels work:</p>



 
 Two parties create a contract that defines the rules of their transaction. 



 They deposit their cryptocurrency into a shared channel, which is a smart contract on the blockchain. 



 They then conduct their transactions off-chain, using the rules defined in the contract. 



 Once they are finished, they close the channel and settle their balances on the main blockchain. 
 



<p>State channels are useful for microtransactions, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main blockchain would be prohibitive. They can also be used for real-time, interactive transactions, such as online gaming or instant messaging.</p>



 Plasma layer 2 solution 



<p>Plasma is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon in 2017. The goal of Plasma is to enable the Ethereum network to process a large number of transactions, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plasma chain projects- Polygon, Loom Network</p>



<p>Here's how Plasma works:</p>



 
 A smart contract is created on the Ethereum network that serves as the root chain. 



 Child chains, also known as Plasma chains, are created off of the root chain. These Plasma chains are fully functional blockchains with their own validators, but they are connected to the Ethereum network. 



 Transactions on the Plasma chains are processed off-chain, and are only submitted to the Ethereum network when a block is finalized. 



 The finality of blocks on the Plasma chains is enforced by the root chain, which acts as a final arbiter for any disputes that arise. 
 



<p>Plasma is useful for applications that require high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms. It can also be used for micropayments, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main Ethereum network would be prohibitive.</p>



 Rollups 



<p>Blockchain rollups are a type of Layer 2 scaling solution that aim to improve the scalability of blockchain networks by grouping multiple transactions together before submitting them to the main blockchain for verification. There are two types of rollups: optimistic rollups, which assume that most transactions are valid and only require minimal verification, and ZK-rollups, which use zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions off-chain before submitting them to the main chain.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Optimistic Rollups 
 



<p>Optimistic Rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution for blockchain networks that offer several advantages over traditional on-chain transactions. Here's how they work:</p>



 
 Transactions are processed off-chain and bundled into batches. 



 The batches are then validated by a small group of validators who check for fraudulent or invalid transactions. 



 Once the batch is confirmed, it is sent to the main blockchain and added to the ledger. 
 



<p>Optimistic Rollups are useful for applications that require high transaction throughput, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms. They are also ideal for micropayments, where the transaction cost on the main blockchain would be prohibitively expensive.</p>



<p>Optimism and Arbitrum are popular optimistic rollup projects</p>



 
 Zero-Knowledge Rollups 
 



<p>Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups) are a layer 2 blockchain solution that enables fast and efficient transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain network.</p>



<p>Projects- Minaprotocol, immutableX, loopring, ZK Sync</p>



<p>Here's how ZK Rollups work:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Transactions are processed off-chain and bundled into batches. 



 The batches are then verified using zero-knowledge proofs, which enable the network to verify the transactions without revealing any of the transaction data. 



 The verified batches are then submitted to the main blockchain, where they are added to the ledger. 
 



<p>&nbsp;ZK Rollups are useful for applications that require high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms. They can also be used for micropayments, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main blockchain would be prohibitive.</p>



<p>To sum up, the implementation of layer 2 scaling solutions is paramount in overcoming the scalability and usability limitations of blockchain technology. These solutions allow for increased transaction throughput, decreased fees, and enhanced functionality, all while maintaining the security and decentralized nature of blockchains. As more projects adopt layer 2 technologies, we can anticipate remarkable progress in the blockchain industry, along with the emergence of fresh use cases for decentralized applications.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our upcoming articles, where we will dive deeper into various layer 2 projects and provide detailed insights into their technical details, advantages, limitations, and potential use cases.&nbsp; Whether you are a blockchain enthusiast, developer, or investor, our articles will provide valuable insights into the latest developments in blockchain scaling solutions. </p>

<p>Cyberattacks continue to increase at an alarming rate, and many security breaches can be traced back to an authentication issue. Whether a password or a password plus an additional authentication factor, attackers are adept at bypassing them at scale. For example, over 100 million multi-factor authentication (MFA) attacks <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/Ways-to-overcome-multifactor-authentication-vulnerabilities">were recorded in Q1 2022</a>, whereas such attacks were virtually non-existent in 2019.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Just this month, law enforcement agencies in Europe and the U.S. announced the seizure of a major online <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation">marketplace that offered over 80 million stolen login credentials</a>, giving cybercriminals access to accounts in the financial sector, critical infrastructure, and government agencies, among others. This hasn’t put them out of business, however, as the group’s admins announced the marketplace would soon be available <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-seizes-stolen-credentials-market-genesis-in-operation-cookie-monster/">through other channels</a>.</p> 
<p>The pressure on security teams is showing no signs of abating, and against that backdrop, we compiled our <a href="https://get.hypr.com/2023-passwordless-security-report">State of Passwordless Security report</a> for a third consecutive year. For this report, we asked 1,000 IT/IS security decision-makers from around the world about the state of cybersecurity in their organization and where passwordless security currently fits into their defense strategy.&nbsp;</p> 
 Authentication Is Still Highly Vulnerable  
<p>As has been the case in our <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-state-of-passwordless-security-in-2022ss-security">previous two reports</a>, authentication remains the greatest weakness in enterprise cybersecurity. Of the professionals we interviewed, 60% said their organizations had suffered breaches through authentication-based attacks across the last 12 months. These breaches can then be used as launchpads for further attacks, such as ransomware or data theft.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ability of attackers to automate phishing processes, including buying easy-to-deploy kits on the dark web, make any authentication process featuring passwords and other shared secrets high-risk. This ease of access means that even low-skilled attackers can launch successful assaults on major corporations. However, despite these clear and obvious risks, most organizations don’t make any changes to their authentication processes after a successful attack. Even worse, a majority still deploy passwords in some form, with 57% using the most basic username and password combos for some systems.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Since credential theft is still the easiest and most successful method for attackers, major industry groups and the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">federal government</a> have advised organizations to deploy phishing-resistant, passwordless methods.&nbsp;</p> 
 Global Cyber Defenses: New Avenues of Attack  
<p>Virtually every organization has suffered some form of cyberattack over the last year. The main vectors for these attacks are common threats such as phishing and ransomware, but one, in particular, has shown noticeable growth. Nearly 30% of organizations were hit by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notification attacks</a>, which have more than doubled their prevalence since the 2022 report (12%).&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This increase relates to how organizations have tried to counter their greatest cybersecurity weakness (passwords) with multi-factor authentication. MFA requires a user to authenticate themselves using two or more factors based on knowledge (i.e., password or PIN), possession (i.e., device or hardware security key) or inherence (i.e., fingerprints or face scans).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the general acknowledgement that passwords are easily phished or cracked, MFA in the form of a password plus an additional factor, has been widely considered a possible solution. However, as our report shows, this has not proven to be an effective security measure. For example, attackers can bypass push notification MFA by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">spamming users with push requests</a>, aka MFA prompt bombing, hoping the user will accept.&nbsp;</p> 
 Passwordless Security: A Multi-Problem Solution  
<p>The most tangible consequences of authentication-originated breaches are monetary, costing organizations an average of $2.95 million annually. This doesn’t factor in the longer-term financial impacts of losing business to rivals and reputational damage.</p> 
<p><a href="https://get.hypr.com/2023-passwordless-security-report"></a></p> 
<p>The problems with passwords, however, extend beyond their serious security implications. From a user-experience perspective, passwords are the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-for-low-friction-authentication">root cause of significant frustration</a>. Our report reveals that 81% of respondents experienced occasions where they could not access critical information because they’d forgotten a password. Along with the time spent logging in with passwords, password resets and account lockouts significantly impact employee productivity and, consequently, their bottom line.</p> 
<p>The costs are also very real at the IT support desk. Our report uncovered some thought-provoking insights into how much upholding password-based authentication costs organizations yearly. Enterprises spend 32% of their IT helpdesk budget on password-related issues, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-much-does-a-password-reset-cost">such as resets</a>. This equates to $465,645 annually, or $375 per employee per year, wasted on password issues.</p> 
<p>While passwordless security has its own implementation costs, it is generally far cheaper than maintaining password-based systems.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Short-Term Future of Passwordless Security  
<p>Despite the clear and obvious problems using passwords causes on an annual basis, many organizations have yet to adopt full passwordless security. Even though the security leaders interviewed were almost unanimous in their belief in passwordless security benefits, organizations still face significant obstacles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These obstacles range from fears around integration with their current technology stack to lacking the internal knowledge to implement a new system, to general misunderstandings of what exactly constitutes phishing-resistant, passwordless MFA. Only 3% of organizations that state they use passwordless solutions are using phishing-resistant, passwordless methods. This means that 97%&nbsp;of the “passwordless” solutions deployed are susceptible to phishing and push attacks.</p> 
<p>Our State of Passwordless Security Report 2023 gives an in-depth insight into exactly how much authentication weaknesses are costing organizations every year. We also look at the global state of passwordless security and how organizations respond to the biggest threats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As soon as the Biden administration released its new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a>&nbsp;on March 1, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/about">Hyperledger Foundation</a>&nbsp;responded with this truth bomb:&nbsp;Open source&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity technology</a>&nbsp;will not only achieve the strategy’s goals, it’s available right now.</p>



<p>It’s an opinion we wholeheartedly applaud.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a>&nbsp;centres on this theme: “We must&nbsp;ensure the Internet remains open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure — anchored in universal values that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.”</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/03/13/the-role-of-decentralized-identity-in-implementing-the-white-house-national-cybersecurity-strategy">statement</a>&nbsp;responding to the strategy, Heather Dahl, Hyperledger Foundation governing board member and Indicio CEO, pointed out that the problems the strategy is addressing don’t require a “moonshot to solve” because they have been “a central concern among open-source technology communities like those at the Hyperledger Foundation for many years. And they—we—have found solutions.”</p>



<p>Ms Dahl explained:</p>



<p>“Decentralized identity has provided a way to provide a verification layer for digital interaction; we have ways to prove who we are and know who we are interacting with; we have ways for people to hold their data and share it in a way that preserves their privacy.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to overstate the importance of the next point: These aren’t paper solutions or future ware; industries are leading the adoption of this technology. The prospect of secure, seamless travel—which would take a passenger from online check in to boarding, through border control, and all the way to unlocking their hotel room—is driving the creation of a verifiable digital travel credential.”</p>



<p>Ms Dahl drew on examples in decentralized identity applications from&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/about/">Indicio</a>, the company she heads up, which span “everything from employee identification to auditing devices monitoring emissions to tracking supply chains. We’ve used Hyperledger Foundation technologies to develop verifiable credentials that manage financial transactions, from passwordless proof of account ownership to reusable KYC.”</p>



<p>Importantly, Ms Dahl said the solutions are ready and universally available: “The future is happening now. And because so much of this work has been built on open source codebases (meaning many developers, companies, and even governments passionate about the technology have contributed code), the future is available to everyone.”</p>



<p>Ms Dahl specifically called out&nbsp;Strategic Objective 4.5 of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in which the White House notes “the human cost of inaction and inertia” as being data breaches that affected nearly 300 million people in 2021 alone and which stem from the lack of secure digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She welcomes the Federal Government’s desire to “encourage and enable investments in strong, verifiable digital identity solutions that promote security, accessibility and interoperability, financial and social inclusion, consumer privacy, and economic growth,” saying:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the remarkable things we have seen with open source verifiable digital identity is that it has been embraced by businesses and governments alike: everyone who sees the technology in action immediately sees how it is the building block for digital transformation: a way to upgrade web2 and tangible infrastructure for creating web3. With verifiable credentials, anything can be given an identity and that identity and the data associated with it can be verified seamlessly. Decentralized Ecosystem Governance — a machine-readable way of managing roles, rules, and trust within a verifiable identity ecosystem — solves the problem of governance, elegantly.</p>



<p>The ability to implement seamless verification transforms every aspect of digital interaction. If you can trust the data, you can devise processes, products, and services that are frictionless and trustworthy, whether it be proving you own a bank account or want to share your health records or cross a border. Again, this is already happening.”</p>



<p>Read Anonyome Labs’ co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley’s explanation of why&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials are the “killer feature of DI.”</a></p>



<p>The Hyperledger Foundation is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation. Anonyome Labs is an active member of the Hyperledger Foundation and has been contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community for some time. Hyperledger hosts the decentralized identity based Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa projects and Anonyome Labs contributes to the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Cloud Agent (ACA-PY)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">aries-vcx</a>&nbsp;projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See all the additional ways Anonyome Labs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">actively contributes to decentralized identity development</a>.</p>



<p>Clearly, we agree with Ms Dahl’s commentary on the new national cybersecurity strategy finding its legs in decentralized identity, so we’ll leave you with her final quote: “As the White House and the Federal Government move forward, we hope they will recognize the enormous progress that has been made, that the moonshot worked, and now we’re ready for the stars.”</p>

 In this vlog, 1Kosmos VP of Product Marketing, Robert MacDonald, is joined by our VP of Product Management, Javed Shah, and our Marketing Manager, Abigail Edwards, to discuss their experience at Gartner IAM. 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 Abigail:<p></p>
 
<p>Gartner IAM. Woo woo. What a good time.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>It’s a great time. It’s always a great time.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>It is fun. We have fun.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Hello.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I’m going to ask you some questions about it.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>All right, fire away.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I mean, to start, what’s Gartner IAM ?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Well, from my perspective, I’ll let Javed talk from PMA side, but from a PMM side, it’s the preeminent identity and access management event that happens every year. So if you want to know what’s going on in the IAM space and what the trends are, what the emerging technologies are, where the market industry is going, you go to this event. And it’s been like that since I’ve entered the IAM space about 20 years ago. It’s also a good opportunity for me to go check out and see what some of my competitors are doing.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Like Rob said, yes, absolutely. It’s a gathering place, annual gathering place of all things identity. Identity professionals, vendors, customers, and of course analysts. It’s also a place to discover stuff. There’s a lot of discovery going on every single day. And I think as much as we are learning from what the analysts are thinking about their research, I believe that the analysts are learning from us as well. Especially the one-on-one sessions where you put an arcane requirement from a bunch of customers you heard about in front of an analyst, you put them in a deep think mode, right? So it’s really useful. And it obviously works the other way where the analyst will drop some piece of information. This quote comes to mind, “You’re either orchestrating or you’re being orchestrated.” Remarkable in my opinion because that’s kind of the drift we’ve been on here at 1Kosmos for a while now, really trying to make things easier and add value on top of passwordless, add security to passwordless. So really important Session held once a year.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>We liked Texas. Texas was Fun.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>And now it’s going to be in Texas apparently. So used to the Vegas life-</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>And we had a booth.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>But that’s history. All good.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>We had a booth.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>We loved Texas, yeah.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>We had great conversations and engagement, but why and where does 1Kosmos fit into this event?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, it’s a good question. Again, from my perspective, and Javed, you may have a different one. But there’s a lot of trends that are taking place within our industry right now. One of those is passwordless, right? And another one is actually identity verification, funny enough. How to prove an identity online. And being that we play in both of those spaces and is really the only vendor to bring both of those capabilities together, we fit into that space quite nicely. If we look at just a lot of the conversations, Abigail, you were in the booth. When we talked about what we did, it aligned very well to what customers were trying to solve. Especially when we brought into the fact that they came in looking for passwordless.</p>
<p>We say, “Oh, by the way we do that is building a verified identity so you can ensure you know the user behind the device.” And at the end of the day, that’s what people are trying to do. There’s lots of technologies that are laying on top to try to make that happen, but at the end of the day, what we bring to the table is a concept of, and it’s one of the things that Akif talked about, is this concept of identity plus selfie. Is it identity plus selfie? ID plus selfie, yeah, thank you. To ensure you know who that user is by the device. So if you combine the identity, I did it again, the ID plus selfie, you end up on a path that puts you in a position of security that hasn’t been available until 1Kosmos, to be frank.</p>
<p>And when customers see it, and this event for us was better than the last time we were there because the market continues to evolve and people are starting to understand what we’re doing. It’s a very interesting conversation and one in which we are leading the conversation in, which is also fun. We had a couple of people show up at our booth because of Javed, talked about meeting with the analysts, they met with a couple of analysts. They’re looking to do some specific things and they left that meeting and came directly to our booth to learn more because we’re the only ones that can do an IAL or AAL level two certified authentication. Nobody else can do that. We’re the only ones that can do that. So it’s a very different conversation for us than I think it is from some of the other people that are attending that show. Right Javed? What do you think?</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely, we have to be there. We’re going to educate the market about how to do Passwordless correctly, Passwordless securely. We are the only NIST certified IAL2 authenticator on the planet. We have to be there. We are the ones who are helping educate the market. The analysts are learning from us and they’re kind of repeating a little bit of our sentiment now. It has picked up that construct of ID plus selfie, it’s something we’ve been saying for four years now. It’s been on our website for three years now.</p>
<p>You do passwordless because you know who the person is, not who the device is. That’s the right way to do passwordless. Every other exhibitor in the passwordless space prefers to use final authentication, bring a device. Well, we demonstrated we could use seven touch IDs on one phone to unlock a demo. That’s not knowing the identity to open the demo. That’s knowing the device and that’s a shared device. That’s not how we do it. So I think it’s really important for us to be there and for this, I guess, dissemination of information that we are very good at. And I think the market’s really not very good at it yet because it’s still learning.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>Love that. What would you say in terms of all these conversations that happened in our booth, did anything throw you off? Any questions or unique conversations that really stuck, that felt different than our typical conversations at these types of events?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>For me, the big one, as I mentioned, we had an organization come straight to our booth after talking with one of the analysts. They were curious about what a digital identity wallet was. “Tell me about how that works.” And that’s not typically a question we get. Normally it’s like, “Tell me how you do passwordless.” Or, “Tell me how you do identity verification.” But the concept of an identity wallet may not be new. The way in which we deliver it, certainly is. And they were interested in the way we bring all of that together.</p>
<p>How do we build that wallet? What’s behind it? What’s the supporting technologies for us to make that work? The fact that we can support the concept of bring your own identity was a very hot button for them. And they spent about an hour in our booth learning more about our technology and how all of this stuff comes together. And that conversation didn’t happen the last time we were at this show because customers just didn’t quite understand it. But the market is moving such that it’s evolving so quickly that we’re starting to have those conversations now. That’s a big one for me.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, and I would agree obviously, and for me it was interesting. Folks are showing up at these events. The IRS was there, Costco was there, so many different large companies. Navy Federal was there. Folks are taking a look at what they’ve been doing for the last 20, 30 years, which has been the paper-based onboarding of new hires, whether they’re full-time or they are contractors. It’s interesting how they are suddenly looking to digitize everything as if that’s going to be possible. But there is this impossible dream. Everyone comes up in shows, “Well, my help desk receives a phone call. Can you digitize that for me? I do this manually and it’s a process. Can you digitize that for me?” Those are impossible problems to solve as the technology in the phones and the onboard biometrics with your laptops and all. The state-of-the-art doesn’t support the impossible use cases, but folks are asking the question anyway, and I think that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>It’s not a bad thing just because it’s an impossible or a difficult problem to solve, doesn’t make it a bad thing. It means that there are discussions happening behind closed doors and the doors have opened. Now those discussions are in our booths, and I think that’s where you tend to get that expansion of that circle, that knowledge domain, which is just starting to happen. I did not get questions like that in the last Gartner event, but this time around there were questions like that, and of course there were difficult answers to those and sometimes there was comfortable silence as well. Where everybody realized, “Well, I just asked an impossible question,” but they’re there. They have your number and I feel that can lead to only good things. So that was kind of a standup for me because it was different.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I mean, great conversations, unique questions. What overall, sessions, booth, other vendors being there, the analysts that were present, the attendees walking around, what are your overall thoughts of how this event went?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Well, again, for me, this is the first event I’ve been to since, not that I want to say that word again, but COVID, right? It’s the first time that I’ve been on a show floor in three years almost. So it was good just to get back out and meet people face-to-face. Not to mention, I mean, listen, this is a very small space. It’s fun to see past coworkers and past customers that you’ve worked at or with at other companies that you may have been part of. But at the end of the day, there’s always takeaways. There’s always things that you’re going to learn.</p>
<p>And this event is absolutely no exception to that. And it’s a very beneficial show if you can get there. There are lots of things that you are going to learn no matter how experienced you are. There’s always going to be something that is going to make you stop and think about whatever you just saw, watched, heard, whatever that might be. It’s always a great event. There’s always things that I’m learning, whether it be from customers or from analysts or even some of the other vendors around the show floor, but it’s always a very good event and always a very good time. Always time very well invested going to it.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>It was good to catch up with friends from, what, 20 years? Folks still in the business. You enter this industry, you don’t leave it because it’s the identity business, as we said in the session, we are truly the only providers of our own identity. Hopefully people are starting to learn that, understand that. That’s been our value prop for nearly half a decade now. The analysts are starting to speak what we are speaking and imagine meeting all of those individuals, those folks at the same place. I was quite pleased with the venue, to be honest. I was not sure what to expect after Vegas.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, I was too.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>But it was good.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>I think it’s better than Vegas, personally.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I liked it. At the Gaylord in Grapevine.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Yep.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p><br>
Identifiers are a crucial part of our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have both private and public identifiers. On the private side, examples include Social Security numbers and Driver’s Licence numbers, and there are many private or closed identity systems that manage private identifiers for us. Sometimes, they give us these identifiers in the form of cards or tokens. On the public side, we use public identifiers every day, such as Phone Numbers, Email Addresses, Domain Names, and Usernames.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these identifiers, both private and public, are created and managed by central authorities, such as governments, financial institutions, telcos, email providers, domain name registrars and most service providers. This centralization means that we don’t really have ownership and control over our identifiers or identities, leaving them vulnerable to fraud and misuse.</p>
<blockquote><p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/J1AQUlvdz4I?t=2043">podcast episode 45</a>, Drummond Reed makes the point that the email address is still the most widely used identifier, but the most valuable for newer systems and where the Social Web is going is your mobile phone number. The mobile phone number is the most valuable identifier on the dark web because, with mobile phone number portability, it’s your address across multiple systems. It’s also the one you’re likely to hold on to because it’s a pain to change it. Some people have more than one, but a lot of folks only have one of those, whereas it’s very common for us to have multiple email addresses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before recording this podcast, I watched a presentation called the <a href="https://vimeo.com/809258916/92b420d98a">AI Dilemma.</a> The presentation was made by some of the same people who created the <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">Social Dilemma</a> documentary on Netflix. In this presentation, they talked about how content-based authentication is dead. With certain advances in AI, deep fakes can be done so easily through both voice and video. You could perfectly mimic someone’s voice with just three seconds of audio, which is kind of scary. It made me think about all these telephone scams that happen and how it’s going to become easier and easier to scam people.</p>
<p>How can we better authenticate things in a world where identity takeovers continue rising, and spoofing is becoming practically impossible to detect? Unpacking identifiers is a good place to start.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a>, or a new way of managing our identities could be an example of something that could help solve these problems. There’s a growing need for decentralized identifiers that put ownership and control back into the hands of individuals, enabling secure/private/confidential conversations, interactions and relationships.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Markus and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 An overview of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) – how DIDs came about, their history and evolution. 
 The core properties of DIDs – what sets them apart from other types of identifiers. 
 DID Methods. As of this post, there are 160+ DID Methods listed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">this registry</a>. Are they all decentralized? Why are there so many? What are some popular ones that have been adopted? 
 What things to consider in your selection criteria for the right DID Method(s). 
 When would one use DIDs for abstraction purposes vs vanilla public-key cryptography? 
 DID Documents – what can be stored in them? How are they linked to a DID? What are some examples of things you can store in the authentication and service endpoints. How do you interact with them? 
 Using blockchain vs non-blockchain (e.g., DNS server) implementations for storing DID Documents. What are some key elements to take into consideration when looking at these different options? 
 Do DIDs disrupt or enhance existing certificate business models? 
 The power of DID Resolution – how has it evolved, how does it work? (see video ⬇️ for a great explainer)

<p>Fission can't wait to return to IPFS Thing. We're presenting nine talks and will share progress on some of our most anticipated projects, including IPVM, RhizomeDB, and a Passkeys + UCAN integration.</p> What is IPFS Thing? <p><a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing</a> is a week-long gathering for the IPFS implementors community featuring talks, workshops, discussion circles, hacking time, and more.</p><p>Last year the conference was held in Reykjavik, Iceland. Here's a quick recap:</p>IPFS Thing 2022 Recap<p>Fission attended in 2022 and gave four talks about our work in the IPFS ecosystem. You can watch a playlist of those talks here (click the image to navigate to the playlist):</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfW9my7NCey9Np7ZYwDjA32w5of3JWKId"></a>A Playlist of Fission's 2022 IPFS Thing Talks (CLICK TO PLAY) Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 <p>This year IPFS Thing will be held in Brussels, Belgium, April 15-19, and Fission is thrilled to return for another year. We look forward to connecting and collaborating with many innovators in the space and are incredibly honored to be giving nine(!) talks throughout the week. </p><p>Here are the talk abstracts:</p> Interplanetary Databases Track <p>Querying Decentralized Data in Rhizomatic Systems with Quinn Wilton</p><p>Shifting storage and compute toward the far edge reflects an extreme departure from traditional cloud-based architectures, bringing with that shift a new set of challenges for application developers. Rhizome is a decentralized database for InterPlanetary Linked Data that embraces these challenges to open up new ways of thinking about consistency, interoperability, and privacy. This talk introduces the ideas underpinning Rhizome, and demonstrates how they come together to empower developers to build and reason about new types of peer-to-peer and decentralized applications.</p> Data Transfer Track <p>CAR Mirror Reflections with James Walker</p><p>CAR Mirror describes a method for efficiently diffing, deduplicating, packaging, and transmitting IPLD data from source to sink. In this talk, there will be an introduction to the CAR Mirror protocol followed by a review of the current state of the Go implementation.</p><p>Data Transfer Batching Techniques Featuring Blake3, CAR Mirror, and More with Phillip Krüger</p><p>Batching block transfer is the main way to optimize DAG exchange compared to bitswap. This talk discusses current proposals for batched data transfer, such as blake3 with bao, sending CAR files, CAR mirror, and GraphSync. We’ll look at what use cases they do and don’t solve and which techniques from one protocol could be applied in others.</p> IPFS On The Web Track <p>The Name Name Service – Discoverable, Verifiable Names for Decentralized Infrastructures with Blaine Cook</p><p>NNS is a new approach to providing distributed discovery for human-readable names. NNS builds upon DIDs and UCANs to allow permissionless delegation and service discovery, emphasizing improving end-user UX for IPFS and related services. This talk will overview the approach, discuss use cases, and explore anticipated challenges.</p><p>WNFS: Versioned and Encrypted Data on IPFS with Phillip Krüger</p><p>The WebNative File System (WNFS) empowers users with extensible metadata, file and directory history, conflict resolution, and encryption with fine-grained access levels. We show a rough outline of its design goals, how it works, our roadmap, and possibly a demo of our new Rust implementation.</p> Integrating IPFS Track <p>Decentralizing Auth, and UCAN Too with Brooklyn Zelenka</p><p>UCAN is a decentralized auth format used by several DWeb, web3, and IPFS projects. Much like how IPFS uses content addressing to liberate data from centralized hosts, UCAN uses CIDs and OCAP to liberate apps from centralized auth servers. Learn how UCAN can help throughout the IPFS stack, from block-level access to user permissions to application interop.</p> Community &amp; Governance Track <p>Starmaps: A Cross-Team Roadmapping Tool with Bastien Dehaynin</p><p>I would like to share Starmaps, a tool Protocol Labs developed for roadmapping based on Github issues. It is especially good for rendering cross-teams/projects roadmaps, which is perfect for improving visibility inside the network and communicating dependencies more easily. We have started using it at Fission, and our goal is to have as many PLN projects as possible rendered in a single Starmap where you can navigate and look at the dependencies between projects. </p> Decentralized Compute &amp; AI Track <p>IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World with Brooklyn Zelenka</p><p>Curious about the latest from the IPVM WG? This talk presents updates from the working group: a high-level overview of IPVM, standards to date, the latest roadmap, and lessons learned so far. This includes invocation and workflow models, a (pluggable) effect system, a principled approach to partial failure, open interop, kernel functionality, private data handling, and the most common question: what IPVM is *not*!</p><p>Foundations for Open-World Compute: Homestar, an IPVM Tale with Zeeshan Lakhani</p><p>At Fission, we've been laying down the groundwork for an IPVM implementation called Homestar, a distributed compute engine built with IPFS and IPLD at its core, along with first-class support for the Wasm (WebAssembly) Component Model and Interface Types, a vision for managed effects, and primitives for open-world replayability, capability discovery (UCAN capabilities specifically), and execution coordination. In this talk, we'll predominantly focus on the deterministic Wasm subset of the engine, particularly on why we've sided with the Wasm Component model, how we bidirectionally translate between IPLD and Wasm Interface Types at runtime and aim to achieve a legitimate write once, run anywhere ethos. We'll also dive into approaches related to the monumental challenge involving open-world interoperability, especially in the context of other distributed workflow frameworks and toward the goal of fault-oblivious computing. </p> UCANs + Passkeys <p>In addition to these exciting talks, our newest Fissioneer, <a href="https://twitter.com/hugomrdias">Hugo Dias</a>, will offer demos of a prototype he built that uses a combination of Passkeys and UCANs to authenticate users signing into Webnative apps. </p><p>As you know, we at Fission love <a href="https://webnative.dev/">passwordless authentication</a>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Passkeys</a> are a fantastic opportunity to onboard more users into apps without them needing to create a password, Ethereum wallet, or use a browser extension. Currently, Passkeys work best for Web2 use cases because they need to connect a server and the user's device for validation purposes. However, we want a local-first solution - one that is native to the browser. </p><p>That's where UCANs come in! UCANs can act as a source of truth for authorization, where servers would typically come into play. To utilize UCANs and have decentralized auth, you need a DID and a private key. Passkeys can use face scanning, fingerprint touch, or hardware authenticators to seed DIDs and cryptographic signatures. This is what we're working on implementing at Fission.</p><p>If you want to see Hugo's demo, find him at IPFS Thing!</p> Stay Informed <p><a href="https://lu.ma/ipfsthing2023">In-person tickets</a> are still available for IPFS Thing 2023, but if you can't make it to Brussels, don't worry! All talks will be recorded, and we will be sure to share them on the blog (with a deeper dive into each talk) when available.</p><p>On that note, be sure to <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/">subscribe to our newsletter</a> so you can receive our blog posts and Fission news directly in your inbox.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, check out our previous update here:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-developer-update-29/">  Spruce Developer Update #29  At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything), is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Currently, we're working on adding support for working with user-controlled data in SSX. If you're curious about this work, message us in our Discord! We hope to have more announcements about changes to the library later this quarter.   We released a new package supporting Auth.js, NextAuth's spiritual successor. We've also updated our tutorials to reflect the new changes and plan on creating additional guides around its usage (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/76?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #76</a>).  We've added an update to revalidate sessions when users change accounts using their wallet to ensure that the currently selected wallet is attempting to establish a session with a given application (<a>ssx #88</a>).  We've pushed numerous fixes to our Gnosis Safe login extension, including a fix for the modal flashing when there's no active delegation for a multisig, a fix for the SSX instance freezing if the modal is closed during the sign-in process, and some additional housekeeping (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/98?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #98</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/100?ref=blog.spruceid.com">100</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/103?ref=blog.spruceid.com">103</a>).  Additionally, we've added a fix for any login failures if <code>resolveEns</code> is set to <code>true</code> and a user is on a network that isn't supported by ENS (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/102?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #102</a>).  We've added callbacks on SSX server middleware routes to increase flexibility for executing additional code during the authentication process &nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/105?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #105</a>).  Finally, we made several additions and updates to our documentation and a few fixes for our end-to-end tests for the library.   <p>We would also like to thank everyone who beta-tested SSX Quest, a credential issuer built on SSX and Kepler during ETHDenver. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/plant-a-tree-and-control-your-data-with-ssx-at-ethdenver/">  Plant a Tree and Control Your Data with SSX At ETHDenver  We’re happy to announce that we are demoing an app called SSX Quest that shows how Sign-In with Ethereum can extend user control into interactions with user-controlled data, beyond just identity.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>We're happy to announce that we'll be planting 100 trees for all the folks who obtained and presented credentials within the application. To learn more about SSX Quest, check out the article above. </p> Sign-In with Ethereum Core Libraries <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-integrates-sign-in-with-ethereum-into-metamask-for-better-user-experience-and-safety/">  Spruce Integrates Sign-In with Ethereum Into MetaMask for Better User Experience and Safety  We’re now happy to announce a significant step forward in Sign-In with Ethereum adoption with a direct integration into MetaMask.  SpruceSam Gbafa    </a>  We're extremely excited to announce our collaboration with MetaMask to bring native Sign-In with Ethereum support to the MetaMask extension wallet! Now, when a user signs in with Ethereum using MetaMask, they will be presented with a neatly formatted "sign-in" request along with domain binding which protects users from phishing attacks. For more information on this integration, check out the article above.   We're in the process of making numerous updates and security improvements to our <code>siwe</code> core TypeScript library. Stay tuned for more information on these changes.   The ReCap specification (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ERC-5573</a>) has been updated to reflect new developments in the distributed capabilities space (EIPs <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6654?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#6654</a>, siwe-recap <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-recap/pull/14?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#14</a>), bringing it in line with the UCAN specification to enable integration between SIWE-based applications and applications using UCANs and CACAOs.   Kepler <p><br>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your existing keys.</p>  CORS support has been improved and made configurable via a simple boolean, making testing and deployment easier for those not using a load balancer (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/138?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#138</a>)  We're currently working on replication in Kepler and configurable storage limits in orbits. If you're curious about our work on Kepler, please reach out to the team.    SpruceID <p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information.</p> TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims at describing both the structure and semantics of the defined schema in a comprehensible way. It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  We are currently working on TreeLDR being able to define a trait definition for each RDF class (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/124?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #124</a>).    Rebase   In Rebase, we've now added PRs for a finalized version of flows for credentials that attest ownership of NFTs and POAPs (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/53?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #53</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/54?ref=blog.spruceid.com">54</a>).

  The FATF Travel Rule raises privacy and data protection concerns, as it mandates VASPs to share sensitive user information while facilitating crypto transactions.  Adhering to the FATF Travel Rule while maintaining data privacy requires a fully automated and P2P-enabled Travel Rule Solution, such as Shyft Veriscope.  The FATF insists that widespread international adoption of the Travel Rule is crucial for mitigating risks and achieving uniformity in combating fraud, illegal transfers, and illicit crypto&nbsp;trails.  <p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule is a global regulatory requirement for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to collect and transmit customer information during cryptocurrency transactions. It aims to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by increasing transparency and accountability in digital asset transfers.</p><p>While the FATF Travel Rule is touted as essential in promoting financial integrity and preventing illicit activities in the crypto space, it also raises concerns about privacy and data protection in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>Therefore, balancing the need for financial security with the right to privacy and data protection in implementing the FATF Travel Rule is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>VASPs must take measures to ensure that the information collected and transmitted is secure and only used for its intended purpose. Likewise, when providing guidelines, regulators must implement measures to safeguard personal&nbsp;data.</p> Here’s What we are covering&nbsp;today:   The FATF Travel Rule and Personal Information  Types of Personal Information Collected Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule  Risk of Personal Information Exposure  Compliance Challenges for&nbsp;VASPs  Technical Challenges in Implementing the Travel&nbsp;Rule  Balancing Compliance With Privacy Requirements  Jurisdictional Differences in Privacy and Data Protection  Challenges in Harmonizing Global Compliance Efforts  Shyft Veriscope: Fully Automated &amp; P2P Data Transfers  <p>Let’s not wait any further and take a deeper look into what the FATF Travel Rule is all about and its implications on the ecosystem’s future!</p> The FATF Travel Rule and Personal Information <p>In order to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, the FATF Travel Rule imposes transparency and accountability measures on digital asset transfers, requiring VASPs to handle sensitive personal data. This information, however, could be targeted by hackers and cybercriminals. Therefore, it is essential to rigorously assess the types of personal data collected and the risks involved.</p> Types of Personal Information Collected Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Under the FATF Travel Rule, VASPs are required to collect and transmit originator and beneficiary personal information and their transaction details.</p><p>And although the information that VASPs collect helps authorities track the flow of funds and detect suspicious activities, collecting and transmitting sensitive personal information could also pose significant risks to individuals’ privacy and data protection. In the next section, we will explore these risks in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">Most Googled Questions on FATF Travel Rule&nbsp;Anwered</a></p> Risk of Personal Information Exposure <p>The collection and transmission of personal information under the FATF Travel Rule come with inherent risks to individuals’ privacy and data protection, such as data breaches, hacking incidents, unauthorized access, and data&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>Data breaches and hacking incidents are among the most significant risks associated with collecting personal information by VASPs, as cybercriminals could hack into the VASPs’ systems and steal personal information. This can put the originator and beneficiary at risk of identity theft and financial fraud.</p><p>Another risk is the unauthorized access and misuse of data by VASPs’ employees or third-party service providers. To prevent that from happening, VASPs must ensure that only authorized personnel have access to personal information and that it is only used for its intended purpose. If VASPs fail to do so, their users’ personal information could be misused or sold to third parties, leading to a breach of trust and potential harm to individuals.</p><p>Moreover, the collection and transmission of personal information by VASPs could lead to the centralization of personal data. This could make it easier for governments and law enforcement agencies to conduct surveillance on individuals, violating their privacy and data protection rights.</p> Compliance Challenges for&nbsp;VASPs <p>VASPs face numerous compliance challenges when complying with the regulatory requirement while safeguarding individuals’ personal&nbsp;data.</p> Technical Challenges in Complying With the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The most significant challenge while complying with the FATF Travel Rule is interoperability, as it mandates VASPs to transmit customer information. To achieve this, VASPs must ensure their Travel Rule Solution can communicate seamlessly with the counterparty VASPs’ systems. However, this is easier said than done, as there are no standardized protocols or formats for transmitting customer information.</p><p>Another big technical challenge is the secure transmission and storage of customer information. VASPs must ensure that customer information is transmitted and stored securely to prevent unauthorized access or misuse. This requires robust security measures, such as encryption and multi-factor authentication, to protect customer information from cyber-attacks and data breaches.</p><p>Moreover, VASPs must comply with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to safeguard customer information. This includes ensuring that customers have control over their personal data and that VASPs do not share their data with third parties without their explicit&nbsp;consent.</p><p>Not to mention, it can be costly and resource-intensive for VASPs, particularly for smaller or less established firms. They may need to invest in new technology, hire additional staff, or seek external support to ensure compliance.</p> Balancing Compliance With Privacy Requirements <p>While VASPs are required to comply with the Travel Rule’s regulatory requirement to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, at the same time, they need to adhere to global data protection regulations and respect individuals’ privacy&nbsp;rights.</p><p>These global data protection regulations include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and more. These regulations require VASPs to obtain customers’ explicit consent before collecting their personal information, ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date, and provide customers with control over their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Achieving a balance in collecting customer information while preserving their privacy requires implementing robust security measures and privacy-focused technologies to safeguard personal data and prevent unauthorized access or misuse. This also requires VASPs to work with regulators to ensure compliance with the Travel Rule does not violate individuals’ privacy&nbsp;rights.</p><p>In the following table, we compare the different factors affecting FATF Travel Rule compliance and privacy/data protection laws in general, shedding light on the complexities VASPs face while striking a right balance between the&nbsp;two.</p> Jurisdictional Differences in Privacy and Data Protection <p>The challenge to balance Travel Rule compliance and data protection laws is compounded when dealing with different laws across jurisdictions.</p><p>When it comes to data protection regulations across countries and regions, the GDPR in the European Union (EU) and the CCPA in the US are the most prominent ones.</p><p>The EU’s GDPR is among the most comprehensive and stringent data protection regulations globally. It applies to all companies processing the personal data of EU residents, regardless of their location, and requires companies to obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting and processing their personal information.</p><p>Meanwhile, the CCPA is another comprehensive data protection regulation that applies to companies operating in California. The CCPA grants California residents the right to know what personal information businesses collect about them, the right to request that their information be deleted, and the right to opt out of the sale of their information.</p><p>Other countries and regions also have their own data protection regulations, such as the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore and the Privacy Act in Canada. These regulations may differ in their scope, requirements, and penalties for non-compliance, creating additional compliance challenges for businesses operating globally.</p> Challenges in Harmonizing Global Compliance Efforts <p>As we discussed above, there are varying data protection regulations across countries and regions. This can create significant compliance challenges for businesses due to differences in cultural norms, legal frameworks, and technological capabilities. Further, it creates challenges for cross-border data transfers and the enforcement of data protection requirements, making it difficult to harmonize global compliance efforts.</p><p>Cross-border data transfers are particularly challenging as data protection regulations may vary significantly between countries, making it difficult to ensure that personal data is adequately protected when transferred between jurisdictions.</p><p>For example, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries that do not have adequate data protection regulations in place. This can create compliance challenges for companies that operate in multiple jurisdictions and must transfer personal data between&nbsp;them.</p><p>Enforcement of data protection requirements is another challenge in harmonizing global compliance efforts. Different countries have different enforcement mechanisms, ranging from government regulators to private lawsuits. This can create confusion and uncertainty for businesses operating across different jurisdictions, as they may face different penalties and consequences for non-compliance.</p><p>Furthermore, data breaches can occur in any jurisdiction, and companies may face legal and reputational consequences from regulators and customers in multiple jurisdictions. This creates a complex legal landscape for businesses to navigate, as they must comply with the data protection requirements of multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>To address these challenges, businesses must adopt a proactive privacy and data protection approach that considers each jurisdiction’s unique requirements. This may involve implementing robust data protection measures, conducting regular privacy assessments, and working with legal experts to navigate the complex legal landscape of data protection regulations.</p> Shyft Veriscope: Fully Automated &amp; P2P Travel Rule Data Transfers <p>To protect user experience and privacy while complying with the Travel Rule, VASPs have the opportunity to use Shyft Veriscope — the only frictionless Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>Even Ironman recommends the Shyft Veriscope.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Dr. Kendall Mao and I am the Chief Scientist for Ontology.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am very interested in cryptography and I also play basketball and football, among other sports. I had two pets when I was a child, a cat, and a dog, and now I have a pet&nbsp;snail.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I have been the Chief Scientist for Ontology since July 2018. My duties include conducting technical research on the underlying technology of blockchain, Ontology’s decentralized identity system, and zero-knowledge proof mechanisms. I also research how we can combine elements of the blockchain and identity&nbsp;system.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>In my opinion, there are three things that make Ontology stand out from other blockchains. Firstly, the efficient confirmation of the Ontology blockchain. The Ontology chain adopts the VBFT consensus algorithm, which can support high concurrent TPS and fast confirmation of blocks. Secondly, Ontology’s multi-virtual machine system currently supports three types of virtual machines: NeoVM, WasmVM, and EVM, enabling developers familiar with different programming languages to quickly develop dApps. Finally, Ontology’s decentralized identity system sets it apart. Ontology was the first team to realize the importance of the decentralized identity system and has been exploring this technology for quite some&nbsp;time.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>The most exciting part of the Ontology project is its decentralized identity framework.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The moment when I really decided to devote myself to the blockchain field was by far the most critical and career-defining moment in my&nbsp;career.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited to see how the expansion of decentralized applications into the mainstream industry brings about real and much-needed autonomy for users, over their identity and&nbsp;data.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In the next five years, in the field of Web3, decentralized collaboration and decentralized social networks may be a trending use of DID frameworks. Ontology will continue to do a good job in building the infrastructure for Web3, not only providing an easy-to-use blockchain but also continuing to provide Web3 with a decentralized identity system and related content, such as decentralized reputation, which is the cornerstone of Web3 applications.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-chief-scientist-dr-kendall-mao-9dc77c5d82da">Meet the Team: Chief Scientist, Dr. Kendall Mao</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Despite their ubiquity, passwords have become – at best – an anachronism and, at worst – a gaping security blindspot for organizations and individuals alike. To put it simply, passwords are bad. They represent one of the weakest links in security, are a leading cause of breaches, and are both difficult and frustrating to manage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll say it again. Passwords are bad. Bad for security and bad for user experience. Bad across the board. Bad bad bad. One can even argue that they are the most prevalent and broadly accepted (albeit irrationally) global vulnerability. They offer practically zero redeeming qualities whatsoever and you should stop using them immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize, passwords suck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, since you are on the Ping Identity website, I’m likely preaching to the choir on the shortcomings of password security. Most of us already know this all too well. We also know that adopting passwordless authentication can solve all these problems through enhanced security, better user experience, and streamlined access management:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>For customers, passwordless authentication improves engagement while also lowering abandonment rates. These seamless experiences ultimately drive higher revenues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>For employees, passwordless authentication results in less time entering and resetting login credentials. In turn, this equals higher productivity and less strain on helpdesks.</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While increased profits should be motivation enough to embrace passwordless, the security benefits are also glaringly obvious. Case in point, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2020/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">80% of breaches involve brute force attacks or the use of lost or stolen credentials</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, the pros of going passwordless drastically exceed the cons of sticking with the status quo. So – this begs the question – why the heck are we still using passwords?!?!</p>

 Stakers can claim DF31 rewards. DF32 runs Apr 6— Apr 13,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 32 is here&nbsp;(DF32).</p><p>DF32 is the third week of DF Main, the final phase of DF. This week, users can earn rewards up to 150K OCEAN. In DF Main, weekly rewards will grow to 1M+&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>The article <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">“Ocean Data Farming Main is Here”</a> has the full details of DF Main. In fact, it’s a self-contained description of Ocean Data Farming (DF), including all the details that matter. It is up-to-date with the latest reward function, weekly OCEAN allocation, and estimates of APYs given the current amount of OCEAN&nbsp;staked.</p><p>DF is like DeFi liquidity mining or yield farming, but is tuned to drive data consume volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards stakers with OCEAN who allocate voting power to curate data assets with high&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>To participate, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">users lock OCEAN to receive veOCEAN</a>, then allocate veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs) via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/data">DF&nbsp;dapp</a>.</p><p>DF31 counting started 12:01am Mar 23, 2022 and ended 12:01am Apr 6, 2023. 75K OCEAN worth of rewards were available. Those rewards are now ready for claiming. You can claim them at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF32 is live and will conclude on Apr 13,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>DF Round 32 (DF32) is the third week of DF Main.

If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF32&nbsp;Overview <p>DF32 is part of DF Main, phase 1. This phase emits 150K OCEAN / week and runs for 52 weeks total. (A detailed DF Main schedule is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.)</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Some key parameters:</p>  Total budget is 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  <p>Active rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%.

<p>In this post we will learn what SBTs are and how they can be applied in our daily&nbsp;lives.</p> What are&nbsp;SBTs? <p>Soulbound tokens, or SBTs, are publicly verifiable and non-transferable <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/nonfungible-tokens-for-beginners/what-are-nfts-and-why-are-they-revolutionizing-the-art-world">non-fungible tokens (NFT)</a> representing an individual’s identity and credentials using blockchain technology. The concept was first introduced in 2022 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, Puja Ohlhaver, strategy counsel at FlashBots, and E. Glen Weyl, political economist and social technologist in a paper titled “Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s&nbsp;Soul.”</p><p>SBTs may consist of employment history, medical records, and any piece of information belonging to a person or entity. The wallets or accounts to which SBTs are permanently bound are called “Souls,” and people could potentially have multiple of them describing different parts of their lives. For example, people could have a “Credentials Soul” for their curriculum vitae and a “Financial Soul” for the records of their transactions, allowing them to build a confirmable digital Web3 character established on their experiences and preceding actions.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most powerful aspects is that SBTs owned by one Soul can be issued or attested by other Souls who are counterparties to these relationships, like other individuals or institutions. For example, a company can distribute SBTs to employees, or a school can issue SBTs to students who completed specific courses or&nbsp;majors.</p> SBTs and&nbsp;NFTs <p>Nowadays, most NFTs are ownership certificates for digital art or collectibles. People buy, trade, or display NFTs as a symbol of wealth and status. The goal of SBTs is to transform NFTs into an object beyond wealth, a unique and untransferable token.</p><p>NFTs portray capital and ownership, whereas SBTs represent an individual’s or entity’s reputation. SBTs do not consist of financial value and cannot be traded once distributed to someone’s wallet. The table below shows a summary of the difference between SBTs and&nbsp;NFTs:</p>[Source: Cointelegraph] SBTs and DAO&nbsp;voting <p>Trust is one of the main challenges involving the Web3 industry. How can a person’s reputation be trusted in a system made to be trustless? In the financial sector, SBTs can be used to represent someone’s credentials, where reputation will act as collateral to get a loan, in contrast with the current way of checking the borrower’s bank account balances and credit&nbsp;scores.</p><p>Another use of SBTs is in decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting. As an alternative to the current governance model, based on the number of tokens a member holds, DAOs could provide SBTs assigning voting power dependent on users’ interactions with the community. This model would prioritize voting power to the most dedicated users with a strong reputation.</p><p>Additionally, SBTs can improve the integrity of DAO voting, defending it in particular against Sybil attacks, where an individual or a group of bad actors take over a DAO by purchasing the majority of governance tokens. This way, voting proposals can be manipulated, and the project’s direction can be influenced by those with majority voting power. The public and verifiable nature of SBTs can help distinguish and prevent bad actors from entering the DAO and, therefore, halt corruption and Sybil attacks from taking&nbsp;place.</p> SBTs’ possible use&nbsp;cases <p>SBTs have a broad spectrum of possible usage in everyday life; a few examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Education records: certification as proof of completion of the required courses. A university could issue SBTs storing the credentials and confirming the relevant qualifications and university membership to graduated students.  Credit history: SBTs can be used to represent traditional credit reports, allowing lenders to access the borrower’s credit history. As a result, people cannot hide or ignore their obligations.  Job applications: Job applicants can submit SBTs representing their educational credentials and professional certifications provided by universities and past employers.   Which SBTs are&nbsp;active? <p>SBTs are quite new, but there are some already in&nbsp;action:</p>  The <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/BABT?source=header">Binance Account Bound (BAB)</a> is the first SBT issued on the BNB chain by Binance. The BAB token is the credential Binance users get when they have passed the KYC process and has no monetary&nbsp;value.  Pangea, one of Metadium’s partners,<a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadiums-new-partnership-with-pangea-inc-promises-further-expansion-in-the-metaverse-ba29a6a8322c"> launched SBT.PIZZA</a> in collaboration with Yonsei University, a top university in Korea. The project allows Yonsei to issue SBTs to students who satisfy qualifications like attending specific lectures, seminars, or activities.  <p>With SBTs being so new, there is still much to be learned. For now, it seems unlikely they will completely replace the NFT system but they could serve as an alternative to identity&nbsp;control.</p><p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>오늘은 SBT가 무엇인지, 그리고 SBT가 우리의 일상 생활에 어떻게 적용될 수 있는지에 대해 자세히&nbsp;알아보겠습니다.</p> SBT란? <p>Soulbound Token(소울 바운드 토큰), 혹은 SBT는 블록체인 기술을 사용하여 개인의 신원과 자격 증명을 나타내는 공개적으로 검증 가능하고 양도가 불가능한 NFT(Non-Fungible Token)입니다. 이 개념은 2022년에 이더리움의 공동 설립자인 Vitalik Buterin과 FlashBots의 전략 고문 Puja Olhaver, 그리고 정치 경제학자이자 사회 기술자인 E. Glen Weyl이 발표한 &lt;탈중앙화 사회&nbsp;: 웹3의 영혼을 찾아서(Decentralized Society&nbsp;: Finding Web3’s Soul)&gt;라는 논문에서 처음&nbsp;소개되었습니다.</p><p>SBT는 근무 경력, 의료 기록 및 개인 또는 단체에 속하는 모든 정보로 구성될 수 있습니다. SBT가 영구적으로 귀속된 지갑이나 계정은 “Soul(소울)”이라고 불리며, 사람들은 그들의 다양한 삶의 모습을 표현하는 소울 여러 개를 가질 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 자신의 이력서를 위한 “자격증명 소울”과 거래 기록을 위한 “금융 소울”을 가질 수 있으며, 이를 통해 자신의 경험과 이전 활동을 바탕으로 확인 가능한 디지털 웹3 캐릭터를 구축할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>SBT의 가장 두드러지는 특징 중 하나는 한 소울이 소유한 SBT가 다른 개인이나 기관처럼 관계의 상대역인 다른 소울에 의해 발행되거나 증명될 수 있다는 것입니다. 예를 들면, 회사는 직원들에게 SBT를 배포할 수 있고 학교는 특정 과정이나 전공을 이수한 학생들에게 SBT를 발급할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> SBT와 NFT <p>요즘 대부분의 NFT는 디지털 아트 또는 수집품에 대한 소유권 인증서입니다. 사람들은 부와 지위의 상징으로 NFT를 사고, 거래하고, 전시합니다. SBT의 목표는 NFT를 고유하고 양도할 수 없는 토큰, 부 이상의 객체로 변환하는&nbsp;것입니다.</p><p>NFT는 자본과 소유권을, SBT는 개인 또는 기업의 평판을 나타냅니다. SBT는 금전적 가치를 포함하지 않으며 한 번 누군가의 지갑에 분배되면 거래될 수 없습니다. 아래 표에서 SBT와 NFT의 차이점을 확인할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> SBT와 DAO&nbsp;투표 <p>신뢰성은 웹3 산업이 직면한 주요 과제 중 하나입니다. 신뢰할 수 없게 만들어진 시스템에서 어떻게 사람의 평판을 신뢰할 수 있을까요? 금융 분야에서 SBT는 대출자의 은행 계좌 잔액 및 신용 점수를 확인하는 현재 방식과 달리 평판이 대출을 받기 위한 담보 역할을 하는, 누군가의 자격 증명을 나타내는 데 사용될 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>SBT의 또 다른 용도는 탈중앙화 자율 조직(DAO, Decentralized Autonomous Organization) 투표입니다. DAO는 한 유저가 보유한 토큰의 양을 기반으로 하는 현재 거버넌스 모델의 대안으로, 유저와 커뮤니티의 상호 작용에 따라 투표권을 할당하는 SBT를 제공할 수 있습니다. 이 모델은 강력한 평판을 가진 가장 열정적이고 활발한 유저에게 투표권을&nbsp;우선시합니다.</p><p>또한 SBT는 DAO 투표의 무결성을 향상시켜 특히 개인 혹은 위험인물들이 거버넌스 토큰의 대부분을 구매하여 DAO를 인수하는 시빌 공격(Sybil attack)으로부터 DAO를 방어할 수 있습니다. 이러한 공격 방식은 투표 제안서를 조작할 수 있으며 프로젝트의 방향은 다수결 권한을 가진 사람들에 의해 영향을 받을 수 있습니다. SBT의 공개적이고 검증 가능한 특성은 위험인물이 DAO에 진입하는 것을 구별하고 방지하는 데 도움이 될 수 있으며, 부패와 시빌 공격이 발생하는 것을 막을 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> SBT의 사용&nbsp;사례 <p>SBT는 일상 생활에서 광범위하게 사용될 수 있습니다. 몇 가지 예는 아래와&nbsp;같습니다.</p>  교육과정 기록: 필수 과정을 이수했다는 증명. 대학은 졸업한 학생들에게 자격증을 저장하고 관련 자격과 대학 구성원 자격을 확인하는 SBT를 발급할 수&nbsp;있습니다.  신용 기록: SBT는 전통적인 신용 보고서를 나타내는 데 사용될 수 있으며, 대출 기관이 대출자의 신용 기록에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 즉, 사람들은 그들의 법적 의무를 숨기거나 의도적으로 무시할 수&nbsp;없습니다.  입사 지원: 입사 지원자는 대학 및 이전 근무 기업에서 제공한 학력, 전문 자격증을 나타내는 SBT를 제출할 수&nbsp;있습니다.   SBT의 실제 적용&nbsp;사례 <p>SBT는 상당히 새롭지만 이미 사용 중인 경우도&nbsp;있습니다.</p>  <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/BABT?source=header">Binance Account Bound (BAB)</a>는 Binance가 BNB 체인에서 발행한 최초의 SBT입니다. BAB 토큰은 Binance 사용자가 KYC 프로세스를 통과했을 때 받는 자격 증명이며 금전적 가치가&nbsp;없습니다.  메타디움의 파트너 중 하나인 판게아는 국내 최고 대학인 연세대학교와 협업하여 <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadiums-new-partnership-with-pangea-inc-promises-further-expansion-in-the-metaverse-ba29a6a8322c">SBT.PIZZA</a>를 출시했습니다. 이 프로젝트는 연세대학교가 특정 강의, 세미나 또는 활동에 참석하는 등 일정 자격을 갖춘 학생들에게 SBT를 발급할 수 있도록&nbsp;합니다.  <p>SBT는 완전히 새로운 개념이기 때문에 아직 배울 것이 많습니다. 현재로서는 SBT가 NFT 시스템을 완전히 대체할 것 같지 않아보여도, 신원 제어의 대안으로 작용할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> Sources:   <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-soulbound-tokens-sbt">What Are Soulbound Tokens (SBT)? | Binance&nbsp;Academy</a>  <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-soulbound-tokens-building-blocks-for-a-web3-decentralized-society">What are Soulbound Tokens?

				 <p>The Indicio Network Consortium is a community for advancing decentralized identity technology through enterprise blockchain. Here’s how it delivers value to its members—and why you should join!</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By France Donegan-Ryan</p>
<p>Indicio is building a community for organizations and businesses who want to be the leaders in the Enterprise Blockchain Community —and we want you to be a part of it. The Indicio Network Consortium is open to all, and there are many benefits to joining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is community important?</p>
<p>Community is a fast growing and strategic initiative for companies, and, contrary to what you might think, it’s not just a strategy for the big B2C brands, it’s an increasingly important strategy&nbsp; for B2B and startup organizations as well. In fact, nearly <a href="https://cmxhub.com/community-industry-report/">80% of founders</a> reported building a community of users as important to their business with 28% describing it as critical to their success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Communities play a vital role in building customer loyalty, driving brand evangelism, and delivering customer satisfaction. A <a href="https://peerboard.com/resources/online-community-statistics">2021 survey</a> found that 84% of companies that worked to improve their customer experience through community programs reported an increase in revenue. The same survey also revealed that customer-centric companies with branded online communities are 60% more profitable than companies that don’t focus on their customers.</p>
<p>Successful and supportive communities are built with the needs and wants of members at the forefront of their mission. When we were designing the Indicio Network Consortium we worked closely with customers, industry leaders, and community management data to create a meaningful program. We found that people, most of all, wanted to have a platform or space to connect with others with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the Indicio Network Consortium?</p>
<p>Consortium members can be Node Operators, Transaction Endorsers, or both. Node Operators support the Indicio Network by volunteering to run a copy of the Indicio ledger on a server that is under their authority. Each copy of the ledger is a node on the network, and multiple copies of the ledger distributed across multiple nodes and geographical locations forms a decentralized network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consortium members can also be Transaction Endorsers, which means taking on the process&nbsp; of approving writes to the network by other companies and organizations according to network governance rules. Node Operators can also be Transaction Endorsers, but only Node Operators can serve as Trustees for the Indicio Network, ensuring that the network meets its mission parameters.</p>
<p>Consortium benefits</p>
<p>There is no fee to become a Consortium Node Operator. Once approved you receive complementary decentralized identity and business training, professional technical support in operating your node, and have access to promotional opportunities provided via Indicio media channels and events. Also, there is a dedicated Slack space for all members to ask questions, get updates, and network. You’ll receive regular technical and community updates and have the chance to attend quarterly summits. Through these community activities you’ll have opportunities to build mutually beneficial relationships with peers, share how your business is using decentralization technology, learn from others, and highlight your progress and achievements.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>All Node Operators are eligible to apply to be a Transaction Endorsers on the Indicio MainNet, or you can sign up directly and not operate a node. Being a Transaction Endorser provides you with additional revenue opportunities for your decentralized identity business model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several Transaction Endorser ledger write (e.g., DIDs, schema, credential definition etc.) packages you can choose from. Additionally, if you’re a Node Operator you receive a 25% discount:</p>
<p>Unlimited ledger writes&nbsp;</p>
<p>$5000 on time fee | $3750 with Node Operator discount</p>
<p>100 ledger writes and unlimited recovations&nbsp;</p>
<p>$995 annually | $746 with Node Operator discount</p>
<p>Make your life easier with the Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">Transaction Endorser Wizard</a>!&nbsp;</p>
<p>$5000 one time fee | $3750 with the Node Operator discount</p>
<p>Consortium goals</p>
<p>We want the consortium to be a catalyst for business growth and for decentralized identity technology to reach new audiences. To do this, we will ensure there are regular opportunities to learn about what’s happening in the space, to hear from Indicio engineers and executives about technical and business developments, and to share in technical advancements that benefit us all.</p>

<p>User account access is a foundational form of cybersecurity, addressing both internal and external threats.</p>
<p>How does Privileged Access Management (PAM) aid security? PAM centralizes privileged data access control to support protection against unauthorized access.</p>
 What Is Privileged Access Management? 
<p>Privileged Access Management is a set of technologies and processes to control and monitor access to privileged accounts that control or touch sensitive or mission-critical data. These accounts will have “elevated” privileges or more access to information or processes that could, in the wrong hands, represent threats to security and compliance.</p>
<p>Account access is one of the oldest security concerns in computing, due in no small part to the fact that the first line of user security is ensuring strong and effective account access that prevents untrained or malicious users from stumbling on important system information.</p>
 Standard Versus Privileged Account Access 
 
 Standard accounts are non-privileged accounts typically held by everyday users who only need limited system resource access. Standard accounts can be used to access apps like shared files, email, or productivity suites but can’t get into global systems that handle metrics, configuration files, or executable files. 
 Privileged accounts have elevated permissions and access to critical IT systems. These accounts are typically used by admins that need to make changes to core files or systems, including configuration files, databases, or even data used by operating systems. Depending on the type of system, admins can perform various operations like deleting and moving files or installing programs. 
 
<p>PAM is an approach that allows administrators to delineate users and functions and promote system integrity and security. This is especially true for organizations following the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">Principles of Least Privilege</a> (PoLP), which states that users should have minimal access necessary to complete their tasks.</p>
 What Are Common PAM Controls? 
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/password-management/">Password Management</a>: PAM will include controls that protect passwords from attack, require complex passwords, rotate passwords regularly, and use controls to prevent common password attacks. This can consist of centralized <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-management-service/">identity management</a> like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/federated-identity-management/">federated identity</a> or Single Sign-On (SSO) approaches. 
 Access Control: Common forms of control like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can centralize rules to ensure that access to resources is limited to those with a reason, a necessity, or clearance to do so. 
 Auditing and Monitoring: PAM solutions will provide auditing capabilities that enable organizations to demonstrate compliance with regulations, policies, and security guidelines. This includes monitoring user account activity and maintaining reports of those activities for predictive security or forensic purposes. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Implementing PAM? 
<p>Perimeter security isn’t just about protecting a system from external threats. Internal security typically involves perimeter protection around different resources. This is particularly true in zero-trust systems where no user is inherently trusted and must be re-authorized at every access point. PAM is the very foundation of navigating these approaches to security.</p>
<p>Organizations use PAM for various reasons, including:</p>
 
 Reducing Attack Surfaces: PAM solutions will typically use heightened authorization and authentication measures (multi-factor authentication, biometrics, etc.) for privileged accounts. Since these accounts are often targets of attacks, then this approach helps focus security on critical system access. 
 Compliance: Many regulatory frameworks require specific control over private or sensitive data access. PAM is a critical component in meeting these compliance requirements. 
 Principle of Least Privilege: There is only one way to effectively implement PoLP, and that’s clearly understanding and managing privileges accounts and access controls within a system. As such, if you expect to leverage least privilege as a security priority, PAM is necessary. 
 Auditing: Part of a PAM system is using audit logs to determine which user accounts can access privileged information and how they do it. Not only are audit logs critical for security in general, but reviewing logs can help security determine if a threat is imminent–for example if odd behavior from a privileged account suggests that it has been compromised. 
 
 What Are the Challenges of Implementing Privileged Access Management? 
<p>Implementing a PAM system can be a complex process. The combination of data flows, applications, and users makes proper account management a challenge.</p>
<p>Some of the common challenges of implementing a PAM system include:</p>
 
 Integration: If you have existing authentication and security systems in place (like logging systems, SIEM solutions, account management software, etc.), then additional PAM controls must be integrated in a way that doesn’t disrupt any workflows or overall system integrity. 
 Applications and Environments: Many businesses use different environments spread across cloud systems and providers. PAM solutions must support different protocols and access methods to remain effective in complex IT environments. 
 Usability: PAM policies, improperly implemented, can also impact user productivity and experience, leading to frustration and resistance among users. 
 Compliance: Not all access policies are created equal. It’s integral that PAM policies meet compliance requirements, especially if your operations fall under different jurisdictions. 
 
 Is Privileged Access Management the Same as Identity and Access Management (IAM)? 
<p>While these two security approaches may overlap in practice, they are two distinct practices in user security. IAM and PAM are related, but they differ in their scope and applicability to different user accounts.</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-iam/">IAM</a> provides centralized user management services. These solutions are used to manage access to non-privileged accounts within an organization. 
 PAM, on the other hand, is focused on managing access to privileged accounts–that means administrator, IT, or executive accounts. 
 
 Support Your PAM Infrastructure with 1Kosmos 
<p>Integration is a major issue with PAM systems. You need an authentication system that works with principles of least privilege while maintaining strict security and usability for employees. That means strong biometrics bound to the privilaged user,, decentralized user management, and a consistent user authentication experience regardless of risk. .</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you get these benefits, along with the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.

<p>#BendNotBreak</p><p>In this series of 4 blogs we will explore the emerging work that we are undertaking in partnership with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a>. The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. A major component of this journey is to identify innovative individuals and organisations who are working in this space. For Laudes, building and supporting a community of changemakers who are working to achieve outcomes such as fair work and green, affordable housing is a critical element of the transition ahead. We hope that these first thoughts will prompt discussions and questions and we would welcome your views and critiques. Please do get in touch if you would like to contribute.</p> Blog 1 (of 4): Considering the fundamental ecological, physical and social constraints of the Built Environment  Applying a new conceptual filter to old challenges <p>The reality is a kaleidoscope of upstream factors and if we fail to address a single one then there is a real danger that we fail at everything.</p><p>If you are reading this blog then you almost certainly understand how to think in terms of systems. Ideas such as looking upstream of the crises to identify root causes and the interconnected nature of the world’s wicked problems will be familiar. You probably have a particular area of interest or expertise. You might be working on education because you sense that if we could encourage a new generation of systems thinkers then our future would be transformed. Or you might be certain that the core problem is the embedded growth obligation of our economic system. Perhaps your focus is on biodiversity and preserving life’s ecosystems, because without these the economy and education are both meaningless. In these (and many other) convictions we would agree. Each is arguably ‘the’ underlying cause and each requires a response. The reality is a kaleidoscope of upstream factors and if we fail to address a single one then there is a real danger that we fail at everything. Following this logic, it seems that we need an ecology of responses rather than multiple upstream solutions.</p><p>This kind of framing can make us feel individually powerless but if we can allow ourselves to lean into the uncertainty and complexity of what is unfolding, then new opportunities surface. An alternative frame is to shift our focus from trying to enact solutions (for example, a Europe wide retrofit rollout or building a certain number of green homes) and to think instead about the dominant forces that are acting on the sector. What do these trends mean in terms of the constraints we must operate within and around? An obvious example is the current spike in electricity prices which is putting enormous pressure on household budgets. If prices are set to rise into the future, will it even be viable to achieve our current comfort levels of heating and cooling by electrifying the existing infrastructure? Even if energy prices fall, existing global mineral reserves are insufficient to manufacture even one generation of renewable technology units (EV’s, H-cells, batteries, wind turbines and solar panels)¹.</p><p>With this in mind, we would like to propose a conceptual tool to help think through the constraints and identify strategies that could help to navigate them. Imagine an image filter that you apply to a familiar landscape. The basic features are unchanged, but the perception is altered so that some objects are in sharper relief and others are hardly visible. Or perhaps like the artist<a href="https://www.oliverjeffers.com/maps-and-globes"> Oliver Jeffers</a>, you turn the image (and the political motivations behind it) on its head to expose a different story. What do you notice that you didn’t consider before? If this type of perspective shift related to the operating space in which you work rather than to a nondescript image, how would you respond? Would it feel exciting, threatening, opaque or simply more than you have time for this&nbsp;week?</p>Oliver Jeffers — This way up, 2018 [oliverjeffers.com]<p>We, like many of you, have considered the cascading and multiplying threats of the 21st Century across many aspects of our work. After a wide review of the literature and some spirited dialogues (both internal and external) we have narrowed these trends down to four bottleneck filters; factors that we consider to be the most significant in analysing the constraints of Europe’s built environment decarbonisation challenge. These filters are intended as thought prompts rather than definitive conclusions and we are curious to hear how they sit with you. Do any of them intuitively ring true or do you think we are missing some fundamental elements? Is this kind of framing useful or do you view it as an unnecessary distraction?</p> The constraints: 4 bottlenecks that will shape the future of Europe’s built environment <p>The scope and scale of the transition ahead is unprecedented in terms of the human, physical and financial resources that will be required. In the EU, it is estimated that retrofitting the existing building stock will demand an estimated EUR 275 billion of additional investments per year to achieve EU climate targets by 2030². Despite the scale of this requirement, raising and managing this level of financial investment will only be part of the challenge.</p><p>We would therefore like to invite you to think about four additional constraints and how they apply to the work you are doing at the moment. How might they shape the strategies, design options and pathways that you think will be optimal for the transition of the built environment? What are you doing already that recognises and addresses these converging limitations? What might you need to lean further into or away&nbsp;from?</p><p>1. Labour constraints</p><p>Labour shortages combined with an insufficiently skilled and ageing workforce, means that resourcing sustainable building activities (for both modernisation and construction) is already a major problem for the building sector³. If we don’t make this sector more engaging and inclusive, we will simply not attract the volume or quality of labour required. This dynamic will be further complicated by migration patterns that will not necessarily correlate to labour needs (in timeframe or geographical spread). Climate and war refugees will not neatly arrive in areas earmarked for planned renovations or green building programmes. Even if they did, there will be other escalating labour priorities such as providing care or improving food security. As these pressures intensify it is likely that the allocation of labour to building renovation versus other critical missions will become a significant strategic issue.</p><p>To add fuel to the fire, across much of Europe, the shift from rural to urban areas is intensifying (in Romania and Slovenia for example the vacancy rate of dwellings in rural areas exceeds 20%⁴). If these and other transitioning geographies around the world continue to urbanise using modern technologies, then the pressures on carbon, material and energy budgets will be far greater than currently estimated.</p><p>2. The energy&nbsp;crisis</p><p>The labour constraints above will be further accentuated by a reduction in the so-called ‘fossil workers’ who have boosted our productivity over the last century. Globally we currently use around 100 million barrels of oil per day (c. 36 billion barrels per year) but this resource is becoming harder and more expensive to obtain, even if we put aside the carbon considerations. To put this into perspective, one barrel of oil is equivalent to the amount of physical labour that a human can produce in 4.5 years⁵. The annual consumption of around 8 billion humans is therefore 4.5 barrels per person (36bn barrels divided by 8bn humans) which equates to 20 years of equivalent human labour per person (4.5 barrels * 4.5 years = 20 years). This is an extraordinary statistic that has profound implications for our future living standards.</p><p>The renewable energy sector is growing rapidly but still only represents around 11% of global energy consumption⁶. Since 2000, the use of electricity by the building sector has increased almost five times faster than the corresponding improvements in the decarbonisation of the electricity generation⁷. Unless we shrink other areas of the economy the additional energy requirements of building decarbonisation may not even be possible within our current economic&nbsp;system.</p><p>3. The material&nbsp;crisis</p><p>This brings us onto the material crisis where energy shortages will collide with a requirement to power the mining of staggering quantities of additional materials. Take copper for example, which is an essential component for retrofitting⁸. Prior to 2020, humanity mined 700 million tons of copper back to 4,000 BC, but to keep up with current copper demand (excluding additional requirements from decarbonisation or electrification) we will need to mine that volume in the next 22 years i.e. we will compress 6,000 years of extraction into just&nbsp;22⁹.</p><p>Threaded through this bottleneck are geopolitical tensions that will almost certainly further intensify material resource pressures. Turkey for example, currently sources 35% of its aluminium (which is a critical building material) from Russia¹⁰. Other minerals used in construction (for example nickel as a component of stainless steel) are starting to be extracted from the deep sea beds of the global ocean. Here too tensions are rising as the frontiers of extraction expand, with China holding more contracts issued by the <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/11/geopolitics-deep-sea-mining-and-green-technologies">International Seabed Authority</a> than any other&nbsp;country.</p><p>4. Ecological dynamics</p><p>In 2021, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957292/Dasgupta_Review_-_Abridged_Version.pdf">Dasgupta review</a> on the economics of biodiversity was commissioned by the UK Treasury and concluded that ‘we are currently damaging it [the natural world] so profoundly that many of its natural systems are now on the verge of breakdown’. Declining biodiversity levels are a tragedy in their own right but without careful management will also limit the availability of biomaterials for green building technologies. Added to this are the intensifying severe weather patterns that will require huge improvements in the resilience of buildings, thus putting further pressure on natural stocks. If we aspire to reconfigure the built environment using green materials we must first reconceive the relationship between our buildings and living resources such as timber. Imagine a future where the shape and quantity of our buildings must be defined by the regenerative potential of our forests, rather than the other way&nbsp;around.</p><p>To put the above into context of the built environment, we did some rough calculations based on the global 96% carbon emission reduction requirement to stay within planetary boundaries and a per capita allocation of that budget per country¹¹. Our assumptions were also based on the current allocations of carbon to the construction industry in Europe (39% overall and 11% to pure construction) and an average emission figure of c.50 tonnes of carbon per new build. Using these high level figures, we estimate that the maximum number of houses that can be built within the carbon budget per year, would be around 176,000 for the whole of Europe and just 15,000 for the UK. To be clear, this is before we consider climate reparation budgets which will further restrict that number. In the context of 700,000 people being reported homeless per day in Europe¹² and an annual target of 400,000 new homes to be built in Germany alone, these numbers are shocking.</p> Strategies and design options: flipping our perspective to meet the future&nbsp;halfway <a href="https://uia-initiative.eu/en/uia-cities/lyon-metropole">Home Silk Road Project,</a> Lyon [Urban Innovative Actions]<p>Building on the bottlenecks above we have been thinking through strategies that are either implied or invited by these constraints. This is our equivalent of drawing the map upside down and re-evaluating how to navigate the changing landscape. There are many possibilities; some are already being used to triage existing issues, some are quietly coalescing to power the next generation of responses, some are still conceptual. The following prompts summarise the strategic design principles that we have been thinking&nbsp;about:</p><p>Consider a no (or low) build future for Europe: There is no question that people need safe, green homes but can we realistically and ethically plan to build and renovate them with resource and energy pressures escalating? If we can’t build the required homes then we will need to intensify our use of the existing building stock. This could include a radical repurposing of Europe’s vacant buildings (including the 16% of homes that are currently unoccupied¹³) and reconfiguring how we equitably share&nbsp;space.</p><p>Embrace low-tech dematerialisation: If we can’t mine or recycle the materials needed we will simply need to use less of them. Some of these resource savings may come from technological improvements, but we can also look at strategies that simplify our lifestyles? Do we really need to keep our houses at 20 degrees year round? Could we instead move to zonal heating where areas of the building are subdivided into smaller compartments for heating according to seasons? For example, it might be possible to think about radiant heating panels for targeted heat requirements such as over a work&nbsp;desk.</p><p>Think upstream of the solutions as well of the problems: We might think of plentiful materials with low levels of embodied carbon as providing uncontroversial solutions, but what if we widen the boundary of our risk assessments? For example, bamboo is considered to be a low-carbon material with strong mechanical qualities, but without careful management bamboo invasion can negatively impact native plant diversity¹⁴. Seeking multiple perspectives on any response being proposed will be essential if we are to prevent today’s solutions from becoming tomorrow’s escalation pathways.</p><p>Embed a culture of care: The working conditions and social status of those who are currently working in the industry is worrying. In 2020, more than 20% of fatal work accidents in the EU occurred within the construction industry¹⁵. In the UK, the <a href="https://www.ciob.org/industry/research/Understanding-Mental-Health-Built-Environment#:~:text=Mental%20ill%2Dhealth%20is%20a,professionals%20their%20thoughts%20and%20experiences.">Chartered Institute of Building </a>has recently reported that ‘Mental ill-health is a silent crisis within the construction industry’, with male construction workers three times more likely to die from suicide than the national average. These are deeply disturbing statistics on a human level that fuel the subliminal narratives that percolate into every decision. How can we expect a worker appraising a development project to meaningfully embrace wellbeing outcomes, when their lived reality of achieving financial targets is in such stark contrast?</p><p>Re-common housing as a universal basic service: Since the 2008 financial crisis investor-owned housing in Europe has increased by 700 percent¹⁶. On average across Europe 18% of dwellings are overcrowded, 35% are under occupied¹⁷ and 16% are not occupied at all¹⁸. The situation is so absurd that a group of activists in Brussels have created an entirely fictional district (<a href="https://www.leegbeek.brussels/">Saint-Vide-Leegbeek</a>) to highlight the 6.5m m2 and 30,000 units of empty properties in the city alone. Housing cannot legitimately remain subject to price speculation and wealth protection in a fair and sustainable future. How could the narrative of housing as an asset (together with the financial practices around it) be reframed, to spark a wide-scale public debate about what housing means in a resource constrained future?</p><p>Ignite imaginative thinking: What if an alternative resource-light architecture is predominantly constrained by a failure of our collective imagination rather than by a lack of viable alternatives? After Covid restrictions were lifted in Europe, many people expressed their wish not to return to their old patterns of living and working. This is obviously a dramatic example but does highlight the power of people viscerally experiencing alternative ways of living, in terms of shifting value perceptions. This is an idea being playful explored by the <a href="https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/index_en">New European Bauhaus</a> which invites Europe’s citizens to co-create a ‘sustainable and inclusive future that is beautiful for our eyes, minds, and&nbsp;souls’.</p><p>Build the politics of transition: Many of the required strategies and capabilities will not be politically acceptable at present but everyday politics will be a powerful driver in meeting the future halfway. How for example would our responses differ if citizens felt empowered to shape and design their own futures? Would residents of a district or city accept skyrocketing levels of inequality and homelessness if they felt there were realistic alternatives? How would working conditions change if organisations agreed to operate under a revocable social licence, that was periodically audited by a random selection of local stakeholders?</p><p>Move on from impossible: If the transitions we were expecting are moving further out of reach then we must stop chasing the impossible and think about responding to the difficult. Taking retrofit as an example, if the materials and energy will not be available to insulate the entirety of Europe’s housing stock, then perhaps we can also create houses within houses using tent-like removable heat capture. Similarly, if we cannot mine the minerals of choice to power our heat pumps, then we will need to start investing in alternative battery technologies powered by plentiful elements such as sodium and fluoride.</p><p>Strategies Xn&nbsp;: Whilst we are happy to share our thinking, we feel strongly that our work will only be robust and meaningful if we begin building on it in community with Laudes and the wider network of built environment practitioners. This is an evolving area and we are committed to holding time and space within it to hear and support your&nbsp;ideas.</p>Co-Hab Athens [<a href="https://cooperativecity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ozanam-1.jpg">Cooperative City Magazine</a>] Closing thoughts <p>In a collaborative workshop between DML and Laudes in December 2022, we discussed the 4-filter constraint framework described above. One concern that was raised was that inequality seemed to be a fundamental omission. If we are applying the filter of labour then thinking through the inequality implications of any goal or strategy would also seem important. Spiralling inequality is undisputedly a destructive and undesirable dynamic in our current socio-economic system. It should and absolutely must be addressed. However, we see this as a structural constraint of the wider economic system in which the built environment is nested, rather than as a specific barrier to inclusive decarbonisation strategies. We will explore and unpack this distinction in our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Finally, this initiative will be hollow without input from the people working towards these common goals. Our wish is to amplify your voices, to learn from you and critically to take your feedback on board to improve our own work. All thoughts, questions, critiques and suggestions are warmly welcomed.</p><p>The Dark Matter project team who co-authored this blog are Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>), Aleksander Nowak (<a href="mailto:Aleks@darkmatterlabs.org">Aleks@darkmatterlabs.org</a>), Vlad Afanasiev (<a href="mailto:vlad@darkmatterlabs.org">vlad@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) and Indy Johar (<a href="mailto:indy@darkmatterlabs.org">indy@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)</p><p>References:</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.simonmichaux.com/">https://www.simonmichaux.com/</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/renovation-wave_en">https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/renovation-wave_en</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-confronted-with-lack-of-skilled-labour-to-support-building-renovation-wave/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-confronted-with-lack-of-skilled-labour-to-support-building-renovation-wave/</a></p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HM1-1-Housing-stock-and-construction.pdf">https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HM1-1-Housing-stock-and-construction.pdf</a></p><p>[5] This is based on performing 40 hours of physical work per week all year at an average output of 600 watt-hours.

				<p>Trinsic has written extensively on IDtech products and their importance to the future of identity. In this post, we include a brief explanation, but if you would like to dive further, <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-idtech-and-why-does-it-matter/">check out our blog posts</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we talk about IDtech products, we’re talking about applications that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need. These products aren’t necessarily decentralized, though we believe decentralized identity solutions will eventually win because they are better for users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve purposefully not included infrastructure platforms (you’ll note that Trinsic is not on the map), open source libraries, or blockchains on this list. While these things enable the creation of IDtech companies and their products, they are not categorized as IDtech in and of themselves. The reason being is that IDtech refers specifically to products and applications that help consumers manage their identity and data.</p>

				<p>IDtech products are opening a new world of digital experiences for both people and businesses. We believe IDtech is on the verge of breakthrough growth that will be compared to the Fintech boom that brought the means for businesses, both large and small, to provide financial services directly to customers like never before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Trinsic is an IDtech infrastructure company. IDtech companies build on top of Trinsic, so they can spend the majority of their time focused on bringing their product to market instead of building complex, underlying infrastructure. We have chosen to build our infrastructure with decentralized technologies, because as we mentioned above, we feel that decentralized identity (often called SSI) provides the most optimal experience for end users to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The number one factor that will influence the adoption of decentralized identity is amazing IDtech products that users love. IDtech products that solve real problems for users. We are excited to see the continued success of the IDtech products listed in the market map and look forward to the development of many more!</p>

 AyanWorks won “FIDO Developer Challenge 2022 - India: Go Passwordless with FIDO Authentication” <p>We at AyanWorks, have always been moved by challenging ourselves with the complex problems in the Blockchain space, be it exploring &amp; evaluating new stacks, contributing to complex open source projects, taking challenges head on to build solutions for, participating in the hackathons to build solutions with cutting edge technologies. Continuing with this DNA, AyanWorks team participated in the ‘FIDO Developer Challenge 2022 — India’ hackathon event. Theme for this challenge was ‘Go Passwordless with FIDO Authentication’. More details can be <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge-2022-india/">found&nbsp;here</a>.</p><blockquote>We are thrilled to announce that AyanWorks has made it to the top 3 finalists in the challenge. We are honoured to be recognised for our innovative work in the field of digital identity and verifiable credential management (see <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-awards-winner-and-top-finalists-of-developer-challenge-india/">official announcement</a> from FIDO Alliance).</blockquote><p>Demo Day</p><p>The final demo and awards event was held at the Samsung Research Institute in Noida and it provided us with a fantastic opportunity to meet and network with various individuals and developers in the field. It was an great platform for us to showcase our SSI (<a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>) mobile wallet app, powered by <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO Passkeys</a>, which stores user’s credentials securely using advanced cryptography, thus preserving the privacy of the individual and the data in her wallet. As they call — ‘Privacy-by-Design’ and ‘Privacy-by-Default’.</p><p>Our team worked tirelessly to develop the solution that is not only secure but also user-friendly and easy to use, making it accessible to everyone. We believe that <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital decentralised identity</a> and cryptographically signed &amp; digitally verifiable credential management is an important step towards a more secure and reliable internet ecosystem. Our SSI mobile wallet app, implements the authentication method using FIDO Passkeys, provides a solution to some of the most significant challenges faced in the space today, such as security vulnerabilities and data breaches.</p><p>At <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a>, our primary focus has always been on creating innovative solutions that serve the best interests of our clients and users. That’s why we’re proud to say that our SSI mobile wallet app is designed with greater preference to the highest security and user privacy standards, while providing an unparalleled user experience.</p><p>Our recognition as a finalist in the FIDO developer challenge is a true testament to the dedication of our team. We’re thrilled to have had the opportunity to showcase our work on this platform, and we’re grateful to the FIDO Alliance &amp; FIDO India Working Group team for providing us with this opportunity. We’re excited to continue driving positive change in the digital identity space and helping our clients and users navigate the complex digital landscape with confidence.</p><p>Why Passwordless?</p><p>Cybercrime damages the world economy $2.9 million every minute, with 80% of cyberattacks targeting passwords. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has warned that online users in the country are being targeted by phishing scams, which involve an attacker fooling a victim into clicking malicious links in order to steal sensitive data like passwords, login information, and One Time Passwords (OTP). In India, the National Crime Record Bureau reported 4,047 cases of online banking fraud in 2020, with 1,093 of those cases involving OTPs. The recent global epidemic has increased enterprises’ readiness to adopt password-less FIDO Authentication, making it easier to solve than ever before thanks to the rising number of devices supporting FIDO and the availability of a public WebAuthn&nbsp;API.</p><p>To summarise</p><p>At <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a>, we remain committed to delivering innovative <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital identity solutions</a> that meet the needs of our users, while prioritising security and privacy.

While last-gen identity solutions based on passwords, emails, devices, and wallet addresses are still prevalent, people are paying for this convenience with one of their most valuable assets — personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>The emerging Web3 makes the problem of data security and fraud more immediate, but it also provides solutions.</p><p>Decentralized identity systems promise to empower users to verify themselves and conduct online transactions without disclosing their personal information. However, many existing platforms can’t offer a holistic solution that addresses critical aspects like digital identity, interoperability, user data security, compliance, and payments — that’s where Nuggets makes the biggest difference.</p><p><a href="https://nuggets.life/">Nuggets</a> is the only product that enables organizations to comply with regulations whilst maintaining their privacy, guaranteeing data security, and remaining fully decentralized. As a super-wallet, Nuggets also enables multi-rail payments and provides a convenient cache for crypto assets — all tied to a verified decentralized identity.</p><p>Best of all, Nuggets is available globally right&nbsp;now.</p> More power to&nbsp;you <p>Requiring just one-time onboarding during sign-up, Nuggets focuses on providing a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable experience across Web2 and Web3. The solution provides a merit-based reputation and prioritizes protecting users’ data — enabling them to navigate the digital world with confidence and&nbsp;ease.</p><p>By leveraging a combination of Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), auditable nuggets of data, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), peerDIDs, and verifiable credentials, Nuggets has created a state-of-the-art solution that puts privacy and security at the heart of its&nbsp;design.</p><p>Users’ identification is linked to W3C verifiable credentials and ZKP proofs, allowing them to confirm their status without revealing any private information.</p><p>Nuggets is also a fully customizable, ready-to-deploy solution that supports real-world use cases. As such, brands can seamlessly integrate Nuggets into existing infrastructures, compliance processes, payments, and customer experience immediately or offer Nuggets as a standalone identity solution.</p><p>One of the most critical challenges facing Web3 is complying with regulations without requiring users to hand over a litany of personally identifying information to a centralized third party. Until now, there has been no decentralized way for Web3 protocols to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Solving this issue, Nuggets features built-in tools to ensure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and The Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) requirements, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, without compromising decentralization, privacy, or autonomy. Whether you’re an individual, DeFi protocol, exchange, or DAO Nuggets creates a frictionless, secure experience and reduces the risk of cybercrimes while simultaneously ensuring users’ privacy and security and increasing operational efficiency. Nuggets’ self-sovereign identity solution also serves as a critical entry point for DeFi, as it allows users and service providers to operate in a verified, compliant environment.</p> Cultivating a Vibrant Web3 Ecosystem <p>Nuggets’ vision goes beyond creating a cutting-edge identity solution — it is committed to nurturing collaboration and adoption within the Web3 ecosystem. Companies like <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/collab-land-3-5-million-154500218.html">Collab.Land</a> and <a href="https://yieldly.medium.com/yieldly-inks-deal-with-nuggets-to-bring-secure-private-ids-to-ylaunch-platform-3ecd1e3d99c0">Yieldly</a> have already embraced Nuggets’ vision in its pursuit of a safer, more private digital&nbsp;future.</p><p>These partnerships highlight how Nuggets is being harnessed to boost user control, interoperability, compliance and privacy across a wide array of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to Web3 communities.</p><p>Nuggets’ solution has the potential to spark a profound transformation in industries as diverse as e-commerce and healthcare, allowing everyone — people of all ages, backgrounds, and businesses — to benefit from its identity solution.</p><p>By incorporating Nuggets into their systems, companies can simplify onboarding processes, elevate user experiences, and protect sensitive information without compromising on convenience.</p><p>Together, we are building a future where digital identity is private, secure, user-centric, and empowering.</p><p>If you’re looking to enable identity, compliance, or payments, we’d love to work with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Request a demo with Seema at partner@nuggets.life</p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/nuggets-the-only-decentralized-identity-merging-identity-compliance-and-payments-effedd74396b">Nuggets: The Only Decentralized Identity Merging Identity, Compliance, and Payments</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 CircuLaw — using existing laws and regulations to accelerate the transition to a circular&nbsp;economy <p>CircuLaw is an open public service that is aiming to accelerate the circular economy transition by enabling policymakers to make more and better use of existing laws and regulations.</p><p><a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">CircuLaw.nl</a> is a digital platform that presents opportunities within the existing legal and regulatory framework in the Netherlands in an accessible, digestible and ultimately implementable way. Over the past two and a half years, we (Dark Matter Labs) have been working alongside the City of Amsterdam, and various knowledge and funding partners to conduct research, design, develop and launch alpha and beta versions of <a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">CircuLaw.nl</a>. The platform currently enables policymakers to explore opportunities around 3 themes: sustainable timber construction, wind turbines and mattress production chains. More themes will&nbsp;follow.</p>CircuLaw.nl — English&nbsp;page Introductions, and some&nbsp;context <p>CircuLaw builds upon Dm’s work supporting regulatory innovation in <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Legitimacities-Toward-a-network-of-city-based-regulatory-experimentati">Montreal (Canada</a>), Madrid (Spain) and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Civic-City-Exploring-future-regulatory-infrastructure-and-digital">Copenhagen (Denmark</a>). In 2019, we engaged with the City of Amsterdam as part of EIT Climate-KIC’s Deep Demonstrations programme. In Amsterdam, we have an innovative and forward-thinking partner, the city has <a href="https://time.com/5930093/amsterdam-doughnut-economics/">embraced the doughnut economic model</a> and has a relatively large and growing number of staff devoted to innovation and accelerating its <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/policy/sustainability/circular-economy/">circular economy transition.</a></p><p>The Netherlands is aiming for a fully circular economy by 2050. Setting targets is a vital first step, but meeting such targets requires immediate and drastic changes in the way that we produce, build, manufacture and consume. According to the <a href="https://www.circularity-gap.world/2022">Circularity Gap Report (2022)</a> increased material extraction means our economies are becoming even less circular — shockingly, global circularity has shrunk from 9.1% in 2018 to just 7.2% in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Research from the <a href="https://www.pbl.nl/publicaties/integrale-circulaire-economie-rapportage-2023">Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency</a> states that the drastic changes we now need cannot rely only on policy aiming to support and facilitate circularity initiatives of parties that are mainly experimenting, but also if we are serious about reaching circularity goals, then we cannot exclusively focus on making changes in laws and regulations; the public sector must use current regulatory powers much more effectively to compel rapid change across wider&nbsp;society.</p><p>Making and implementing new regulations is time-consuming, so back in late 2019 and early 2020, Amsterdam was already pondering how it could make better use of existing ‘hard’ instruments — the components of its current legal, regulatory or taxation systems — to begin accelerating change. Even among municipalities leading the battle against climate breakdown, these existing hard instruments remain largely underutilised. According to <a href="https://www.royalhaskoningdhv.nl/nl-nl/challenges/duurzaamheid/circulaire-economie#downloadrapports">Royal HaskoningDHV’s 2022 research</a> such directive use of regulations accounts for only 1% of activity.</p>Circular Activities of local and regional authorities (Royal Haskoning, 2022)<p>Having spent almost two and a half years working around policymakers in Amsterdam and the wider Netherlands, we recognise how incoherent the legal and regulatory system can seem. Firstly and fundamentally, pivoting towards a circular future requires the use of a regulatory system that was never developed to drive the transition to a circular economy. For policymakers with circular economy goals, navigating this regulatory system forms a formidable obstacle.</p><p>Accessing and evaluating the relevant information and policy options takes a lot of time and requires expensive legal expertise, so when a return on that investment is uncertain, policymakers are often deterred from exploring possibilities. In instances where legal support is sought, it also tends to be highly specialised, because the different parts of the regulatory system are so fragmented. Even in the rare instances where a legal or regulatory instrument is successfully used to bring about policy change in a municipality or province, information about the outcome tends to remain localised and knowledge is rarely passed on. As a consequence, policymakers across the Netherlands still opt to pursue change via more voluntary agreements (covenants) and innovation subsidies, irrespective of their chances of making the necessary impact. Assertive use of legal and regulatory opportunities remains ‘too damn difficult’, even though we won’t get much further without&nbsp;it.</p> CircuLaw’s solutions <p>In response to this, CircuLaw attempts to piece the fragments together; to make the Dutch regulatory system more easily accessible to its policymakers by quickly directing them towards relevant instruments and information.</p><p>Behind the scenes, we’re analysing existing laws and regulations, extracting relevant instruments and then translating the findings into understandable, readable, shareable, applicable insights; policymakers in all levels of government can use these as starting points for shaping actionable policies.</p><p>By combining this analysis with a breakdown of innovations that did (and didn’t) work, CircuLaw aims to provide an overview of the current systems and practices. To do the legal analysis we created the following replicable methodology:</p> CircuLaw’s methodology for law&nbsp;analysis Methodology for law&nbsp;analysis<p>1. Choosing theme<br>We’re choosing themes or product groups (e.g. wind turbines) based on impact, influence, momentum and existing opportunities.</p><p>2. Researching theme<br>Defining how the chain of the product is put together, understanding who plays a role in this, which circular processes are already in place, etc. This analysis helps us to see which (technical and policy) solutions are already available for some problems and which ones still need to be developed, leading to a set of operational goals.</p><p>3. Demarcating laws<br>Identifying laws and regulations that can help us achieve the operational goals.</p><p>4. Analysing laws<br>We’ve developed an analysis key to thoroughly examine laws and regulations at local, provincial, national and soon also EU level to identify relevant instruments and opportunities.</p><p>5. Ranking opportunities<br>Based on the influence of an instrument in practice and its legal feasibility we rank the instruments.</p><p>6. Translating legal language<br>To be readable and understandable by policymakers without a legal background we present our content without using&nbsp;jargon.</p><p>7. Creating overviews<br>Our overviews allow policymakers to explore findings according to authority level, the way the instruments interrelate or as a filterable list.</p>Different instrument overviews based on authority level, how instruments interrelate and as a filterable list. For the interactive overviews see <a href="http://www.circulaw.nl">circulaw.nl</a> Some things we have learned so&nbsp;far <p>The shift towards a systemic policy focus on the circular transition is only really getting started, though there’s increasing appetite for the work and it’s taking place with a growing sense of urgency across all layers of government in the Netherlands. But when it comes to learning and measuring impacts, there’s still vast terrain left to explore. CircuLaw is among several initiatives working across the Netherlands to accelerate change. It’s still early days, but we’ve been given the space to co-create a flexible, iterative tool to best serve the particular requirements of its end users. Here are a few lessons we’ve learned over the past two and a half&nbsp;years.</p><p>1. We need to be sensitive towards existing policymaking and implementation processes</p><p>When we began working with policymakers in different parts of the municipal organisation, we were aiming to closely witness — and perhaps map — their policymaking processes. Almost immediately, we started to realise the sheer diversity of policymaking and implementation processes. Each policy domain relevant to the circular transition (and there are more than one might imagine) has its own practices and logic; and all policymakers bring their own knowledge, experiences, networks and approaches. Every potential instrument has its own implementation journey requiring expertises scattered across several departments and teams, and this work all takes place within differently structured municipal organisations with their own hierarchies, internal politics and working cultures.</p><p>As a result, policy making is both relational and non-linear, so working out how to help at a generalised level presents a challenge. Top down, one-size-fits-all approaches are doomed to&nbsp;fail.</p>A simplified illustration of the context of a policy maker timber construction — drawing by Yvonne de Meij van Streefkerk (Team CircuLaw)<p>2. We’re focusing on the policymaking frontrunners</p><p>Amsterdam has a team devoted to its circular economy transition, positioning the city at the vanguard amongst global capitals. As our work has expanded across the Netherlands, we’ve opted at this stage to cater to those municipal practitioners prepared to experiment and take greater risks in their policy-making decisions. Some of the approaches and discoveries might not be immediately applicable in a municipality with 0.5 FTE working towards a circular economy, but we’re aiming to establish precedents amongst frontrunners that then show a growing body of evidence to inspire and enable colleagues in organisations with less in-house capacity. By demonstrating and documenting a wide range of cases at the edge of current practice, we hope to create a real shift in what is considered possible within the current rules and regulations in cities across — and beyond — the Netherlands. And we hope it will contribute to a better shared understanding of where actual changes in the law are needed to further accelerate change.</p><p>3. We need to support both replication and innovation</p><p>There’s still plenty of potential for change using the existing regulatory system. Identifying and mapping relevant legal and regulatory instruments around different themes and product groups will begin to increase navigability and coherence, but then successfully utilising those instruments to change outcomes is a different matter. When an existing legal instrument has been implemented, <a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">CircuLaw.nl</a> can provide a step-by-step walkthrough of how change has been achieved, with examples and shared lessons. This approach could stimulate replication and greater uniformity across the Netherlands — critical for shaping e.g. the investments of suppliers of goods and services to the government.</p><p>While there is definite value in documenting previous successes, we also need to establish ways to support policymakers who are looking to do unprecedented things; to give them the tools and confidence to innovate using (existing) legal instruments that might have been previously overlooked or underutilised.</p><p>4. We’ll need help to monitor and measure impact in a complex, adaptive&nbsp;system</p><p>There are so many factors involved in any policy making process that claiming impact or attributing causality can be difficult. At some level we need metrics to establish whether we’re doing the right things, but, however effective, regulatory instruments are only ever a part of the policymaking picture.</p><p>Some impacts of CircuLaw might be relatively straightforward, others might take ten years to take full effect. It’s never going to be as simple as measuring the increase in % of instruments used, because a single instrument might account for repeated change. So we’re exploring the best way of working with the City of Amsterdam’s Monitoring team to look at material flows, such as concrete or food, to establish what would be most useful to&nbsp;measure.</p><p>CircuLaw is also about increasing shared awareness about possibilities in law and regulation. We’ve already seen an example of a circular economy team hiring a legal policy expert, recognising it’s important to have this knowledge within their team, or hearing people say, “OK, we’ve seen what you are doing, we are going to see how we can work more like that”. This shows the kind of early impact that can lead to later successes, and any measurements of impact will have to be a mixture of qualitative and quantitative findings.</p><p>5. The value of working in an ecosystem</p><p>In co-creating CircuLaw, we’re working in an expanding ecosystem. We’re not just developing ideas internally and then encouraging their adoption within a municipality. Instead we’re forming a team between organisations. The collaboration started between Dm and the city of Amsterdam, but has now expanded to include a variety of public institutions, legal experts and funding partners from across the Netherlands. Together, we’re developing a platform and testing ideas with and for experienced policymakers.</p><p>As a small organisation Dark Matter Labs is able to move with greater agility than a large municipality, but developing CircuLaw requires a range of expertise and experiences. Dm brings strategic designers, system thinkers, developers, visual designers and user experience designers, and CircuLaw requires us to orchestrate an ecosystem of people with deeper policymaking expertise, greater experience of governmental operations, legal expertise and context-related circular economy knowledge.</p><p>We’re still thinking uncompromisingly about what needs to happen, and how it might be possible, but alongside policymakers who’ll work with it every day because if CircuLaw is to have any impact then it needs to be&nbsp;used.</p><p>6. Public tech has to be created with and for&nbsp;humans</p><p>While we began this blog by stating that more assertive approaches are required — top-down, government-led public tech projects cannot expect to be fully embraced. Successful public tech needs to recognise human experience in all of its messiness. While this might occasionally require non-linear co-creation processes, it will ultimately result in products that better reflect the end users’ reality. By entering a process of consistent user testing and iteration, we’ve not only developed a clearer understanding of how policymakers approach their work, but also the transition their work is having to&nbsp;undergo.</p> Next Steps <p>So far, we’ve co-created a small, manageable platform, but to demonstrate viability beyond the Netherlands, CircuLaw will need to cover many more themes, incorporate wider legislation (e.g. EU), and develop a more sophisticated taxonomy of relevant legal instruments. Our ambition is to pass the hosting and running of CircuLaw to a national organisation by the end of 2024, but before that’s possible, there’s still lots of work to be&nbsp;done.</p><p>1. A continuous dialogue with Dutch policymakers</p><p>In order to make CircuLaw part of the Netherlands’ wider circular economy policy landscape we’re collaborating with a community of practice to better understand how policymakers go about their work, to help more fully recognise the practical barriers that policymakers tend to run into when attempting to use instruments, and to create an avenue for feedback. From this we’re looking to establish whether policymakers want extra information, whether they want courses, or workshops or templates to give them increased confidence when navigating the legal and regulatory system.</p><p>2. More themes in more&nbsp;places</p><p>Amsterdam provided a very suitable environment to initiate the CircuLaw platform, but to stand any chance of accelerating the wider circular economy, CircuLaw needs to exist beyond the confines of a single municipality or country. A lot of the regulation currently on the platform also applies to the wider Netherlands but the next step is to begin incorporating EU Law. We’ve already authored <a href="https://openresearch.amsterdam/nl/page/90992/europese-wet--en-regelgeving-circulaire-economie">three white papers</a> on this subject. We’re currently exploring food, solar panels and other product groups as additional themes.</p><p>3. Maintaining the CircuLaw&nbsp;platform</p><p>While we’re still testing and continuously improving the platform, we can be highly responsive in adapting the design and implementing required changes. Once more fully embedded, CircuLaw will require regular maintenance in order to expand thematically, ensure that information is kept up to date, and allow users to submit feedback and access support when required. In order to remain open and accessible to public sector users and other circular economy actors, we imagine the type of organisation that would host CircuLaw for the long term needs to maintain a non-commercial model, and without a&nbsp;paywall.</p><p>4. Improving the methodology and its execution</p><p>The current execution of the legal analysis methodology requires time and capacity; it’s human endeavour. No doubt much of this will always remain the case; but for the CircuLaw approach to be replicable, scalable and easy to update we’re looking to see what parts of this methodology could be done in more efficient ways; we are hoping to explore possibilities in AI and Natural Language Processing to improve and accelerate legal analysis and translation capabilities, alongside the more creative research&nbsp;work.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you’d like to know more, or have suggestions, questions or thoughts then get in touch with <a href="mailto:Romy@darkmatterlabs.org">Romy@darkmatterlabs.org</a> — as this project is part of a collective endeavour to accelerate the transition to a more circular economy (and to transitioning to a just, regenerative economy more in general), we are keen to hear any feedback that can help us and others learn to achieve these goals together.</p><p>The current platform is mostly in Dutch, but we’re working on translating it into English.

     <p>For consumers, organizations and companies alike, the topic of digital security has become increasingly paramount in recent years, especially with the rise of digital fraud and scams. With this in mind, Allan Foster’s upcoming session, “Does Trust Matter?” at the <a>IdentityNorth 2023 Spring Symposium</a> is generating significant interest.</p>
<p>As a retired identity and digital security professional with a career spanning 40 years leading and guiding teams at Apple, Netscape, AOL, Guru Associates, Microsoft, Intel and Sun Microsystems, Foster has an extensive background in the field. He most recently served as the Vice President of Global Partner Success at ForgeRock, a leading provider of digital identity solutions. His wealth of knowledge and experience make him well-equipped to discuss the key trends and tactics impacting the digital environment on a global scale.</p>
<p>One of the main issues Foster will address at the <a>virtual two-day event</a> is the importance of securing digital identities. As more people conduct business and social activities online, it is becoming more crucial to protect against scams and social engineering. This is especially true in Canada, where digital fraud is on the rise. Foster will provide insights into the tactics and technologies that can be used to protect consumers and organizations in this critical time.</p>
<p>Additionally, Foster will also delve into the darker side of identity. As he has noted in the past, “One of the problems of identity is that it has a very dark side in as much as it enables authoritarianism.” This statement underscores the importance of understanding the complexities of digital identity and the need for responsible practices.</p>
<p>Foster’s session is <a>just one of the many compelling presentations</a> being offered at the symposium and the event as a whole promises to be an engaging and informative learning and networking opportunity for digital security professionals &amp; experts and anyone interested in digital security and identity.</p>
<p>Attendees can expect to gain valuable insights into the current state of digital security, as well as practical strategies for protecting their businesses, and personal digital properties and platforms against fraud and scams. In addition to Allan Foster’s session, there is a full stream during the Spring Symposium dedicated to Safeguarding Digital Infrastructure/Cybersecurity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/2023-spring-symposium-registration-474869566657">Register for the IdentityNORTH Spring Symposium</a> to hear Allan Foster and other Canadian and international leaders driving Canada’s digital future.</p>

 Why Trade&nbsp;Crypto? <p>While there are many reasons that people become interested in trading cryptocurrencies, the following are three main reasons that attract investors:</p>  portfolio diversification from traditional financial assets  high volatility opportunities  around-the-clock 🕚 24/7 trading activity.  <p>Algorithmic trading can help you stay solvent in this non-stop financial market. Why? Because algorithms can trade at all times, even while you are sleeping! 😴 To start your algorithmic trading journey, we offer you a momentum strategy using the Simple Moving Average (SMA). We will also introduce Ocean Protocol, an open-source data sharing ecosystem of tools that can allow traders to sell the output price predictions of their algorithms!</p>Figure 1. Golden and Death Cross technical indicators are shown on a time series chart of BTCUSD&nbsp;prices. What are Golden &amp; Death&nbsp;Crosses? <p>What does SMA have to do with golden and death crosses in trading? What are they? A golden cross is a bullish indicator that happens when the SMA 50 crosses above the SMA 200. Why is that bullish? <a href="https://emojipedia.org/ox/">🐂</a> Because the SMA 50 moves faster relative to recent price changes than the SMA 200, so this cross shows that the latest prices are moving upward. 📈 The opposite case, when the SMA 50 moves below the SMA 200, is a death cross and is a bearish indicator 🧸 that indicates a downward trend in the latest prices.&nbsp;📉</p><p>Golden and Death crosses are shown in Fig&nbsp;1.</p> The Simple Moving Average Explained Simply!&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/teacher/">🧑‍🏫</a> <p>So how is the SMA calculated? SMA is the average of a time series of prices in a window of a fixed length. The technique is called “moving” because the window slides in accordance with the time series. A time window of 200 days is typically used for computing the “historical trend” and a window of 50 days is used to compute the “current trend” in golden/death cross strategies. Of course, it is possible to form a golden or death cross interpretation on different SMA indicators, such as the SMA 5 versus the SMA 20 for higher frequency trading decisions for example. In this tutorial, however, we will stick with the traditional SMA 50 and 200 day indicators. We’ll show you how this works in the code&nbsp;below!</p> Let’s Trade! <p>Using the SMA 50 &amp; 200 day indicators, we show you a quick algorithm to detect that glorious Golden cross buying signal 💰 and ominous Death cross selling signal 💀. Check it out&nbsp;below:</p> <br># Get 201 days of data<br>eth = get_ethereum_201_days_data()<br><br># Use 200 days to compute SMAs from the day before<br>sma_day_before_200 = sum(eth[:200]) / len(eth[:200])<br>sma_day_before_50 = sum(eth[:50]) / len(eth[:50])<br><br># Use 200 days to compute SMAs from the current day<br>sma_current_day_200 = sum(eth[1:]) / len(eth[1:])<br>sma_current_day_50 = sum(eth[1:]) / len(eth[1:])<br><br># Detect Cross<br>day_before_diff = sma_day_before_50 - sma_day_before_200<br>current_day_diff = sma_current_day_50 - sma_current_day_200<br><br># Golden Cross<br>if day_before_diff &lt; 0 and current_day_diff &gt; 0:<br> advice “buy”<br># Death Cross<br>else if day_before_diff &gt; 0 and current_day_diff &lt; 0:<br> advice “sell”<br># No Cross<br>else:<br> advice “do nothing”  On Maximizing Profit <p>Did you know that you can tune the window length for the SMA calculation to optimize your&nbsp;profits?</p><p>We show you how to do a grid search using different SMA time windows over the last 6 years of historical ETH data to find optimal buying and selling points. This way, we select the time window with the highest returns for the trading strategy.</p><p>The Grid Search Algorithm:</p>  Select multiple combinations of time windows to compute historical and current trends. The historical trend window should range from 10 to 210 days with a step of 10 days, while the current trend window should range from 5 to 50 days with a step of 5&nbsp;days.  Perform the trading strategy for each combination. Simulate transactions for a year, from January to December, at the beginning of which the trading return and investment are zero. Execute purchases and sells during the year based on the algorithm signals, and calculate the return on the last day of December for each&nbsp;year.  Obtain a return value for each combination of time window. Analyze the results by averaging the returns per year and per window combination to determine which window size combination consistently yields the highest returns across&nbsp;years.  <p>The colorful Figure 2 below shows all the different time windows we tried in our grid search for trading over 6 years. The brighter the color, the higher the percentage of total return. And guess what? We found out that the sweet spot for computing the current trend is between 10 and 20 days, while for historical trend it’s between 30 and 50 days. Time to put our findings to good use and capitalize on&nbsp;them!</p>Figure 2. Percentage return of trading with given different SMA window combinations. Monetizing Your Asset with Ocean Protocol&nbsp;🌊 <p>Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem of open-source tools that share datasets and algorithms on the blockchain. 🐙🐬 In this tutorial, we’ll publish our algorithm as an NFT with metadata on the blockchain and a corresponding “datatoken” to gate access to the&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>Learn more about Ocean Protocol in the <a href="https://www.oceanacademy.io/">Ocean&nbsp;Academy</a>.</p> Minting an algorithm “dataNFT” <p>It’s trivial to mint your trading strategy algorithm on the blockchain as a “dataNFT’’ using Ocean Protocol’s Python library, ocean-lib! At the same time we mint the NFT, ocean-lib will also create a datatoken that controls access to this NFT. We’ll be able to sell copies of this datatoken on the blockchain to immediately monetize our algorithm!</p><p>First, we pip install the Ocean Python&nbsp;Library.</p> $ python -m pip install ocean-lib <p>Type ‘python’ in your terminal to open up the Python console. Let’s code some&nbsp;Python!</p> $ python <p>Then, we’ll import all the libraries we need &amp; setup our blockchain as Polygon’s Mumbai test network for this tutorial:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.web3_internal.utils import connect_to_network<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; connect_to_network("polygon-test") # mumbai is "polygon-test"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from brownie.network import accounts<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.example_config import get_config_dict<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.ocean.ocean import Ocean<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime, timedelta<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.models.compute_input import ComputeInput<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pickle<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os <p>Next, you can choose whether to connect your wallet to your system’s environmental variables so that you can use it to pay for the gas fees. Or, you can use Bob to act as the wallet’s owner, as shown in the below code. Note that if you use Bob, then you will have to give him fake Matic to pay for gas. You can put his address in at <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/">https://faucet.polygon.technology/</a></p> &gt;&gt;&gt; config = get_config_dict("polygon-test")<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ocean = Ocean(config)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; accounts.clear()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; bob_private_key = os.getenv('REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2')<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; bob = accounts.add(bob_private_key) <p>Upload your SMA cross strategy algorithm to an open repository (for a full SMA algorithm example, please see the Addendum). The public URL to this file will be encrypted by Ocean so that purchasers of the NFT only get the output of the algorithm instead of the algorithm itself.</p><p>To publish the algorithm NFT + Metadata + datatoken using the algorithm’s URL, do the following:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; ALGO_url = "YOUR_PUBLIC_URL_HERE"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; name = "golden_death_crosses_recommender"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (ALGO_data_nft, ALGO_datatoken, ALGO_ddo) = ocean.assets.create_algo_asset(<br>    name,<br>    ALGO_url,<br>    {"from": bob},<br>    image="pandas/pandas",<br>    tag="pip-all",<br>    checksum="sha256:f85d01f3455431325b7b5b7b18ff26d88c0ca9f9f45383b9147fe596e90917ce",<br>    wait_for_aqua=True<br>)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"ALGO_ddo did = '{ALGO_ddo.did}'") <p>Once your algorithm is published as an asset on the blockchain, we’ll create a compute service to run your algorithm on a dataset. At the end, we will only sell the output of your algorithm, rather than the algorithm asset&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For this tutorial, you can use the Data asset referenced in this <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0dac5eb4965fb2b485181671adbf3a23b0133abf71d2775eda8043e8efc92d19">link</a> which is free to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Side note: This data asset provides 1000 hours of ETH price, meaning that the algorithm is not going to be able to use windows greater than 42&nbsp;days.</p><p>To add a compute service to the data&nbsp;asset:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; ALGO_did = "ALGORITHM_DID_HERE"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; DATA_did = "DATA_DID_HERE"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; DATA_ddo = ocean.assets.resolve(DATA_did)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ALGO_ddo = ocean.assets.resolve(ALGO_did)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compute_service = DATA_ddo.services[1]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compute_service.add_publisher_trusted_algorithm(ALGO_ddo)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; DATA_ddo = ocean.assets.update(DATA_ddo, {"from": bob}) <p>Whichever data asset you use, make sure to have permissions for the Data asset to attach a compute service to it.

<p>Sharing about the March online developer training and student experiences.</p> What <p>This March the Holochain Foundation, collaborating with our education partner Mythosthesia, hosted a four day, online developer training. This training focused on giving developers the skills needed to develop Holochain applications in a clean, simple, and robust manner; and it taught them to reason about distributed systems from an agent-centric perspective.</p><p>The weekend following the training we held a two day build event where the newly minted Holochain devs could test their skills and demo their projects.</p> Who <p>Holochain partnered with Mythosthesia, the new venture by Marcus Philips who co-founded <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hack Reactor</a> and experienced dev educator Muhammad Meigooni, in order to provide world-class instruction to our community. Marcus and Muhammad are really passionate about Holochain and it has been a pleasure working with them to develop this course. </p><p>Attending the event was an experienced cohort of 18 developers, which ranged from folks who had been developing on Holochain for years to those totally new to the community. Preparing for this training we conducted extensive tech checks (including a solid grasp of the Rust programming language) and culture interviews to ensure that everyone taking the course would be able to get the most from it and that they could grow into valuable community members.</p> What Was Built <p>Our build weekend was short. With only a day and a half of build time before the demo, none of the projects demonstrated had reached an MVP status. However, this is only partially due to the limited time. The developers also chose large and potentially impactful projects that were never meant to be completed in a weekend, ones they all seem dedicated to continuing work on. Their thinking and progress on these projects is inspiring. </p><p>While we could gush about how incredible this cohort of developers is, we would prefer to simply show you. The following are some highlights from the demo.</p> Short Demo Descriptions <p>Harlan Wood has been working on the <a href="https://github.com/trustgraph?ref=blog.holochain.org">TrustGraph</a> technology for Holochain over the last year, but at the build days he got it working with a live application. TrustGraph is a reputation system built for platform interoperability that leans into peer-to-peer networks through its transitive trust algorithm which can be used for things like feed filtering. <br><br>Watch this quick video to learn more about how TrustGraph might be used:</p><p>John Hopkins started mapping out a DID implementation for Holochain. We won’t speak about this too much right now because identity is such a huge topic and we have separate updates about that coming, but it was encouraging to see a dev, new to the framework, who was thinking about a lot of the same things we have been.</p><p>Matt Gabrenya started creating a registry of composable app elements that developers could use to create unique arrangements, easily pulling these elements together. This reminded us of the composable applets of We but for the development layer rather than the user layer.</p><p>Without there being a direct connection between the two projects, we can already imagine how this might interface with <a href="https://www.generativeobjects.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Generative Objects</a> (GO) founder Walter Almeida’s work. He came to this training with the express intent of integrating Holochain into GO’s Meta Modeler so that it is possible to generate custom Holochain applications in a low code environment. Customizable Holochain applications that anyone can build and publish without needing years of developer experience? Yes please. We’ll definitely keep you up to date as these projects progress.<br><br>There was also a crop of projects focused on financial applications.<br><br>Joshua Vial and Nicholas Stebbings designed the fundamentals of an app that would make it easy to bootstrap an authority list, based on social trust structures, that would serve to authenticate cross chain and cross DHT transactions, ensuring that ledgers on both sides of an exchange were updated appropriately. Meanwhile Julien Lucca, Ross Eyre, Ché Coelho, and Leo Proechel worked on a credit clearing algorithm that uses agent-centric methods to find debt cycles in B2B contexts and cancel them out. Even the course instructor Marcus Philips spent time refining the design for a protocol he started for a Transitive Favor Network. This would be a radically peer-to-peer currency protocol where each individual would only need agreed-on systems of value exchange with their direct neighbors, but which would allow strangers to still exchange with each other by finding connections through the social graph. </p><p>Watch this video of Julian, Ross, Che, and Leo describing their Credit Clearing Algorithm:</p> Course Reviews <p>How did the course turn out? Rather then trying to explain a group’s shared experience, we’ll just quote a few of the responses from the students’ course feedback forms:</p><blockquote>“I thought this was a really excellent way to gain an introduction to Holochain, and it definitely left me with a thirst to learn more. I think the curriculum is well thought out and gives the perfect HDK 101.” —John Hopkins</blockquote><blockquote>“A very cohesive bunch of minds gathered with a yearning for more knowledge and discovery — which makes for a refreshing classroom experience. It is clear that the choice of cohort and instructors was very well considered and this has led to a wealth of knowledge in the room, and excellent coordination throughout.” —Nicholas Stebbings</blockquote><blockquote>“I can't think of another class or training I've been in where I enjoy the community as much as I have in this class. I have learned so much from the questions and side conversations.” —Patrick Winfield</blockquote><blockquote>“This course has been invaluable and incredibly empowering. It has also been a super-collision of incredibly competent and fascinating folk.” —Ché Coelho</blockquote><blockquote>“Super fun and useful! Definitely exceeded my expectations. The course is super grounding and down to earth — getting all the way down to DHT ops and all the way up to capability claims.” —Anon</blockquote><blockquote>“The course is great. It provides a thorough grounding in the conceptual building blocks of Holochain, along with the practical tools and experience to build working apps. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how Holochain works, what it can do, and how to make it do those things.” —Anon</blockquote><blockquote>“The Holochain developer immersive has been exceptionally stimulating. It's helped to solidify my understanding of distributed systems in general and has led to a deeper appreciation of the HC architecture and its potentially integral role in bringing digital technologies into alignment with the human-social organism. Our studio intends to become active developers and supporters of the ecosystem.” —Ross Eyre</blockquote><blockquote>“This is an excellent technical deep-dive for developers who wish to write Rust code based directly on the HDK. It is well-constructed, descriptive, paced excellently, and presented by very knowledgeable and passionate people.” —Acea Spades Black</blockquote> A Self-Paced Online Course <p>We expect to have more dev training sessions in the future, but in the meantime we are producing a self-paced, online course available to anyone who wants to learn to develop on Holochain. </p><p>This course will consist of recordings from the March dev training so that you get the same information and education that we provided to this past cohort. You’ll need to know some Rust, and there won’t be the hands-on element, but by supplementing your experience with online build events, Discord office hours, and the support of our thriving developer community, we think that this course will help you grow as a Holochain developer.<br><br><a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/QQoJ4s3D?ref=blog.holochain.org">Fill out this interest form</a> and we’ll let you know when the course is live.</p>

<p>Ultimately, SelfKey iD may be a win-win for everyone involved.</p>
 Ease of Use 
<p>For identity owners or data subjects, the ease of use when it comes to digital identity schemes primarily depends on how easy it is to enroll and use their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is designed with simplicity in mind, utilizing <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">soulbound tokens</a> so that users may easily produce their credentials using any non-custodial wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With SelfKey iD, the enrollment process may be as easy as a one-click option for users, with the heavy lifting happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey iD may offer a user-friendly approach to digital identity schemes that may make it easy for users to produce, maintain, and use their credentials. At the same time, it might also provide a secure and decentralized solution that meets the needs of the modern digital age.</p>
 SelfKey iD vs traditional KYC checks 
<p>SelfKey iD may be a better alternative for identity verification, as it may offer a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly approach to KYC.</p>
<p>By using the potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts, SelfKey iD may provide a secure, decentralized, and efficient identity verification process. It may have the potential to eliminate many of the issues associated with traditional KYC methods, possibly making the process more user-friendly and safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, but with SelfKey iD, users may have complete control over their digital identities and they might exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">SSID</a> rights more easily than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 How does SelfKey iD work? 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD is a smooth and hassle-free process that prioritizes user convenience without compromising security and privacy. The streamlined procedure may ensure that users have access to a secure and private digital identity that they can trust.</p>
 The process&nbsp; 
<p>By following the simple steps outlined by the platform, users can obtain a SelfKey iD quickly and with ease. The steps are as follows:</p>
 
  Users must first log in with their wallet and pay an entry fee.&nbsp; 
  The next step would be to undergo a KYC verification process. This method is designed to ensure that the user's identity is authentic and that they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The verification process typically consists of:&nbsp;</p>
 
 performing a <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">selfie check</a>. 
 providing personal information, such as name and address. 
 providing government-issued identification documents, such as a passport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, users will not be able to create duplicate accounts.</p>
 
  Once the KYC process is complete, legible users are automatically approved. 
  The final step in the process is to mint the soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT. This unique digital asset is generated using blockchain technology and is securely bound to the user's digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It might serve as proof of identity and it may be used to authenticate the user's identity in a variety of settings, such as:</p>
 
 online marketplaces. 
 financial institutions. 
 other digital platforms, such as social media and videogames. 
 
<p>Even more, as the concept of the metaverse gains popularity, the need for secure and reliable digital identities becomes increasingly important. SelfKey iD emphasizes privacy and self-sovereignty. Therefore, it may be the perfect identity credential for the exciting products and services of the future.</p>
 Minting soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT 
 Aggregating Multiple Credentials 
<p>By combining different SBT (soul-bound tokens) and identity credentials, SelfKey iD may provide a higher level of verification for the user's identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials which may be aggregated by a SelfKey iD include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Metaproof. 
 KYC credentials issued by SelfKey Network issuers. 
 Traditional accounts, such as: Google, Apple, Discord, Github, Twitter, and the likes. 
 Various identity tokens, such as Binance’s BAB token issued in 2022. 
 
<p>This implementation may have significant advantages over individual credentials, as it may increase the reliability and accuracy of identity verification. And, an increase in reliability and accuracy is crucial for online interactions and services that require trust between parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more credentials added to the SelfKey iD container, the more trust may be established, and the more reliable and secure the user's digital identity may become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the integration of multiple SBTs and identity credentials within a SelfKey iD container might provide users with unparalleled flexibility. This may enable them to add as many credentials as they require to establish their identity in a variety of contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may enhance the SelfKey platform's versatility and utility. It might make it more appealing to individuals and institutions seeking a reliable and secure digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Essentially, SelfKey's implementation of an aggregated credential system in its platform may be a significant step forward in the development of a strong and reliable self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>
 Attaching NFT series to SelfKey iD 
<p>SelfKey continues to prioritize user-friendliness with the introduction of a unique feature that may enable users to attach a distinct NFT series to their SelfKey iD profile picture. This feature may add a touch of personalization and uniqueness to the user's digital identity. Even more, it might reflect the growing trend of NFTs in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may also enhance the user's experience by providing them with more options to personalize and showcase their digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the addition of the NFT series feature to the SelfKey iD platform reflects the platform's continued focus on user-friendliness, personalization, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
 Access to SelfKey DAO 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD may provide users with numerous benefits that enhance their experience on the platform and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These benefits may include:</p>
 
 access to the governance of the SelfKey Protocol. 
 the ability to mint SELF tokens. 
 participating in staking. 
 exclusive access to member-only channels on Discord. 
 obtaining exclusive collectible NFT packs. 
 registering for KEY.ETH ENS domains. 
 enjoying instant login to partner apps. 
 
 Minting SELF tokens 
<p>Having access to the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. The token might then be used for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may add value to the user's experience and may provide them with more control over their digital identity.</p>
 Staking 
<p>By staking KEY tokens on their KYC credential, users may mint SELF tokens. Staking on credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials. Users may withdraw tokens at any time, although this will result in the termination of SELF token generation.</p>
 Exclusive Discord Channels 
<p>Access to member-only Discord channels may be another perk of having a SelfKey iD. It may provide users with a community to engage with other DAO members through a designated channel. DAO members may also discuss proposals for the governance of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
 NTF packs 
<p>Exclusive collectible NFT packs may also be available to SelfKey iD holders. This may add a unique and personalized touch to their digital identity. These collectibles are released by the SelfKey DAO, further enhancing their customization and originality.</p>
 KEY.ETH ENS domains and SelfKey iD 
<p>Moreover, SelfKey iD holders may register for KEY.ETH ENS domains. This might enable them to create unique and easily identifiable domains for their online identity.</p>
 Instant login to partner apps 
<p>Instant login to partner apps may be another advantage of having a SelfKey iD. This may provide users with a seamless and secure login process across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the benefits of having a SelfKey iD express the platform's commitment to providing users with a comprehensive, valuable experience. It may enhance their ability to navigate the crypto space with ease and confidence.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>In theory, SelfKey iD may be a strong and reliable form of digital identity that might be used for a broad range of use cases in the crypto world. With its focus on user-friendliness, security, and privacy, the SelfKey iD may be well-suited to the needs of decentralized societies and Web3 applications.</p>
<p>However, SelfKey iD may also be suited for traditional Web2 platforms that want to benefit from security and anti-bot features inherent to the SelfKey iD system.</p>
<p>SelfKey iD may not only empower the governance of the SelfKey DAO but it may also provide a model for other decentralized governance systems. By offering powerful, privacy-preserving identity credentials, the SelfKey iD might enable more fair and democratic governance. This way, users may have greater control over their data and identities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to provide new forms of decentralized governance, which may allow members to experiment with different approaches and explore the full potential of the SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the crypto world continues to evolve, the SelfKey iD might play an increasingly important role in enabling secure and transparent transactions across a wide range of platforms and applications.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 27th March to 2nd&nbsp;April <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we delve into South Dakota’s unsuccessful attempt to pass a crypto regulation bill, the SEC Chairman’s concerns over cryptocurrency compliance in the market, the EU’s implementation of a 1,000 Euro ceiling on crypto transfers, and the Central Bank of Bahrain’s updated crypto asset framework.</p><p>Let’s dive into this week’s recap without forgetting that along the ever-evolving regulatory landscape, we need to safeguard the ecosystem’s true&nbsp;ethos.</p> South Dakota Fails to Pass Crypto Regulation Bill <p>The South Dakota House could not overturn Governor Kristi Noem’s veto of a proposed bill to establish government regulations for utilizing cryptocurrency within the state. This means there are no changes to South Dakota’s regulatory approach towards cryptocurrency, resulting in the state maintaining its current&nbsp;policy.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1640760891367981078?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>Although the bill had made its way through the legislative process, it faced opposition from some who perceived the proposed regulations as a means of enabling government surveillance and overstepping boundaries.</p><p>The opponents argued that they require more time to observe the outcomes of similar legislation in other states before making a final decision.</p> SEC Chairman Cites Cryptocurrency Compliance Concerns in the&nbsp;Market <p>Speaking at the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, US SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said that rules for the crypto market already exist and are called securities regulations. However, the industry is still “rife with noncompliance.”</p><p>He also reiterated his stance that the majority of coins should be classified as securities.</p><p>In its dealings with the cryptocurrency industry, the SEC has adopted a “regulation by enforcement” strategy, targeting firms and projects dealing with what the agency deems as unregistered securities.</p><p>Gensler further emphasized that the SEC needs new tools, expertise, and resources to address misconduct in emerging and new areas, including the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>He added that the additional staff would allow the SEC’s Enforcement Division to investigate wrongdoing on a larger scale and accelerate the pace of enforcement investigations to resolution.</p> EU Implements 1,000 Euro Ceiling on Crypto Transfers <p>The European Parliament is implementing a large-scale overhaul of money laundering laws with the approval of three new draft&nbsp;bills.</p><p>The first adopted text requires crypto asset managers to identify their customers and associated risks, limiting anonymous crypto transfers to 1000&nbsp;euros.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1640700969955602434?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>Lawmakers have approved limits on payments by unverified crypto users as part of the money laundering overhaul.</p><p>The second text requires EU member-states to establish a financial intelligence unit to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>The third text establishes a new supervisory and investigative money laundering authority to directly supervise the riskiest crypto service providers in the EU&nbsp;bloc.</p><p>The upcoming MiCA bill will complement these new bills, introducing a new legislative framework for cryptocurrency businesses and incorporating the FATF’s Travel Rule for crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Central Bank of Bahrain Updates Crypto Asset Framework <p>The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has introduced updates to its Crypto-assets (“CRA”) Module. The amendments were made after due consultation with industry stakeholders to cater to ongoing developments in the crypto market and comply with industry best practices.</p><p>Their objective is to bolster investor protection and align the crypto-assets market’s development with the Kingdom’s Economic Recovery Plan, as outlined by the&nbsp;CBB.</p><p>The amendments expand the scope of the framework to include digital token offerings, which the CBB will regulate if they exhibit the characteristics of security.</p><p>The CBB will determine whether a digital token qualifies as security by examining its underlying economic purpose, structure, characteristics, and rights attached to the&nbsp;token.</p><p>The amendments also outline new requirements to enhance safeguarding clients’ assets and allow crypto-assets licensees to engage in additional activities after obtaining the CBB’s approval.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/australias-latest-crypto-bill-explained">Australia’s Latest Crypto Bill Explained</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1641855759720775710?s=20">Monthly Overview — March&nbsp;2023</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Was GDPR v1.0 the data protection solution everyone hoped for? Let’s explore how General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) didn’t live up to our expectations. And let’s also ask the important question; will GDPR v2.0 be able to solve the issues?</p>
<p>After a near decade of pulling back and forth, the balance in the tug-of-war between monetising personal information and safeguarding it took a major step towards the latter. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and its enforcement from 2018 was a watershed moment in global technology regulation. It forced even multinational organisations to take personal information seriously or risk possible penalties reaching up to 4% of annual global turnover. Overnight, the GDPR became Brussels officials’ poster child of powerful legislation. One that could show that all organisations need to abide by the law just as much as one-person start-ups. However, in the five years since the GDPR entered into force, it has become clear that the GDPR wasn’t the solution we thought it was. Serious concerns and numerous loopholes have been discovered by privacy activists, technology experts and even national privacy watchdogs alike.</p>
 Current issues with GDPR 
<p>The core problem is that under the GDPR, all companies, including the tech giants, are overseen by the national regulator in the EU country in which they are headquartered. In practical terms, this so-called “one-stop shop rule” directs most of the major compliance investigations run through the Irish and Luxembourgian systems, because the largest technology companies, such as Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, have all set up their European headquarters in one of these two countries (due to favourable taxation and other legislation). This in return results in EU-wide precedents that reflect the political climate of only two countries, not 27.</p>
<p>Both Ireland and Luxembourg have faced mounting criticism in the recent years for slow, and even lax, enforcement which they officially deny. However, claims of lax enforcement does not equal no enforcement, the Irish data authority has recently imposed a &gt;$200M <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/irish-data-protection-authority-gives-eu-397-billion-present-meta">fine against Meta</a>. Meta however earns a million dollars every 15 minutes, and therefore we are back at the same problems we had before the GDPR. That ignoring the law can be very profitable, and private individuals still have little leverage to safeguard their privacy online.</p>
<p>To my mind this brings us to a very unpleasant question – is the GDPR really a tool for safeguarding EU residents’ privacy, or a tool for punishing US-based multinationals?</p>
<p>It is 2023, and year after year there is talk about EU-wide class actions and seemingly widespread support for them. Yet the actual legislation fails to materialise again and again. Retaliating against the big US-based multinationals for disregarding the European Commission is one thing. But making me, as a private individual, decipher corporate structures and hunt for the correct competent authorities is another problem.</p>
 Evolution of the GDPR 
<p>The European Union is finally taking concrete steps in fixing the dysfunctionalities of its poster child. The solution? More legislation.</p>
<p>The now 7-year-old law will get a facelift before summer 2023. The solution seeks to correct its glaring problem: the extremely lop-sided way that Irish, and to a lesser extent Luxembourgian, data protection commission and courts can steer the entire 27-country bloc.</p>
<p>The details are unfortunately scantly available. The official take is that the new legislation will “harmonize some aspects of the administrative procedure” in cross-border cases and “support a smooth functioning of the GDPR cooperation and dispute resolution mechanisms”, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13745-Further-specifying-procedural-rules-relating-to-the-enforcement-of-the-General-Data-Protection-Regulation_en">as the Commission explains</a>. Simply put, it seeks to end the jurisdiction shopping inside the 27-country bloc.</p>
<p>However, fixing failed regulation with more regulation can often end up doing the opposite. So why not take the chance to simply state that; EU Data Subjects may choose to use their home jurisdiction. While proceeding to combine the GDPR, the ePrivacy directive (aka the “EU cookie law”), and even the 3Q2023 Data Governance Act, to ensure that there are no conflicting requirements. One could possibly dare to wish for a plethora of improvements from the perspective of private EU residents, but so far, the silence is deafening.</p>
 How the improvements will help individuals/businesses 
<p>It is clear that the precedents cannot rest solely on two countries’ shoulders in a union of 27 countries. For us private individuals, the proposed changes are a step in the right direction. Any organisation that is clearly GDPR compliant will not face any issues, and ending jurisdiction ­shopping will level the playing field between local organisations and big multinationals. It will be interesting to see what, if any, effect the new legislation will have on the EU-US relations regarding privacy protections as well. But we might have to wait until the, seemingly inevitable, Schrems III case goes through the court system to find out whether the EU-US data protection tug-of-war will finally end.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one should keep hybrid (cloud + on-premises) solutions in mind when deciding where and how to process any personal data. Hybrid solutions can bring the best of the two worlds, geographically determined identity data residency with cloud-based IAM capabilities, as explained in more detail in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/understanding-hybrid-cloud/" title="Understanding hybrid cloud">Understanding hybrid cloud</a>.</p>

  Stolen credentials are one of the easiest and most popular way for cyber criminals to gain access to targeted IT systems, but longer and stronger passwords together with first-generation multi-factor authentication (MFA) have failed to make a difference.

			 Crisis Resilience: How Tokenization Could Empower Banks 
<p>The recent bank crisis has sparked concerns and uncertainty in the financial world. With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, and the collapses of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank. We want to share some of our views on the role tokenization may play in the future of banking.</p>
 Bank Runs: Crisis Calls for Transparency and Trust 
<p>Countless bank runs have occurred throughout financial history, as&nbsp;no bank can survive a situation where a large number of depositors demand repayment simultaneously. Banks mostly generate income by lending deposited funds at higher interest rates; they cannot maintain enough cash reserves to cover all deposits at once.</p>
 The Twitter-era Bank Crisis Spreads Contagiously Faster Than Ever 
<p>Swift information dissemination via social media and mobile banking accelerates the potential for bank runs. In a single day, Silicon Valley Bank’s customers withdrew $42 billion, far exceeding the largest bank run in modern U.S. history, which happened at Washington Mutual in 2008 and totaled $16.7 billion but took 10 days to transpire.</p>
<p>As the banking crisis continues, people are increasingly distrustful of keeping their money in banks, as illustrated by the following chart.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dbs.com.sg/treasures/templatedata/article/generic/data/en/CIO/032023/230327CIOP.xml?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8o29LGsAwykYDlGGDppfQnYM6HnQ1ZRTOiXAwCM4rCWbn3Vtey9nrrBfAM5sg7Zo-C8_m8">According to DBS</a>, in 2023, US commercial banks experienced their largest deposit drop in four decades, surpassing even the 1981 Volcker-era decline.&nbsp;This situation calls for banks to enhance risk management and transparency to regain depositors’ trust.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Money Moves To Money Market Funds 
<p>Depositors are shifting money to money market funds&nbsp;due to concerns about banks, such as Silicon Valley Bank, investing in long-term government bonds, which experienced losses when sold to meet depositor demands. Additionally,&nbsp;money market funds offer attractive yields,&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vmfxx?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">some are over 4%</a>, significantly higher than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/index.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">0.37% FDIC-reported rate&nbsp;</a>for bank deposits. Financial Times reported that money market funds have received over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/032523bc-3b92-4b94-b6b8-ebbe1d606b2c?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">$286 billion in inflows during March</a>, as depicted in the chart below. It marks the largest month of inflows since the Covid-19 crisis began.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Furthermore,&nbsp;money market funds can tokenize their assets to rapidly gain market share&nbsp;and even take it a step further by allowing tokenized funds to be used as collateral. This is precisely what J.P. Morgan and BlackRock achieved l<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/jpmorgan-finds-new-use-for-blockchain-in-collateral-settlement?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">ast May</a>, settling their first transaction using tokenized money market funds as collateral, paving the way for bridging Traditional Finance (TraFi) with Decentralized Finance (DeFi).</p>
 Tokenization: Steering Institutions Towards Crisis Resilience 
<p>The internet has revolutionized the way we exchange information, but the transfer of value has remained relatively unchanged, especially in private markets.&nbsp;Tokenization provides the solution to allow value to be exchanged efficiently and securely, empowering banks and institutions to navigate financial crises. Let’s list a few benefits:</p>
 
 Transparency: Tokenization offers an immutable and publicly accessible record of asset ownership and movement, boosting investor confidence and accountability in banks’ portfolios and balance sheets. We saw a similar trend in cryptos post-FTX with the emergence of “proof-of-reserves” by exchanges and new services from data providers such as Chainlink. 
 Real-time rebalancing: Tokenization enables the atomic settlement of securities, granting banks greater flexibility and resilience during liquidity crises by enabling rapid asset trades. 
 Dynamic Portfolio:&nbsp;Tokenization allows banks to create extensive, diversified portfolios. Private assets have been overperforming public assets for years. Tokenization is transforming private markets with a shared infrastructure that enables seamless global trading of private assets. Consequently, banks can strengthen risk resilience by investing across various regions and markets. 
 24/7 Automated Risk Management:&nbsp;Tokenized securities enable banks to deploy smart contracts for automating risk strategies and processes, providing continuous monitoring and automatic adjustments to portfolios when predefined conditions are met. 
 DeFi Bailouts:&nbsp;As blockchain-savvy investors move towards DeFi for its transparency and code-based approach, banks could potentially leverage DeFi for refinancing and assistance during crises in the future, once massive adoption is realized. 
 
<p>The recent bank crisis has exposed the weaknesses in traditional banking systems and the need for change. As the future of securities is tokenization, it would certainly play an important role in the future of banking crises; as we explore, the benefits and challenges will be more clear.</p>

<p>The proposed changes focus on actions to be taken by competent authorities in the following areas:</p>



  cooperation between authorities, other stakeholders and prudential supervisors; 



 supervisory expectations should follow a consistent approach when supervision of institutions is the subject of multiple authorities; 



 train their staff to have all necessary expertise and technical knowledge to properly conduct their tasks for the supervision of crypto-assets service providers. 
 <p>They also expand on:</p>



  sources of information available to competent authorities when supervising crypto-asset service providers (CASPs /VASPs); 



 „how competent authorities should determine the type of guidance needed within the sector and how to communicate this guidance in the most effective manner” 
 <p>Amendments in the following areas are proposed:</p>



<p>1. ‘Subject matter, scope and definitions’</p>



<p>2. Guideline 4.1 ‘Implementing the RBS model’</p>



<p>3. Guideline 4.2 ‘Step 1 – Identification of risk and mitigating factors’</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020, many organizations were forced to digitize at a speed exceeding their security capabilities. Remote work meant that employees accessed company networks from potentially unsafe end devices. Today, many in the e-commerce business work in a hybrid mode – partly from home, partly from the office – and are thus potential insider threats.</p>
<p>According to today’s guest in our Speaker Spotlight, Rajan Barara, Director of Product Management for Identity at Entrust, Zero Trust can help mitigate the risk of insider threats. At its core, Zero Trust stipulates that trust should never be the default setting and that access requests should always be verified. This can also mean, that employees should in most instances have the least possible access privileges and be granted access just in time (JIT).</p>
<p>Together with Wolfgang Goerlich, Advisory CISO for Cisco Secure, Gerald Horst, Partner Digital Identity EMEA at PwC, and Michael Jones, Identity Standards Architect at Microsoft, Rajan will discuss the future of Zero Trust in a panel entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5335/2">Zero Trust: Where do We Want to be in Five Years?</a> at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023.</p>

<p>Do you know who your customers are? This sounds like a trick question, but it isn’t. Although organizations are required to have Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks baked into their interactions with customers, the degree of certainty around a customer’s identity isn’t always as high as it should be. Identity theft is a pervasive problem, and it leads to many challenges for banks, lenders, insurance carriers, and other financial institutions. Reported instances of fraudsters using stolen identity information to open new bank accounts under a victim's name grew by 32% in 2022 in the U.S. according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/CSN-Data-Book-2022.pdf">FTC</a> to over 110,000 cases – in each of these situations, the bank’s KYC/AML process failed. Meanwhile, in the UK, instances of credit card ID theft, where a criminal either opens a new card using a stolen identity or takes over a genuine account in good standing, were up 101% YoY midway through 2022 according to <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-10/Half%20year%20fraud%20update%202022.pdf">UK Finance</a>, with a reported gross loss of £21.4m in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These financial crimes are costly to consumers and financial institutions alike. For financial services organizations, a failure to verify their customers’ identity in situations such as these carries a reputational cost, too – so it’s important to get it right.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Adding authentication to public clients such as Single Page Applications (SPA) and JavaScript applications can be a source of confusion. Identity Providers like Okta try to help you via multiple support systems. Still, it can feel like a lot of work. Especially since you’re responsible for way more than authentication alone in the applications you work on!</p>

<p>As part of authentication, your client application makes multiple calls to an authorization server, and you get back several strings, which are tokens. Let’s demystify what’s going on behind the scenes and closely examine what those tokens are and how you use them within your client application.</p>

 Authentication and Authorization using OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC) 
<p>OAuth 2.0 with OIDC is the best practice for adding authentication and authorization to your software applications. Authentication verifies the identity of who you claim to be, and authorization verifies you have access to data you want to see or actions you want to perform. It is lightweight with less effort to set up and use than Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an alternate authentication and authorization mechanism that pre-existing systems may use. For newer systems, you’ll want to use OAuth 2.0 + OIDC.</p>

<p></p>

<p>OAuth 2.0 handles authorization to resources, such as when your front-end application gets data from a backend API by making an HTTP request. OAuth 2.0 standards have the flexibility to support authorization across your entire application system through different flows and grant types. For example, different OAuth 2.0 flows support JavaScript-based front-end applications, for your APIs and back-end services to communicate, and even for IOT devices in your home automation system. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer on OAuth 2.0 that provides standardized identity information.</p>

 OAuth 2.0 + OIDC for JavaScript clients and SPA 
<p>SPAs and other JavaScript front-ends are public clients, which means they can’t maintain secret information for authorization, unlike a confidential client. A confidential client (such as a traditional server-rendered web app) can keep super secret information such as a Client Secret for authorization. In both application types, we should use a flow called Authorization Code and an extension to the flow called Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).</p>

<p>Let’s see how this flow works step-by-step following what happens when a cute dinosaur named Sunny prepares to sign in to the “Rawr” app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The client application starts the process and generates a random, long string — the code verifier. Then it creates a code challenge from the code verifier. This step is part of the PKCE extension.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The client application holds on to the code verifier. It then makes an authorization code request to your authorization server, in this case, represented by Okta. The authorization code request includes the code challenge along with some critical pieces of information, such as</p>
 
   Client ID 
   Scopes, including at least the following:
     
       <code>openid</code> required for specifying the app uses OIDC in verifying the user’s identity 
       <code>profile</code> for accessing the user’s profile information, such as their name 
       <code>offline_access</code> to request a Refresh Token as part of this call 
     
   
   Redirect URI for the callback location within the client application when sign-in is complete 
   A random alphanumeric string for preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
 

<p></p>

<p>The authorization server redirects the user, Sunny, to a web page it hosts to sign in and provide authorization consent.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yay! Sign-in success! The authorization server returns an authorization code to the client application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that there’s an authorization code, the client application makes a request to the token endpoint of the authorization server and sends the authorization code and the code verifier.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To process the token endpoint request the authorization server ensures the authorization code is still valid and that the code verifier matches the code challenge sent in the authorization request. This step is part of the PKCE extension.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yay! Success! The authorization server returns three tokens:</p>
 
   Access token 
   ID token 
   Refresh token 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now that Sunny successfully signed in, they can continue their rawring lessons!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you have these three tokens let’s better understand what each one is for.</p>

 Auth tokens in OAuth 2.0 + OIDC 
<p>These three tokens provide crucial information about your identity, access to resources, and the ability to stay authenticated securely.</p>

 ID token 
<p>The ID token is about the user, so information about Sunny in this case. This authentication token is returned from the OpenID Connect layer. It contains standardized identity information such as email, name, and issuing party, called claims. The ID token may include extra claims for information critical to Sunny’s identity, such as their dinosaur family, which is a Smileasaur of course.</p>

 Access token 
<p>The access token is a key that grants access to data or to perform an action. This authorization token is returned from the OAuth layer. The token has metadata about the token itself, such as the issuing party, information about requested scopes made in the original request, and the expiration time. Access tokens are intentionally short-lived for public clients and are a safety mechanism since it guards access to resources, and it’s dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands!</p>

 Refresh token 
<p>The Refresh token allows us to exchange it for new, shiny tokens. This optional <code>offline_access</code> scope we added in the original authorization code request allows the access token to be short-lived but does not require Sunny to authenticate to get a new token repeatedly. Refresh tokens can be longer-lived than access tokens, but for public clients, the lifetime of Refresh tokens should also be short. We want to make sure bad actors can’t get a hold of a Refresh token to gain access to an access token! For public clients like SPA, it’s a best practice also to use Refresh Token rotation, which improves security by rotating refresh tokens after each use.</p>

<p>While each step of this OAuth flow to get the tokens is critical to ensure a secure authentication and authorization process, let’s inspect the two requests in more detail.</p>

 Create an OAuth 2.0 + OIDC Compliant Authorization server 

<p>We’ll start by setting up an authorization server in Okta and use the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> tool to inspect the Network requests. This authorization server is OAuth 2.0 and OIDC compliant so we can use it within applications that conform to those specs.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code>. In the upcoming steps, you’ll need those values to configure Okta in your SPA client.</p>

 View the well-known endpoint for OIDC Discovery 

<p>Authorization servers have standard, public endpoints for discovery by clients. Let’s take a peek at the OIDC discovery document.</p>

<p>The OpenID Connect specification requires a standardized mechanism for client discovery. You can find it at <code>{Issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration</code>. Open up a browser tab to the OIDC discovery endpoint. It is also JSON formatted data that looks something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the discovery response, we have the endpoints for the authorization and token requests which we’ll use in the following steps. We also have a user info endpoint to query for user information and endpoints to validate the ID token. If you find the property for <code>claims_supported</code>, you’ll see the claims cover various identifying information about the user.</p>

 Debug the authorization code and token requests 

<p>We can see this OAuth flow using the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> tool. Open the site on a browser with good developer debugging capabilities. You’ll see something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Some fields are pre-populated, which is helpful. Add the other key information needed:</p>
 
   Authorize URI (required) - the authorize endpoint from the discovery doc 
   Client ID (required) - the Client ID value from Okta CLI 
   Scope (required) - <code>openid</code> is already added for us. Add <code>profile</code> and <code>offline_access</code> with spaces in between. The form field should look like <code>openid profile offline_access</code>. 
   Response type (required) - select “Use PKCE?” to unlock a few new fields, but everything is auto-populated. The debugger discovers the token endpoint automatically for us. 😎 
 

<p>Open debugging tools in your browser to watch for redirection and network requests. You’ll want to make sure you’re preserving logs between page refreshes.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page, you’ll see how the authorization code request is formed. Press Send Request to start the flow.</p>

<p>First, you’ll authenticate using Okta if you still need to sign in by redirecting to an Okta-hosted sign-in page. Redirecting to the Identity Provider’s hosted sign-in page is the best practice for security, so it’s also a common practice you’ll see across Identity Providers. Completing sign-in redirects you back to the OIDC debugger with a success message. You’ll see the authorization code automatically exchanged for tokens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The token format for ID tokens is JSON Web Token (JWT). The access token from Okta is also a JWT. JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that allows systems to exchange information in JSON format securely. They are compact and safe from modifications, but our tokens contain public information. Don’t worry! They are secure, just not confidential.</p>

<p>You can copy the access token or ID token value from the response and read the contents using a <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT debugger</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So this is cool, but what do we do with the tokens in our SPA? Let’s bring these concepts into our front-end application.</p>

 Add authentication to your SPA 

<p>First, we need an Okta OIDC application supporting our SPA’s redirect URI. We could edit the existing OIDC debugger application we created previously, or we can use a handy Okta CLI command to set everything up for us and to scaffold out a sample application in our preferred framework.</p>

<p>Use the following command in the terminal to get going quickly. There’s a separate command for each Angular, React, and Vue.</p>

<p>Angular</p>
   <code>okta start angular
</code>   

<p>React</p>
   <code>okta start react
</code>   

<p>Vue</p>
   <code>okta start vue
</code>   

<p>Follow the instructions in the terminal to start the application. You should be able to sign in and sign out. Additionally, you can watch network requests for the calls it makes.</p>

<p>We don’t have a refresh token by default. You can enable that in the Okta Admin Console. Navigate to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer site</a> and sign in to your Okta organization. In the Admin Console, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and select the Okta application for the SPA you created. Edit the settings to enable Refresh Token. It automatically adds Refresh Token Rotation. Save your changes.</p>

<p>If you still need to, open the SPA code in your favorite IDE. Depending on your framework, navigate to the <code>config.js</code> or <code>app.config.ts</code> file. You’ll see the OIDC config and property for <code>scopes</code> where you will add <code>offline_access</code>. Your OIDC config looks something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    clientId: CLIENT_ID,
    issuer: ISSUER,
    redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
    scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access']
}
</code>   

<p>Now try rerunning the SPA. If you inspect the network request, you’ll see the refresh token too. You can see the tokens by looking at the contents of your local storage too.</p>

 Use auth tokens in SPAs 

<p>Now that we have these tokens in our SPA, what do we do with them? Let a trusted OIDC library, such as the Okta SDKs, handle all the token requests and refresh them for us. Behind the scenes, the OIDC library is hard at work exchanging tokens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We’re primarily interested in the contents of the ID token and using the access token.</p>

 How to use the access token 
<p>The access token gives us access to resources. That means we use access tokens in outgoing API requests that our application needs, like for Sunny to get their next rawring lesson.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll send the access token as a Bearer token in the HTTP call’s Authorization header. So in the case of Sunny, the outgoing HTTP call looks like this.</p>

   <code>GET /lessons
Authorization: Bearer access_token_value
</code>   

<p>You’ll want to ensure you’re not adding the access token to calls outside your system by maintaining an allowlist of origins that should include the token.</p>

<p>A great way to manage adding the Authorization header and the logic to verify the call matches the allowlist of origins is using an interceptor. Interceptors sit between your application and outgoing (or incoming) HTTP requests. Angular includes the concept of interceptors within the framework, and if you use Axios in Vue or React apps, you can configure interceptors there.</p>

<p>You can see access tokens in action within the SPA you previously created. If you navigate to Messages in the application, it will make a call to a resource server and add the access token to the Authorization header. If you want to see the messages request succeed, you’ll need to run the resource server in Okta’s <a href="https://github.com/okta/samples-nodejs-express-4">samples-nodejs-express-4 repo</a>.</p>

 How to use the ID token 
<p>Since the ID token contains user identity information, you can use it to start populating your user store and for supporting identifiers you need immediately, such as their name.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the SPA you previously created, you can see all your claims if you navigate to Profile.</p>

<p>The Okta SDK automatically decodes the ID token so that we can use the claims without decoding the payload ourselves. But before we jump right into using the claims, the Okta SDK first validates the token signature, which helps ensure the token’s integrity and that it hasn’t been altered. Let’s take a quick peek under the covers at what happens during this validation process.</p>

<p>Since this token is a JWT, we can rely on standard validation for JWTs for the validity of the token itself. Next, it will validate some claims in the payload, including:</p>
 
   <code>iss</code> - the issuer, which should match the original request. In the OIDC Debugger tool, we passed this in as the “Authorize URI” 
   <code>aud</code> - the audience, which should match the client ID of your Okta application 
   <code>nonce</code> - an arbitrary one-time value that should match the original request. In the OIDC Debugger tool, it was pre-populated for us. 
   <code>exp</code> and <code>iat</code> - the expiry time and issued at times, respectively. Only non-expired tokens with an expected issue time here, please! 
 

<p>Once you have the access token, you can also make a request to the OIDC Discovery document’s User Info endpoint, which may contain more information about the user than what is available in your ID token. You may also need to add any user information and user settings from API calls within your system into your user store since the SPAs we write have complex user information.</p>

 Learn more about OAuth, OIDC, tokens, and authentication best practices 
<p>Hopefully, this gives insight into how authentication and authorization with OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect work for public clients like SPAs and how each token fits into the landscape.</p>

 Financial services are one of the most targeted industries in the world for cyberattacks, suffering nearly 20% of all attacks in 2022. This is understandable considering the high-value outcomes of successful attacks and the fact that, despite supposed security improvements, attacks are still relatively successful, with over eight million records breached in the field in Q3 of 2022.

<p>Financial services are one of the most targeted industries in the world for cyberattacks, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence/">suffering nearly 20% of all attacks in 2022</a>. This is understandable considering the high-value outcomes of successful attacks and the fact that, despite supposed security improvements, attacks are still relatively successful, with over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1329989/us-number-of-records-exposed/">eight million records breached</a> in the field in Q3 of 2022.</p> 
<p>Data breaches don't just affect the institution that's compromised but also affect confidence in the sector as a whole. The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/03/global-cyber-threat-to-financial-systems-maurer.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> has highlighted the significant threat that weak financial services cybersecurity poses to the industry and the world. Potential outcomes range from a loss of confidence in financial services to widespread economic instability.</p> 
<p>That's why global cybersecurity regulations have been ramped up over recent years, as they strengthen the security posture of individual firms and the industry overall. Here we'll look at the most important financial services cybersecurity regulations in 2023.</p> 
 New York — NYDFS Part 500  
<p>One of the US's most important pieces of cybersecurity legislation is the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-nydfs-multi-factor-authentication-requirement">New York Department of Financial Services cybersecurity bill</a>, technically known as 23 NYCRR Part 500. The bill affects any firm that operates under the Banking, Insurance or Financial Services laws out of New York, which will be most financial services firms in the US.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It requires firms to implement a cybersecurity policy over data governance, access controls and consumer privacy. It also obligates the introduction of more robust security methods, such as the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">deployment of multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for protecting non-public information.</p> 
 US — Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)  
<p>The original Sarbanes-Oxley Act was instrumental in codifying the disclosures companies must make to current or potential investors, as well as the penalties that are due for breaches (with executives being directly on the line for up to $1 million and ten years in prison).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It has since been <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5069/text">updated to include cybersecurity considerations</a>. It now obligates all publicly traded companies in the US and their wholly-owned subsidiaries to declare adherence to cybersecurity best practices in areas such as authentication and data safety. They are also required to report any data breaches publicly.</p> 
 California — California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)  
<p>Introduced to help protect the privacy rights and consumer protections of Californians, <a href="https://support.hypr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044300832-Does-HYPR-support-the-California-Consumer-Privacy-Act-CCPA-">the CCPA </a>affects any company which does business with Californians and meets one of the following:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Has a gross revenue of over $25 million  
  Buys, sells or receives personal data on 50,000 consumers  
  Makes over half its revenue from selling consumers' personal information&nbsp;  
  
<p>The fines can be up to $2,500 for unintentional violations and $7,500 for intentional violations, which will be multiplied per record stolen in the case of a data breach.</p> 
 US — Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)  
<p>The GLBA has a specific <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/how-comply-privacy-consumer-financial-information-rule-gramm-leach-bliley-act">Privacy of Consumer Financial Information Rule</a> that directly affects financial services cybersecurity. This concerns non-public personal information (NPI) that a company will collect when informing about or providing a financial product or service. Fines for non-compliance can be up to $100,000 per violation and five years in prison for complicit directors.</p> 
 EU — General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
<p>All companies processing the data of European Union citizens are affected by the GDPR. The law determines how data is used and protected and governs how consent must be used for collecting it. Along with data usage, timely reporting of breaches is also obliged if it affects EU citizens.</p> 
<p>For financial services cybersecurity, adhering to GDPR in 2023 is essential. Failure to do so can lead to fines of $20 million or 4% of global revenue, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/amazon-given-record-888-million-eu-fine-for-data-privacy-breach">Amazon receiving the biggest fine so far of $888 million</a>.</p> 
 UK — Data Protection Act  
<p>After the UK left the EU, it kept the GDPR which it passed into law as the <a href="https://uk-gdpr.org/">Data Protection Act (2018)</a>. It is roughly the same as the EU-GDPR (just amended for UK citizens) but still carries the same requirements around data safety, consent and reporting, and fines for non-compliance.</p> 
 EU — Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2)  
<p>The PSD2 was introduced to make it easier for financial services companies to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/open-banking-psd2-and-achieving-strong-customer-authentication">integrate and securely share data</a> while making payment systems safer. In addition, the law set specific technical standards for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-guide/strong-customer-authentication-psd2">strong customer authentication</a> and improving security measures.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The measures affect all companies catering to consumers in the EU and any payments that start, travel through or end in the EU. This puts clear obligations on financial services cybersecurity, even for firms outside the EU.</p> 
 Global — Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)  
<p>The PCI-DSS covers the processors of payments from major credit and debit card companies. To achieve compliance, financial services cybersecurity programs must meet several obligations, such as protecting cardholder data, encrypting data in storage and transmission, and authenticating access to all system components. Breaches of the PCI-DSS may result in fines and restrictions in using major credit cards.</p> 
 Singapore — Monetary Authority of Singapore Notices on Cyber Hygiene  
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulates financial institutions in the banking, capital markets, insurance and payments sectors. The <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/cyber-security">MAS has issued </a>a collection of notices on cyber hygiene, which are a set of legally binding requirements that financial institutions must take to mitigate the growing risk of cyberthreats. The cyber hygiene notices cover six key areas, which include securing administrative account access, regular vulnerability patching and mitigation controls for systems that cannot be patched, written and regularly tested security standards, perimeter defense systems, malware protection and multi-factor authentication for any system used to access critical information.</p> 
 Canada - Bill C-11  
<p>Expected to be passed into law in Canada in early 2023, <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2022/op-c11_addario/">Part 1 of Bill C-11</a> will introduce the Consumer Privacy Protection Act (CPPA) into law. The regulations are heavily based on the NYDFS Part 500 and give recommendations on securing systems and data, as well as obligations on the collection, usage and storage of data.</p> 
 US — FFIEC Standards  
<p>The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is an interagency body that sets standards for all federally supervised financial institutions, including their subsidiaries. The FFIEC cybersecurity best practices includes guidance on effective <a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/press/pdf/Authentication-and-Access-to-Financial-Institution-Services-and-Systems.pdf">authentication and access risk management practices</a>. The <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/ffiec-endorses-passwordless-mfa">FFIEC authentication standards</a> emphasize multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a critical security control against financial loss and data compromise, similar to the PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication mandate. It includes references to NIST standards SP 1800-17 and SP 800-63B, which provide implementation guidelines for passwordless MFA based on FIDO specifications.</p> 
 US — FTC Safeguards Rule  
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-safeguards-rule-what-your-business-needs-know">FTC Safeguards Rule</a> requires non-banking financial institutions, such as mortgage brokers, auto dealers, and payday lenders, to implement a comprehensive security program to keep their customers’ information safe. The FTC Safeguards Rule was recently updated, with the compliance deadline set for June 9, 2023. Among the new provisions is a mandate for multi-factor authentication for anyone accessing customer information. It should be noted that this includes <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-passwordless-desktop-mfa-is-critical">MFA for desktop and server access</a>, not just applications.</p> 
 Protect Data and Systems with Strong Authentication  
<p>The financial services sector is at high risk of cyberattacks due to the value of successful data breaches or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">account takeover attacks</a>. To combat this, state, national and supranational governments and industry groups have introduced several financial services cybersecurity regulations to ensure best practice is deployed throughout the industry.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A common thread throughout much of the financial services cybersecurity regulations worldwide is the protection of data and stronger authentication systems. HYPR's True Passwordless MFA solution uses FIDO2, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-fido2-authentication">the "gold standard" of phishing-resistant MFA</a>, to help companies secure their systems and achieve regulatory compliance.

 Summary 
<p>Nowadays, most individuals operate in a digital environment where transactions and communication are made online. As a result, digital identity verification has become a very important aspect of online security and compliance.</p>
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) is one of the most widely used methods for verifying the identities of users and clients. While KYC has been effective in assuring security and regulatory compliance, it has some significant drawbacks. KYC can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult for users, potentially resulting in losing customers and missing business opportunities.</p>

 KYC: Potential Issues to Consider 
<p>Even though KYC has become a commonly used procedure in many industries, it has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Here as some examples:</p>
 
 The collection of personally identifiable information (PII) for KYC purposes comes with legal responsibilities and storage costs, which can take a toll on companies.&nbsp; 
 Users have a tendency to dislike KYC checks, finding them intrusive and time-consuming. This can lead to lower conversion rates and a negative first impression for potential customers.&nbsp; 
 Implementing KYC can be a difficult and expensive process, further adding to its disadvantages.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Perhaps the time to explore alternative ways of verifying customer identities has come. With SelfKey iD, you can explore methods that are less tedious for all parties involved.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD 
<p>As stated above, KYC processes can be inconvenient for both companies and customers alike. However, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Ai-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> method along with SelfKey iD can potentially become a better alternative to KYC.</p>
<p>Here are some of SelfKey.iD’s benefits:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The overall process is easier and less costly, making it more accessible for users.&nbsp; 
 The onboarding process is quick. 
 Ongoing monitoring makes sure that customer data remains accurate. 
 Existing KYC checks are reused, thus the need to collect and store PII repeatedly is no longer an issue. 
 Costs for companies are reduced, but also improves customer privacy and security. 
 It provides powerful compliance tools, ensuring that companies remain in compliance with regulations and laws.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can streamline their KYC processes, reducing costs, enhancing customer privacy, and improving compliance. Ultimately, this results in a better experience for customers and a more efficient and secure system for companies.</p>
<p>Below, we will discuss some of SelfKey iDs benefits more in depth.</p>
 High-Level Flow 
<p>SelfKey iD enables zero-knowledge interactions between individuals, making sure that users' data is kept private and secure. With SelfKey iD, the user's data does not reach your server. This adds to user privacy and prevents potential data breaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the onboarding process is quick and simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user with a SelfKey iD visits your server, they are checked to determine if they match your filter. If they do, they can be onboarded instantly, simplifying the process and reducing the time and resources required.</p>
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can provide a secure and efficient onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security. The zero-knowledge interactions and instant onboarding features make it a better alternative to traditional KYC processes.</p>
 Quick Relying Party Onboarding 
<p>To streamline the onboarding process, the following steps are required:</p>
 
 Sign up at SelfKey iD to create your user filters. 
 Add these filters to your smart contracts. 
 When a user attempts to run your smart contract function, the system will check if they have a SelfKey iD NFT. If they do not have one, they will be prompted to get one. 
 If the issuer has a SelfKey iD NFT, they will then be able to verify whether the user matches the filter that you have set for the transaction. If they do, the user will be granted access to your server. If not, the user will be denied access. 
 
<p>Following these steps, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system ensures that only authorized users are given access to the company's services. This reduces the risk of relying parties allowing access to unauthorized individuals to their services.</p>
 The Issuance: SelfKey iD NFT User Flow 
<p>The issuance process for SelfKey iD is outlined below:</p>
 
 The user visits your project and is redirected to SelfKey iD, in case they do not already have one. 
 The user pays for the verification check. 
 The user goes through the verification process, and the issuer stores their data. Ongoing monitoring of the account begins. 
 If the user passes the checks, the issuer releases a credential that verifies the user's humanity, uniqueness in the database, and verified data. 
 The user then mints their own SelfKey iD NFT. 
 
<p>By following these steps, users can obtain a SelfKey iD NFT that verifies their identity and potentially provides access to various projects that use the SelfKey iD platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verification process ensures that only authorized users are granted access, providing enhanced security and privacy for both users and companies.</p>
<p>Enhanced security offers several benefits such as:</p>
 
 Anti-bot security. This measure prevents automated attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious or malicious bot traffic. 
 Fraud protection. Bots are often used for fraudulent activities like creating fake accounts or generating false clicks to generate revenue. Implementing anti-bot security measures helps to identify and prevent such fraudulent activities, keeping the business and customers safe. 
 Improved user experience. Bots can significantly hinder the user experience by slowing down websites or making it difficult for users to access information. Anti-bot security measures ensure that legitimate users can access the website or service without interruptions or delays. 
 
 The Verification: SelfKey iD User Onboarding 
<p>The onboarding process for SelfKey.iD is as follows:</p>
 
 A user with a SelfKey iD visits your project. 
 You request that the SelfKey iD issuer checks the user's information. 
 The issuer verifies whether the user's data matches your filters. 
 The issuer sends a signed message confirming the user's status.&nbsp; 
 If the user is verified, they can be onboarded, and the signed message can be used to authorize transactions. 
 The relying party (issuer) is billed for the verification check. 
 
<p>Through this process, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding method that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system makes sure that only authorized users are granted access to the company's services. The use of a signed message adds an extra layer of security, offering further assurance that the user's data has been verified by the relying party.</p>
 Reusable KYC and SelfKey iD 
<p>The benefits of using reusable KYC with SelfKey iD are as follows:</p>
 
 Your project subscribes to SelfKey iD. 
 Your project can be featured on the SelfKey iD website. 
 A user with a SelfKey iD NFT visits the SelfKey iD website. 
 The user scrolls through the list of projects that support SelfKey iD. 
 The user can potentially choose your project from the list. 
 The user quickly onboards to your project using their existing SelfKey iD NFT. 
 Your project profits from the seamless onboarding experience. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's reusable KYC system could provide companies with a more streamlined onboarding experience for users. Users can easily access multiple projects without having to go through the time-consuming and costly process of verifying their identity each time.</p>
<p>Additionally, companies benefit from increased user adoption and loyalty, as the reusable KYC system encourages users to choose projects that support SelfKey iD. Overall, this system offers a win-win situation for both companies and users alike.</p>
 SelfKey iD New Project Setup 
<p>Setting up a new project with SelfKey iD is quite easy. Below, we will detail a few steps which you need to consider.</p>
 The project onboarding process is as follows:&nbsp; 
 
 Go to the SelfKey iD website. 
 Register for a new account. 
 Add your company privacy policy to your account. 
 Choose a subscription pack that suits your needs. 
 Set up filters to verify your users' identity. 
 Your project is now ready to implement the filters into your system. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's easy-to-use platform could offer companies a quick and efficient way to set up their project's identity verification process. The platform provides a range of subscription plans to choose from, depending on your business's specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ability to customize filters for your users, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, enhancing security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, SelfKey iD's new project setup process offers a simple and effective solution for individuals looking to integrate identity verification into their systems</p>
 The Library Implementation

 Implement the SelfKey iD smart contract into your own smart contract. 
 Your project is now ready to onboard users. 
 
<p>By following these steps, you can integrate SelfKey iD into your project's system and take advantage of its powerful identity verification capabilities. With the backend library in place, your server will be able to communicate with SelfKey iD to authorize user access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By integrating the smart contract into your own contract, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, boosting security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey iD's library implementation process offers a robust solution for businesses looking to enhance their identity verification capabilities.</p>
 How the Profile Builder Functions: 
<p>SelfKey iD's Profile Builder is a tool that allows you to create customizable filters for your project. These filters could be used to sort and manage users based on specific criteria.</p>
<p>The Profile Builder allows you to create multiple filters, which can be implemented separately on your project. This means that you can have different filters applied to different sections of your app or website, depending on your specific needs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 You could create a filter that accepts citizens of Country A for one section of your app, but another filter for the same project that excludes citizens of Country A from another section.&nbsp; 
 This level of detailed filtering allows you to match regulatory requirements while also boosting the benefits of your app. 
 
<p>To set up the Profile Builder, you would first define the standards you want to filter by, such as citizenship, age, or profession. You can then apply rules and conditions to each filter to create a customized sorting system.</p>
<p>For the most part, the Profile Builder in SelfKey iD could provide a flexible and powerful tool for managing user data and creating a tailored experience for your app's users.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>SelfKey aims to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the needs of both businesses and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of SelfKey iD could include efficient, secure, and cost-effective KYC checks, streamlined onboarding, and better conversion rates. Additionally, SelfKey iD's approach to privacy ensures legal compliance and reduces costs associated with PII storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, with a user-friendly one-time KYC process and access to multiple projects on the website, SelfKey iD offers convenience and ease of use for users. SelfKey iD's project features and powerful user filtering tools could enable businesses to match rules and increase profitability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Establishing a new legislative structure for the digitalisation of commercial trade documents and enabling digital identity for corporates are the most discussed trade transformation topics of 2022.</p>
<p>In an episode published on the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/electronic-trade-documents-bill/" title="Ubisecure Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast">Ubisecure Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast</a>, the relationship between digital identity and the trade business, as well as the legal reforms regarding data driven trade, are discussed very articulately. Chris Southworth, Secretary General of ICC United Kingdom, and Oswald Kuyler, former director of the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, both leading names in this industry, clearly convey the work done in the direction of digitalisation of trade and the roadmap for removing barriers.</p>
<p>Significant and major legal reform steps have been taken, continuously and decisively, in the UK, Germany, France, China and further G7 countries for the digitalisation of international trade.</p>
<p>What needs to be understood about digitalisation is not just the conversion of paper trade documents into a digital format like PDF, but also the gathering of data from papers with AI technology.</p>
<p>The legal reforms such as the UK’s Electronic Trade Documents Bill&nbsp;allows for certain trade documents to be digital, such as bills of lading, bills of exchange, promissory notes, warehouse receipts, and insurance documents. These currently must be on paper and physically possessed. Under the Bill, digital trade documents – in other words, trade data – will be on the same legal footing as their paper-based equivalents.</p>
 Why do we need this legal reform? 
<p><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2022-11-07/debates/EFDEB437-4656-42AA-B3FF-0531B0DFA9BB/ElectronicTradeDocumentsBill(HL">The problem is pretty simple</a>: to have possession of goods—if they are under a bill of lading, for example—you must be able to possess that document. It is much more than a contract of terms, but it is a possessive document. Possess the paper and you possess the goods. How is it possible to take this ownership into a digital and intangible, and yet in so many ways so contested, world?</p>
<p>With the standardisation of the trade data used by the main stakeholders of international trade, who are logistic providers, banks and insurance sectors, we will experience a kind of digital revolution similar to that of the inclusion of internet usage in the 1980s, which caused the information age and globalisation of the world. Today, for example, the ICC’s Digital Standards Initiative (DSI) and the United Nations Centre for trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) lead these standardisation efforts in cooperation with sectors such as logistics and banking towards a new world age.</p>
 Cornerstones of Digitalisation 
 Enabling Wide Usage of Digital Identities 
<p>The main two cornerstones that will ensure digitalisation in trade are enabling wide usage of digital identities by corporates and transacting with electronic transferable records.</p>
<p>Digitalisation decisions of leading countries eventually will help to relax anti-terrorist regulations and KYC processes of bankers which tied them up in knots in terms of operational processes, with the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA and then the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>In addition, with digital identity, it will be easier for SMEs to access new supply chain networks but also financial resources. The trade finance space of SMEs is calculated to close the 1.5 trillion USD financing gap.</p>
<p>In supply chain management, it is not easy for a buyer company to onboard a reliable supplier that will provide goods to the production line. In order to ensure trust in trade transactions, these problems should be figured out, who the supplier company is in real life and whether it actually produces what it says or its trade partners or references are really their partners as claimed by the supplier, and more importantly, which staff are authorised to sign on behalf of the corporate. For this reason, cumbersome bureaucratic procedures are carried out in the processes of carrying goods, sharing information and transferring payments between the parties of the trade.</p>
<p>As trust and transparency cannot be provided, aside from the operational costs, the rapidly growing supply chain financing gap of SMEs can’t be tackled. Clearly, there has been great potential in the field of finance.</p>
<p>Additionally, if trade business can reduce operational costs, paperwork can be shifted to make our world a better place in the sense of sustainability.</p>
 Transacting with Electronic Transferable Records 
<p>Another main cornerstone of digitalisation is aligning national legal frameworks to run on electronic transferable records. Which means handling of data, instead of paper, in trade transactions.</p>
<p>Recently, when I asked why an SME owner doesn’t export, they said “I don’t have the time and resources to trade with a ‘red tape’”. Imagine that there are no bureaucratic processes in an export! With the widespread use of digital identity, a supplier can trade without needing bank intelligence or references. What a great potential!</p>
<p>In order to tackle the rapidly deteriorating climate problem of the world, complying with the international legal regulations of ESG and 0-Carbon is not a “nice to have” situation, but it has become an inevitable necessity. This means that legal authorities should reach sensitive commercial trade data of the corporates.</p>
<p>In order to carry out legal inspections, transparent data on trade is crucial; not the information that companies, customs, terminal operators and banks try to collect one by one from papers stuck in data silos.</p>
<p>In this case, the most important technological need is to provide data confidentiality, which will provide the element of trust between the trade parties. The privacy of commercial data is almost even more important than the privacy of individual data. Individuals have been sharing their personal information, private stories, and photos every day for years. After fearlessly sharing it on social media such as Facebook and Instagram, the world started to discuss and take precautions on personal data privacy.</p>
 Data Confidentiality in Digital Identities for Legal Entities 
<p>In commercial life, neither companies nor logistics providers nor banks can scatter their data as boldly as individuals, saying “it’s good to go digital”. It is very important which information will be disclosed to whom in the digital identities of legal entities.</p>
<p>The legal presence, name and address information of the company in the country where it is located may be public and available to all trading partners, but for example, its balance sheet, profitability, credibility in banks, trading partners or signatories with which it does business cannot be public.</p>
<p>Similarly, the data on the bill of lading, which includes, for example, the buyer of the exported goods, must be confidential. This data, which cannot be processed because it is stuck in papers at the moment, provides a kind of “confidentiality” indeed. However, to make world trade of this size sustainable, we must change all paper-based processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the decreasing trust in central structures as a result of financial crises, the only technological solution that can pave the way for central structures that are insufficient to manage the world trade exceeding 22 trillion USD, seems to be Blockchain and DLT today.</p>
 Tackling digitalisation 
<p>Will the efforts of the country’s customs to facilitate trade solve the problem of digitalisation and transparent data? I think it will be insufficient. Because the main data owner parties that carry out international trade are corporates, and it seems like the only way to focus on companies’ needs is to evolve digitalisation.</p>
 The Impact of ICC Regulation 
<p>The latest regulation of the ICC, such as the URDTT (Uniform Rules for Digital Trade Transactions), is one of the most concrete steps taken on this path. For the first time in its history, the ICC Banking Commission has published a set of rules that focuses on corporates, not Banks. Even the word “Bank” is not mentioned in the URDTT, and financial service providers are included as a secondary source for risk mitigation or financing.</p>
<p>UNCTAD- #MLETR (Model Law on Electronic Records) is also the best example of this as a draft model law. This Model Law has succeeded in drafting a legal text that stipulates providing commercial data privacy as the top priority of transacting with electronic trade data. Now there is a need for neutral entities such as the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).</p>
<p>The trade industry is struggling to form neutral and interoperable entities of digitalisation which are valid internationally and in cooperation with local (legal) structures. I think this is the right form of governance of digitalisation.</p>
 Benefits of the Digitalisation 
<p>With the digitalisation journey, not only will the problems in the management and financing of supply chains will be resolved. But also, the smuggling, fraud, corruption and VAT losses that countries face will be mostly controlled. The fraudsters, who know the commercial documents and banking process, are now living a good life thanks to the run-down structure based on paper.</p>
<p>Not to mention the VAT losses; in the UK alone, the VAT deficit is estimated at £9 billion. If we make a rough calculation considering the VAT leakage amount in the total imports of goods and services (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-trade-in-numbers/uk-trade-in-numbers-web-version#import-statistics">£609 billion</a>) of the UK in 2020, we can say that the VAT loss of all countries in world trade is about 2.3 trillion USD. Such a huge amount!</p>
<p>It is time to start global cooperation in the field of digitalisation and international digital identity. It would be beneficial to roll up our sleeves for cooperation in the field of digitalisation and international digital identity. By controlling this kind of fraud, we can use revealed sources for SME’s finance and complying with ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) rules or tackling the climate crisis.</p>
 Global Digitalisation Growth 
<p>There are 53 countries in the UK’s commonwealth and the most prominent countries which meet the same basis with English Law are India, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. With the adoption of the electronic trade document law, which is currently in the “fast track” stage in the UK legislative process, great impact on the commonwealth area will be seen. Moreover, the adoption of English law in international trade agreements and letters of credit is a centuries-old tradition in the world.</p>
<p>Germany, France and the USA have made significant progress in the adoption of the electronic trade document law. China, on the other hand, is taking firm steps forward in this area. These countries have a large area of influence and the potential for the acceleration of data-driven digital electronic trade is quite high in the coming years.</p>
<p>Therefore, digital supply chain documents and finance operating platforms such as the Bolero International (WiseTech Global Group), Contour, Essdocs, which have managed Rulebooks, will find themselves a great commercial opportunity with digital data-based trade that has become law. Although technology provider platforms based on blockchain technology experienced “winter conditions” in 2022, they will be able to scale rapidly from 2023 with the availability of legal infrastructures.</p>
 How should organisations prepare for digitalisation? 
<p>So, what should companies and banks do for the upcoming digitalisation era?</p>
<p>Is it wise to wait for these developments to mature?</p>
<p>Especially small companies and local banks seem far from creating a vision to prepare for the effects of the big change coming. Some large companies think that they can adapt to digitalisation by relying on their size, but if they do not prepare their workforce, which is their most valuable resource in their medium-term business plans, they will not only be more vulnerable to negative impacts like COVID, but also may lose their competitive advantage in their own sector. In the view of that what should companies do? Watch out for upcoming articles.</p>

<p>After some of the basics of quantum computing are explored in the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/introduction-to-quantum-computing-and-post-quantum-cryptography-pqc/">introductory episode of the Entrust Engage podcast</a>, episode two takes listeners deeper into the science behind this topic with an <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/the-science-behind-quantum-computers/">interview featuring Dr. Carmen Palacios-Berraquero</a>, award-winning quantum physicist and CEO of Nu Quantum. &nbsp;Many interesting areas were covered – from a brief history of quantum computing to what the future benefits of this field might be. Here are the 6 key takeaways from this episode:</p>
<p>#1: The episode kicked off with a concise history of quantum computing, which goes back to the ’80s when people first began to look at how to apply quantum theory to computing. Then in the ’90s, Shor’s algorithm was developed, which significantly sped up the calculation of factorization problems and was the first step in potentially breaking RSA encryption. Experimental physicists also found new hardware in which you could encode quantum information. Progress in quantum computing continued to exponentially accelerate in the 2000s and 2010s and led to a kind of modern-day space race of different hardware approaches. In these earlier years the field was still largely an academic endeavor, whereas in the past seven years the academic pioneers of this race moved into the industry to set up startups. In 2019, Google declared “quantum supremacy.” And in 2021, more than $3 billion was invested into quantum computing, further cementing its importance to the future of technology.</p>
<p>#2: So, what exactly is “quantum supremacy”? For starters, Dr. Palacios-Berraquero prefers the term “quantum advantage.” When Google announced that it had achieved this, what did that really mean? How significant was this?</p>
<p>Well, Google was essentially successful in using quantum computing to solve a problem that would have been infeasible for a classical computer. However, the problem it solved had no application in the real world. While the industry is moving toward solving commercially useful problems, there is still progress to be made before any organization can consider itself to have a true quantum advantage.</p>
<p>#3: There is consensus that the quantum computing threat to traditional public key algorithms will be a reality within the decade. However, taking Google’s 2019 claim of quantum supremacy into consideration, the question arises: Has this timeline been accelerated?</p>
<p>The answer: not necessarily. There are two main factors to consider here. The first is that it is very hard to scale these machines. The second is that there are lots of errors in quantum computers’ processors. Error correction schemes are very complex and take up quite a few logical qubits in quantum computers, leaving fewer qubits to perform logical computations. So, even with the progress made at present, the threat timeline of quantum computers has not accelerated.</p>
<p>#4: Is the news about quantum computing all about its threats and challenges? Echoing what we learned from episode one, absolutely not! There are major benefits that quantum computing can unlock in the future. For starters, quantum computing can crack those intractable problems we can’t currently solve today. This opens entirely new applications, markets, and industries. Some examples include both material and drug design, paving the way for innovations in healthcare and the battle against climate change. In the near term, quantum computing promises benefits like financial portfolio optimization, improvements in machine learning algorithms, and the simulation of quantum and physical systems.</p>
<p>#5: &nbsp;What is a quantum random number generator and how different is it from what we know of entropy in cryptography today? The quantum random number generator is based on the main proposition of quantum theory that the outcome of a measurement is completely unpredictable. It uses this principle to generate entropy/random numbers. Over the past decade, it has been proposed to use these generators as a source for cryptography.</p>
<p>The main difference is that entropy used in cryptography currently is based on classical mechanics, where theoretically everything is predictable. In theory, by knowing the exact functioning of a system and combining it with a lot of computing power, you could predict the outcome of a classical random number generator.</p>
<p>The reality is quite different, though. Current cryptography uses mathematical tools in addition to a random number generator, making it quite impossible to crack. While the industry is debating the use and applications of a quantum random number generator, it’s still a long way from adopting it in cryptography.</p>
<p>#6: Additional benefits in development include quantum computing as a service (QCaas) and quantum internet. These are two very different things. QCaaS is a means by which users can access quantum computers via the cloud. For example, AWS hosts around five quantum computers, and a user can buy time on them through the cloud and run various algorithms. And there’s a long line of users queued up to use these computers. Who are these users? A mix of academics and researchers as well as R&amp;D departments in industry. However, these machines are still in the labs of companies, and it will be a while before they can function independently in a data center.</p>
<p>Now let’s unravel the service known as quantum internet. Picture a computer network that can send quantum information between distant computers, and there you have it in a nutshell. This technology is still largely contained to the realm of academia, and it’s still unknown what the exact commercial application will be. What we do know is that it’s still some years away.</p>
<p>The science behind quantum computers is pretty fascinating, and if you’re looking to learn more, I recommend listening to the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/the-science-behind-quantum-computers/">second episode</a> of Entrust Engage.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Ensuring that only authorized individuals can access IT systems and data is at the core of cybersecurity, especially as most successful cyber-attacks are enabled by the abuse of stolen credentials. Access management, therefore, is an essential part of any cybersecurity strategy, but in the modern business world, where cloud computing, virtual machines, DevOps, automation, AI, and remote working are common, this can be extremely challenging.</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity of access management, these business IT technologies and practices increasingly involve the use of service accounts for humans and machines to perform IT tasks. These are commonly known as privileged accounts, which are given to privileged users to enable them to access critical resources and perform admin-level actions.</p>
<p>In the light of continually increasing and evolving cyber threats, management of this high-level access is critical for all modern businesses because the misuse of privileged accounts and credentials is a popular and powerful technique used by cyber attackers.</p>
 PAM necessary for almost everything related to business IT 
<p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are designed to enable organizations to deal with these challenges, and with today’s complex operating environments and interconnected machines, and the proliferation of privileged accounts, almost everything related to business IT has some need for PAM. But this is a dynamic and evolving market space driven by changing threats and business IT environments.</p>
<p>As a result of widespread adoption of cloud services, for example, Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) platforms are disrupting the traditional PAM market, demand for dynamic cloud access continues to grow, and Just in Time (JiT) and Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) demands are beginning to impact the market.</p>
 Customer Identity &amp; Access Management highlights in the EIC agenda&nbsp; 
<p>Whether your organization is considering implementing PAM for the first time or looking to replace or augment existing solutions, it is important to understand exactly why PAM is necessary, what are best practices, how this market is evolving, and the business benefits. A good place to start, is the dedicated <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/935">PAM track</a> at this year’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud &nbsp;Conference</a>.</p>
<p>In the modern business world, there is an increasing demand for contact-free onboarding experiences, passwordless authentication, decentralized identity, and policy-based access. Get up to speed with these and other trends in access management and learn how to future-proof existing access management investments in a session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5323/3">Access Management Trends in a Connect Anywhere World</a>.</p>
<p>Drilling down to the specific topic of Privileged Access Management (PAM), it is important to recognize that all organizations are different and so it is important to choose the PAM solution that best fits your organization’s technical, security, and business requirements. Discover what the PAM market has to offer and how to choose the right solution in this market overview for <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5334/1">Privileged Access Management Solutions</a>.</p>
<p>As already discussed, privileged accounts are very powerful and are a top target for cybercriminals, but they are often anonymous and shared. Learn how to take control of privileged access in this session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5323/1">Trust No One, Always Verify</a>.</p>

 <p></p><p>The United States’ potential ban of TikTok is the latest and loudest warning sign of our increasing need for a decentralized internet. Consumers are quickly wondering where they’ll go for their short form video content if TikTok is taken away. Creators are faced with the reality that their income could immediately dry up if the most viral social media platform to date disappears. Lastly, businesses could potentially watch one of their most powerful distribution channels go up in flames overnight.</p><p>Distribution and content, two of the most valuable assets on TikTok, are currently owned by the platform instead of the users who worked so hard for them. A follower on TikTok can’t be transferred outside of the platform, and a video on the social media giant is currently owned and stored on TikTok’s servers. It’s the very nature of Web2 infrastructure that platforms like TikTok absorb an incredible amount of ownership and responsibility to store, manage, and steward the relationships and data on them, putting end users and businesses at risk.</p><p>So what’s the alternative? How can we build platforms that turn over data ownership to the users of that platform rather than hoard massive amounts of power? The answer is to build Web5 applications that enable users to maintain ownership of their data so platforms can stick to what they do best: curating and serving that data.</p><p>Let’s consider the model a platform like TikTok currently uses. They ask users to upload videos to TikTok servers and then store, sort, organize, and serve that content. In a Web5 world, users could store their own videos on their own decentralized web node(s) and grant access to that content to TikTok. TikTok would adhere to a common schema to access that content - one that any other platform, such as Facebook or Instagram could access as well, and then layer its own metadata such as likes, comments, and analytics on top of that.</p><p>Follower counts wouldn’t need to be limited to a single platform, instead allowing users with a single decentralized identifier to follow users, creators, or businesses across platforms. This would decouple platforms and distribution, meaning that the marketing power of individuals and businesses wouldn’t be wholly subject to the whim of community guidelines or editorial discretion of platform owners. In this model, a TikTok ban would simply mean that TikTok’s metadata - like counts, comments, and other analytics - would be stripped away, but the content and creator-follower relationships would persist. TikTok and platforms like it would still be able to curate their excellent algorithms, monetize on in-feed ads, and more, while holding less power over their users’ content and reducing the overhead of storing incredibly large amounts of video content on behalf of their users.</p><p>If a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub</a> or join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">Discord</a>.</p>

  New South Wales Senator Andrew Bragg has recently introduced a crypto services regulation bill in the Australian Parliament.  Titled the Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill 2023, the regulation may introduce a crypto licensing regime.  Australia has a considerable crypto market, with more than 25% of the population owning cryptocurrency in the&nbsp;country.  <p>In a noteworthy development for the Australian cryptocurrency landscape, Senator Andrew Bragg, a member of the Australian Liberal Party from New South Wales, has introduced a new bill to the Australian Parliament. This proposed legislation seeks to implement regulations for crypto services in the country, potentially impacting the future of the crypto ecosystem and its&nbsp;users.</p><p>If Senator Bragg’s proposals receive approval, a person or business would be required to hold an ASIC or foreign license to operate a crypto exchange. ASIC stands for the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The same would apply to crypto custody service providers and stablecoin issuers in the&nbsp;country.</p> How Popular Cryptocurrencies are Among Australians? <p>The share of people who own cryptocurrency in Australia is more than <a href="https://swyftx.com/au/blog/25-percent-of-australians-now-own-cryptocurrency/">25%</a>, implying that nearly one in four adults in Australia own some cryptocurrency. In line with the nature of the crypto market at large, Bitcoin is the leading currency in the country, and the foremost reason to invest is portfolio diversification.</p><p>Despite the significant presence of cryptocurrencies in Australians’ financial strategies, regulatory frameworks surrounding these assets are still in development. The recent release of the ‘Token Mapping’ consultation paper in February highlights the ongoing efforts to establish fundamental definitions and guidelines for the sector. This paper represents a crucial step toward shaping the future of cryptocurrency regulations in the country as it attempts to set the basic definitions applicable to the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Returning to the bill moved by Senator Bragg, there are more recommendations apart from the licensing regime for service providers.</p> Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill&nbsp;2023 <p>Senator Bragg insists the Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill 2023 seeks to ‘protect consumers and promote investors’, especially in the wake of FTX collapse and the apparent inaction of the Australian Government in bringing regulatory clarity to the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>While setting the pretext for why this bill was necessary, Bragg pointed out the Labour government’s failure in not following through on 12 crypto regulation recommendations introduced by the Senate Select Committee on Australia as a technology and financial center in October&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-to-vote-on-mica-in-april">EU to Vote on Mica in&nbsp;April</a></p> How Does the Proposed Bill Impact the Crypto&nbsp;Users? <p>As cryptocurrency users in Australia eagerly anticipate the potential impact of the proposed bill, it’s essential to understand the implications for the community at large. And to better understand the potential impact of any bill, it’s crucial to look at its upsides as well as the downsides, and that’s exactly what we will do&nbsp;here.</p> The Upsides <p>If passed, the bill would create a robust regulatory framework governing crypto exchanges, custody services, and stablecoin issuers. From a user’s perspective, this translates to increased protection and security, as the bill outlines specific obligations and requirements for these entities.</p><p>These requirements, including capital and minimum reserve requirements, customer fund segregation, customer holdings reporting, auditing, assurance, and disclosure arrangements, are designed to foster a trustworthy and transparent crypto environment. Now, let’s look at the negative aspect of the&nbsp;bill.</p> The Downsides <p>The potential consequences of this legislation are manifold, as it could affect users’ experiences, privacy, and the overall market landscape.</p><p>The bill’s provisions concerning capital and minimum reserve requirements may result in increased operating costs for crypto exchanges and stablecoin issuers. As these entities grapple with the financial burden of compliance, they could pass the costs onto users in the form of higher transaction fees, reduced rewards, or limited access to services.</p><p>This would ultimately make cryptocurrency transactions less attractive and accessible for users, potentially deterring newcomers and hindering the market&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Privacy concerns could also arise due to the bill’s customer fund segregation and customer holdings reporting requirements. As crypto service providers are obligated to disclose their clients’ holdings to regulators, users may feel that their financial privacy is jeopardized.</p><p>This might undermine one of the main attractions of cryptocurrencies — the promise of pseudonymous, decentralized transactions — and deter users from engaging with these services.</p><p>The auditing, assurance, and disclosure arrangements mandated by the bill could negatively impact crypto users by prompting more stringent security measures. While these provisions are intended to protect users and maintain transparency, they might inadvertently result in longer transaction processing times, more complex user interfaces, or the implementation of invasive identity verification processes. Such developments could make the user experience cumbersome and discourage usage in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>However, private members’ or private senators’ bills, like the one introduced by Senator Bragg, often take months or even years to pass through the Australian Parliament.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kongs-proposed-asset-regulation-sparks-industry-optimism">Hong Kong’s Proposed Asset Regulation Sparks Industry&nbsp;Optimism</a></p> Final Note <p>The bill could have both negative and positive ramifications for the industry, striking a balance between consumer protection and innovation. As such, lawmakers must carefully consider the potential implications of this legislation on the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector and its users, ensuring that the regulatory framework fosters growth while safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders involved.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/australias-latest-crypto-bill-explained-b10fbc46baf8">Australia’s Latest Crypto Bill Explained</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 We sit down with the eIDAS, digital identity, digital signatures and PKI expert to discuss digital wallets, eIDAS 2.0, and why Italy’s Public Digital Identity System (SPID) is such a success. 



 



 One of the chief aims of eIDAS 2.0 is for all EU member states to make a Digital Identity Wallet available to every citizen who wants one. Are there any countries that you would consider further ahead, or behind, in achieving this than others? 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS 2.0</a> is setting a completely new framework for the European digital identities and digital trust services. This is one of the more ambitious projects of the European Union, with different streams going parallel – the legislative process, standardization, EUDI Wallet Reference development, Large-Scale Pilots, Architecture and Reference Framework specifications. Many actors from public and private sectors have the same goal – doing digital identity right and within a very challenging timeframe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is hard to make predictions on which countries will be ahead and which ones behind, and I don’t believe we should look at eIDAS 2.0 as a race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All EU member states will deliver an EUDI Wallet to their citizens, which will happen in due time, as requested by the Regulation. The EUDI Wallet will have applications in the following main use cases: Payments, Driving Licenses, Educational Titles, Travel Credentials, and Organizational Identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some countries with an electronic identification scheme already in place, and others in the early stages of defining and framing one. And, while some countries have been offering digital services for many years, others are in the middle of their digital transformation. In the end, however, we will all reach the same point.</p>



 What role will standardization and open-source technology play in the future of digital identities? 



<p>Both play a fundamental role in the development and interoperability of digital identities and trust services around the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. There are several initiatives, led by European standardization bodies, that are focused on drafting standards in support of eIDAS 2.0 or updating existing ones where applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EUDI Wallet reference will be developed with an open-source licence. In this way it can be customized by each Member State to meet specific needs. An open-source code is accessible and transparent, enabling greater trust.</p>



 What are some of the major societal, cultural and economic benefits that digital identities can offer? Which industries will benefit most from eIDAS 2.0? 



<p>The most important parts of our social interactions are carried out on digital platforms today. Technology has enabled billions of people to tell their stories to a potentially unlimited audience. At the same time, technology increasingly defines who we are in the digital world, what we can do, and what information we can access, ultimately influencing how we think. As such, digital identities and personal information are defining our digital twin. It is therefore of paramount importance that we make sure we properly define the technology and governance that regulates our digital persona.&nbsp;</p>



<p>eIDAS 2.0 is an integral part of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/europes-digital-decade">Digital Decade</a>, which aims to provide at least 80% of EU citizens with a digital ID by 2030. This will enable holders to prove who they are cross-border, to give explicit consent to share pieces of personal information, to know exactly with whom they’ve shared personal information, and for what purpose. This technology will allow us to control our own data and how data is used. Reaching this point will be a quantum leap for the digital world, and all industries and the public sector will benefit.</p>

 The Italian eID scheme SPID is regarded as one of the world’s eID success stories. To what do you attribute its success? 



<p>SPID is a real success story, embraced by 34 million citizens who made over 1 billion transactions last year. There are several reasons for its success: it is provided and promoted by the private sector with a special attention to user friendliness and mobile capabilities; has been integrated in more than 16,000 public services and integrated for the provisioning of private services. There are many use cases, for example: with SPID you can request a change of residence, book a health service, consult your health records, send your tax applications, and digitally sign documents. Thanks to this widespread diffusion, SPID offers a multitude of services to its citizens and residents at a click of a button.</p>



 We are only scraping the surface of potential for digital identities and digital wallets. How do you foresee the future of eIDs? 



<p>Well, the future holds unlimited possibilities. We do everything online today – booking a flight, signing legal documents, opening bank accounts, asking for loans. All these use cases require different accounts, passwords and applications, and at some point, applicants will need to prove who they are. Identity proofing is the most painful, costly and frustrating experience of modern times. This will come to an end with the EUDI Wallet. In addition to be able to prove who we are, the EUDI Wallet will enable us to know with whom we are sharing our personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, to have eIDAS 2.0 delivering its full potential, it is important to educate the market, to explain the benefits to citizens, where the Wallet can be used, how it will allow them to control their data, and how to give or withdraw consent.</p>

It has also been crossposted on the blog of our project partner, <a href="http://mysociety.org/2023/03/30/neighbourhood-warmth-monthnotes/">mysociety</a>.</p> Month 0: It’s getting hot in&nbsp;here <p>Here’s a question posed by Immy Kaur at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/M18ovxgiIKQ?feature=share&amp;t=12504">Retrofit Reimagined</a> event last&nbsp;year:</p><blockquote>“What if the climate transition and retrofit of our homes and streets were designed, owned and governed by the people who live&nbsp;there?”</blockquote><p>This is one of those simple questions that holds within it the potential for amazing, transformative consequences. And perhaps the first of those consequences? <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> are kicking off a new partnership, with this proposition at its&nbsp;heart.</p><p>For the next few months we’ll be exploring how we might realise the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/new-value-flows-impact-modelling-and-financing-neighbourhood-retrofit-v0-1-8674f795cef8">Transitioning Together hypothesis</a>, developed by Dark Matter Labs. Together, we’ll build on <a href="https://research.mysociety.org/publications/prototyping-home-energy">lessons</a> from testing mySociety’s <a href="https://mysociety.github.io/neighbourhood-warmth">Neighbourhood Warmth prototype</a>, developed during <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/climate/climate-prototyping/">a series of prototyping weeks</a> in 2022 (pictured below). And we’ll co-create solutions with communities, to test our riskiest assumptions about how collective action on home energy could be catalysed through civic technology.</p>mySociety’s first <a href="https://pages.mysociety.org/neighbourhood-warmth/">Neighbourhood Warmth prototype</a> The spark <p>But how did we get&nbsp;here?</p><p>mySociety’s prototyping weeks allowed their <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/climate/">Climate Programme</a> to quickly dip a toe into several potential areas where their skills and experience could have an effect. The purpose was to understand the potential of civic technology to propel local climate action in each field. External participants generously made time to share their experience and wisdom, guiding a path through jungles of challenges and opportunities. mySociety built prototypes and tested these on the final day of each week to gather feedback. These were synthesised into tentative insights, which were woven into&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Home energy felt like a particularly complex domain to navigate, despite benefiting from the hard-earned knowledge of pioneers like <a href="https://www.powertochange.org.uk/news/carbon-coop-people-powered-revolution/">Jonathan Atkinson</a> during <a href="https://research.mysociety.org/publications/prototyping-home-energy">the second prototyping week</a>. This spurred additional <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qtTI3YuT7u6M3VYh-k4Mq5EYoBBtJKj_RS3n7CwaspU/edit?usp=sharing">research and engagement</a>, to deepen mySociety’s analysis and to explore collaboration.</p><p>Eventually, the idea coalesced that collective action on home energy could overcome critical limitations of the default, individualist approach: from the user experience and motivations, learning, risk and its perception, to level of ambition and the economies of scale. This aligns with the first of <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2021/11/24/three-shifts-well-make-to-repower-democracy/">three shifts</a> in mySociety’s current strategy — to design for the needs of society, not just provide tools for individual citizens.</p><p>mySociety discovered a handful of trailblazing initiatives that gesture towards the power of coordinated efforts: for example, Carbon Co-op’s <a href="https://carbon.coop/portfolio/levenshulme-abs/">Levenshulme Area Based Retrofit Scheme</a> and Connected Places Catapult’s <a href="https://cp.catapult.org.uk/report/integrated-planning-for-net-zero/">Community Retrofit Service</a> prototype — but no sign of a mature digital infrastructure to support a shift away from atomised&nbsp;action.</p><p>As mySociety edged forwards with their route of enquiry, one organisation’s work proved particularly illuminating: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">Dark Matter Labs, who suggest</a> that a “systemic shift can be achieved by testing strategic interventions in the ‘dark matter’ of the retrofit ecosystem: through piloting and proving out new infrastructures, new standards, new legal patterns, or new institutions.”</p><p>Dark Matter Labs’ explorations around the entanglement of home energy with questions of democracy and justice chime with core concerns for mySociety — for a flavour, check out <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">‘A Right to Retrofit’</a>.</p><p>Their approach is a perfect fit for mySociety’s experimental spirit, and together we’re excited to be exploring how our work could be greater that the sum of its&nbsp;parts.</p>A vision of street-based retrofit, from Dark Matter Labs’ earlier work in the&nbsp;space Friction leads to&nbsp;fire <p>Right now we’re crafting a plan to build a functioning version of our Neighbourhood Warmth prototype. This is geared to answer the immediate question that we’re trying to address by the end of&nbsp;May:</p><blockquote>“How can we support communities to organise locally around a simple and achievable home energy&nbsp;action?”</blockquote><p>We believe there is a role for a civic digital platform that supports the process of community coalescing and organising, to open doors to the benefits of collective retrofit.</p><p>Once we’ve built something that people can interact with, we’re planning to test it in a few communities — a mix of places to learn how different contexts make for different outcomes.</p><p>In the final phase, we’ll analyse these lessons and start thinking about where this might go next — perhaps we’ll carry on and build some sort of fully-functioning digital service in this&nbsp;domain.</p><p>If we do, questions will inevitably arise about how people might discover it. We’d love to hear thoughts on that and on this work as a whole, <a href="http://info@darkmatterlabs.org">so please get in touch</a> and share this in any relevant communities.</p>

<p>As we approach the second quarter of 2023, AERGO team decided to hold the first Townhall for 2023. It is a moment to evaluate and reflect on our actions, and&nbsp;results.</p> Genesis of&nbsp;AERGO <p>AERGO was conceived in 2014, before the concept of Ethereum or EVM even existed, based on the initial direction of “blockchain for the enterprise.” Regardless of the industry and era, the need to quickly process large amounts of data in real time with SQL/JDBC support has been consistent. AERGO has been targeting the market through a private blockchain that provides an environment where existing enterprise customers can directly integrate their data with the blockchain.</p> Bridging the Two Universes: de-facto Enterprise to&nbsp;Consumer <p>Over the past few years, various projects based on public blockchains, such as DeFi and NFTs, have seemed to monopolize market attention and drive the growth of the blockchain market. However, private blockchains have been expanding their reach&nbsp;quietly.</p><p>The needs of the enterprise blockchain market are evolving in the form of “Layer 1.5,” which encompasses both private and public blockchains that require connectivity with various chains through technologies such as&nbsp;bridges.</p><p>This is why AERGO has been creating side chains that can interconnect and utilize resources in various environments, from enterprise to public blockchains, based on the core features of SQL language, D-DPOS consensus structure, and <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-merkle-bridge-what-else-is-needed-for-nft-c5170502da3a">Merkle bridges</a>. By utilizing the characteristics of Layer 1.5, AERGO is evolving into a de-facto enterprise blockchain that targets a wide range of enterprise customers, rather than a platform limited to the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Together with its core technology partners, Blocko and Blocko XYZ, AERGO is building and operating <a href="https://www.aergo.io/enterprise">blockchain solutions</a> for various corporate customers, including domestic and foreign entertainment and distribution management companies, and plans to secure more than 500,000 active users within the&nbsp;year.</p><p>In addition, in order to preempt the STO/e-securities field, which has recently attracted the attention of the financial sector, we have unveiled ‘Silvermine’, a security token issuance platform. Silvermine provides basic functions that are difficult to provide by existing cryptocurrency issuance platforms, including issuance, burning, increase and decrease, and division. With this, we plan to expand beyond STOs to non-financial assets such as carbon credits and other asset markets where transaction tracking is critical.</p> AERGO’s Expansion Towards the Public Ecosystem (NFT / Web&nbsp;3) <p>AERGO’s focus is not limited to enterprise blockchain. Through Blocko XYZ, we are expanding our platform to include NFTs and even ‘NFT-as-a-Service’, which allows us to provide additional services such as membership and personal information authentication using SBT (Soul-Bound Token).</p><p>Currently, Blocko XYZ has reduced the cumbersome NFT minting process of over 20 steps from membership to sale to 4 steps, minimized minting costs, and is currently managing about 300,000 active wallets (MAU=active users), with over 800,000 NFTs minted, and continues to increase its share of the domestic NFT&nbsp;market.</p><p>AERGO is planning to support ‘Composable Transaction’ to support the increase in transactions that will occur in the NFT and Web 3 fields in the future and activate the AERGO native token, and has started the transition of the exchange&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>In addition, we have established an <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-labs-funding-the-future-4d195c79858c">Ecosystem Fund</a> to expand the AERGO-based ecosystem and have been providing support to various DApp and service developers. Currently, the closest Dapp to launching is <a href="https://www.booost.live/">BOOOST</a>, an AERGO-based Web 3 social&nbsp;app.</p><p>BOOOST is currently undergoing closed beta testing which features walking and driving modes, but will soon expand into socializing. Users will not only be able to visualize the impact of their daily activities, but will also be able to curate a digital version of themselves, everything on a single app, one activity at a&nbsp;time.</p> Q&amp;A <p>Q1. Are AERGO and Blocko considering to offer alternative payment solutions beyond traditional merchant networks like GemPay&nbsp;still?</p><p>It’s a great question. Payments are an essential feature for expanding beyond just paying to buy goods, and into more services and solutions. It is also key to targeting the B2B market as well as the B2C market, which is why AERGO and Blocko are very positive about developing/introducing additional payment features. Due to volatile market conditions and unclear regulatory issues, it is not easy to launch a crypto-native payment system or DeFi system at the moment. However, AERGO and Blocko are preparing to utilize bridge/cross-chain technology to serve as a payment system in the near future. This will be included in the ‘AERGO 2.0 Whitepaper’, which will be released in May, and we will share more details in a future whitepaper.</p><p>Here’s a preview of what we’ve got lined up for the AERGO 2.0 Whitepaper:</p><p>AERGO Opsilo (working title): A lightweight and easy Web3 and app deployment platform where developers can develop and design Dapps and services while ensuring delivery quality, security, cost optimization, cost management, and compliance throughout the application lifecycle.</p><p>AERGO EVM-Compatibility: A fully EVM-compatible engine, enabling smart contracts written in Solidity to be supported on AERGO smart contract code base to support enterprise-grade applications and Web 3 Dapps in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>AERGO AI / ML: AI and Machine Learning will dynamically change how data is processed and audited. By combining AI / ML with the AERGO blockchain, we will continuously explore and seek to expand the possibilities of AERGO platform.</p><p>Q2. What are your thoughts about introducing new crypto primitives to AERGO mainnet? (i.e., DeFi solutions that allow people &amp; businesses to diversify out of USD, KRW into traditionally safe assets like vaulted tokenized gold &amp;&nbsp;silver)</p><p>In the wake of the recent Luna debacle, blockchain-based stable coins or pegged assets have become the number one target of financial regulators worldwide. While this is definitely something that will be needed in the future, the regulatory risk is too high to develop and launch right&nbsp;now.</p><p>However, a similar area that AERGO and Blocko are currently focusing on is tokenized securities(STOs). On February 3, the Financial Services Commission of South Korea announced to overhaul regulatory system on the issuance and circulation of security tokens. “Token securities” refers to securities under the Act on the Capital Market and Financial Investment Business that are digitized based on distributed ledger technology. The Financial Services Commission has announced that it plans to allow the issuance and distribution of token securities by overhauling the system that has been an obstacle to the issuance and distribution of securities utilizing distributed ledgers.</p><p>Q3. How does AERGO plan to address scalability and interoperability challenges in blockchain technology?</p><p>Scalability and interoperability are two areas we’ve been focusing on since the beginning of AERGO’s development. They are essential for the democratization of blockchain technology, and we want to address them in the following ways.</p><p>1. Scalability: AERGO supports vertical and horizontal scaling. From the initial concept, we have been connecting both on-chain and off-chain using side-chain to enable scalability.</p><p>2. Interoperability: As we have mentioned, AERGO is a Layer 1.5 blockchain, which means that it is a fast, low-cost Layer 1 blockchain that can interoperate between side-chain and private chains using Merkle&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p>Q4. How does AERGO ensure regular communication and collaboration with its management team and community members to identify and discuss new ideas and opportunities for&nbsp;growth?</p><p>AERGO will have Townhall sessions and video interviews with executives to engage with the community. Furthermore, we plan to create various channels to communicate with more developers as developers’ engagement will be crucial for AERGO’s current focus on STO, NFTs, and other&nbsp;areas.</p><p>Also, AERGO and Blocko will provide a unified set of tools and developer-friendly environments so that developers can easily build, deploy and run AERGO-based Dapps. Development status and results will be translated into everyday language and announced on the AERGO community and&nbsp;Medium.</p><p>Q5. Would it be possible for you to share a projected release date, or at minimum, a sneak peek of the roadmap to help us better understand your future&nbsp;plans?</p><p>AERGO and Blocko are working on more projects than ever with various Dapp studios, including Booost (Web 3) and Blocko XYZ (NFT/SBT). We’re also currently working with several listed exchanges to support the AERGO mainnet. We’ll be keeping you updated on these developments via <a href="https://twitter.com/aergo_io?s=20">AERGO Twitter</a> and Medium. Starting with this Town hall, we’ll be uploading video interviews with key members of the AERGO and Blocko teams, which will provide key insights into the AERGO 2.0 whitepaper, which will be released in&nbsp;May.</p><p>Q6. Will AERGO move from erc-20 to native Aergo tokens in the foreseeable future? How will AERGO expand its ecosystem? Will there be more implementation partners to help utilize Aergo more broadly? What does AERGO see as the niche where they can thrive in a world with many different L1s?</p><p>AERGO is currently in discussions with most exchanges to convert to mainnet tokens. As mentioned earlier, we are expanding our ecosystem into the Web3 and NFT sectors with various Dapp studios and partners including Blocko XYZ and BOOOST. In the STO space, we are discussing partnerships with other blockchain projects as well as Blocko to broaden the market&nbsp;base.</p><p>AERGO is a fast, low-cost Layer 1 blockchain that can interoperate between side-chain and private chains using Merkle Bridge technology. Our experience in building and maintaining real-world projects, especially for enterprise customers, and our diverse product offerings in response to regulations are advantages that other blockchain projects cannot easily access. We plan to take the lead in the STO field based on these experiences.</p><p>In May, we will release the AERGO 2.0 Whitepaper, which will outline our new direction and development roadmap. As we reshape ourselves to meet market changes and customer demands, we will reveal something worth waiting&nbsp;for.</p><p>Q7. How are you bringing value to the Aergo&nbsp;token?</p><p>As AERGO and Blocko move forward with the project, we are aiming to secure healthier on-chain activities and expand the ecosystem, rather than the short-term value of the Aergo token. BOOOST in the Web3 field and Blocko XYZ in the NFT/SBT field are continuing meaningful activities, so please pay attention to them. We will disclose more details about AERGO’s direction and new technology development plans in&nbsp;May.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/introducing-aergos-townhall-q1-2023-f09757591d1a">Introducing AERGO’s Townhall [Q1 2023]</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Dear Metadium community,</p><p>We are happy to share our latest partnership just in time to close our 2023 activity report: NDXInvest.</p><p>NDXInvest is a Singapore-based project aiming to connect individuals to organizational enterprises with Web3-based philosophies and technologies for successful Digital Transformation. The core team is formed by experts who previously work in companies like Samsung and&nbsp;Google.</p><blockquote>NDXInvest’s vision is that “within Open Innovation, individuals will develop and prove their abilities by branching out into different characters. Likewise, enterprises and organizations will branch out into various DAOs and collaborate with various individuals within these DAOs to gain new growth engines.”</blockquote><p>With this partnership the two companies seek to develop a new project that promotes a DAO, a DAC and a new DEX. The DEX would first be launched as a MVP (minimum viable product) using the META-Orbit bridge for locking up and DeFi investing features using Metadium’s and NDX’s native tokens as well as BTC, ETH and&nbsp;MATIC.</p><p>The Metadium Team welcomes our new partner to the ecosystem of companies working together to bring blockchain technology closer to people’s&nbsp;life.</p><p>- Metadium&nbsp;Team</p><p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>올해 1분기 마지막 파트너십사인 NDXInvest를 소개합니다.</p><p>NDXInvest는 성공적인 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 위한 Web3 기반의 철학과 기술로 개인을 조직, 기업과 연결하는 것을 목표로 하는 싱가포르 기반의 프로젝트입니다. 팀의 핵심 구성원은 삼성과 구글 등에서 근무한 이력이 있는 전문가들로 구성되어&nbsp;있습니다.</p><blockquote>NDXInvest의 비전은 “오픈 이노베이션 내에서 개인은 다양한 캐릭터로 분기하여 자신의 능력을 개발하고 증명할 것이다. 마찬가지로 기업과 조직은 다양한 DAO로 분기하고 이러한 DAO 내의 다양한 개인과 협력하여 새로운 성장 동력을 확보할 것”이라고&nbsp;말합니다.</blockquote><p>이번 파트너십을 통해 양 사는 DAO, DAC 및 새로운 DEX를 촉진하는 신규 프로젝트를 개발할 예정입니다. DEX는 우선 메타디움과 NDX의 고유 토큰뿐만 아니라 BTC, ETH 및 MATIC을 사용하여 잠금 및 DeFi 투자 기능을 위해 META-Orbit 브릿지를 사용하는 MVP(최소 기능 제품)로 출시될&nbsp;예정입니다.</p><p>메타디움 팀은 블록체인 기술을 사람들의 삶에 더 가깝게 만들기 위해 협력하는 생태계에 함께 하게 된 새로운 파트너를 진심으로&nbsp;환영합니다.</p><p>- 메타디움&nbsp;팀</p><p>Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a></p><p>Discord | <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a></p><p>Telegram(EN) | <a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0">http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a></p><p>Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a></p><p>Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadiums-new-dex-activity-acfe9b4024cb">Metadium’s new DEX activity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The CA/Browser Forum has approved <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/03/02/ballot-sc61v4-new-crl-entries-must-have-a-revocation-reason-code/">Ballot SC61</a> with directions as to which certificate revocation lists (CRL) revocation reason code should be used for a revocation of a TLS certificates.</p>
<p>What is the problem? <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt">RFC 5280</a> provides a list of revocation reason codes, but it is left to each Certification Authority (CA) to determine which code they will use. The result is inconsistency in the reason codes provided in different CRLs.</p>
<p>So why does inconsistency matter as revocation is revocation, right? If the CAs use consistent revocation reasons, then the browsers may be able to use the revocation reason to provide different output to the browser users. For instance, a certificate which has been revoked due to key compromise may be indicating an attacker is using the private key, so the certificate should not be trusted. On the other hand, if a certificate was revoked because it was renewed would mean the original certificate did not have any trust issues. The result may be that the browsers would support hard revocation for some revocation reasons and not for others.</p>
<p>So what is hard revocation? This would mean the certificate should not be trusted, so the website would not be presented to the browser user.</p>
<p>Here is the list of revocation reasons from RFC 5280 with a description as to when the reason can be used.</p>
 
 unspecified (0) – used when no specific reason is provided, a CA right to issue has expired, or for a reason specified in the CA’s CP or CPS, which is not specified in the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">TLS Baseline Requirements</a> (TLS BRs) 
 keyCompromise (1) – the private key corresponding to the certificate has been compromised, the private key is weak and can be easily computed, or the method to generate the private key was flawed 
 cACompromise (2) – this reason is not applicable to TLS certificates; however a CA can use this reason if an associated CA is compromised 
 affiliationChanged (3) – no use designated in the TLS BRs 
 superseded (4) – the validation of the domain name or IP address is not reliable, the key size or public key parameters are not applicable, or the certificate was issued not in compliance with the TLS BRs or the CP/CPS 
 cessationOfOperation (5) – the website associated with the certificate is no longer in operation 
 certificateHold (6) – not allowed to be used by the TLS BRs 
 removeFromCRL (8) – not applicable 
 privilegeWithdrawn (9) – certificate request was not authorized, certificate was misused, subscriber violated the subscriber agreement, wildcard certificate supports a fraudulent domain name, there is a material change in the information in the certificate, or the information in the certificate is inaccurate 
 aACompromise (10) – not applicable 
 
<p>Ballot SC61 is effective 15 July 2023, so the CAs will be updating their policies and procedures before this date.</p>
<p>Since many CAs also issue other certificates such as Code Signing and S/MIME, we can expect similar revocation reason practices to be used for all certificate types.</p>

<p>Social engineering is still one of the most successful forms of attack in the wild, including various phishing attacks. One form of this threat, spear phishing, uses research and user targeting to breach sensitive systems.</p>
 What Is Spear Phishing? 
<p>Spear phishing is a social engineering attack targeting specific individuals or groups with tailored, sophisticated, and fraudulent communications. In a spear phishing attack, the hacker typically gathers information about the target through extensive research, such as their name, job title, or personal interests. The hacker uses that information to create a compelling message that appears to come from a trusted source, such as a colleague or a company they do business with, to get them to part with their credentials.</p>
<p>The goal of a spear phishing attack is usually to trick the target into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data, or to install malware on their computer or mobile device.</p>
 What Are Some Key Aspects of Spear Phishing? 
<p>Spear phishing is different from regular phishing in several key ways:</p>
 
 Targeting: Spear phishing attacks are highly personalized. The attacker behind a spear phishing attack will typically research the target to gather the information that can be used to create a message that appears to be from a trusted source, such as a colleague or a company they do business with. 
 
<p>While regular phishing attacks are typically sent to many people with a generic message, spear phishing attacks include information and messaging that speaks directly to the recipient.</p>
 
 Sophistication: Spear phishing attacks are often more sophisticated and convincing than regular phishing attacks. These attacks are more likely to be professional looking with more obfuscation around spoofing and free of spelling and grammatical errors. 
 Objectives: The objective of a spear phishing attack is often more specific than that of a regular phishing attack. Instead of trying to obtain generic information such as login credentials, attackers may want to trick the recipient into accessing critical systems or information or to initiate financial transactions that only the victim can do. 
 
<p>While spear phishing and regular phishing attacks rely on social engineering tactics to trick targets into divulging sensitive information or installing malware, spear phishing attacks are typically more personalized, sophisticated, and specific in their objectives. As a result, spear phishing attacks can be more challenging to detect and defend against.</p>
 How Can I Protect Against Spear Phishing Attacks? 
<p>Spear Phishing is a significant threat, but it isn’t an insurmountable challenge. There are several short- and long-term practices and processes that your organization can put into place to prevent spear phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Some of these include:</p>
 
 Education: Employees should learn about attackers’ tactics and how to recognize a spear phishing attack. The common conception that it’s easier to fool entry-level employees over executives has been disproven over the years. With the rising skills of attackers, everyone in a company org chart must understand how these threats work. 
 Verify And Source of Communication: Before responding to an email or clicking on a link, verify the sender’s email address and check the domain name. If you need more clarification, reach out to the supposed sender through an alternate means to confirm their identity. 
 Implement Email Security: Email security measures such as DMARC, DKIM, SPF, and other methods to reduce the risk of your domain name being spoofed in spear phishing attacks. For example, these allow you to whitelist email domains, prevent known spamming domains from sending emails to recipients inside the organization, and insert warning HTML signals into emails from outside domains to warn recipients about the potential for phishing. 
 Don’t Trust Links or Attachments: Don’t click on links or download attachments from unknown or untrusted sources. Even if the message appears to be from a known source, be cautious when links are shortened or appear out of context. 
 Use Multi-Factor Authentication: MFA, especially with biometrics, can add an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a secondary authentication method beyond a password. This can prevent everyday credential hacks by making it impossible for hackers to pass MFA login challenges. 
 Sanitize Online Professional Presence: The more information a professional shares on open networks, the more a hacker can use to craft convincing spear phishing attacks. Post only what is necessary and maintain privacy over all other accounts. 
 Use Passwordless Authentication: While passwordless (or even MFA) can’t stop human error, it can simply remove a hacker’s ability to steal credentials from a spear phishing attack. 
 
<p>Following these best practices can help protect yourself and your organization against spear phishing attacks.</p>
 How Is Spear Phishing Different from Other Forms of Phishing? 
<p>Spear phishing is set apart from other attacks due to its targeted nature and how sophisticated their delivery is.</p>
<p>Consider these different types of phishing attacks:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/email-phishing/">Email Phishing</a>: This is the most common type of phishing attack, in which attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to be from legitimate sources to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. 
 Smishing: This is a type of phishing attack that is carried out via SMS or other messaging apps. Attackers trick targets into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. 
 Vishing: Voice phishing is a type of phishing attack that is carried out over the phone or via video conferencing and chat software. The attacker poses as a legitimate individual or organization and fools the target into revealing sensitive information or performing a specific action, such as transferring money. 
 Clone Phishing: In this type of attack, the attacker creates a nearly identical copy of a legitimate email or website, often using the same branding and layout. The attacker then sends the fake email or link to the target, hoping to trick them into revealing sensitive information. 
 
<p>Spear phishing, and the closely-related threat of “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">whaling</a>” (or spear phishing that targets <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/executive-phishing/">high-level executives</a>) <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">can use different kinds of technical approaches</a> like those listed above, layered with the added research and targeting tactics that make these attack vectors more dangerous.</p>
 
Thwart Spear Phishing Attempts with 1Kosmos Passwordless Authentication 
<p>One of the best ways to shortcut successful phishing attacks is to eliminate the need for passwords. While this isn’t foolproof, cutting out the password part of authentication can make it extremely difficult for attackers to access a system.</p>

 Individual user segment of DI market will grow fastest&nbsp; 



<p>Grand View Research’s DI report reveals some interesting market&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decentralized-identity-market-worth-102-130000466.html">insights</a>, including that the individual user segment of the DI industry is projected to register the fastest growth rate over the forecast period given the privacy and security benefits it offers individual users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SMEs and banking are forecast as the fastest growing industry users of the new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example of how enterprises and customers are already embracing DI products and services, Experian reports in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.com/decision-analytics/global-fraud-report">2021 Global Identity and Fraud Report</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.com/decision-analytics/global-fraud-report">60 percent</a>&nbsp;of global consumers now use a mobile wallet – up from 53 per cent pre-pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>Explore Anonyome Labs’ new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">Sudo Platform decentralized identity wallet SDK</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity wallets like the one we offer through&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;replace passwords with public and private key encryption to give users more secure access, anchored in blockchain technology. Users use the identity wallet to store their verifiable credentials and to present them as proofs when requesting access to products and services. The wallet app also allows for cross-provider end-to-end encrypted messaging. Learn&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">more</a>.</p>



<p>With the continued rise of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance economy</a>, the world needs solutions that improve&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;for everyday internet users. Decentralized identity is widely recognized as the most important privacy technology innovation for the next decade because it gives users unprecedented control over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized identity-based applications rely on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">blockchain</a>&nbsp;as the anchor of trust and therefore decentralized identity is one of the most important use cases for blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apparently, Linus of Linus Tech Tips, a YouTube channel known for…uh tech tips…didn’t read <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/lapsus-facebook-and-your-corporate-network">,my blog post on session cookie stealing attacks</a>. Or maybe they read it, and I wasn’t clear enough. Whatever.</p>

<p>The point of this post is to explain how even the best can be vulnerable. So, grab some popcorn, and let's dive in and learn life lessons from Linus.</p>
 Act 1: A Cunning Cyber Trap <p>An unsuspecting Linus Tech Tips team member opened an email containing malware craftily disguised as a mouth-watering sponsorship offer. This sneaky little program wasted no time, swiping session tokens from the victim's browsers (Chrome and Edge) which gave attackers some of the keys to Linus’s kingdom. And what did they do with their newfound power? What anyone would do: stream fake Elon Musk crypto scam videos and delete channel content, of course!</p>
 Act 2: Linus vs. The Hackers <p>At 3 AM Linus and his team embarked on a naked race (seriously, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGXaAWbzl5A">,evidence</a>--but only after you finish reading this post) to contain the attack. </p> 
   The team hadn't prepared a disaster response plan. So the team had to make stuff up as they went along. Of course, you’ve got a plan in place, right? If not, subscribe, like, and follow us on LinkedIn and I promise I’ll explain how.. 
   Linus, bless his heart, focused on password security and two-factor authentication. That’s usually the right move, but in this case, the attackers had waltzed in through the session token (or session cookie) their malware stole. 
   Google's tools, ever the trusty sidekicks, glitched and timed out, adding to the team's mounting frustrations. 
   The cold weather in Linus’s room shrink Linus’s patience and, uh, ego. 
 
 Act 3: The Cavalry Arrived <p>When all seemed lost, Google's Partner support swooped in, identifying the compromised account and banned it, restoring order and videos to their Tech Tips realm.</p> The Moral of the Story <p>What wisdom can we extract from this tale?</p> 
   Have a plan: Know your services, who has the keys to them, and how to snatch those keys back when needed. 
   Arm yourself with the right tools: Powerful weapons like <a href="https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM/">,Google Apps Manager (GAM)</a> can help automate Google Workplace processes to speed things up if you’re comfortable with the command-line and maybe some scripts. Not for everyone. Still, they are not enough as they do not cover other services which are vulnerable to this attack, so having a plan for how to kill sessions on all critical services is critical. 
   Keep it simple: If you're looking for a user-friendly ally, consider YeshID, designed to help you manage your security without breaking a sweat. 
   Find out who added the strawberry to the video. 
  A word from our sponsor <p>YeshID is a next-generation identity and access management solution. The tool is dead simple to use and smart enough to help create a disaster plan, identify and control who has access to what, and mitigate threats with one click. It’s designed to be delightful to use, created with CEOs, founders, and others in mind who wake up to a disaster and wonder why they are still the super admin.</p>
 Serious moment: Session Token Theft – Don’t Get Infected <p>Protecting against session token theft is incredibly hard. You can learn more about this attack in my previous post <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/lapsus-facebook-and-your-corporate-network">,here</a>, but let me summarize it for you: a session token cookie is a way to authenticate you without you needing to type in your password (or <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/give-passwords-the-finger">,give your finger</a>) on Every. Single. Action. Think of them as temporary passwords your browser enters for you on every action. These cookies live in your browser storage and are carefully protected. Unless they are stolen via malware, as in this case. Stealing a session token allows the bad actor to authenticate as you without any friction (password, finger, face…)</p>

<p>There is currently no perfect solution to detect and prevent this attack because each website does it differently. If you are on Google Workspace to Enterprise edition, I recommend reducing <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9368756">,session duration</a> to something that won’t annoy users too much.</p>
<p>Don’t forget other services (if they support it), e.g., <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115005223763-Manage-session-duration-">,Manage session duration | Slack</a>. Sorry, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisburger/">,Kris</a>.</p>

<p>You can go further and enable <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/12645308?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9262521#:~:text=Understand%20use%20case%20examples%20for%20Context%2DAware%20Access">,Context-Aware Access</a>, and configure it only to allow access from specific trusted devices, but it only <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275380?hl=en#:~:text=About%20editions-,Apps,-Platform%20requirements">,covers very specific Google apps</a>, and that doesn’t help Linus as it does not cover YouTube, or third-party services. Or, if you bought GitHub Enterprise and did a SAML integration for that extra Enteprirse-level security, you won’t benefit from Context-Aware Access because that’s <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275380?hl=en#zippy=%2Capps:~:text=The%20exception%20is%20SAML%20apps%2C%20which%20are%20evaluated%20on%20sign%2Din.">,not covered</a>:</p>
<p>I am optimistic that the future will be better than today. OIDC (OpenID Connect) - the technology most commonly used for SSO these days - has recently approved the specifications for enabling better session management across different websites and apps with <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html">,Final: OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0</a>, and support for forcing a logout with <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html">,Final: OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0</a>, but adoption will take some time. Until then: Avoid malware.</p>
 In Conclusion: <p>The Linus Tech Tips hack was a rollercoaster of emotions, but we've emerged from it wiser and more prepared for the twists and turns of the digital security world. So let's raise a toast to learning from other people's misfortunes and staying safe out there, folks!</p>

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>The way we travel has changed a lot in recent years. Travelers expect a seamless travel experience from before they get on the airplane to their final destination.</p>
<p>Today, at the Queen Beatrix Airport in Oranjestad, Aruba, the government of Aruba, SITA and Indicio, announced the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/transformative-innovation-arrives-at-arubas-queen-beatrix-international-airport/">successful trial</a>&nbsp; of a new mobile application that enables seamless travel to Aruba.</p>
<p>The app —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.phocuswire.com/sita-app-travelers-digitally-cross-border-before-arrival">Aruba Happy One Pass</a> (Aruba HOP) — allows an air traveler to&nbsp; to create a digital travel credential (DTC) from their passport. The DTC allows the passenger to pre-populate their Embarkation and Debarkation card (ED card) as required for travel to Aruba. The traveler can use the selective disclosure features of the credential to select the specific information they need to share by law to clear immigration —&nbsp;and, critically,&nbsp; they can do all this before they step foot on the aircraft.</p>
<p>The ability of immigration to verify all this information as authentic and uniquely belonging to the traveler streamlines arrival in Aruba. Pre-filling information directly from a passport ensures greater accuracy and less error, while a simple scan frees travelers from long waiting lines.</p>
<p>Dangui Oduber, Minister of tourism, public health, and sports for Aruba, described the trial as the result of Aruba’s relentless focus on innovation backed by a strategy of seeking collaborative partnerships with a broad range of stakeholders. He said he wants the entire hospitality sector on Aruba to be able to take advantage of the digital technologies behind AHOP to provide visitors to the island with a superlative, “seamless” travel experience.</p>

				 <p>The Aruba HOP trial resulted in a 64% reduction of the manual entry of passport information into the ED card website, and had an overall 100% error-free clearance rate of participating travelers, meaning the information contained in trial participants’s ED card was digitally verified by immigration authorities to be accurate for all participants.</p>
<p>Here are some of the other ways this app adds value to the overall travel experience:</p>
<p>Convenience<br>Travel can be stressful, especially when it comes to managing travel documents and clearing immigration. With a digital travel credential that clears immigration before boarding, travelers can have a stress-free and enjoyable travel experience.</p>
<p>Contactless<br>The COVID-19 pandemic has made contactless interactions a priority in all aspects of life, including travel. This app offers a contactless solution to clear immigration. Travelers can create a digital travel credential using their verifiable credentials, eliminating the need for physical documents exchange.</p>
<p>Security<br>Verifiable credentials are secure and tamper-proof, making them an ideal solution for digital travel credentials. Any attempt to alter the information in the credential breaks the credential.&nbsp; This means border protection can quickly clear pre-approved&nbsp; travelers with the assurance that their documents are authentic.</p>
<p>Compliance<br>Governments worldwide are implementing strict data protection regulations. This app ensures that travelers’ personal information and travel details are secure and cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals. This feature provides peace of mind for travelers, knowing that their data is safe and protected.</p>
<p>The next step<br>Aruba HOP represents a leap forward in digital travel, one that starts with the need for data privacy and delivers the seamless verification that will transform our experience of travel.</p>
<p>Built with the highest level of interoperability using open standards and open source technologies from Hyperledger Foundation, the verifiable credential technology powering the&nbsp; DTC can be easily integrated into any existing hardware and technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>As the world continues to adapt to the changes brought by new mobile and biometric technologies, digital solutions such as digital travel credentials and verifiable credentials are the easiest way to ensure verification of quality data, a smooth traveler experience, and a privacy-protected method for managing travel.</p>

 Part 2: Exploring how new digital tools and better shared data can support zero carbon, bio-based and circular construction. MatR: A digital registry for a building’s material, component and performance data<p>This is part of a series of blog posts introducing the work <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> (DML) has been doing over the past two years as part of the <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> funded <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220718_J1261-CKIC-NetZero-Playbook-3.pdf">HCC: EU CINCO project</a>, to support efforts to decarbonise construction through the use of low embodied carbon, bio-based materials and the transition to more circular construction practices.</p><p>This piece explores how innovation in digital tools and standardised shared data could support the transition to a lower embodied carbon and more circular built environment. It introduces MatR — a digital tool for recording material, environmental impact and performance data for buildings — that we’ve been developing and prototyping with our partners, <a href="https://spatialtech.info/">The Center for Spatial Technologies</a> (CST).</p><p>You’ll find links to the rest of the series at the&nbsp;end.</p> Our built environment is costing us the&nbsp;Earth <p>The environmental impact of our built environment is astonishing. Buildings are responsible for<a href="https://architecture2030.org/why-the-building-sector/"> 40% of global carbon emissions</a> or 10 billion tonnes (Gt) of CO2e each year — when measuring both <a href="https://www.istructe.org/resources/guidance/carbon-embodied-operational/">embodied and operational carbon</a>. This is larger than our <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-fired-electricity">global emissions from coal-fired power plants</a>. To meet a net zero scenario by 2030, this figure must fall to below 4 Gt annually.</p>Aerial photo of a quarry (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@adamrhodes?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Adam Rhodes</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>)<p>At the same time, of the <a href="https://circularity-gap.world/2021">100 Gt of materials we extract each year</a> globally, construction is responsible for nearly 40%. Waste arising from the construction and demolition of buildings and infrastructure represents <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/construction-and-demolition-waste_en">more than a third</a> of all waste materials generated in the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>Not only are buildings carbon intensive before they’re even finished, but their performance has a significant impact on our health once we start using them. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00338-0">recent study</a> found indoor air pollution to be responsible for over 3 million deaths in 2020 alone, almost as many as attributed to outdoor air pollution. Whilst long-term exposure to noise from road traffic <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.021436">can make heart failure more&nbsp;likely</a>.</p>Our built environment is carbon-intensive, wasteful and bad for our health (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@yasinb3da?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">yasin hm</a>, <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rus_marshall?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Ruslan Khadyev</a> &amp; <a href="https://unsplash.com/@tsujigimi?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Gregory Pappas</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/zHK__gTTTds?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>)<p>Given all this, and that we spend <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90506856/we-spend-90-of-our-time-inside-why-dont-we-care-that-indoor-air-is-so-polluted#:~:text=Studies%20have%20found%20that%20in,accurate%20than%20you%20might%20think.">90% of our time indoors</a>, we still fail to accurately track the performance of the space we&nbsp;inhabit.</p><p>The ways we currently design, construct, use and reuse our buildings is incompatible with both our planetary limits, and our current global targets for mitigating the dual climate and biodiversity crises. The compounding risks of material scarcity — and knock-on <a href="https://www.raconteur.net/construction/material-shortages-construction/">construction product shortages </a>and price volatility — as well as rapidly <a href="https://reductionroadmap.dk/">depleting carbon budget</a>, means we have no choice but to drastically reassess how and where we use materials, whilst making as much use of existing buildings and their components, as possible.</p><p>We must carefully weigh up when it makes sense to retrofit a building — taking into account the embodied carbon and material requirement of doing so, compared to the projected operational carbon reduction over its life cycle as well as potential benefit to occupant health — versus making better use of it as is, or deconstructing for reuse. When new construction is critical, we should design and construct for disassembly and reconfiguration, whilst retaining vital data for future reuse. For existing buildings, we must find efficient methods to locate and tag reusable components, logging their specification and current condition, helping to assess how and where they can be&nbsp;reused.</p><p>But, we have one big problem — we don’t know what most buildings are made of, or how they actually&nbsp;perform.</p> Current data limitations <p>Whilst we’re awash with tools to track our own behaviour; from sleep patterns, to dating habits, and even life expectancy — we currently lack access to shared, robust data on what our built environment is made of, its environmental impact, and how it functions throughout its&nbsp;life.</p><p>So what are the main challenges in this&nbsp;space?</p>  Lack of embodied carbon benchmarks: City officials, planners, architects and developers lack localised and typology-linked benchmarks for setting thresholds for embodied carbon and circularity in both new buildings and refurbishments, through building regulations and procurement — in Europe, only Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France and the Netherlands <a href="https://fs.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/7520151/RMC/Content/EU-ECB-Summary-Report.pdf">were found to have</a> baseline data of sufficient sample size and quality. Whilst generic emissions databases exist (e.g. <a href="https://ecoinvent.org/">Ecoinvent</a>, <a href="https://circularecology.com/embodied-carbon-footprint-database.html">ICE</a>), these vary in life cycle scope and geographic context. From our experience working with partners in Madrid and Milan, currently there are no standardised emissions databases for benchmarking buildings or for local construction products. Our interviews highlighted this as a key factor which made it difficult to establish incentive mechanisms or attract investment because it reduced certainty on what constitutes a low embodied carbon project and how it should be measured and demonstrated, leading to an increased perception of risk or unclear&nbsp;reward.  Lack of component specific embodied carbon data: Whilst Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for construction products are increasing — with over <a href="https://constructionlca.co.uk/2023/03/01/over-130000-construction-product-epd-available-globally/">130,000</a> now available globally — this is still relatively few. It’s therefore difficult for designers, developers and construction professionals to conduct product-specific embodied carbon assessments using standardised data — in terms of format, life cycle scope and geographic context. At the same time, only around half of these EPDs are machine-readable, preventing widespread integration with digital&nbsp;tools.  BIM adoption and whole life implementation: Building Information Modelling (BIM) is still not widely used in many geographical contexts, including Madrid and Milan. <a href="https://www.planradar.com/gb/bim-adoption-in-europe/">Adoption amongst European construction companies</a> ranges from 73% in the UK to 35% in France, and 20% in Austria. There’s also a lack of digitals tools and standards to make it easy for designers and developers to integrate embodied carbon and material circularity related decisions in the design process. At the same time BIM files tend to be discarded or remain static once a building is built, losing valuable information for optimising building use and future deconstruction.  Missing or inconsistent building performance data: Building performance data — for instance indoor air quality, light and noise levels, water use — is generally considered separately from embodied carbon and material circularity metrics, if measured at all. For facility managers and building owners to make more informed decisions to maximise utilisation of existing spaces and minimise environmental impact of renovations and new buildings, understanding the full picture of building performance and embodied impacts is necessary.  Lack of data on reusable products and circularity metrics: A lack of data documenting the condition, specification, location and potential for reuse of building components and materials, makes it difficult for designers and construction contractors to specify reused products. Without recognised certification and standards for reusable products, construction professionals remain hesitant of reuse. At the same time circularity metrics for buildings are yet to be standardised; and whilst a number of recent <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/levels/lets-meet-levels/how-does-levels-work_en">frameworks</a> and <a href="https://www.circuit-project.eu/post/report-recommendations-on-circularity-indicators-for-a-circularity-dashboard">research projects</a> make proposals, they are yet to become mandatory.  Data aggregation: There’s a need for digital tools to integrate and aggregate material and environmental impact data from individual components, to systems, to buildings, to cities; to identify local material stocks and track their flows, from the scale of a door handle to a city’s material economy. For instance, tools like <a href="https://onderzoek.amsterdam.nl/publicatie/the-circular-economy-monitor-an-outline">Amsterdam’s Monitor</a>, which measures total material flows (including those resulting from the built environment) within the city alongside their associated carbon emissions and other environmental costs, can help cities to monitor their progress towards material circularity.  <p>For a more detailed overview of barriers and opportunities, as well as relevant existing initiatives in relation to innovations in digital tools and data that could support the transition to a lower embodied carbon and more circular built environment, see our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xm1k389BQjz3N8KZoLC-uqgvJ-BFXi9f/view?usp=sharing">Digital tools and data: Briefing document</a>.</p> What should we do about&nbsp;it? <p>Whilst it’s useful to understand materials, environmental impact and performance at the scale of an individual building, it becomes exponentially more powerful when aggregated at the scale of cities and regions. Developing these tools in close partnership with municipal governments and city stakeholders will be fundamental to their success and therefore their public&nbsp;value.</p><p>Successful solutions in this space should be designed to facilitate mass adoption; by a diverse range of user types; for a spectrum of use cases — from planning teams and developers to deconstruction contractors and reused component certifiers. We feel it will be necessary to identify and develop a standardised approach, aligned to internationally recognised frameworks and regulations — for example <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/levels_en">Level(s)</a>; the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/ecodesign-sustainable-products_en">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation</a> (ESPR) and related <a href="https://www.corporateleadersgroup.com/files/cisl_digital_products_passport_report_v6.pdf">Digital Product Passports</a> (DPPs); and recently revised <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0068_EN.pdf">Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)</a> — that integrates with existing digital tools used by built environment professionals.</p><p>For these reasons, we believe it’s important to adopt an open-source approach — taking inspiration from tools like <a href="https://speckle.systems/">Speckle</a> and <a href="https://ifcjs.io/">IFC.js</a> — to foster widespread adoption and enable future adaptation to local contexts and use cases; rather than implementing a closed system using proprietary software.</p><p>Through this work, we believe several criteria will be critical:</p>  Make it open-source: Building on existing open source tools and standards to support data exchange from multiple data sources and integration with other architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software tools whilst enabling users to adopt and extend for diverse use&nbsp;cases.  Share data: Data exists on a <a href="https://www.theodi.org/about-the-odi/the-data-spectrum/">spectrum</a>, from closed, shared to open. Data permissions will help to unlock public value through sharing built environment data, whilst ensuring access to sensitive data — for example building occupancy or security — requires authentication. Decentralised publishing of data, using open standards, as seen in the <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">Open Banking initiative</a>, can help to standardise sharing across a sector and increase collaboration. Data pooling, of aggregate data from multiple sources, can generate a critical mass of data for analysis and benchmarking across a geography or sector. This may require stewardship from a data institution to act as a trusted intermediary.  Build for the web: Developing a tool that can run in a browser will allow the data to be accessed quickly without proprietary software or specialised hardware, enabling different use cases. Whilst designing it to integrate with recognised AEC tools, currently used by built environment professionals, can help users adopt the new tool as part of their existing workflows.  Integrate multiple sources: This will require a tool capable of gathering data from multiple discrete sources — whether via external datasets and an application programming interface (API); or wireless sensors in buildings; or user input data — and linked to a 3D BIM of the building and its components.  Adopt physical asset tags: It will be necessary to develop a method to encode each unique ID from the digital model to a physical object. This could use proven technologies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification">RFID</a> tags or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a>, or adopt novel solutions to <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/12/dna-of-things-storing-data-in-everyday-objects.html">embed data in the objects themselves</a>.  Align to regulation: Designed to align and integrate with <a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/regulation_on_ecodesign_for_sustainable_products.pdf">incoming regulation</a> on sustainable products and aligned to the <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/levels_en">Level(s) sustainable building reporting framework</a>. The recently passed <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0068_EN.pdf">revision to the EPBD</a> will require embodied carbon to be calculated as part of life-cycle global warming potential (GWP), using a harmonised approach across member states. It also invites the inclusion of embodied carbon data, as part of mandatory national energy performance of buildings databases, using the <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/levels/lets-meet-levels/how-does-levels-work_en">Level(s) indicators</a>. Here, regulation will be critical for driving behaviour change across the industry, and better, open-source data systems can support the implementation of a harmonious approach across&nbsp;Europe.  Apply to new builds and retrofits: Given the criticality of retrofitting existing buildings and continuing requirement for new buildings, developing a tool appropriate for analysing materials, environmental impact and performance in both use cases is vital. Neglecting to account for embodied carbon in retrofit projects risks misrepresenting their intended carbon savings and exacerbating the climate crisis. It’s only fairly recently that the industry has started to recognise this, with <a href="https://www.leti.uk/_files/ugd/252d09_c71428bafc3d42fbac34f9ad0cd6262b.pdf">guidelines</a> and <a href="https://caretool.org/">tools</a> emerging to guide retrofit projects on this&nbsp;topic.  <p>For now, these criteria remain assumptions, based on our research and experience to date. We’ll continue to validate and reassess them as we develop and test our approach alongside a range of stakeholders.</p> A new approach — MatR <p>A digital registry for a building’s material, component and performance data.</p><p>In response to the barriers and design principles, DML together with partners has been working on one possible approach. MatR is an open source, web-based digital tool that aggregates data on what buildings are made of and how well they perform. It creates a secure digital repository for each building with the digital architecture to link multiple data sources — from environmental impact and material circularity data, to component reuse potential and residual&nbsp;value.</p>MatR proof of concept: A digital registry for a building’s material, component and performance data<p>MatR enables a range of users — from architects and developers to city officials or deconstruction contractors (more on this below) — to connect data to a live BIM file of a building. This may be technical specifications from manufacturers; environmental impact data from <a href="https://www.environdec.com/about-us/the-international-epd-system-about-the-system">EPDs</a> or <a href="https://ecoinvent.org/">life cycle inventory datasets</a>; air quality or noise from indoor sensors; a log of component condition and any repairs; or residual value of components.</p><p>This registry of materials and building performance can then be scaled from a building, to a district, to a city or even nation — contributing to a dataset providing the granularity of the constituent materials in a door handle, to the aggregation of material flows across a city. In the future, it could integrate directly with public datasets and dashboards — for instance emerging <a href="https://stadsutveckling.goteborg.se/sa-planeras-staden/digitaltvilling/">digital twins</a> and <a href="https://3d.amsterdam.nl/index.html">3D city models</a>. Data permissions would ensure that any sensitive data — for example detailed BIM files or granular energy use data — is only accessible via authentication, whilst open data standards can enable aggregate data to be pooled at the city level to inform benchmarks and analyse material&nbsp;flows.</p>Data aggregation and sharing — From the door handle to the&nbsp;city<p>During the planning of a new building, city officials could use city level aggregate data to set planning requirements for embodied carbon or material use. This tool could allow developers and investors — whether commercial, public or civic — to be much clearer on the environmental impact of their projects and drive supply side change via market signals whilst avoiding greenwashing. In the design stage, architects can use specific product-level data to inform their designs and meet benchmarks. During construction, the registry can be used to log the actual components used and specify maintenance or deconstruction requirements. In the use phase, building operators can track building performance, log maintenance processes and monitor the condition of components. At end of life, a digitised inventory pre-populated with deconstruction guides can help contractors disassemble the building and provide a verified dataset on component specification and condition, to better facilitate reuse. This could contribute to a city-wide material reuse platform, identifying when materials are available (or soon to be available) for reuse; where they are; their specification; and what condition they’re&nbsp;in.</p><p>At end of life, a digitised inventory pre-populated with deconstruction guides can help contractors disassemble the building and provide a verified dataset on component specification and condition, to better facilitate reuse. This could contribute to a city-wide material reuse platform, identifying when materials are available (or soon to be available) for reuse; where they are; their specification; and what condition they’re&nbsp;in.</p><p>We believe this approach can be considered innovative in several&nbsp;ways:</p>  Open source software and shared data approach: To support wider collaboration within the construction sector and between diverse stakeholders, to drive the transition to a post-carbon and regenerative built environment. Some of the more developed initiatives in this area use proprietary tools and closed datasets.  Web-based interface and BIM integration: MatR is a cloud-based tool, linked directly to a digital BIM file, connecting multiple different users throughout the building life cycle and extending the functionality of BIM from design through to deconstruction. It does not require specialist hardware or proprietary software licences and aligns to open BIM standards. Existing material passport tools tend to export data from a BIM file, detaching the live file from a material&nbsp;dataset.  Integrating building performance data: Understanding the performance of buildings is critical to measuring how efficiently we use materials. We believe tracking building performance alongside environmental impact and circularity of materials is necessary in order to assess the opportunity costs of how we use scarce materials in the built environment.   MatR — Proof of&nbsp;concept <p>As part of the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220718_J1261-CKIC-NetZero-Playbook-3.pdf">HCC EU CINCO project</a>, we’ve been working with <a href="https://spatialtech.info/">The Center for Spatial Technologies</a> to develop a technical proof of concept (PoC) of this tool — MatR. The PoC currently enables the user to access a BIM file through a web browser; view an inventory of all components; view aggregate data on material mass and embodied carbon for the overall building; and view specific data for select components, including their specification, environmental impact and material circularity (sourced from&nbsp;EPDs).</p>MatR — Building and component level&nbsp;metrics<p>The mockup UX for the MatR platform demonstrates how a user could access data for multiple buildings and projects; manage user permissions; set environmental impact targets; and analyse emissions, circularity and performance related data in a single dashboard.</p>MatR — Data platform&nbsp;UX<p>The team is in the process of validating the concept through user testing with built environment professionals, including architects, developers and city planners. Feedback will help to inform the tool’s future development and ensure the team prioritises the development of functionality that is most critical.</p> Why better data&nbsp;matters <p>The possible impact of material registries can be considered across several horizons.</p><p>In the near-term it could&nbsp;enable:</p>  Low carbon material selection and building design: Supporting architects, engineers and developers to design low carbon and circular buildings by selecting low impact and reusable components.  Lower the cost and complexity of compliance: Tools like MatR can reduce the costs and complexity associated with complying to sustainability related building regulations, procurement requirements and certifications.  Generate local benchmarks: Data collected can contribute to local benchmarks for different building typologies, helping city officials to set more accurate targets within regulation or procurement requirements.  <p>In the longer-term:</p>  Performance-based regulation and contracting of space: Better building data could enable more agile regulation of the construction and use of buildings, based on their performance or outcomes they contribute to. In the future, this could enable the taxation of underutilised assets or those that don’t contribute to public&nbsp;value.  Materials accounting: With intensifying material scarcity, price volatility and dwindling carbon budgets making material accounting increasingly important; the availability of robust, shared data on materials and buildings will be vital. Citywide accounting of material flows or component life cycles — for example, ensuring that carbon is sequestered in timber buildings for a sufficient time period and preventing its early release — will help to guide our material use in buildings.  Analysing future liabilities: More accurately modelling the depreciation of built assets to assess their future value (including the associated liabilities) could support a new economy for both durable and regenerative materials, incentivising the reuse of materials at their highest&nbsp;utility.  Carbon accounting: The use of <a href="https://www.government.se/government-policy/swedens-carbon-tax/swedens-carbon-tax/#:~:text=Swedish%20carbon%20tax%20rates&amp;text=The%20carbon%20tax%20was%20introduced,of%20SEK%2010.15%20per%20EUR).">carbon taxes</a> and possible future implementation of national Carbon Treasuries — public institutions responsible for the national allocation and management of carbon emissions and sequestrations — would require robust, shared datasets for each key industrial sector. With the built environment being a significant contributor to carbon emissions, a sector wide national database of emissions attributed to buildings and their constituent materials, would help efforts to introduce more accurate carbon accounting   What’s next <p>As noted in Part 1, systemic shifts require many levers to interact. Data plays a central role in enabling other levers — including regulation, investment, supply chain and construction practices etc. — to shift. MatR shows what one piece of the puzzle could look like. Together with CST, we’re aiming to continue and expand our user testing over the coming months, as we identify a set of requirements for the next iteration of the tool; with the intention to develop and test it alongside a live construction project for the next stage of development.</p><p>Whilst we’ve initially focussed on a new build scenario — where starting from scratch means data can be linked to the BIM file as the design evolves, making the process more straightforward — we consider a renovation or retrofit use case as equally appropriate. We’ll therefore focus future development of the prototype for use in both new build and retrofit scenarios.</p><p>We’ll also be investing more time in developing the open-source approach and underlying business model, whilst looking for partner cities who would be interested in co-developing the&nbsp;concept.</p><p>If you’re interested in hearing more, collaborating or sharing feedback; or you’re from a city interested in partnering, please get in touch&nbsp;at:</p><p><a href="mailto:matr@darkmatterlabs.org">matr@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p> Other posts in this&nbsp;series <p>This is part of a series covering work we’ve been doing to support efforts to decarbonise construction and transition to more circular construction practices.

 Part 1: Exploring innovations to support zero carbon, bio-based and circular construction. La Borda, Barcelona (Alvaro Valdecantos)<p>This is the first in a series of posts introducing the work <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> (DML) has been doing over the past two years as part of the <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> funded <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220718_J1261-CKIC-NetZero-Playbook-3.pdf">HCC: EU CINCO project</a>, to support efforts to decarbonise construction through the use of low embodied carbon, bio-based materials and the transition to more circular construction practices.</p><p>The series gives an overview of the initiative; the challenges and opportunities identified; interventions we’ve developed in collaboration with project partners; and learnings we’ve taken from them. Within each post we’ll provide links to key ‘artefacts’ as examples of these, with an explanation of their current status, potential value to key stakeholders and possible next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>This piece introduces our focus areas, within the context of the wider project; outlines our whole-systems approach; covers the portfolio of activities we undertook and summarises our learnings. Subsequent posts will dig deeper into each activity&nbsp;area.</p> Introduction <p>Since early 2021, Dark Matter Labs has been part of a group of partners supported by the <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> to investigate and test ways to accelerate efforts to minimise <a href="https://www.leti.uk/_files/ugd/252d09_aa3cb94a124e40fba747d6520afc4bce.pdf">embodied carbon</a> in buildings, support material circularity and increase the use of low carbon, bio-based materials. We’ve been working on a number of initiatives with the cities of Madrid and Milan, as part of the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220718_J1261-CKIC-NetZero-Playbook-3.pdf">HCC: EU CINCO project</a> (Healthy, Clean Cities: EUropean CIties for climate-Neutral COnstruction).</p>Iron ore mine, Erzberg, Austria (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@silverdaddy?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Chris</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/6LNv5BmYuvI?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a>); Forest, Serbia (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@filipz?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Filip Zrnzević</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/wallpapers/nature/forest?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a>); Building demolition (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@jasonmphoto?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Jason Mitrione</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/xjAmhIhdgGk?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a>) Why embodied&nbsp;carbon? <p>Today, buildings are responsible for <a href="https://architecture2030.org/why-the-building-sector/">40% of global carbon emissions</a>, when considering both <a href="https://www.istructe.org/resources/guidance/carbon-embodied-operational/">operational and embodied carbon</a>. Whilst operational carbon — emissions associated with operating a building e.g. from heating and cooling — currently represents a larger proportion of total emissions, as energy efficiency in buildings increases and energy sources become less carbon intensive, tackling embodied carbon — emissions associated with materials and construction processes throughout the whole life cycle of a building — is now critical. We’ll simply fail to achieve our climate goals without making it a priority, something cities and other built environment actors are slowly starting to recognise at scale — with help from initiatives such as <a href="https://carbonneutralcities.org/embodied-carbon-policy-framework/">CNCA</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c40.org/accelerators/clean-construction/">C40</a>.</p> Why bio-based materials? <p>Using <a href="https://www.rics.org/news-insights/wbef/are-biobased-materials-the-key-to-a-more-sustainable-construction-industry">bio-based</a> materials — organic resources produced by plants and animals, such as timber or sheep’s wool — is considered one of the most effective routes to not only decarbonising the built environment, but shifting to a more regenerative future. Apart from offering low-embodied carbon alternatives to conventional construction materials, bio-based materials are renewable and can be sustainably produced. They provide a number of additional co-benefits including faster, safer and cleaner construction; easier and more sustainable reuse or composting options at end of life; healthier internal environments; and a boost to rural economies — something of particular relevance at a time where we’re seeing a growing urban-rural political divide, especially with regard to the environment.</p> Why material circularity? <p>The built environment is responsible for <a href="https://circularity-gap.world/2021">nearly 40% of global material extraction</a>. Whilst construction and demolition waste (CDW) accounts for a <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/construction-and-demolition-waste_en">third of total waste generated in the EU</a>. This linear material extraction, use and disposal paradigm represents a material economy and a way of interacting with the natural world that is no longer viable at a planetary scale. The need to transition to a more circular model is increasingly urgent.</p><p>As former president of the American Institute of Architects, <a href="https://carlelefante.com/insights/the-greenest-building-is/">Carl Elefante</a>, famously <a href="http://www.sohosandiego.org/images/forum_greenest_bldg.pdf">said</a>, the greenest, most sustainable building is the one that already exists. While the scope of HCC EU CINCO mostly focuses on supporting decarbonisation in new construction, we recognise this needs to happen within a ‘building circularity hierarchy’.</p>Circular economy for the built environment (LETI,&nbsp;2022)<p>This framework prioritises increasing the utilisation and prolonging the life of existing buildings through maintenance; above refurbishing, repurposing, and deconstructing them for reuse; and finally remanufacturing, reprocessing and recycling components. While this blog series will not go into detail on these aspects, we acknowledge their critical importance.</p> Project partners <p>The project has involved a consortium comprising <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a>, <a href="https://www.demsoc.org/">Democratic Society</a>, <a href="https://materialeconomics.com/">Material Economics</a>, <a href="https://www.bwb.earth/">Bankers without Boundaries</a>, and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/About">Dark Matter Labs</a>, working in close collaboration with local partners in the two focus cities. In Madrid, these include <a href="http://itd.upm.es/en/">UPM</a>, <a href="https://www.arup.com">Arup</a>, <a href="https://www.madrid.es/portal/site/munimadrid">Madrid City Council</a> and <a href="https://creamadridnuevonorte.com/">CreaMNN</a>. In Milan, the partnership has involved <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en">POLIMI</a>, <a href="https://www.amat-mi.it/">AMAT</a> and <a href="https://redosgr.it/en/">Redo</a>. Our work related to digital tool development and spatial data prototyping has been supported by our close partners, <a href="https://spatialtech.info/">The Center for Spatial Technologies</a>.</p> Testbed sites Architectural renders of Milan L’Innesto (Left) and Madrid Nuevo Norte&nbsp;(Right)<p>Two sites were selected to test in practice the innovations proposed as part of the project (more on these innovations below). The two testbeds — sites for conducting rigorous, transparent and replicable testing — are two of Europe’s largest urban regeneration projects: <a href="https://creamadridnuevonorte.com/">Madrid Nuevo Norte</a> (MNN) and <a href="https://innestomilano.it/">Milan’s L’Innesto</a>. MNN is a large-scale development with high sustainability aspirations which seeks to integrate Chamartín Rail Station with the rest of the city. Whilst L’Innesto aims to be Italy’s first carbon-neutral social housing development, located at Scalo Greco Breda, a former freight terminal&nbsp;site.</p><p>By working closely with the project teams of these test sites, alongside local partners from academia, municipal government, private sector and civic organisations, the consortium has had access to a wealth of knowledge and perspectives. This has made it possible to ground the project in real world contexts, deeply understand structural and specific challenges and opportunities from the viewpoint of the diverse stakeholders, and work together to overcome barriers collaboratively.</p> Approach <p>As part of our work, we’ve adopted a whole-systems approach to understand the blocks and bottlenecks that limit the uptake of low embodied carbon materials and circular construction practices, as well as to identify opportunities to accelerate their uptake. This means we have tried to look at the whole picture to understand how regulation, procurement and contracting, material and construction data, digital capacities, finance, culture, habits and ways of working all come together to influence the decision-making of stakeholders along the process — from forestry agents, bio-based material manufacturers, designers, construction teams and academic researchers to policy makers, municipal officials, legislators, insurers, developers and building&nbsp;users.</p><p>We’ve worked collaboratively to strengthen our collective understanding of barriers and opportunities while fostering network building, connection and communication across actors. We believe that the <a href="https://cascadeinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/What-is-a-global-polycrisis-v2.pdf">entangled</a> complexity, scale and urgency of the challenges we face, necessitates the whole ecosystem working together to drive the transition to a <a href="https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Regenerative_design">regenerative</a>, low carbon and circular built environment.</p><p>Over the past two years we’ve worked closely with local partners using four strategies:</p>  Building contextual and technical knowledge through interviews and secondary research which we then share via reports and/or sensemaking sessions  Fostering connections through participatory processes such as collaborative workshops and communication events  Designing solutions to current key challenges in close collaboration with “problem owners”, those with the means and mandate to tackle the issue and those who most feel its&nbsp;impact  Sharing provocations to invite partners to think beyond what is possible today to what is necessary in the long&nbsp;term   Focus areas <p>These strategies have been implemented through a series of interconnected interventions as part of a portfolio, which was co-defined with partners and spans multiple&nbsp;levers:</p>  Finance;  Policy and regulation;  Contracting and procurement;  Digital tools and&nbsp;data;  Capacity and capability building;  Networks and shared narrative  HCC: EU CINCO focused on six strategic levers (DML focused on the blue&nbsp;layers)<p>Over the course of the first phase of the initiative, Dark Matter Labs has focused on three of these interlinking levers of change — Policy and regulation; Contracting and procurement; and Digital tools and data. We’ve also developed transversal activities focusing on Capacity and capability building and conducted a study analysing the economic and environmental impact of using sustainable timber in the Madrid testbed. Each of these will be covered in more detail in a subsequent post.</p> Overview of activities <p>The project has involved us conducting over 30 interviews with actors along the timber value chain and compiling their diverse perspectives on challenges and opportunities in a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aO55YkNSMN9Fn_BYi16CcvsNB3untKkT/view?usp=share_link">shared document</a>. While it helped uncover indispensable and detailed contextual knowledge, it also fostered a shared understanding to help disparate stakeholders work together and see their interconnections and potential synergies more easily. We also conducted in depth research and compiled briefing documents on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xm1k389BQjz3N8KZoLC-uqgvJ-BFXi9f/view?usp=share_link">Digital tools and data</a>; and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xl-vN0ClJYlBKv20mm2jxlahhQv5jra1/view?usp=share_link">Policy, regulation and contractual innovation</a> in relation to low embodied carbon and circular construction in Madrid and&nbsp;Milan.</p>Project outputs: Timber value chain learnings; Digital tools &amp; data brief; Policy &amp; regulation brief<p>Additionally we hosted collaborative work sessions with select experts — from the fields of energy, architecture, urbanism and ecology — as part of an innovative process for proposing regulatory changes to integrate carbon and climate conscious perspectives in the review of urban planning legislation in Madrid and to suggest a new approach for learning-focused regulatory sandboxes.</p>Project outputs: WLC reporting template; Municipal price list provocation<p>As to concrete solutions to the barriers currently faced by our local partners, it has led us to design <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hKyyw2uIIaK-VA6ApnUfNzEFNhg8OdsU/view?usp=share_link">clauses to require whole life carbon assessment</a> in the tender processes of Madrid Nuevo Norte; to develop easy to use templates to compile embodied carbon data; and to propose new, low carbon and bio-based materials to be included in Madrid’s municipal list of prices (<a href="https://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Vivienda-urbanismo-y-obras/Publicaciones/Cuadro-de-Precios-de-los-Proyectos-de-Urbanizacion-y-de-Edificacion/?vgnextfmt=default&amp;vgnextoid=4527b1a987c0b110VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=cf6031d3b28fe410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD">Cuadro de Precios</a>) — a public list of prices for materials, products and construction processes for use in preparing a <a href="https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Bill_of_quantities_BOQ">bill of quantities</a> for public construction projects.</p><p>Recognising the need to work at two speeds — tackling current problems and implementing actions that are feasible today, while considering the long term and working to expand the boundaries of our own and our partner’s imaginations as to what is possible — we have also developed a number of “provocations”. These are thought pieces co-exploring what we think may be needed; meant to inspire, invite discussion and foster new courses of action. As part of this line of work, we reimagined <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xwjuJnZBzf1yTCBvPHTNbYy0WHIRxKPq/view?usp=sharing">what a climate conscious 21st century municipal price list could be</a>, and developed a <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/datas-role-for-a-post-carbon-built-environment-7a31b4ebc934">proof of concept for a material registry</a> — MatR: An open source, web-based digital tool that aggregates data on what buildings are made of and how well they perform, which could enable more holistic decisions to minimise life cycle environmental impacts and maximise material circularity in the built environment.</p>Project outputs: Economic analysis of increased forestry in Castilla-La Mancha; MatR — A digital registry for a building’s material and performance data.<p>As part of the project, we also conducted a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cl6bJgQg0bzvkWA-cAaL2W9Nf44RKJt4/view?usp=share_link">regional economic and environmental impact analysis</a> to illustrate the potential impact of increased demand for engineered timber products on the local forestry industry and its related activities within the region of Castilla-La Mancha,&nbsp;Spain.</p><p>These will be discussed in more detail in subsequent posts.</p> Strategic learning <p>Through working across multiple levers of change, we identified three necessary shifts to make the transition to low carbon, bio-based, circular construction possible:</p>  Re-defining cost and value: From a short term and narrow conception focused on direct cost and profit; to a long term and broad conception that considers wider economic, environmental and social impacts and how they are inherently linked.  Re-thinking collaboration: From centralised and siloed approaches where design, manufacture, construction and maintenance are considered independently, and there’s limited stakeholder collaboration; to distributed and multi-actor ways of working where shared responsibility frameworks support innovation and institutional infrastructure facilitates learning and cooperation.  Re-scoping focus: From sector specific approaches in which single point interventions can lead to uncoordinated and sometimes conflicting results; to systemic​ approaches in which multiple levers (finance, regulation, etc.), diverse domains (energy, biodiversity, health, etc.), and their interactions are considered together to minimise negative externalities and maximise co-benefits.  A multi-lever approach for a low carbon, circular and just built environment<p>Collectively, the range of experiments we initiated with our partners aim to help make these necessary shifts possible. Alongside these, a number of key lessons have also&nbsp;emerged:</p> 1 — We have found that barriers are often related to capacity, capabilities and political and normative choices, rather than to technological limitations. <p>Barriers often arise from individuals or organisations having limited time or resources to do things differently, lacking the means to innovate or having limited access to knowledge. Often barriers arise in decision making processes where economic, political and climate values are perceived as contradictory or conflicting. Therefore, focusing on strengthening the capacities and capabilities of key stakeholders to enable collaborative learning; embracing agile action; and long term thinking, becomes critical. This led us to directing more efforts than initially planned to support essential capability building amongst key actors, including municipal officials, and relevant construction sector and industry&nbsp;players.</p> 2 — We’ve witnessed the need for new approaches to planning, financing and agile collaboration. <p>Different stakeholders are subject to very different paces and timeframes. Political cycles, fiscal years and university research timelines don’t usually coincide, complicating multi-actor collaboration and project financing.</p><p>At the same time, because of the ongoing interaction between all the different parts of the system and the continuous evolution of internal and external pressures, traditional linear planning is unable to respond with the necessary flexibility and learning focus to complex challenges such as that of decarbonising construction. This has prompted us to search for and test new ways to plan, fund and collaborate.</p> 3 — We’ve experienced how difficult deep collaboration is. Strategic cross collaboration has to be designed explicitly from the&nbsp;start. <p>For many of us, working collaboratively with very different partners isn’t the usual mode of operation. It may require more time to reach mutual understanding and build trust. When faced with tight deadlines and workload pressure, we may be tempted to retreat to working individually and in silos instead of collaborating across domains. However, together we’re able to achieve better quality, more impactful results. To make this possible, we found collaboration had to be established as a shared objective early on. Time for collective sense-making whilst working individually is not enough; working together through shared challenges accelerates mutual understanding and facilitates deeper collaboration. Deadlines, budget and expectations need to be adjusted accordingly. In response to these insights, we are working to integrate this approach more fully in the next stage of our&nbsp;work.</p><p>In order to respond to continuously evolving contexts, it is also critical to continue to build our capability to be agile and recognise when it’s time to shift focus and adapt resource allocation quickly. This also entails building our decision making capacity so that we’re able to commit the time and resources necessary for exploring areas of potential deeply, without being distracted by emerging opportunities with less potential.</p><p>Additionally, local partner collaboration is invaluable. However, navigating complexity and uncertainty in a second language is difficult. Local partners don’t always feel comfortable or are not able to engage deeply in English. Therefore, deep collaboration with local partners requires speaking the local language.</p> 4 —Within the wider context, we recognise how far cities still have to go to engage deeply with this planet-critical challenge. <p>As the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/">latest IPCC report</a> starkly warns, “there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all” and an urgent need for “deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation actions in this decade [to] reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems.” There remain significant gaps between the projected emissions from implemented policies and those from <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs#NDC-registry--">nationally determined contributions</a> (NDCs) — on our current trajectory, it’s likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C in the 21st century and will be hard to limit below&nbsp;2°C.</p><p>This gives a clear indication of the scale and urgency of transition required across Europe and beyond, to deliver on our collective climate ambitions. Cities must play their part by accelerating the impact of mitigation and adaptation measures, whilst sharing lessons across sectors and borders. In the built environment in particular, there remains a large disconnect between what is needed in response to the climate crisis and what is currently being built or planned in terms of new development. Collaborative city networks, for example <a href="https://www.c40.org/">C40</a> and <a href="https://carbonneutralcities.org/">CNCA</a>, provide the scaffold for mobilising transformative climate action, disseminating best practice and accelerating change in municipal policy and action. Yet, decision making still does not respond to the depth and urgency of required&nbsp;action.</p><p>We also acknowledge this is particularly hard in the built environment and construction sector, where in some contexts a significant portion of GDP is linked to carbon and material intensive practices. As a sector, it’s typically slow to change and comes with significant risks in terms of job losses and industry phase-out. Here, carefully designed policies along with targeted public investment will be necessary to ensure a just and inclusive transition.</p><p>In conclusion, this work has shown us some of the challenges of attempting to work systemically while operating within structures and systems that have been set up with predefined objectives, and sector specific or siloed approaches which are no longer fit for&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>We recognise that, within the project scope, we’re still working out how to overcome these barriers and will continue to test new ways of working collaboratively, through exploration, while navigating an ever evolving context in which new needs and opportunities will continue to emerge. Sharing our learning and reflections thus becomes mission critical.

<p>The European Union (EU) has recently taken a significant step towards combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal activities involving crypto-assets. MEPs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the Committee on Civil Liberties (LIBE) adopted new legislation as part of the EU’s anti-money laundering package. (source: <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26164/crypto-assets-new-rules-to-stop-illicit-flows-in-the-eu">European Parliament</a>)</p>



 New Requirements for Crypto-Asset Transfers: 



<p>The newly approved legislation mandates that all transfers of crypto-assets must include information on the source and beneficiary of the asset. This information must be made available to the competent authorities. The rules will also apply to transactions from unhosted wallets and will require technological solutions to ensure individual traceability of these asset transfers.</p>



 Removing Minimum Thresholds: 



<p>MEPs decided to remove minimum thresholds and exemptions for low-value transfers, recognizing that the speed and virtual nature of crypto-asset transactions easily circumvent existing rules based on transaction thresholds.</p>



 Public Register of High-Risk Entities: 



<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) has been assigned the responsibility of establishing a public register comprising businesses and services engaged in crypto-assets that may pose a high risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal activities. Before distributing crypto-assets to beneficiaries, providers are required to confirm that the asset’s source is not subject to any restrictive measures and that there are no associated risks of money laundering or terrorism financing.</p>



 Closing the Loophole: 



<p>Ernest Urtasun, co-rapporteur for ECON, emphasizes that the EU’s objective is to close the loophole that enables illicit flows in crypto-assets to circulate undetected across Europe and the world. Assita Kanko, co-rapporteur for LIBE, further explains that the new legislation intends to both protect and normalize the usage of crypto-assets, while fostering trust.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>The text that has been adopted serves as a draft mandate for MEPs to negotiate the legislation’s final form with EU governments. The European Parliament is scheduled to cast their vote during the plenary session in April.</p>



<p>The EU’s new anti-money laundering package represents a significant step in the ongoing battle against criminal activities related to crypto-assets. By enforcing stricter regulations, the EU aims to improve transparency, security, and trust within the cryptocurrency domain.</p>

<p>The European Union (EU) has recently adopted new measures to strengthen its anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, and evasion of sanctions policies. MEPs approved stricter rules to close existing gaps in combating these illicit activities within the EU. Coinfirm, a leading<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics platform, is dedicated to helping businesses navigate these regulatory changes effectively.</p>



 Key EU Measures: 



<p>Establishment of the European Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA): The new AMLA will have supervisory and investigative powers to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) requirements across EU member states.</p>



<p>Enhanced Customer Identity Verification: Banks, asset managers, and other entities will be required to verify their customers’ identity, ownership, and control of companies. This includes conducting due diligence, assessing sector-specific money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and transmitting relevant information to a central register.</p>



<p>Caps on Cash Payments and Crypto-Asset Transfers: The EU has set limits on cash payments (€7,000) and crypto-asset transfers (€1,000) that can be accepted by persons providing goods or services when the customer cannot be identified. These caps aim to restrict transactions in cash and crypto-assets, mitigating the risk of misuse by criminals.</p>



<p>Banning of “Golden Passport” Schemes and Strict Controls on “Golden Visas”: The EU aims to ban citizenship-by-investment schemes (“golden passports”) and impose strong anti-money laundering controls on residence-by-investment schemes (“golden visas”) due to their high risk of misuse.</p>



<p>Creation of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) in Each Member State: Each member state will establish an FIU to prevent, report, and combat money laundering and terrorist financing. FIUs will share information with each other and with competent authorities, as well as cooperate with AMLA,<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/europol/"> Europol,</a> Eurojust, and the European Public Prosecutor’s office.</p>



<p>Increased Transparency with Access to Beneficial Ownership Registers: National FIUs and other competent authorities will have access to information on beneficial ownership, bank accounts, land or real estate registers, and high-value goods such as yachts, planes, and cars.</p>

			  Liam Karwan is a Sales Manager at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>I am Liam Karwan. I was born and raised in Brussels, Belgium. I moved quite a lot in my life. I have lived in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Thailand, and Portugal (where I have now settled). I have always enjoyed the thrill of going to a new city, getting to know the local way of life, and meeting new people with different mindsets.&nbsp;</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>My passion for blockchain started in 2017 during the ICO boom. I did not know or understand much about the technology back then. After starting my career in finance and investment banking, I realized that blockchain would actually be the best technology to disrupt the financial industry. I then did some research, and Tokeny seemed like the most advanced solution to be able to accomplish this complex mission.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>The team is amazing, everyone is looking after each other and everyone has a strong sense of responsibility since day one. It is good to know that although we have a remote work policy, everyone is always reachable and ready to help when needed. As a growing startup, it is rewarding to feel that you are part of a team that is working all together towards the same goal.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Regarding my passions, nothing out of the ordinary. I do not collect stamps, or rare coins 😅. I genuinely enjoy being surrounded by close friends and family, going outdoors and seeing what the world has to offer. I am a big football fan too and always enjoy watching my favorite team playing.&nbsp;</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My grandmother told me that her best achievement in life was to be able to look back at her life and be proud and happy about the way she lived it. Reaching the same conclusions would probably be my ultimate dream.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Take ownership of your tasks and be creative. Joining a growing company comes with lots of challenges, but also with its fair amount of opportunities. Also, do not be afraid to reach out to people and ask for guidance, the team is always going to be ready to help you.&nbsp;</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>The financial sector seems to be increasingly willing to adapt to the new technologies and opportunities created by blockchains. The future looks bright for the Tokenization industry.&nbsp;</p>

They’ve got the wrong mental model as to how this sort of change happens, expecting a fish to behave like a&nbsp;fowl.</p><p>A PDS is not just another digital app whose success depends on ‘going viral’. It’s not something where some venture capitalists fund an initially high ‘cash burn’ to achieve this viral growth, and then exit at a massive multiple (usually before the app has actually made any&nbsp;money).</p><p>It’s not that model at all. Personal data stores are infrastructure like water and electricity, like roads, railways and aviation: infrastructure that, when it is installed, rewires how the system as a whole works, changing both what people do and how they do&nbsp;it.</p><p>Infrastructure is never built in just a few short years. It takes decades: first to incubate it and second to install it. It takes many years to bring together all the technical, operational, organisational, commercial and perceptual breakthroughs, big and small, that are needed before a fundamental infrastructure development can take off. This includes ensuring safety, reliability, efficiency, ease of use, accessibility, scalability and economic viability, plus public understanding, reassurance and acceptance.</p><p>Then it takes many more years to actually install. An app can be installed (using pre-existing digital infrastructure) by millions of people in seconds. Making water, electricity and roads available to every household and workplace means painstaking installation work: house by house, street by street, town by town. Which takes&nbsp;decades.</p><p>PDSs are personal data infrastructure for a 21st century digital economy. Judging their success or failure as if they were some sort of digital app — by comparing cheese with chalk — is a potentially disastrous error.</p><p>Many other factors combine to compound this challenge.</p> Perceptions <p>Usually, when people say ‘it hasn’t happened yet so it never will’ they have what they think is a good reason why. In this mini-series we’ve addressed some of these misperceptions, for example the argument that <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/do-people-really-want-to-manage-their-data-bac784b98be1">people don’t want to manage their data</a>, or that <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/is-there-any-demand-for-personal-data-stores-80b9e57adb0a">there is no demand for personal data&nbsp;stores</a>.</p><p>It was ever thus. It’s almost inevitable that when something crops up to challenge an established way of doing things, the experts in those established systems — the ones most deeply immersed in making them work — quickly see all the reasons why the new approach ‘will never&nbsp;work’.</p><p>In the past, for example, consensus expert opinion dismissed the following as viable possibilities: gas lighting, powered flight (and subsequently commercial passenger aviation), transatlantic steamships, alternative current distribution of electricity, radio, rocket propulsion, nuclear energy, communication satellites, mass computing.</p><p>Think for a second how difficult it is to do each one of these things and you can see why the experts said what they said. Nevertheless, in each case, the experts ended up being proved wrong — mainly and precisely because they were experts in the old ways of doing&nbsp;things.</p> Vested interests <p>Other more practical reasons slow progress too, vested interests being an obvious case in point. If your power and riches depend on the old way of doing things, the last thing you are going to do is encourage a new way that threatens your power and riches. With personal data, many of the richest and most powerful organisations in the world have an existential fear and dread of individuals really being able to control their own&nbsp;data.</p> Inertia <p>Another banal but extremely powerful barrier is simple corporate inertia. Large organisations in both the public and private sectors have a deep aversion to any risk and to any effort that’s not directly related to their current priorities. Amongst these organisations, innovation is a bit like teenage sex. The less it’s done the more it’s talked about, especially by those who aren’t doing it. They don’t want to lose face amongst their&nbsp;peers.</p><p>An innovation means doing something that hasn’t been done before. For big corporates, that doesn’t spell opportunity; it sets alarm bells going. It means risk —the risk of something that may not work. And risk is the last thing they&nbsp;want.</p><p>Such risk aversion is actually quite reassuring. Large organisations survive as large organisations because they do things they know work. Huge amount of damage can be done by a large organisation doing something that doesn’t&nbsp;work.</p><p>The bad side however, is that when a new way of doing things comes along, the corporate instinct is to wait, and wait, and wait — until it’s been demonstrated completely and utterly without doubt that it works: that it won’t result in a negative Daily Mail headline.</p><p>This, in turn, creates a chicken-and-egg effect: organisations avoid adopting the innovation because they want to avoid the risk; but the ability to prove these risks either don’t exist or can be managed is hampered because few organisations want to touch it. Every one of the innovations in the list above struggled to get off the ground a) because they presented some very real risks and b) because of resistance from incumbents.</p><p>Effort aversion comes with risk aversion. Organisations invest a huge amount of time, money and energy creating systems that they know work. Given that time, money and energy are always limited, they much prefer to invest what they have in making these existing systems work better than explore alternatives.</p><p>Internal social dynamics reinforce this risk aversion. By definition, within a large organisation the person most likely to be most risk averse is the one with most responsibility for success — the boss. It takes courage for a team member to tell the boss they should be doing something different.</p> Conclusion <p>In his magisterial review of The Progress of Invention in the Nineteenth Century, published in 1900, E W Byrn noted that the motor car had been around in various forms for nearly thirty years and despite endless talk about its potential its overall impact on transport had been marginal. “It is not probable that man will ever be able to get along without the horse,” he concluded.</p><p>Economics history is full of people making such statements.</p><p>The common factor uniting those who say ‘it will never happen because it hasn’t happened yet’ is that they haven’t read their history. At Mydex, because we’re at the front line of it all, we are well aware of the difficulties of making a transformational change such as this happen. But we can also see a way through, and we are also aware of the increasingly rapid progress we are&nbsp;making.</p><p>Personal data stores will happen a) because they’re desperately needed and b) they are eminently doable. The rest is detail. Yes, there is an awful lot of detail, and working through this detail takes time. But that has always been true of innovation at the infrastructure level, and it always will&nbsp;be.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/personal-data-stores-havent-happened-yet-so-they-never-will-c383a7b4acfe">“Personal Data Stores haven’t happened yet. So they never will.”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Recent advances in AI have opened up new challenges and opportunities for social media. As content-generation costs drop, algorithms to help people sort through information must evolve rapidly.</p>
<p>At Bluesky, we’re approaching this challenge from a marketplace perspective. Our goal isn't to create every algorithm in-house, but to enable the developer community to bring new algorithms to users swiftly and effortlessly. In this blog post, we’ll provide an overview of our motivation behind creating a system that enables composable, customizable feed generation, and embraces third-party development.</p>
 Owning your attention 
<p>Your attention is an invaluable resource. A social platform's algorithm is responsible for curating the content in your feed. The algorithm, more than the content type or the app's appearance, is the core of social media because it directs how you spend your attention there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s usually very little transparency into how things are selected or why content is being shown to you. While you have the choice to open or close a social app, you often lack control over the content you see while using it. You might have some control over their feed through choosing who to follow or selecting a chronological feed option, but your ability to truly customize your experience is limited.</p>
<p>Due to the backlash against the perceived algorithmic manipulation of people’s timelines, some people say they really just want a chronological feed of who they follow. A feed of content from the people you follow ordered only by time is also an algorithm (albeit a very simple one). This should be an option if you want, but we think there are also many more ways this could work. The problem isn’t “algorithms” — the problem is a lack of transparency and control around how algorithms are used to direct your attention.</p>
 A Marketplace of Algorithms 
<p>We want a future where you control what you see on social media. We aim to replace the conventional "master algorithm," controlled by a single company, with an open and diverse "marketplace of algorithms."</p>
<p>With the AT Protocol v1 launch around the corner, we can confidently share our vision for this marketplace. Algorithms in ATP will act as aggregator services, similar to search engines. Users will be able to find, share, and add algorithms to their clients. Our UX design allows users to swipe between favorite algorithms or view a multi-algorithm feed.</p>
<p>Here’s how we’ve started building towards a world where users have control over what they see:</p>
 
 Developing APIs for feed generation: These APIs will be architecturally separate from the rest of the system, allowing for custom feed and moderation systems to be created as independent services. 
 Designing interfaces for third-party algorithm selection: We’re developing a feed selection system that enables users to explore third-party feeds and access them as effortlessly as their home timeline. 
 
<p>For developers, an open marketplace of algorithms will provide the freedom to experiment with and publish algorithms that anyone can use. Recent advances in machine learning will make it easy and exciting to experiment with new ways of structuring content.</p>
<p>For users, the ability to customize their feed will give them back control of their most valuable resource: their attention. Life is made up of all the little moments you spend your time on. We hope that the future of social apps is a framework that allows you to express your agency over how you spend your time.</p>
<p>While feed algorithms and search are the primary focus here, we’re using a similar approach to address reputation, misinformation labeling, and moderation.</p>
<p>Our goal is to assemble a social media architecture that composes third-party services into a seamless user experience, because an open ecosystem is likely to evolve more quickly than a single approach to curation or moderation developed within one company. By creating the interfaces for innovation in these areas, we hope to provide a dynamic and user-driven social experience.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Customer identity and access management (CIAM) is a major cybersecurity component of any company that maintains customer accounts. Online fraud and authentication attack attempts have grown significantly in the past several years, with attackers increasingly turning their attention to customers rather than companies. This can be seen, for example, in the finance industry, where attacks against customers now <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/email-security/attackers-target-vulnerable-financial-customers-rather-than-the-institutions-themselves">outnumber those on institutions or their employees by 4:1</a>.</p> 
<p>Protecting the safety of customers and their data is just one of the many reasons firms need to focus on CIAM as a security priority. Other reasons include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Keeping Customer Trust: A customer’s compromised account will damage their opinion of the firm involved, even though they may not be at fault.  
  Reducing Friction and Frustration: <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/367713/consumers-abandon-brands-after-frustration-over-id.html">61% of consumers</a> said forgetting passwords, failed login attempts and frustrating reset experiences cause them to abandon a transaction.  
  Minimizing Payouts: Many retailers refund fraudulent purchases as a matter of courtesy. With the growing number of attacks, this can be a significant expense.  
  Beating the Competition: Businesses often compete on customer service. If the CIAM experience is poor, consumers may try the competition.  
  Regulatory Compliance: With an ever-increasing number of consumers covered by data protection legislation and other regulations, stronger customer authentication methods may be needed to meet obligations.  
  
<p>However, CIAM often has distinct requirements and priorities from authentication used <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/which-form-of-authentication-is-the-strongest">by employees</a>. Different approaches are required for a context where security can be more complex, and customer conversion can be won or lost depending on the customer authentication method used. Below, we’ll look at different types of customer authentication methods and how they rate in terms of security and customer experience.</p> 
 Types of Customer Authentication Methods – Ranked  
 7. Passwords  
<p>A password is a string of secret characters that, in conjunction with a username or email address, is used to verify identity. It is considered a knowledge authentication factor in that the user must know the password in order to gain access.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>Accounts that only have a password for protection are extremely vulnerable to attack. There are numerous methods attackers can use, such as <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/brute-force-attacks-what-to-know">brute-forcing</a>, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/dictionary-attack">dictionary attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/phishing">phishing</a> and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle (MitM)</a>, to gain a user’s password. Attempts to improve password security by enforcing lengths or varying character types have also led to users committing severe security sins, such as keeping lists of passwords. Phishing techniques are very advanced and are often automated, which means attackers can steal the passwords of thousands of individuals at once.</p> 
<p>Customer Experience: </p> 
<p>Passwords have been used in computer authentication for more than 60 years. Though never very secure, passwords were popular as they gave the user control and were relatively easy to use. Now, however, not only have passwords become more complicated to remember but recovering a password is a regular and frustrating experience. This friction on the customer’’s end can cause them to become frustrated and choose another service provider or leave a purchase behind.</p> 
 6. Magic Links  
<p>Magic links allow customers to log into accounts using a one-time use link sent during the authentication process. After entering their username, a URL link is sent either to the customer's email address or their mobile phone via text.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>A magic link confirms a customer is who they say they are by verifying they have access to the email address or phone number linked to the account. Magic links are somewhat more secure than a password as they can’t be guessed or brute forced, but they can be easily intercepted or stolen. If a hacker gains access to a customer’s email account or text messages then they can take over any account verifying by magic links.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customer Experience: </p> 
<p>The concept is easy to use in theory as the customer only has to enter their email address or phone number and then click on the link that is sent — no passwords to remember. However, it assumes that the customer has quick and easy access to their email or smartphone, which won’t always be the case. From a conversion standpoint, it’s never a good idea to tell a customer on the verge of conversion that they should take their eyes off your site (and their shopping cart).</p> 
 5. One-time Passwords (OTPs) 2FA  
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/2fa-vs-mfa-an-explanation">Two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> requires a password plus another authentication factor, usually a one-time password (OTP). <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">OTPs are unique passcodes</a> that can only be used for a single login instance. The next time a user wants to access an application or website, they will need a different OTP.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>After a customer enters their login details, the OTP is sent by email or to their phone by SMS. The customer then enters the code to complete the login process. OTPs are more secure than a password only, however, commonly available phishing kits have become adept at extracting these codes from users. In addition, the rise of <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/sim-swapping">SIM-swapping attacks</a>, where attackers transfer a user’s number to a SIM they control, also renders OTPs highly vulnerable.</p> 
<p>Customer Experience: </p> 
<p>OTPs, especially those sent by SMS, are widely used to confirm a user’s “possession” factor of authentication, i.e., that they are in possession of a linked device (although many regulatory schemes do not allow SMS OTPs as proof of possession). They are fairly straightforward to use, however, they still require an additional action, on top of entering a password. Moreover, if delayed, they can cause frustration, leading users to request the OTP again and enter the wrong one. Essentially the system is asking the user to enter two passwords — one they’ve thought of themselves and one they’ve received — neither of which is a pleasant experience.</p> 
 4. Social Login  
<p>It has recently become widespread for users to access or create accounts with third parties based on their social media or Google account. This system is built on the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html">OAuth protocols</a> for allowing authorization between unrelated services, creating, in effect, a single sign-on (SSO) for mass usage.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>For individual companies, this authentication method can be useful as it theoretically absolves them of any authentication responsibility. However, on a broader scale, it may be less secure for the user as the related account may only require a username and password, which can be easily phished, allowing the attacker to use that account to access many more.</p> 
<p>User Experience: </p> 
<p>So long as you are logged into the social media or Google account, then everything is quite simple. You click which account you want to use at the login stage, and everything transfers through. The user experience problems arise when you’re not logged in, for example, when on a different device. With your account being entirely predicated upon your social media or email account, you don’t have any way to access it without logging into them as well.</p> 
 3. Push Notification MFA  
<p>A CIAM system looking to verify a possession factor may request a user to “push” a notification on an app to verify they’re in control of their device. After a customer enters their password, they receive a notification via smartphone app. The user must approve the push request in order to access their account.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>Though push authentication might seem relatively fool-proof, hackers launch <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notification attacks</a>, whereby they spam the user constantly until they give up and accept the prompt. Also known as MFA prompt bombing, such attacks <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-report">have skyrocketed in the past year</a>, fueled by easily available automated attack tools.</p> 
<p>Customer Experience: </p> 
<p>Push notifications are relatively seamless, depending on how they are deployed. The major user experience issue with them comes from the “push fatigue” mentioned above. Users can get quite irritated with constant rechecks of their credentials and being asked to push to verify.&nbsp;</p> 
 2. Passkeys (Multi-Device)  
<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are more secure and easier to use than passwords. Passkeys are a standard-based technology that, unlike passwords, are resistant to phishing, strong, and are designed so that there are no shared secrets. Passkeys cannot be written down or typed in which makes it harder for hackers to trick users into providing their authentication credentials.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>General consumer passkeys can be copied to other devices and shared. This makes them extremely easy for end user adoption but can increase the security concerns for IT and Security Team. They also do not satisfy the possession requirement under some regulations and are <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/#faq">not currently recognized as an official form of multi-factor authentication under these regimes</a>. However, signing in with passkeys is still far more secure than the above customer authentication methods.</p> 
<p>User Experience: </p> 
<p>Passkeys replace passwords, removing one of the biggest customer authentication frustrations and the biggest security risks. The user experience is familiar for customers as they sign-in to an app or website using the same biometric or PIN verification that they use to unlock their device. From the IT side of things, it’s a bit more complicated as any organization that wants to support <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passkeys-for-customer-iam-deployments">passkeys needs a FIDO2 server</a>.</p> 
 1. True Passwordless, Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/true-passwordless-mfa">True Passwordless MFA </a>is built on public key cryptography and uses device-native verification technology. Similar to how passkeys work (both are based on FIDO standards), the user’s private key for authentication is not transferred during login but is only used to digitally sign for authentication locally. Unlike passkeys, however, it is device-bound and cannot be passed amongst devices. It is inherently multi-factor as it simultaneously meets both the possession and the inherence (i.e., something you are) factors of authentication.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>Fully passwordless <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-fido2-authentication">FIDO-based MFA</a>, is one of the most secure customer authentication methods available. It can be thought of as a virtual hardware security key. It provides strong phishing resistance as there is no password, OTP or push notification for the attacker to hack. It stores the private key in the secure device TPM and does not transmit, share or sync it. Depending on the specific solution, it meets <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/open-banking-psd2-and-achieving-strong-customer-authentication">PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication</a> requirements and other industry regulatory requirements.</p> 
<p>User Experience: </p> 
<p>True Passwordless MFA allows customers to securely sign in with a single authentication gesture. As a user always has their biometric features with them, it removes further friction with navigating to other accounts, carrying security keys or remembering a code. It also supports multiple verification options if the user is unable to, or chooses not to, use biometrics. This makes it the most seamless of the customer authentication methods.</p> 
 HYPR’s True Passwordless MFA  
<p>Your CIAM processes are critical both from a security and customer experience perspective. Insecure or friction-laden customer authentication methods can lead to breaches, customer churn, lost sales, and regulatory fines, among other consequences. HYPR True Passwordless™ MFA reduces your customers’ frustration while improving security.

 Interested in entering the lucrative gaming industry? Here’s everything you need to know about online gambling licenses, their relevance and importance, who needs them, and much more.&nbsp; 



<p>The gaming industry is booming and shows no signs of slowing anytime soon. In fact, while numerous sectors, including financial services, are struggling, the global gaming industry is looking for new approaches to meet consumers’ needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gaming market was worth $63.53 billion in 2022 and is projected <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market#:~:text=The%20global%20online%20gambling%20market,11.7%25%20from%202023%20to%202030.">to grow</a> by 11.7% between 2023 and 2030. The most popular gambling markets in Europe, the United Kingdom is the largest online gambling market, with its GGR <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/29048/largest-regulated-online-gambling-markets/#:~:text=As%20data%20from%20H2%20Gambling,United%20States%20(%2411.0%20billion).">worth $12.5 billion</a> in 2021. Others include France with 3.8 billion and Germany with $3.6 billion that same year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, where there are opportunities there are always criminals looking for ways to exploit the system for their own benefit. Players who use underground gambling platforms and rogue casinos, which often do not have the most rigorous of KYC checks, run the risk of having their personal data and funds stolen. Players should avoid these rogue casinos at all costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To offer gambling services legally, every operator must hold a license and comply with specific regulations and standards set by one or more regulatory authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an online gaming business to be licensed means they are committed to a fair gambling policy and care about their reputation, among other factors. Holding an online gambling license is crucial for the operator and the consumer.&nbsp;</p>



 What is an online gaming license?&nbsp; 



<p>An online gaming license is a legal document issued by a regulatory authority that allows gambling operators to run online casinos and sportsbook platforms in certain regions or territories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an operator to legally provide gambling and betting services, they must hold a license covering the regions in which they want to operate. Obtaining a license typically involves a lengthy process that includes extensive paperwork and various fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Licenses cost money (the costs may act as a significant barrier to access a market) and oblige the operator to adhere to set regulations. The operator also needs a license to open merchant accounts, obtain AML compliance, buy and offer legal gaming software, and work with payment providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifics of regulations usually vary from one jurisdiction to another. Some regions have stricter prerequisites regarding online gambling than others. For instance, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> is among the most <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/cyprus/gaming/1147366/gambling-laws-in-europe#:~:text=the%20relevant%20licenses.-,United%20Kingdom,-United%20Kingdom%20is">stringent</a> regulatory bodies for gambling worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many countries want online gambling to enter the legal mainstream and have started cracking down on illegal gambling businesses. Those caught offering illegal gambling or betting services risk hefty fines and potential jail time. In 2022, there were record financial penalties ($269,532,490) and warnings – and even gambling-license suspension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In essence, a licensing body’s main roles include (but are not limited to) the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Eliminating crime from gambling.&nbsp;  Guaranteeing that all licensed gambling is fair and transparent.&nbsp;  Safeguarding <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">minors</a> and vulnerable individuals from potential harm and exploitation of gambling.&nbsp;  



 Who needs a gaming license?&nbsp; 



<p>Any business that offers facilities for gambling, betting, or participating in lotteries requires licenses to operate legally. Obtaining an online gambling license should be considered a priority since it is non-negotiable if you want to enter the world of legal gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A license is needed when registering a company, opening merchant accounts, proving credibility, and establishing the reputation of a fair gambling business in the eyes of B2B providers and players. It also allows licensees to operate in regulated markets and protects them from legal problems, fines, and imprisonment. Licensees can also enter new markets and work with renowned software developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online gaming licenses and remote gambling licenses are sometimes used interchangeably and refer to all gambling activities involving players participating via different forms of remote communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are the different types of online gaming licenses?&nbsp; 



<p>Types of online gambling licenses vary depending on the jurisdiction. Each licensing jurisdiction has its system. It can be uniform, including a single permit, comprising a variety of games. It can also be split across categories, depending on the kind of gambling or betting activity the licensee intends to offer. The cost of obtaining a permit typically comprises a one-time fixed fee, business registration and bank account fees, and regular renewal fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The type of gambling licenses needed by a business depends on various factors:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Category of gambling and betting, i.e., online slots, poker, sportsbook, etc&nbsp;  



  Jurisdiction of the operator and prospective customers&nbsp;  Operating currencies&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



 How to get an online gaming license.&nbsp; 



<p>As previously stated, regulations vary depending on the jurisdiction. The most common licensing requirements for licensing authorities include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Business registration, including trademarks and design, and having servers within the jurisdiction&nbsp;  



  Readying detailed information about the business’ main employees, origin and proof of funds, and onsite gambling operations&nbsp;&nbsp;  Enforcing AML policies on the online platform, and carrying out independent audits&nbsp;  Providing clear information regarding problem gambling and the prohibition of underage gamblers&nbsp;  Compiling all required documentation&nbsp;  Paying the necessary fees&nbsp;  



<p>Much like the licensing conditions, the required documents for obtaining a license vary from one region to another. The most common requirements include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Provide evidence of no criminal history&nbsp;  Passport copies of the business owners and main employees&nbsp;&nbsp;  Utility bill copies and bank statements&nbsp;  



  Description of the games and software to be offered&nbsp;  Sound business plan&nbsp;  



<p>Before issuing a license, regulatory bodies usually conduct background checks to ensure the operator is transparent and will not affect the reputation of the jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The most popular jurisdictions for issuing gaming licenses.&nbsp; 



<p>There are many recognized jurisdictions worldwide. Below are some of the most popular ones chosen by most operators:&nbsp;</p>



 Malta&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">The Malta Gaming Authority</a> provides B2B and B2C licenses, with the latter divided into four types. Each of these licenses enables the licensee to organize different types of gambling and betting businesses. Licenses remain valid for 10 years. Once the Maltese authorities accept an applicant’s licensing application and the required information, a decision is usually made within 12-16 weeks. The minimum total of all fees combined (initial application, licensing, system, and compliant audit fees), is €36,000.&nbsp;</p>



 The United Kingdom&nbsp; 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> accepts licensing applications for both online and land-based casinos. Applying for a British gambling license starts at about £25,000. Those with a cross-license agreement with the British administration can apply for a gaming license in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



 Curacao&nbsp; 



<p>Curacao is well known for its affordable pricing, low tax rates, and moderate requirements for obtaining gaming licenses. The island of Curacao offers two types of gaming licenses: a basic license and a sub-license. The jurisdiction allows licensees to organize various kinds of gambling activities under one license. Applications to the <a href="https://www.gamingcontrolcuracao.org/">Curacao Gambling Control Board</a> take nearly six weeks to review.&nbsp;</p>



 Gibraltar&nbsp; 



<p>A license from Gibraltar remains valid for five years. Being one of the strictest authorities, the licensing department only considers businesses with experience in the industry, particularly ones with other licenses from recognized jurisdictions, fair financial conditions, and a sound business plan. Generally, the prices have a straightforward structure: licensing for B2C operators running online casinos, betting platforms, and websites offering other gambling products cost £100,000. On the other hand, licensing for B2B providers costs £85,000.&nbsp;</p>



 The benefits of having an online gaming license. 



<p>Obtaining an online gambling license – especially from a respected authority and jurisdiction – has numerous benefits:&nbsp;</p>



  Reach global markets: Obtaining a license from a reputable regulator can allow businesses to gain exposure to global markets. For example, a Malta Gaming Authority license can be used internationally and help the licensee target global markets; specifically, those where gambling is legalized and no regulator is governing activity, like in Canada.&nbsp;  



  Legal business in prime jurisdictions: The UK is Europe’s most <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2020/12/European-Online-Gambling-Key-Figures-2020-Edition.pdf">prominent</a> gambling market, accounting for most of the continent’s market revenue. To offer gambling services legally in the UK, an operator must hold a local license from the UK Gambling Commission.&nbsp;  



  Financial benefits: Some licensing jurisdictions impose low to zero tax rates, allowing licensees to take advantage of fiscal benefits. Operators can also open settlement accounts in various jurisdictions.&nbsp;<br>  Partnerships with top software developers: Through proper licensing, operators can partner with award-winning developers in the industry, such as Microgaming, NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, Playtech, IGT, and more. Licensees can also benefit from ad campaigns created by such software providers, which often prove to be an asset for player retention business strategies.&nbsp;  



  Working with trusted financial institutions: Licensees can negotiate terms and establish strong relationships with renowned payment service providers, such as regional and global financial institutions, e.g., Neteller, PayPal, Trustly, Skrill, etc.&nbsp;  



  Credibility and authenticity: Players and businesses are significantly more likely to trust licensed online gambling operations. Licensed operators also enjoy numerous opportunities, as associations with well-known hardware, software, and other providers are easier to achieve.&nbsp;  



 The risks of not having an online gaming license.&nbsp; 



<p>Online gambling regulation ensures authorities and governments receive revenue and can protect operators and players from all types of crime and gambling-related harm, e.g., fraud, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/#:~:text=Money%20laundering%20involves%20disguising%20the,trading%2C%20bribery%2C%20or%20embezzlement.https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/#:~:text=Money%20laundering%20involves%20disguising%20the,trading%2C%20bribery%2C%20or%20embezzlement.">money laundering</a>, problem gambling, and the exposure of underage individuals to gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operating without a license can damage the reputation of a company and may even negatively impact the entire industry. Below are the disadvantages associated with not having an online gaming license:&nbsp;</p>



  Player distrust: Players trust licensed companies. This is for many reasons: a license from a respected regulator means the operator follows stringent rules regarding fair gaming, data security, and responsible gambling. Operators cannot guarantee safety and fairness without a proper license.&nbsp;  



  No cooperation from financial institutions: Financial institutions regard licenses as an agreement and pledge that the operator will not engage in criminal activity such as money laundering or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorist financing</a>. That is because regulatory bodies conduct thorough background checks to ensure the operator has no criminal record.&nbsp;  



  Little to no partnerships from software companies: Respected software developers and game providers avoid offering their services and products to unlicensed gambling providers. They do not want to risk associating their brand with companies that have the potential to engage in unethical practices.&nbsp;  



  Being blocklisted: Unlicensed gaming businesses face the imminent risk of being blocklisted by distinguished review platforms, regulators, and other organizations. A poor reputation may keep the operator from acquiring an online gambling license or having their current one revoked.&nbsp;  



  Risk of penalties and eventual shutdown: Operating in a certain region and not complying with the jurisdiction’s licensing laws can have dire consequences, including being blocklisted, hefty fines, legal problems (potentially leading to imprisonment), and eventual shutdown.&nbsp;  



 A legitimate gaming license is vital in a booming gaming industry.&nbsp; 



<p>With the ever-expanding gaming industry, having a valid gaming license is becoming increasingly important. Not only must businesses comply with their nation’s laws and regulations in order to protect consumers from harm, but they also need to demonstrate their commitment to responsible gaming practices to avoid any potential reputational damage or legal repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having a gaming license gives companies legitimacy, as well as acting as a financial buffer for losses incurred through fraudulent activity or cheating. Furthermore, it allows customers to assess a business’ reliability and trustworthiness when taking part in online gambling activities – ticking all of these boxes is essential for creating an attractive platform for gamers.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining to a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And today we’ll discuss a new perspective on verified digital identities. And for that, we have a special guest who is Adrian Field. He leads OneID’s market development, working with banks, industry groups, governments and regulators to enable the UK market for identity services to grow and succeed. He’s also engaged with OpenID Foundation developing global open standards for identity and global projects to connect identity schemes, cross-border. Hello, Adrian.</p>
<p>Adrian Field: Morning. Hi, thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure having you. Thank you. Let’s talk about digital identity but first, I’d like to hear a bit more about yourself. So, tell us, what was your journey into this world of identity?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yeah. So, my background is banking and payments originally, so I spent a long time with one of the card schemes, doing all sorts of things, but learned about the concepts of authentication and authorisation through that process. And then spent a few years at one of the UK’s large banks looking at lots of different innovation topics, but digital identity was one of those. And then I used my authentication knowledge to build on that to investigate more and more about, you know, what is identity? How do you prove that it’s the right person, in a journey, at the right time?</p>
<p>Oscar: And to start this conversation with common understanding, for ones who have not heard or is not completely clear. What is the concept of verified digital identity? So, what are we talking about when you use this term and why is it important?</p>
<p>Adrian: I normally explain this by going back to the question of, “what is identity?” without the digital part. And for us at OneID this is your, it’s the legal concept of your personhood. So, you are a person which is either a natural person, which is a human, or a kind of legal person, which is an organisation. And if you’re a person in UK law, that gives you certain rights, so you can own things, I can sign documents, I can own property. I have certain rights that non-persons, i.e., objects and things don’t have those rights. So, you get your legal identity by – as a person you’re entered into a birth register, or if you’re an organisation, you get entered into a company’s register or charities register as a legal organisation. And that’s how you get the identity part. That’s what an identity is.</p>
<p>The digitisation of that is, how do I securely connect that legal entity or the natural person to that legal identity in a digital process. So, I’ve got to have some way of verifying a birth certificate, or a passport, or a document or some other way to connect those two things together. And then I can store some data, which is the digital part. And I can protect that by providing that person with some secure authenticators, so they can reconnect to that digital identity and use it in other contexts. And that’s when it becomes a reusable digital identity and therefore, it’s more useful and also verified.</p>
<p>Oscar: In most of the countries, there are several co-existing identity verification products. There are some based on getting a passport ID cards, for instance, that’s one category. There are some based on mobile subscriptions. And the one I know you and your company, OneID, is focused is the identity verification based on online banking. So, why this category of verified digital identities are needed?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yeah, so we looked at the UK market, and we looked at a number of different markets that have digital identity schemes and solutions in place. And specifically for the UK, we didn’t feel the government ID was the right way to go. It was quite hard, because politically, people have looked at ID cards from the government in the past, and they didn’t really want those. Whereas in the UK, we’ve got a very strong financial services market. We’ve got open banking infrastructure, which all of the banks have put a lot of investment into. To meet Payment Services Directive 2 requirements, so some EU legislation. And part of that open banking is all around strong customer authentication. So being able to securely identify that you have the right person in place to prevent payments fraud and things like that.</p>
<p>So, we saw that as a very good technical platform on which to build an identity layer, so an identity scheme on top of that. So essentially, it’s a bank ID scheme. So, you leverage the Know Your Customer process that the bank has put you through, so that they know who you are, we can leverage that and make that available in any online customer journey. And it’s a very easy process, because most people in the UK already have the bank app or the credentials that they need to get through our OneID service. And we can enable that for around 40 million UK adults, for instance, already have what they need to use the service. So, it’s a lot less friction for the customers to understand what a digital identity is, all they need to do is click a button and consent to share some data.</p>
<p>And we do – there’s a lot of kind of documents scanning solutions in the market and we recognise, and we look at that as a kind of bridging technology. I’ve got to scan my documents which we kind of see that as a digitised identity rather than a digital identity. Because I’m digitising paper into a digital format, as a follow-on step from that I can choose to store that digital format somewhere with a provider to create a reusable identity, and then protect that in in some way. So, we see that as a long-term process as well.</p>
<p>And in terms of what the telco sector can bring, there’s a lot of kind of useful signals around telcos in terms of SIM swaps, when was the last date that my SIM was swapped, and where is the phone location-based data, and things like that. We definitely see telcos and banks working together and providing complementary features. Although there are some gaps in the telco market in terms of I could have multiple shared handsets on one account. So, it makes it harder for, to know all the IDs on that account, and pay as you go, for instance. If there’s no KYC on getting the device, then that becomes harder to do identities in that manner.</p>
<p>Oscar: Explain us a bit in a, let’s say concrete example. Thinking the user doing some transactions and doing something online in which requires the identity verification, in the case of these online bank base, verify data identities. If you can guide us to a use case to understand how it works.</p>
<p>Adrian: Yeah, sure. So, what our corporate customers who we – relying parties, we use that term. They would implement our service as a, we have a software development kit, an SDK. Essentially that they can embed our button within their app or website, so the consumer, as the service that consumers are trying to get to. They would then click that button, and then select the UK bank that they do their banking with. And once they’ve selected the UK bank, we would route them off to either the bank app that’s on their phone, or an online banking login page for their bank. And they login to that and they see what data that the relying party is requesting, they can consent to share that data. And then we hand off that customer back to the original service or relying party that they’re trying to access.</p>
<p>So, it’s a three click simple process, and the customer is completely in control and has good visibility of what data they’re sharing. And then through that process, we kind of avoid the need to educate the customer on, “This is a digital identity. This is what it is. And this is how you use it.” Because all you really see is I’m sharing my name, address, date of birth, with – I’m trying to get some car finance or trying to buy something online. That’s a lot easier for the consumer to understand in that context.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, so far, it’s already serving different types of relying parties, as you said, or, in practice service provider, or at least the other term just to use that. So, there are many, let’s say type of businesses and also, I guess, government that are already using this type of verified identity.</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes, exactly. So, we’re getting some good traction in e-signing, for instance. So currently, when you sign a document, you typically get an email into inbox, you then click the link and sign the document. But if that email goes astray, or if you, as the contracting provider, want to know that it went to the right person, you can insert a digital identity check in that process. So, we’ve built that and partnered with a number of the e-signature market to be able to have an identity and signature flow, which works really well.</p>
<p>Another use case we’re looking at is Disclosure and Barring Service or DBS Checks in the UK for employment. We can now do that in 100% digital process that doesn’t need documents scanning. So, it’s a much easier flow for the customer to get through.</p>
<p>And final use case is financial services where we’re live in the FCA Regulatory Sandbox working with one of our customers in the asset finance space where we can augment and supply some of the KYC data into their customer due diligence process for money laundering checking.</p>
<p>Oscar: And you have mentioned earlier that one of the reasons why this type of verified digital identity made a lot of sense in the UK is because, the UK has open banking among other parts of the system that are already working, working pretty well. So, if you can tell us a bit more about that online banking, how this approach is using or complementing open banking?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes, exactly. So, we’re regulated ourselves by the Financial Conduct Authority as the UK FS regulator. We’re an Account Information Service Provider under PSD2, so we have permission to access all of the banks without permissions or contracts from the banks. But you can only get certain limited data under the PSD2 directive. And it’s, you know, eIDAS is the regulation in Europe that covers identity. PSD2 is just about triggering payments and getting bank transaction data so it’s not about identity. So, we partner with the banks to get that additional information. So, we’re using open banking as technical rails to secure the API connectivity. But we have commercial partnerships with the banks to actually get the identity data.</p>
<p>Oscar: And this approach can be replicated in other countries?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes. So, we’re looking at other countries that have, either open banking, and digital identity frameworks. A lot of countries who will have both of those things and talking to other schemes in terms of how– sharing how people do it elsewhere; what’s worked, what hasn’t worked, and what needs to be put in place, if you haven’t got the relevant frameworks or standards. And how we can connect those things to enable cross-border journeys. So, there’s a lot of activity going on. I think there’s something like 60 countries globally have digital ID systems. They’re not all based on open banking, but open banking, online banking is emerging as a good model on which to base your identity for a number of different reasons.</p>
<p>Oscar: Coming back to the benefits that verified digital identities have, can you tell us what are some of those benefits both for individuals and for businesses?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes. So, I’ll start with businesses. So firstly, it acts as a key capability within digital transformation. So, understanding who your customers are, and enabling them to access your services in a much quicker way, will lead to increased sales. Basically, you’ll be able to onboard more customers more quickly. They’ll typically spend more with your company, because we find convenience always wins. So, the customers will also use the path of least resistance. If I have one service that is hard to get to and I need to go and find my document and do lots of different steps to get onto that service. Versus one that takes three clicks to get through to the same thing, typically, you’ll find your conversion is better with a simpler service.</p>
<p>We also think this will be a cheaper route. So operationally, the cost if you haven’t got – don’t need people checking documents, then it’s a cheaper provision of service. And also, for the business, we think this will lower fraud because we can keep fraudsters out of the loop because they can’t prove that they are who they are. So typically, impersonation fraud, someone’s pretending to be someone they’re not with a different name. If you then ask them to authenticate themselves with their bank account, they won’t have a bank account in that name so they just can’t get through the process. And this will help things like authorised push payment fraud, and other frauds in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>And then on the on the individual life. It’s really all about making my life simple. So, make my life easier, and not more complex. If I’m trying to get to a service, when I’m out and about maybe my ID documents at home, I can onboard to service easily just with the phone I have when I’m out. It makes my life really simple. We can actually onboard you to a service provider and also do a login afterwards as well. So, there’s no new passwords to remember. I get to see what data I’m sharing so I can control my data. I consent to share exactly what data has been asked for. I can see what data I’ve shared in the past through another consent service that we offer.</p>
<p>And in our model, the data is protected by my bank. So, someone I already have a relationship with, I trust my bank, I trust him with my money, I trust him with my information. And they can help me when it goes wrong as well. So, if something happens and identity is compromised, I can call my bank and say, “Can you help me out? Let’s figure out what went wrong and fix it.”</p>
<p>Oscar: Do you see there could be some cross-border challenges that come from specific country based digital identities?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yeah. So, a lot of a lot of this comes from, you know, interoperability in the standards space. So, what – how do I actually connect to these services, connecting together to share data from one scheme or solution to another one? What’s the kind of data format, what does the data mean? And then from a governance perspective, what’s the level of assurance that was been through, the checking of that identity before that data was issued? And do I trust that that process was followed properly?</p>
<p>So, in the UK, for instance, we have a certification regime set up where I can actually get an independent auditor to verify that I’m safe and doing these things properly. And therefore, you build in different layers of trust in the data that comes out of that ecosystem. And do you have equivalents of those things across different corridors. But essentially, identity, or legal identity always comes from a national authority, so it always will be nation-based. I got my identity from being on a birth register in a country. And then they issued me with a passport, driving license, et cetera, digital identity can be added on to those things.</p>
<p>So, I do see we will have 200 plus countries issue identity, and in what format they do those things. And that’s where some of the work I’m doing with OpenID Foundation and others is in terms of; how do we come up with better, easier-to-use standards that can enable, all of these things, to talk to each other.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how are this type of approach of online bank based verified identity fits with eIDAS 2.0, if it fits?</p>
<p>Adrian Field: Yes, there’s a lot of interesting activity going on in Europe with eIDAS 2.0 with the whole kind of shift to digital wallets and people having a wallet or a container that they can then put digital identity credentials into. What are the kinds of standards and infrastructure that enables that to happen? And how do we give people more control and visibility about what data they have, enable them to choose to share that data with third parties, and a privacy respecting, data minimisation, all of those good things happen through that. And I think that the kind of eIDAS 2.0 framework started to drill down through the layers to say how these things actually going to be implemented, which is really good.</p>
<p>And we’ve got four or five large scale projects with lots of different parties involved, with lots of good capabilities. So, we’re watching that space quite closely in terms of what’s our equivalent approach in the UK to digital wallets between the government, the banking sector, us as a provider, how those things work and interoperate together. To be able to securely provision those credentials into the right wallet.</p>
<p>And I do think some key challenges are going to be around how do you bind the credential to the wallet? How do you bind the wallet to the device, and the person that owns it, to make sure that the credentials that are being presented actually belong to the person that’s in front of you, or in that digital journey?</p>
<p>Oscar: How, first of all, is the UK Trust Framework is supporting verified digital identities?</p>
<p>Adrian: I think the UK government is doing really well with the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology. There’s a new department, but they’ve now taken over ownership with the trust framework. The Trust Framework is in a beta version, and we have 36 providers in the UK market that have been certified under a number of different roles within that framework.</p>
<p>So, I think the UK government’s work has certainly catalyse the UK identity market and enabled providers, such as ourselves, to be certified for services within that. And also, they have launched – there are three schemes, there’s a right to rent, right to work and Disclosure and Barring Service schemes that have been launched under that. Where if relying parties are looking to buy services from the market, the framework is recommending that they use certified providers because you’ve got that layer of trust that you don’t have with non-certified services.</p>
<p>So, I think it’s been a very good framework that’s evolved and enabling the UK market to progress from where it was before. And also, for – we now have a kind of reference point for; anyone that’s doing anything and identity in the UK and point towards the framework and say, “Well, let’s do it this way. We can have that common language between each other. We all know what the inputs and outputs are in terms of a common approach. So, it has been really good.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and as you said earlier when I asked you about the, what are the verified data identity? You mentioned very clear there are verified identity for individuals, which mostly what we’re talking in this conversation, but also you mentioned there’s also for the organisations. So, that touches the topic of the Legal Entity Identifiers, LEIs, to go your view how do LEIs are supporting verified digital identities?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes, I think this is – these are essential and the whole, the work through GLEIF and the whole ecosystem of, how do we give unique identifiers to legal organisations globally? That can then be used to create security around who are the business organisations that I’m dealing with, who owns which assets, etc. Who owns – what’s the kind of parent-child relationship, in particular businesses, as well. Absolutely helps understand that kind of transparency and trust of, I know, organisationally, who I’m dealing with, who I’m contracted with.</p>
<p>And then we can add in the individual identities from things like OneID to say, “I know who the individuals are, and I’ve verified the individuals.” I can then start to connect those two things together. So, I’ve got OneID for an individual, I’ve got an LEI that I know it’s this particular company. And I can then join those two things together to say, this individual is acting as a director of that organisation. Or it’s the Chief Financial Officer, and they have access to the bank account information. And then you can then start to secure those channels to say, “I’ve only got certain notified people should have access to my corporate bank accounts.” It then protects the corporate bank accounts from fraudulent use of internal people, or the wrong internal people accessing those accounts.</p>
<p>And also, when you’re paying other companies, you can then start to verify, “Am I paying the right company? Am I dealing with the right person within that company, in terms of individual identities?” So, it becomes very powerful, the combination of both.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. And I really hope to see this – exactly the use case that you just described I hope to see really in the in the near future. Unless, unless you have already seen them. But yeah…</p>
<p>Adrian: And we’re looking at those kinds of use cases as well to say, you know, how can we actually do better corporate identity, and use the LEIs for all sectors, really. So, LEIs have been born out of the financial sector, through regulation. But we do see business use in all sectors is useful, to be able to enable less fraud within a country, or better and smoother cross-border use cases for companies.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, certainly. A final question, Adrian, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Adrian: I would say, come and talk to us, so my email is <a href="mailto:adrian@oneid.uk">adrian@oneid.uk</a>. Come talk to us, come and engage with the services, come and test and learn and try them out. So, we’re live and we have an easy-to-use API that takes a few hours to integrate. We’re also based on open standards, with OpenID Connect. So, it’s very easy to get up and running with a service and start to consume it, to see what kind of data you get from the service, what kind of assurance, and what certification? How does this interoperate in terms of other things in the market? What kind of solutions are you using today? What kind of problems you have, that these solutions can potentially address? But it’s all ready and up and running, so yes, just come talk to us.</p>
<p>Oscar: Again, it was very nice, very interesting discussing with you Adrian and all the best.</p>
<p>Adrian: OK, thanks for having me.</p>

  <p>Adopting a Zero Trust security model of strict identity verification and access control for every user or device is widely accepted as a solution, but many organizations struggle to find the best route to implementing it. Join security experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and Zero Networks as they discuss network segmentation as a departure point and how microsegmentation is evolving to make it easier to use.</p>
<p>Alexei Balaganski, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts will explain the problems with network security, how microsegmentation addresses those problems, what it is, how it works, and why previously it has not been more widely recognized and adopted as a means of achieving ZTNA.</p>
<p>Nicholas DiCola, VP of Customers at Zero Networks will outline and demonstrate the concept of intelligent microsegmentation. He will explain how this approach makes it easy for organizations to use microsegmentation to achieve least privilege networking automatically and in a scalable way for every user and device without having to deploy agents or configure policies.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pioneering-zero-trust-network-access"></a>

<p>Regulators worldwide intensify their scrutiny of the crypto industry, the CFTC files a lawsuit against Binance for evading US regulations, G7 finance leaders prepare to discuss tighter crypto rules following FTX’s collapse and bank failures, and Huobi advisor Justin Sun faces SEC fraud charges, potentially impacting the company’s VASP license application in Hong Kong.</p>



 CFTC Targets Binance for Evading US Regulations 



<p>Lately, US regulators have been targeting more and more crypto market players. Making headlines now is the suit filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against Binance, as an outcome of an investigation started in 2021, for allowing US citizens to access their platform and transact in BTC, ETH and LTC without registering with the derivatives regulator.</p>



<p>Internal communication from Binance revealed that the entity knowingly and willingly did so by obfuscating the locations of its executive offices, as well as their identities.</p>



<p>The full details of the lawsuit and allegations against Binance can be read <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/60YAbCz/cftc-binance-pdf">here</a>.</p>



 G7 Finance Leaders to Tackle Crypto Regulations in the wake of FTX Collapse and Bank Failures 



<p>The G7 is a group of seven countries with the most advanced economies (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States; the EU is an active participant, however, not an enumerated member) and its presidency rotates annually, currently held by Japan.&nbsp; Its aim is to address transnational issues, such as financial stability, international security among others.</p>



<p>Days before the annual Leaders’ Summit is hosted in May, the group will discuss, in a meeting of finance ministers and central banks, the tightening of crypto regulations in order to protect consumers and promote business transparency, as an outcome of FTX’s collapse and the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.</p>



<p>Although it issues policies, the G7 is not a formal entity, thus with no legislative or authoritative power to enforce them.&nbsp;The efforts, statements and reports issued by G7 are valuable for international and national organizations from various fields as resource tools in supporting their work and advance national legislation.</p>



 Huobi Advisor Justin Sun Faces SEC Fraud Charges 



<p>Justin Sun, who serves as an adviser to Huobi Global, has been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59">charged</a> with fraud, by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, due to selling two unregistered crypto tokens and manipulating trade&nbsp;in one of his three companies. Huobi moved its headquarters from Singapore to Hong Kong and is in the process of obtaining a VASP license from Hong Kong’s Securities Futures Commission (SFC).</p>



<p>The new charges brought against Sun may have negative repercussions for Huobi’s application.</p>



<p>Hong Kong’s new licensing framework goes into effect in June 2023, which will allow retail investors to trade cryptocurrencies. Currently there are only two licensed exchange platforms in this territory and only high net-worth individuals are allowed to trade crypto on one of them.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — March 20th to March&nbsp;26th <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we look into the upcoming G7 crypto regulatory recommendations, the proposed bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Act, the CFTC Commissioners urging collaboration with the SEC for harmonized crypto regulations, and the EU to vote on MiCA in&nbsp;April.</p><p>We are closely monitoring and analyzing regulatory developments while taking into account the importance of protecting the ecosystem. Let’s dive straight into the recap&nbsp;now.</p> G7 to Unveil Crypto Regulatory Recommendations <p>As the G7 summit approaches in May, the member states are reportedly gearing up to advocate for tighter cryptocurrency regulations worldwide.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/Moonchaser2020/status/1640190489797246976?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>This potential regulatory push could have significant ramifications for crypto users and the broader digital asset community, altering the landscape of this rapidly evolving&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Recommendations on regulating, supervising, and overseeing global stablecoins and crypto asset activities are expected by July and September this&nbsp;year.</p><p>While the overall tone of the recommendations remains unknown, the potential for stricter regulations could create both challenges and opportunities for the crypto community.</p><p>On the one hand, tighter regulations may hinder innovation and limit the adoption of cryptocurrencies. On the other, enhanced transparency and consumer protection could foster greater trust and increase mainstream adoption, ultimately strengthening the&nbsp;market.</p> EU Parliament Gears up for Crucial MiCA Vote in&nbsp;April <p>The European Union is on the verge of formalizing the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), establishing a licensing regime for cryptocurrencies across the&nbsp;bloc.</p><p>With a 28–1 vote in favor by the Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee last October, the EU is now all set to debate over MiCA on April 18 and final vote the following day on&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>Additionally, the Transfer of Funds regulation, which aligns with FATF Travel Rule requirements, will be discussed and is expected to be approved shortly after&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>If MiCA and the Transfer of Funds regulation are approved, crypto companies will be required to adhere to governance and consumer-protection norms. They will also have to verify user identities and exchange data with counterparty VASPs during transactions to minimize money laundering and terrorism financing risks.</p><p>Although these regulations aim to ensure consumer protection and market stability, their potential impact on user experience and privacy remains a concern for the crypto community.</p><p>As the EU legislators prepare to decide on MiCA, industry stakeholders have a crucial role to play. They should design processes and safeguards to shield the end users from potential regulatory backlash by prioritizing user experience and&nbsp;privacy.</p> Bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Act for a Clear US Regulatory Environment Aims to Streamline Crypto Industry Oversight <p>US House of Representatives Majority Whip Tom Emmer has introduced the Blockchain Regulatory Act (BCRA), a bipartisan bill designed to bring regulatory clarity to the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>Co-led by Representative Darren Soto of Florida and backed by members from both political parties, the bill aims to create a more sensible regulatory environment for blockchain developers and service providers not involved in holding or managing consumer&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Emmer insists that by distinguishing these entities from money transmitters subject to stringent regulation, the BCRA could potentially alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens and encourage innovation within the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>If passed by Congress, BCRAthe Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act could significantly benefit the crypto community by increasing investor confidence, reducing regulatory uncertainty, enhancing consumer protection, and promoting adoption.</p><p>However, the bill’s success ultimately depends on securing a majority of votes in Congress. If achieved, this legislation would represent a significant victory for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, paving the way for future growth and innovation.</p> CFTC Commissioners Urge SEC Collaboration for Harmonized Regulations <p>At the DC Blockchain Summit, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Kristin Johnson emphasized the need for collaboration between the CFTC and SEC to establish a digital token classification framework.</p><p>They highlighted the importance of precise legal terms in defining market participants’ obligations and responsibilities, as well as the limitations of enforcement authority and regulatory oversight.</p><p>Mersinger and Johnson also stressed the significance of a global regulatory relationship, citing Japan’s pioneering regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies established in&nbsp;2016.</p><p>Commissioner Mersinger advocated for “global harmony,” emphasizing the CFTC’s unique role in aligning its rules with international regulations.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-block-perspective-march-2023">European Crypto Regulatory Climate and its Impact on Crypto Ecosystem</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/gibraltar-based-xapo-bank-to-enable-usdc-services-amidst-banking-crisis">Gibraltar-Based Xapo Bank to Enable USDC Services Amidst Banking&nbsp;Crisis</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">The Most Googled Questions on FATF Travel Rule&nbsp;Answered</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 In this vlog, 1Kosmos CSO, Mike Engle, is joined by CodeCluster CEO, Mike Vitez, to discuss how 1Kosmos, Arculus, and CodeCluster partner to reduce fraud. 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>All right, thank you for joining. My name is Mike Engle, head of strategy and co-founder at 1Kosmos. Today I’m joined by Mike Vitez, CEO of CodeCluster. Mike, would you be so kind as to introduce yourself and give people a little bit about your background?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Thank you for this introduction and thank you for the opportunity to participate in this video with you together. I really appreciate this opportunity. So as Mike told me, I’m Mike Vitez, I’m the founder and CEO of CodeCluster, a system integrator company focused on web two and web three technologies. I personally been in for almost a decade in the industry, started as a computer scientist and then starting my own system integrator company, which differentiates us on the market is that we are not a typical development chef. We mostly do products including the architecture and giving out Scrum masters project managers. So let’s say, full product teams including business analysts, et cetera. And on the other side regarding custom development, we are integrating web three modules and web three elements into custom development projects. That’s how we got in touch with you also and how we started working with you as 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>No, that’s great. I guess the term custom development project is a bit broad. Maybe you could give an example of a type of integration that you do and what your role is in a process like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>So this custom development phrase as a project covers in the whole integration process, which starts with a consultation where we understand that what is the need of the business, what we are trying to solve, and then we start integration the whole modules from the separate teams and the separate providers. For example, from our perspective, we don’t want to achieve any solution, like to be easy to understandable, we don’t want to create an e-commerce solution. We want to create a solution that can be a solution for an e-commerce business. So we try to solve a business issue, not a technical issue from our side. And custom development means that if we are working with modules from parties, not just ours, then we are the ones who are putting the parts together and probably we can create our own solutions that needs to be developed for the specific reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>That’s great. No, thanks for explaining that. There’s one particular project which we’re going to dive into here today. It is kind of a three-way partnership between 1Kosmos, CodeCluster and Arculus, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>For those that aren’t aware of Arculus, they are the leading cold storage wallet in the marketplace today. Cold storage wallets are used for, most of the time, storing of things like crypto keys, keeping a private key private, and compared to other form factors in the marketplace. The Arculus card, I have one here but don’t have time to pull it out of my wallet, it’s a basic credit card form factor and the company that’s behind that called CompoSecure, they’re a public company and they make most of the metal credit cards in the world today. This Arculus card has some amazing benefits, superior security, it’s got what they call three-factor authentication. And maybe you could talk a little bit about why Arculus, 1Kosmos and CodeCluster came together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>So our role was to create, at first a frame for this card. Arculus hired us to create a mobile application for their cards and we integrated 1Kosmos solutions into the pipeline, so this is a very good example for this custom development process I mentioned above, because after we have made the whole design process, the whole point of the process, we made the application by ourselves based on the design and the needs, what Arculus brought to us. Then after we were able to integrate 1Kosmos SDK as the KYC provider for this particular case and for the security reasons that needs to be done from 1Kosmos’ side to make Arculus to be able to use this solution on the market. So we were the ones who put these parts together, our role was the system integrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Right. As you described. So the perfect use case for your organization and the type of expertise you bring to the table. There’s a process that was in introduced, and that is proving somebody’s identity and we call that Identity Enrollment, which brings a couple disciplines together. So there’s matching somebody’s face to government credentials, verifying the integrity of the credentials, obviously all the security and decisioning bias has to be addressed with that as well. So at the end of this process though, you’re able to use the Arculus card for some pretty neat capabilities. Could you talk about the capability that is brought to the table, what you can do with this card from a transaction perspective?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>Yes. I’ve got two answers for that. Firstly, I would briefly introduce how this pipeline works, how the workflow goes through the registration. Then I can talk about the benefits of the integration. So during this card registration with 1Kosmos BlockID, the user’s payment card creates new keeper. Through the 1Kosmos BlockID app, the user approves the unique authorization by tapping the secure Arculus payment card to the back of our mobile device. So with that case, we’ve been testing and using these physical devices also by ourselves, it was a very interesting part, I have to say. Every one of my developers was super excited about this part and, “I want the card, I want the card.” Everybody said that. So yeah, this is really a cool use case to use also from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>So what we have seen that the real benefit in this case is the heightened security because this solution that was 1Kosmos made is totally eliminating the use of a password to authenticate users, which means that we are eliminating all the risks to inherit into password, including sharing, loss and theft from cyber attack, like account takeover. User authentication is always a problem because in a lot of cases you forget to remember your password authenticate.</p>
<p>So I think that everybody faced that issue in the past, and in that case, a simple tap from the Arculus card is enough to make the users authenticated. So in that case, we are eliminating these need of passwords and password biggest attacks, which I think is the future because the leak, the biggest security leak is still and the most vulnerability point of every system is still the password. So I think that this kind of authentication can be a good solution to solve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, there’s a phrase that’s getting really popular, “Hackers don’t hack in anymore, they just log in.” Because they’ve stolen the username and password, and as we saw just this week, the big announcement about how the LastPass hack happened, they basically put a keystroke logger on the main developer’s home machine and got access to all the keys. Imagine if that last pass developer had to go like this with the Arculus card and tap it to the back of the phone for as you put a card present transaction or an incredibly strong factor. And that’s what you guys have developed and brought to the table with this capability be just this simple act and this amazing form factor, which fits in my wallet, is a real game changer in the industry.</p>
<p>So Mike, it’s been really a pleasure speaking with you and hearing about the process, the success story that’s already to market and is brewing as this really picks up speed and looking forward to working with your team in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, me too. And also I really appreciate being represented here and also it was enjoyable process working with both, 1Kosmos and both, with Arculus together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>All right, let’s keep on keeping on. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Every year, the Ponemon Institute surveys more than 2,500 IT leaders who are immersed in PKI management at an enterprise level. The most recent survey — issued in mid-2022 — identified a pattern seen over previous years. According to authors of the study, PKI continues growing in importance in terms of enterprise security and enablement, yet companies are struggling to achieve “PKI maturity” on a couple of fronts.</p>
<p>Barriers to PKI maturity: Funding and talent</p>
<p>Funding presents one large obstacle for most organizations. Few CFOs or other senior leaders understand what PKI is, making it difficult to build a case for securing budget. A second and more imposing obstacle, according to the survey, is a persistent shortage of skilled IT and IT security practitioners. This is a widespread problem that cuts across all markets, company sizes and regions of the world. There simply are too few workers with strong PKI management skills. That gap is creating serious challenges for CISOs and other IT leaders looking to mitigate the risks of ubiquitous cyberattacks.</p>
<p>So, if PKI talent isn’t readily available on the market, how do you build a team? Which tasks do you keep inside the organization and which ones do you outsource to a trusted partner? Before we dive into those questions, let’s quickly review the key roles requires for effective PKI and certificate management:</p>
 
 Certificate Authority (CA) Administrator: People in this role are responsible for analyzing security data and producing reports regarding the enterprise’s system security status. They conduct system security risk assessments and penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities and implement remediation actions. They also establish security best practices and are generally responsible for the overall health of the PKI infrastructure. 
 Auditor: This is the PKI team member responsible for defining which CA events and for reviewing the security log for events related to PKI management and operations. 
 CA Officer: This role is responsible for managing digital certificates and cryptographic keys. This includes the important tasks of certificate issuance, renewal, revocation, issuance and deletion. 
 Backup &amp; Recovery Specialist: People in these roles are accountable for the ongoing backup and recovery of the CA database and configuration settings. 
 
<p>The increasing importance of digital security prompts many organizations to staff these roles internally and keep the tools that allow access to “the crown jewels” inside the organization. For most in-house approaches, companies create small and specially trained teams that manage the entire life cycle of digital certificates and keys. Responsibilities for these small but mighty teams include creating and updating security policies, ensuring the security and integrity of root signing keys, managing user registrations, and staying current on crypto standards and protocols.</p>
<p>Companies increasingly lean on trusted cybsersecurity partners</p>
<p>But because these teams are small, it’s easy for them to become overwhelmed with the time-consuming responsibilities of urgent requests to resolve lost, compromised or expired certificates. In fact, these day-to-day management responsibilities can require so much manpower that many companies end up finding a trusted outside partner to help with those tasks. This is true even when sophisticated tools are deployed for automating certificate and key management.</p>
<p>These PKI management challenges are magnified as organizations grow. If growth is organic — or simply involves the expansion of existing digital ecosystems — the challenge is simply a matter of volume. But in the event of mergers or acquisitions, teams likely have to take on the massive and complex task of integrating disparate architectures and platforms, which are likely using a number of PKI solutions.</p>
<p>This reality — coupled with the challenges of funding headcount and finding qualified candidates — is leading to more widespread use of external managed services for PKI life cycle management. Partnering with an external provider of cloud-hosted PKI infrastructure-as-a-service provides CISOs and other IT leaders with access to personnel, systems and distributed data centers that scale to meet the demands of an enterprise.</p>
<p>Key strategy: Hiring moldable talent</p>
<p>But even if an external managed service is engaged, organizations need skilled people to oversee certificates, keys and other critical elements of a digital ecosystem. Considering that (according to a 2022 ISC2 market study) there is a global cybersecurity workforce gap of 3.4 professionals, how can you even build a small team?</p>
<p>One answer is to shift your focus from hiring fully trained, plug-and-play talent to finding people with the right soft skills who are highly receptive to training. Instead of searching for unicorns who bring every certification and skill set to the job on day one, look for good, smart people who want to learn — and have a professional affinity for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Just as it is with developers and software engineers, the technologies, standards and best practices surrounding cybersecurity are moving so fast that it’s more important to have people who are willing to learn than people who are deeply familiar with cybersecurity particulars of the moment. Given the global shortage of cybersecurity talent, it’s likely a more prudent path to hire enthusiastic and hard-working people to learn the PKI trade. Then, fill in any gaps with external partners you trust — while maintaining control over your certificates and keys.</p>
<p>Tips for building a successful PKI program</p>
<p>In addition to resolving the PKI talent gap, it also helps to build a secure and manageable PKI program. Here are some tips for that:</p>
 
  Maintain good key and certificate hygiene and conduct regular scans: Know where your keys and certificates are located, how they were generated, and when they expire. Build accountability into your processes. Know precisely who has access to keys and certificates and where they are stored. Create a life cycle management process that keeps you in control. 
  Built a collaborative risk management strategy: Digital security is becoming a boardroom topic, so this should be easier than in previous years. Analyze your risk profile across the entire enterprise. Include people from business units, compliance, IT, engineering and other disciplines. Make sure everyone understands the plan and knows why adhering to the processes you establish is necessary. 
  Achieve a balance of strong security and excellent user experience: You could create a bullet-proof cybersecurity strategy if you didn’t have to worry about user experience. But without productive employees, engaged business partners and happy customers, you wouldn’t have anything to protect. Work closely with all user groups to explain the benefits of security and identify the security measures that both protect them and keep them engaged. 
 
<p>Building a strategy that incorporates these principles and focusing your hiring practices on promising talent rather than people with deep and specific knowledge will help you create a successful and sustainable security strategy in a world full of great opportunities and ubiquitous threats.</p>

<p>At the Gartner IAM Summit 2023, Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, presented on the promising future of true B2B IAM. Attendees of the Summit can replay this session via the Gartner app. However, for those who didn’t attend, this overview will cover the key takeaways from the session.</p>
 Current B2B IAM 
<p>To understand why nobody is delivering true <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/b2b-iam/" title="B2B IAM">B2B IAM</a>, we need to look at what is being delivered today. B2B IAM focuses on the external identities – i.e., partners, suppliers, consultants etc.</p>
<p>Delegated administration is a key (and very beneficial) feature of B2B IAM. When using delegated administration in B2B IAM, the entity that knows what the identities should be manages the external identities, so that they can effectively&nbsp;oversee the identity lifecycle management. Whether done through federated authentication or management monitored, the central point retains control over the authentication and authorisation of external identities.</p>
<p>Therefore, B2B IAM systems are still managing the identities&nbsp;of individuals. This leads us to question, how is this different from B2C IAM? Although B2B IAM makes identification and authentication simpler, it still follows the same processes as B2C. In these scenarios, transactions are made with organisations (perhaps shops, restaurants etc.), rather than an individual. Yet this proposes a security challenge.</p>
 The Challenge of Transaction Values 
<p>The security in a transaction comes from being able to identify the parties involved and using that identification to work out the risk involved in the transaction and managing that risk appropriately.</p>
<p> Higher assurance identities provide a lower risk, whilst the risk increases with lower assurance identities. With any given risk, we can choose what kind of transaction value we’re prepared to tolerate within that.</p>
<p>There are, and have been, many ways for individuals to verify they are dealing with verified organisations. However, there is currently no technical identification to verify a legitimate transaction. This is why highly assured organisational identities are needed to identify the endpoint in transactions with organisations.</p>
 Which Organisational Identity to Choose 
<p>There are many organisational identities that exist today. The World Trade Organisation are pushing an initiative for cross-border paperless trade, based on organisation identities. Within their toolkit they list the five preferred subject identifiers that will be used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Only one of these identifiers represents a highly assured identity that is suitable for use in identifying the endpoint in transactions and reducing the associated risk. The LEI is globally unique, externally validated and has public access, meaning it can be looked up, at no cost, with full visibility for that highly assured organisational identity.</p>
 What is an LEI? 
<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) was created as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. It tells you who is who, and who owns who. Understanding this consolidated ownership is key to stopping the circular investment meltdowns that caused the financial crash. For more about LEIs, see: <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/corporate/what-is-legal-entity-identifier/" title="What is a Legal Entity Identifier and what can you do with it?">What is a Legal Entity Identifier and what can you do with it?</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Due to the LEI’s implementation through an open data framework, and the strict accreditation rules through the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF), the LEI is a highly assured organisation identifier. The G20, with the FSB, have a target to grow the number of LEIs to about 20 million by 2027 (about 10% of organisations globally), at which point we’re beyond that critical mass stages of having that highly assured organisation identifier.</p>
 What can happen if you get Organisational Identity Wrong? 
<p>Having or representing the wrong organisation identity can have serious consequences and significant financial impact. Who remembers the <a href="https://www.keatingchambers.com/case-report/liberty-mercian-ltd-v-cuddy-civil-engineering-ltd/">Cuddy Group vs Liberty Mercian contract case</a>, resulting in a 5 million GBP bill? Or the fake Eli Lilly Twitter account which cost $15 billion on their market cap?</p>
<p></p>
<p>These cases show how it’s critical that not only do you have a highly assured organisation identity, but that you can attribute it to the right person to represent that.</p>
 Why True B2B IAM is the Future of Digital Identity 
<p>The combination of a strongly authenticated individual with a highly assured organisation identity enables you to express who you are, who you represent, and the rights that you have to represent them.</p>
 
 Strongly Authenticated Individual<br>
The rise in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/european-reusable-strong-identity/" title="reusable identity">reusable identity</a> schemes globally means that reusable, strongly authenticated, highly assured identities are becoming easily available and accessible for individuals. 
 High Assured Organisation<br>
The LEI is available globally and is a highly assured organisational identity. 
 Ability to Combine Them<br>
To combine the strongly authenticated individual and the highly assured organisation is a technical operation. 
 
<p>Firstly, a form of assurance is required, a vetting of records – but that assurance is required to get identities. The second factor for combining them is delegation. But not just delegated administration that is seen in current B2B IAM, as discussed earlier, but generic delegation is required. Delegation chains, within operational workflows, are what adds value to the business proposition.</p>
 How Delegation Completes the Picture 
<p>Organisations are big tree structures, from a management and execution point of view, the rights to operate flow through that structure. The governance framework for the organisational flow is embodied within an individual’s contract or job description, but these checks and validations are usually administrative.</p>
<p>What if generic delegation, across all operations within the organisation, was implemented instead of delegated administration alone. Being able to do all business operations through the delegation chain is the true value that delegation brings.</p>
 Example: Payroll Operation Delegation 
<p>Many organisations outsource payroll to third-party organisations. Delegation allows the organisation to delegate its rights and responsibilities for submitting payroll and payroll tax to the external third-party organisation. They will then delegate internally, within the payroll organisation. This operational delegation allows for the whole system to run smoothly, providing the same efficiencies that we see from delegated administration, but on the operational side.</p>
<p>The combination of strongly authenticated individual identity and highly assured organisation identity, with true delegation at all levels, is True B2B IAM from our perspective.</p>
 How does True B2B IAM fit the Current Global Movement? 
<p>Several global schemes and frameworks are recognising the LEI as the highly assured organisation identifier of choice. Both the World Trade Organisation and the ICC are pushing to enable paperless trade leveraging the LEI. The eIDAS 2.0 EU digital wallet scheme will enable citizens to use the LEI to express relationships to organisations. The Globally Assured Identity Network (GAIN) also recognises the LEI as the entity identifier within its framework to allow for a transitive relationship between global networks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The GLEIF has launched the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/vlei/">verifiable LEI (vLEI)</a> as both a verifiable credential and a governance framework. It has created an ISO standard which defines a jurisdiction-based legal role and enables the verifiable credential mechanism to express a relationship between; a highly assured individual, a highly assured organisation identity and the Official Organisation Role that bridges them together.</p>
 How Ubisecure enables True B2B IAM 
<p>As of March 2023, Ubisecure became the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/ubisecure-200000-organisation-identities/" title="largest issuer of LEIs worldwide">largest issuer of LEIs worldwide</a>, alongside our status as a leading identity and access management provider.</p>
<p>We have delivered True B2B IAM in a solution that supported over 400,000 organisations, and this is just the beginning. Our insights have shown that the combination of highly assured organisation identity and broad delegation can achieve savings of up to 99%. Meaning that transactions previously costing €30, can be reduced to €0.20 by deploying true B2B <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Katso-Case-Study.pdf" title="IAM">IAM</a>.</p>
<p>A broad range of use cases exist for this true B2B IAM. Watch the below video on how to authenticate an employee to a supplier, and then communicate the rights of that employee to represent his company. This simple use case shows how the RapidLEI platform and IAM services can digitise traditional, high cost administration.</p>
 
  
 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
<p>We know that organisational identity is fundamental to the delivery of true B2B IAM. If B2C involves identifying the Cs, then B2B must involve identifying the Bs. Over the next few years, we expect to see a push from the legislation and organisations that are working on it. And this must impact what we’re doing as identity professionals, and how we think about B2B IAM.</p>

  It is already known how centralized systems work: the majority must follow the rules and authority of the few in order to benefit from necessary tools, applications, and websites.  

Even more, centralized systems do not offer us the means or opportunity to voice our concerns and needs as members of the system.

DAOs, on the other hand, are shaped by the voices of its active members who work togeth

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Summary 
<p>Nowadays, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are becoming more and more popular due to the many benefits they offer. These include creating a safe environment for individuals to interact with one another. as well as equality and transparency among its members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the potential of DAOs, however, many struggle with a lack of user participation. Without active engagement from its members, decision-making and growth can be delayed, and the DAO's decentralized structure can decline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> is addressing this issue by developing an engagement system that aims to keep its members active and involved. By motivating participants to regularly engage within the DAO, the DAO itself will become more active and successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the SelfKey DAO engagement system, its benefits, and how members can participate in the DAO in order to mint tokens.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 The SelfKey DAO Incentive System 
 Introduction 
<p>The SelfKey DAO’s Incentive System is an innovation that offers a wide variety of benefits to its valued members. One of the main advantages of the SelfKey DAO Incentive System is that active members can mint tokens for their contributions and involvement within the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These tokens can be used to access various services within the SelfKey ecosystem, such as buying NFT packs to customize <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211">NFTs</a>, as well as buying SelfKey ENS domains.&nbsp;</p>
 How the SelfKey DAO Incentive System Works 
 A brief definition 
<p>The SelfKey DAO Incentive System is designed to facilitate users to mint work tokens for their active participation and positive behavior in the DAO. Participants who contribute valuable resources, such as time, skills, or suggestions, are recognized accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO offers numerous benefits to its users, including a secure and decentralized platform for managing digital identities. Even more, participants are incentivized to work together towards common goals. This builds a strong sense of community and collaboration within the DAO.</p>
 The SelfKey DAO Incentive System and Individuals 
<p>Tokens minted within the SelfKey DAO Incentive System represent a powerful tool for promoting growth and adoption of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DAO offers active members the possibility to mint tokens and have their contributions recognized. This helps the organization attract and retain high-quality talent and resources. In turn, it can enhance the quality and effectiveness of the services offered by the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, the SelfKey DAO Incentive System is a powerful asset for creating a strong, joint community of participants who are committed to the success of the DAO. The long-term goal of the DAO is to be able to build a space for innovation and creativity, while also driving growth and adoption of its services.</p>
 How to participate in the SelfKey DAO 
<p>To fully benefit from the platform's incentive system, users need to participate actively in the DAO's general governance and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are specific tasks which participants of a DAO can do in order to mint work tokens and help maintain the DAO.</p>
 How to keep the SelfKey DAO active and mint work tokens 
<p>Member engagement is a key necessity in order to benefit from an active platform. Aside from contributing to the overall well functioning of the SelfKey DAO, active members have the opportunity to mint work tokens by completing certain tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment, there are some essential activities that participants can perform to help SelfKey DAO in achieving its goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
 
 Invite Friends. 
 Post social media (SM) messages generated by the system. 
 Engage with the official Selfkey SM posts. 
 Be active in the official discord channel. 
 Stake on own credentials to increase security and reliability of the system. 
 Help with developer and designer tickets based on DAO grants. 
 Showing initiative and creativity in developing new ideas or solutions. 
 
 Invite Friends 
<p>Inviting friends to join SelfKey DAO can increase the membership and participation of the platform. This could offer more resources for the system, as friends could potentially bring in new skills and connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If more people join SelfKey DAO, the network security of the SelfKey ecosystem can grow. The benefit of this is that it can potentially result in greater visibility, influence, and impact within the larger community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, a constant flow of new participants to the DAO can be a valuable strategy for expanding and strengthening it. It can increase its resources and capabilities, and build a more powerful sense of community and collaboration among its members.</p>
 Post social media (SM) messages generated by the system 
<p>It’s highly important for members to actively post SM messages generated by the system in order to boost the visibility of SelfKey DAO and its activities. This way, participants can help expand the SelfKey network by bringing awareness to the platform and its goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using system-generated Social Media messages, SelfKey DAO can make sure that its content is consistent and on-brand. This can help create credibility and build trust among the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another benefit of SM messages generated by the system is that it can be more efficient than manually creating and posting each message. This can save time and resources, allowing members of the DAO to focus on other important activities.</p>
 Engage with official Selfkey SM posts 
<p>Engaging with official SelfKey SM posts could help members stay informed with the latest official news and connect with others participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It allows members to make informed decisions, increase their visibility, and potentially attract new business opportunities. Participants can also give constructive feedback, which can lead to platform upgrades that could benefit the entire community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, by engaging with official SelfKey SM posts, active members can gain access to exclusive content or benefits that are not available anywhere else.</p>
 Be active in the official Discord channel 
<p>The SelfKey Discord channel is a community hub where users can connect with other members of the SelfKey community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants who stay active in the channel can engage with other individuals, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. Even more, active members can quickly get answers to their questions and find solutions to almost any problems they may encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ft2U7DKg4X">official discord channel</a> is often the place where SelfKey DAO announces and hosts various events and activities. Therefore, keeping up with the channel and actively participating in discussions, members can stay up-to-date with important news and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Showing initiative and creativity in developing new ideas or solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By showing drive and creativity, active members can help develop new ideas and solutions that will help the DAO grow. This can be anything from suggesting new features for the DAO's platform to proposing fresh methods for community governance.</p>
 Stake on own credentials to increase security and reliability of the system 
<p>By certifying that members have a deep-rooted interest in keeping their own credentials safe, the overall security of the system can be enhanced. This can also minimize the risk of credentials being lost or stolen, as well as help keep participants safe from identity theft or other security breaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another advantage of staking is that it can increase the credibility of the system by motivating participants to make sure that their credentials are valid and up-to-date. This way, errors or mistakes in the data can be prevented, reducing delays or issues when using the platform.</p>
 Help with developer and designer tickets based on DAO grants 
<p>One of the key benefits of offering a grant within SelfKey DAO is that members can mint tokens for their contributions to building the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helping with developer and designer tickets can improve the overall quality of the platform. By addressing technical issues and making improvements to the design, the platform can become more user-friendly, efficient, and effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can aid in attracting new users and retaining existing ones, as well as drive the growth of the DAO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way that members can contribute to the DAO is by delivering on development, design, and QA bounties based on grants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These bounties encourage members to tackle specific tasks that have to do with the development, design, and testing of the DAO's software. Participants can work together or individually to deliver high-quality work that meets the needs of the DAO and its community.</p>
 The Benefits and Uses of Work Tokens 
<p>As stated previously, SelfKey DAO facilitates benefits for active members, such as being able to mint tokens. We’ve elaborated on the activities active members can perform. Now, let us focus more thoroughly on how participants can make use of the work tokens they mint.</p>
 Work tokens can be exchanged for NFT packs 
<p>SelfKey’s NFTs are called Normies, and they can be customizable to fit the user’s personal preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some advantages Normies bring to members:</p>
 
 they allow users to express their unique creativity and personality by creating one-of-a-kind digital assets.&nbsp; 
 they can increase the originality of the asset, as it becomes more exclusive and personalized.&nbsp; 
 they enable members to have greater control over their digital assets. 
 they allow members to modify or add additional content to their NFT. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT packs that members can obtain by exchanging work tokens can be used in several ways.</p>
 
 To customize Normies around a specific theme or concept, such as a particular genre or event, such as: fandoms, movies, games, music, etc. 
 To customize Normies by choosing the background, outfits, hair styles, skin color and texture, or additional details. 
 To create different levels of rarity among the NFTs contained within them. For example, a pack could contain one or more ultra-rare, limited-edition wearables. 
 To build a collection of related or complementary NFTs. This can motivate members to collect multiple packs in order to complete the entire set. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, SelfKey’s NFT packs can include unlockable content, such as additional media or exclusive access to events.</p>
 Work tokens can be used to participate in DAO Governance 
<p>DAO governance is ideal for members because:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Decisions are made through a decentralized voting system that takes every participant’s opinion into consideration. 
 It represents a more fair and open method of organization that aims to benefit every active member. 
 
 Conclusions 
<p>Centralized systems are based on pyramid structures, where the majority have to follow the rules and authority of the few. Typically, in this kind of structure, individuals have no way of voicing their needs, let alone have them met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs, on the other hand, can be shaped by the participants’ direct involvement. This is why it is important to keep DAOs active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO is working on developing the most efficient incentive system to make sure that active members are constantly involved with the development of the DAO. It’s likely to become the ideal space in which individuals can safely engage and have their needs heard and met.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>We hear it all the time: “Humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity”. Unfortunately, this contemptuous characterization of human nature is deeply ingrained in the industry. While human error is still the driving force behind a number of security breaches and incidents, the modern cybersecurity landscape has become too broad and sophisticated to be managed by individuals alone. By modernizing and implementing the right tools, however, we may be able to reduce and improve the impact of the human factor on cybersecurity.</p>
 The Alternative? Passwordless Authentication 
<p>Security could be dramatically enhanced by modernizing authentication systems and introducing new technologies. It is much easier to blame the end user for a security breach than to address the larger and more challenging issue of getting rid of legacy systems. Luckily, the continued momentum of passwordless authentication technologies is one of the key trends in the identity and access management (IAM) space.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, there has been a significant uptake in the adoption of passwordless authentication solutions in both enterprise and consumer use cases. Passwordless is becoming the new normal, and the use of passwords is becoming less and less relevant. For enterprises, this means a new opportunity to build new authentication architectures and leverage the potential of standards such as FIDO.</p>
 FIDO as a driving force 
<p>The non-profit organization FIDO ("Fast IDentity Online") Alliance was launched in 2013 to develop and promote authentication standards. As a result, the FIDO Alliance has introduced a set of open, scalable and interoperable specifications to reduce the reliance on passwords.FIDO2 is the latest specification released by the Alliance, offering a more flexible approach that supports a range of authentication factors, including biometrics, security keys and other devices. WebAuthn is a web standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that implements the FIDO2 specifications for web applications.</p>
<p>The role of FIDO2 and WebAuthn in passwordless authentication is to provide a secure, standardized, and user-friendly approach to authentication on the web that eliminates the reliance on passwords and improves user experience at the same time. FIDO2 and WebAuthn use public key cryptography and strong authentication to enable passwordless authentication while reducing the risk of password-related attacks, such as phishing and credential stuffing.</p>
<p>FIDO has also worked with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple to integrate and adopt FIDO standards across their operating systems. More recently, these companies have announced plans to support passkeys on their platforms. For example, Apple's latest update, iOS 16 for iPhones as well as macOS Ventura for Macs, now supports passkeys, while Google introduced support for passkeys in December 2022.</p>
 The adoption of passkeys 
<p>In a nutshell, a passkey is a type of authenticator that works by generating a unique cryptographic key pair. The private key is securely stored on the user's device (such as a USB key or mobile phone), while the public key is shared with the FIDO server. During authentication, the passkey generates a digital signature using the private key and sends it to the server along with the user's credentials. The server then verifies the signature using the public key, and if the signature is valid, the user is granted access.</p>
<p>The use of passkeys by these companies is likely to contribute to the widespread adoption of a passwordless future. As a consequence, the transition to phishing-resistant forms of authentication will continue to gain momentum. Companies need to evaluate the assurance level they seek for their relying applications and, if appropriate, leverage the benefits of passwordless technology. Nevertheless, by eliminating passwords and providing users with a more modern authentication system, organizations can strengthen security and lessen the impact of the human factor.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>The European Union (EU) has consistently demonstrated its innovative approach to technology and data protection through the implementation of groundbreaking laws such as the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679&amp;qid=1679610648554">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281">Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS) regulation</a>. These legal frameworks have set the bar high for data protection, privacy, and digital identity standards, establishing the EU as a global leader in these domains. As a result, many countries around the world have been inspired to follow suit, adopting similar regulations and best practices that align with the EU’s progressive stance on ensuring security, interoperability, and trust in the digital age.</p>
<p>This conversation with Viky started with a discussion around the history and evolution of eIDAS. One part of eIDAS is related to electronic identification and electronic identity, and the other is related to trust services, which include electronic signatures, timestamps, electronic seals, preservation of electronic signatures over a long period of time, and certificates for website authentication. As part of the legislative process, the European Commission conducted an assessment of the eIDAS regulation after several years of implementation to determine if any changes or adjustments were necessary. This assessment took place from the regulation’s inception in 2014 until 2020. During this period, it was observed that only 14 member states had notified electronic identification schemes in place, which means that only around 59% of citizens had access to an electronic identity mechanism. Out of these 14 electronic identity schemes, only seven were mobile. As a result, it became apparent that the regulation was not meeting the expectations and needs of citizens, who increasingly prefer to use mobile devices for accessing services and information.</p>
<p>We then shifted the conversation to talk about <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">The European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework</a> and how it’s going to be implemented in 4 pilot projects across various use cases. They are composed of representatives from different member states and the private sector. The mix of participants, including both member states and the private sector, was one of the main requirements.</p>
<p>The European Commission launched a call for applications and selected four winning consortia:</p>
 
 The first is the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EUDI Wallet Consortium (EWC)</a>, which focuses on mobile travel credentials and organizational digital identity. It covers all European Union countries, including Ukraine, and has participants from over 60 countries in both the public and private sectors. 
 Next is the <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID Consortium</a>, which is primarily focused on payment issuance and acceptance. 
 The third consortium is <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">Potential</a>, with various use cases such as electronic registration, account opening, electronic driving licences, and electronic prescriptions. 
 Lastly, the fourth consortium, <a href="https://dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU</a>, is focused on educational credentials and professional qualifications. 
 
<p>These consortia aim to cover the main use cases that could lead to the widespread adoption of the eID Wallet and the new European electronic identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Viky and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
 
 Understanding eIDAS 2.0: its history, lessons learned and implications. 
 How the current ecosystem of trust providers will change and adapt under new eIDAS 2.0 regulation. 
 The EUDI Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (ARF), and how it aligns with eIDAS. 
 Person Identification Data (PID) Providers, and the differences between Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers and Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers. 
 Exploring the 4 Large Scale Pilots, their use cases and their use of PID. 
 Some of the various associations collaborating alongside eIDAS and the large scale pilots (e.g., <a href="https://www.etsi.org/">ETSI</a>, <a href="https://cloudsignatureconsortium.org/">CSC</a>, <a href="https://inatba.org/">INATBA</a>). 
 Trust lists, trusted issuers/verifiers and governance! 
 Current and upcoming challenges and opportunities. 
 
<p>I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did. There is tons to learn for anyone interested in how a digital identity program start from a legal framework, and be coordinated across multiple nation states and actors.</p>
