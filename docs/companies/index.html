<p>Clearview AI is making another play for legitimacy. The <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-quietly-sells-face-recognition-tech-law-enforcement-agencies-012008/">embattled facial recognition specialist</a> has put together an Advisory Board to oversee the development of the company’s technology and business moving forward.</p>



  



<p>In its announcement, Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That reaffirmed the company’s commitment to government and law enforcement, and indicated that the board would help the company deliver solutions that appeal to those particular sectors. However, Ton-That was less forthcoming on the subjects of privacy and compliance. Clearview’s disregard for privacy has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/california-activists-sue-clearview-violating-local-facial-recognition-bans-031503/">repeatedly landed the company</a> in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/plaintiff-bipa-lawsuit-against-clearview-ai-wants-data-destroyed-041302/">legal hot water</a> in recent years, and the makeup of the Advisory Board suggests that the company is still <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nypd-gets-caught-lying-about-rampant-use-clearview-ai-041411/">prioritizing performance over ethics</a>.</p>



<p>In that regard, the members of the Advisory Board are drawn primarily from the law enforcement and government sectors. Members include former New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, and former National Security Council senior official Richard Clarke, who served during both Bush Presidencies and the Clinton administration.</p>



<p>Lee Wolosky, Thomas Feddo, and Owen West bring additional national security expertise. Like Clarke, Wolosky sat on the National Security Council, while Feddo recently served as the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury for Investment Security. West, meanwhile, worked under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as the Assistant Defense Secretary for Special Operations between 2017 and 2019.</p>



<p>The Advisory Board’s more civilian members are Rudy Washington, Floyd Abrams, and Sarah Schott. Schott is a long-time financial executive, while Washington was a Deputy Mayor in New York City and Abrams is a prominent free speech attorney.</p>



<p>Of those, Abrams’ appointment seems particularly noteworthy, since free speech has been a key component of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-claims-legal-injunction-would-violate-first-amendment-rights-081905/">Clearview’s legal defense</a>. The company has tried to argue that the first amendment gives the company the right to use (and profit from) any information that is available to the public, and that it has no legal obligation to seek consent when <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clearview-ai-facing-even-more-investigations-over-biometric-data-scraping-071001/">using personal photos</a>. Privacy authorities in Canada have <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/commissioner-rules-rcmps-clearview-contract-violated-canadian-privacy-law-061104/">disagreed with that line of thought</a>, though it is not yet clear how the argument will play out in the United States.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bio-key.com/">BIO-key</a> is making a splash in the payments pace with the release of a new mobile Point-of-Sale (POS) terminal. The BIO-key MobilePOS Pro is a handheld rugged device that runs on the Android platform, and authenticates users with the help of a built-in fingerprint scanner and a biometric camera.</p>



  



<p>The capacitive fingerprint scanner boasts FBI certification, while the 5 MP camera supports BIO-key’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-keys-palmpositive-solution-gets-technology-innovation-award-071604/">award-winning</a> PalmPositive authentication solution. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-upgrades-portalguard-with-new-palm-authentication-feature-051003/">PalmPositive</a> verifies someone’s identity when they hold their hand in front of the camera, and therefore provides users with a fully contactless authentication option.</p>



<p>The MobilePOS Pro comes with a thermal printer, a magnetic stripe reader, and NFC and barcode scanners in addition to the biometric readers. The dual SIM device supports 4G and WiFi connectivity, and can be controlled with the help of a 5.5-inch touchscreen. All of that hardware has been fully integrated into a single (and self-contained) POS device.</p>



<p>BIO-key has indicated that it is willing to pre-load applications onto the MobilePOS terminal for customers who place volume orders. The device is available either with or without BIO-key’s own <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-extends-portalguard-coverage-with-new-sso-concierge-062306/">PortalGuard</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-upgrades-platforms-501181/">WEB-key</a> identity management solutions. That hardware itself is capable of mobile enrollment, authentication, and payment processing, all of which are backed up with liveness detection to prevent fraudulent transactions.</p>



<p>“We know that providing a full and complete biometric-ready product line is essential to supporting our customers who engage in mobile POS transactions,” said BIO-key Chairman and CEO Michael DePasquale. “We see the new model of roving engagement for banking, healthcare, social work and payments as ideal applications for adding the certainty and ease of BIO-key Identity Bound Biometrics and Mobile POS Pro.”</p>



<p>BIO-key has already shipped MobilePOS units to its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-adds-kenya-based-distribution-partner-to-cap-network-704071/">customers in Africa</a>. The terminal is available for purchase in other parts of the world, and indicates that BIO-key remains committed to hardware despite the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-reports-223-yoy-revenue-increase-in-q2-update-708172/">recent success of its cloud-based PortalGuard solution</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://safr.com/">SAFR from RealNetworks</a> is hoping to make inroads in the Japanese market after entering into a reseller arrangement with <a href="https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/">NTT Docomo</a>. The latter is the largest mobile carrier in Japan, and will be offering SAFR’s facial recognition technology to organizations that are looking for ways to upgrade their access control and security postures.</p>



  



<p>The partnership builds on the existing relationship between the two companies. SAFR and NTT Docomo have previously worked together to install face-based access control tech at a hospital and a commercial facility, and in a standalone robot. Their partnership will address access control and watchlist surveillance use cases, as well as other edge computer vision applications. For example, SAFR’s facial recognition technology could be used for consumer analysis in the retail sector, or to enable biometric authentication for those making online payments.</p>



<p>NTT Docomo cited SAFR’s smaller computational footprint as a key factor in its partnership decision. The smaller size makes it easier to integrate SAFR’s tech into edge devices, and reduces latency and improves performance for those using the tech across 5G networks. The SAFR platform offers <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/safr-improves-passive-liveness-capabilities-with-updated-facial-recognition-system-040805/">passive liveness detection</a> to guard against fraud, and can track and analyze demographic traits like age and gender without storing the personal information of the people being observed. It can also gauge people’s emotional reactions to various materials.</p>



<p>“This agreement will accelerate the security and access control digital transformation for enterprise customers utilizing Docomo’s high-speed, low-latency 5G network with a low-bias AI computer vision platform,” said SAFR APAC VP Noriaki Takamura.</p>



<p>SAFR has already formed similar partnerships with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/convergint-offers-safr-us-customers-052101/">Convergint Technologies</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/safr-provides-biometric-facial-recognition-setelsa-security-120205/">Setelsa Security</a>. The former is marketing SAFR’s technology to customers in the United States, while the latter is focusing primarily on Europe and Latin America. NTT Docomo, meanwhile, has been working to expand its 5G network in <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/ntt-docomo-makes-nec-official-5g-core-network-vendor-110502/">collaboration with NEC</a>.</p>

<p>Behavioral biometrics company BioCatch has announced that it has been named to an annual list of the fastest growing companies in the United States.</p>



  



<p>Its inclusion in the Inc. 5000 rankings is the latest recognition of BioCatch as one of the fastest growing private companies in the U.S. In June of 2021, the company <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/kuppingercole-names-biocatch-overall-leader-fight-against-fraud-062204/">celebrated being named</a> as an Overall Leader in the 2021 KuppingerCole Leadership Compass for Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms report, while also being recognized for its Innovation and Product leadership in that same report.</p>



<p>“We are honored to be recognized as one of the Inc. 5000.” said Howard Edelstein, BioCatch Chairman and CEO. “With financial institutions facing increasing levels of cybercrime and fraud, our role in providing innovative behavioral biometric technology to combat fraud and protect digital identity is more important than ever. By innovating closely with our clients, BioCatch’s forward-thinking team develops new behavior-based solutions that leverage the best technology available to protect clients and consumers from increasingly sophisticated fraud and cyberattacks.”</p>



<p>This latest honor comes amid what has been a strong year for the company, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic placing a spotlight on the importance of digital security. A dramatic increase in online traffic caused by the various lockdowns and remote work initiatives aimed at curbing the spread of the virus has led to a proportionate increase in cybercrime.</p>



<p>During this time, BioCatch has repeatedly espoused the benefits <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biocatch-pushes-behavioral-biometrics-mobile-banking-channels-012804/">of behavioral biometrics</a> in securing online activities, while also making an effort to educate the public on the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biocatch-explains-how-spot-fraudsters-before-they-commit-crime-041907/">increasingly sophisticated methods</a> of fraudsters.</p>



<p>BioCatch is the only representative of the behavioral biometrics market that was named to the Inc. 5000 list, and it ranks in the top third of all security providers that are listed.</p>

<p></p>
<p>My name is Jose Navalon, I currently live with my wife and my son in Geldrop, a little town in the Netherlands. I was born and raised in Valencia, a sunny city on the east coast of Spain. I graduated as an engineer (ing/MSc) from the Polytechnical University of Valencia.</p>
<p>During my professional career, I have developed software solutions for both big companies and startups. Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, cooking, reading books and of course spending time with my family and friends.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After I finished a big project for my previous company, I was looking for a permanent remote position and I got an offer from Tokeny. After interviewing with some team members, I was impressed by the work being done in Tokeny. Tokeny is up to speed with the latest technologies and always works with the leading technologies of the moment. Also, Tokeny’s product vision on blockchain is sure to be a success. So it was clear for me to join Tokeny 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>All people are really skilled and it is a pleasure working with them. Tokeny gives us full freedom at work, in my case I’m working remotely not only due to the Covid. The honesty and transparency of each member of the team makes you really integrated in the company.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I like traveling a lot with my family and friends. Knowing new places, new cultures, new food, other ways of life…</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I have many, but the most important one is “Mankind beats the Corona”, of course we can make it, be optimistic! xD</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Too many things to be changed 😀 but for example I’d love to see all people, not only nations, working together to solve global problems such as poverty, child education, global warming, ….</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the fourth interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/Trung_cave">Duy</a>, administrator of <a href="https://t.me/OntologyVietNamese">Ontology Vietnam</a> and <a href="https://t.me/WingDAOVietnamese">Wing DAO&nbsp;Vietnam</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I first learned about Ontology in March, 2018. At that time, I followed the newly listed coins on Binance and realized Ontology is a high-performance blockchain with the goal of building a decentralized trust ecosystem. It’s revolutionary technology allows businesses to use blockchain technology without having to be experts in the technology themselves. I was really impressed with the&nbsp;project.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>Realizing the potential of Ontology; a project that I believe will thrive in the future. Community is also one of the factors contributing to the success of the project. So, I decided to become one of the supporters of Ontology.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>A Harbinger’s role is to share information about the project, improve community understanding of the project, and remove language barriers. I feel happy when I can help communicate and share information with the community.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>I strive to contribute my efforts to the sustainable development of Ontology.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Ontology’s community is multilingual, with over 30 different languages. Not many other blockchain projects have such a large community. With a community as diverse as Ontology’s, the project’s information can be spread across the globe. In this way, Ontology will be known by more and more&nbsp;people.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>I typically use Telegram. Currently, I am the administrator of <a href="https://t.me/OntologyVietNamese">Ontology Vietnam</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/WingDAOVietnamese">Wing DAO Vietnam</a>. I also opened a Facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OntologyVietNam">Ontology Vietnam</a>, because Vietnamese people use Facebook more than other social networks. At the same time, I also have a personal <a href="https://twitter.com/Trung_cave">Twitter account</a> to interact with Ontology.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I have learned many skills and absorbed lots of knowledge and experiences from managers and other Harbingers. My advice to Harbingers is to try, try to learn, learn more information about products, ecosystems, and technologies related to Ontology. Do your best to help and interact with the community and you will become an excellent Harbinger.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Advanced, Sophisticated, Sustainable.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>To expand and develop the community further in the future, I think building a good team of Harbingers is also one of the factors. And in the future, I hope Ontology’s products such as websites, documents, ONTO, etc., can be available in more languages. In addition, actively interact, absorb and respond to the community more.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Ontology’s big milestone for me was the MainNet launch event. Over the years, Ontology has continuously evolved and updated its decentralized identity and data vision and decentralized identity framework, ONT ID. With the rapid development of the Internet today, data has become a valuable resource that requires secure methods of storage. The cryptocurrency market has been developing strongly in recent years, but it is also a new industry with lots of potential, as well as challenges and limitations. Ontology is no exception. They have a lot ahead of them. Hopefully the community will always support Ontology in the future, helping Ontology grow stronger and stronger.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the fifth interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

<p>What is the great theory of change for Ethereum and the blockchain industry which will galvanize, inspire, and ultimately save&nbsp;us?</p>“Forest, Poland” by Rogge, Britta licensed under CC BY 2.0 | Ethereum logo: <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">https://ethereum.org/en/</a><p>This 3-part series presents a guiding narrative and vision for the blockchain industry fit for the current and oncoming conditions of the&nbsp;world.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-1-wicked-problems-a186c4860bc3">Wicked Problems</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-2-world-models-theories-of-change-cd8aecfd53de">World Models &amp; Theories of&nbsp;Change</a>  Building an Economy with a&nbsp;Future  <p>Let’s get to&nbsp;work.</p> What should Ethereum’s theory of change&nbsp;be? <p>To be worth a damn in the grand scheme of things Ethereum has to meaningfully contribute to controlling climate change. And maybe other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk">existential risks</a> like&nbsp;AI.</p><p>We have far too many smart people working together to be shooting for smaller goals than this. We want our work to <a href="https://noahraford.com/wp/2014/08/04/silicon-howl/">matter</a> and nothing smaller than this counts because if we fail on the existential risk stuff it is not going to matter how much volume went through our decentralized exchanges or what our NFT collection was&nbsp;worth.</p><p>The World Computer should be used to do some computation which reduces our chance of extinction or breaking the ecosystem.</p><p>Preferably the world computer should be part of a global effort to reduce the earth’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_the_Study_of_Existential_Risk">existential</a> risk to zero. It’s a long road to get there. Can we do an ICO for long range sky scanning to stop asteroids hitting earth? I don’t&nbsp;know.</p><p>But what I do know is that the World Computer is well positioned to be used to do computation which directly cuts our existential risks by crushing climate&nbsp;change.</p> Carbon Footprint Calculations <p>Right here, right now: what is your carbon footprint?</p><p>Your answer, I guarantee, is “I don’t&nbsp;know.”</p><p>You can get an approximation from a <a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">carbon footprint calculator</a>, but it’s just an approximation. The well-meaning among us buy these offsets once a year to cover at least some of our damage. But until these systems are precise they cannot be automated. Imprecision means there is always a manual&nbsp;step!</p><p>When we know exactly what our footprint is, we can easily say “buy offsets for my footprint.” But when it is all approximate there is always a sense that we are making a decision to accept the imprecision, to roll the dice on the estimate. You have to look and think “does that seem about right?” and the whole system grinds to a halt on that decision.</p><p>Having to calculate our own CO2 footprint and accepting that the result is just a guess produces enough friction in the process that very few people in practice do CO2 offsetting. Even relatively well off green activists don’t do it, even though the cost is typically a hundred dollars a year or&nbsp;less.</p><p>Automated, we might all offset our emissions. It might even become mandatory, the cost of staying alive, the most basic act of personal self-responsibility. Because we have systems like zk-SNARKs on top of ERC20s, we could imagine a future with a mandatory CO2 tax. In that potential future everybody has to offset 100% of their CO2 consumption. But their privacy is protected. The system knows how much CO2 they have to offset, but without ever revealing the lifestyle choices which led to generation of that CO2 footprint.</p><p>We could get more privacy and a safer&nbsp;world.</p><p>That seems like a fitting job for a World Computer: to run the global carbon accounting system which makes sure that trillions of dollars a year are spent planting trees and rewilding or grinding up olivine mountains to make sure that the earth does not dry out, burn up, and blow&nbsp;away.</p><p>So let’s put that right into the Ethereum Theory of Change right now. The world computer will run the global carbon accounting system. That’s our ambition. That is one way we’re going to change the&nbsp;world.</p> Reducing waste in the global economy to&nbsp;zero <p>Another grand challenge is global resource overconsumption. It is easiest to see when we think of <a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/deforestation-facts-and-statistics">deforestation</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/stories/deforestation-facts-and-statistics">Deforestation Facts and Statistics</a></p><p>We are simply using too much wood and land. The forests are getting cut down for other purposes.</p><p>But a third of the food grown is <a href="https://earth.org/facts-about-food-waste/">wasted</a>. If we could not waste that food there would be more than enough land for the forests to be left in peace. Rewilding at scale requires food efficiency.</p><p>The food chain has an enormous number of links. There are tens of thousands of significant actors. Gigantic companies and tiny farms. Huge franchises and one-cook restaurants. It all combines to make the food system. There is simply no way to get a system in place to manage all of this on any database technology other than the World Computer. Every corporation involved will want to keep its private data in a silo. They will want to hide evidence of their own waste, particularly in areas where waste equals profit. To keep people honest, we need to get an overview of how the food is produced, where it is stored, and how it is consumed. Over time we can tighten up the waste in that system and enormously reduce the pressure we place on the land. We need to break open the silos to understand the performance of the system as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>The World Computer. Nothing else is going to do this. Yes, it envisages a World Computer with nearly infinite computing power but that is coming. Computers continue to get faster every year. The underlying algorithms that power Ethereum get more refined every year. L2 solutions which bind to quantum supercompuers can’t be that far away. This thing can actually&nbsp;work.</p><p>And of course it’s not just food. Empty houses in countries filled with homeless people. Systemic structural inefficiencies exist in every supply chain. The world is both cold, starving and homeless at one end, and packed with empty five bedroom houses and untouched boxes of cold pizza at the other. I am not suggesting that we pack the homeless into those five bedroom houses. Rather I am suggesting that if everybody moves up a little we make plenty of room for everybody. Efficient markets should provide for everybody.</p><p>But the efficient market cannot be efficient enough on the existing technical, social and legal infrastructure. The world computer opens up the possibility of genuinely efficient markets in truly dramatic&nbsp;ways.</p> Circular Economy <p>Every manufactured thing in the world eventually winds up in landfills or as scrap, with a few exceptions. Some of the scrap is recycled and turned into new products, but some of it just sits and rots until it <a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/viewers-horrified-over-viral-video-of-thick-black-smoke-100415035.html">catches&nbsp;fire</a>.</p><p><a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/viewers-horrified-over-viral-video-of-thick-black-smoke-100415035.html">Sinister story behind thick black smoke seen from space</a></p><p>In almost no case is the true cost of disposing of things calculated. So much recycling just winds up as landfill or dumped in some poor <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-12/fast-fashion-turning-parts-ghana-into-toxic-landfill/100358702">country</a>&nbsp;too.</p><p>Similarly, when an old camera or an old phone breaks and cannot be repaired because it was designed not to be fixable, both its owner and the world get a little poorer. The global capital base is depleted every time a poorly designed thing breaks and enters the waste stream. All these individual leaks seem small but together they constitute a flood of wasted life. The time and energy of the person who made the thing are wasted when it breaks. Then we must count the cost of a replacement. What of all the natural resources burned to make a thing? All of that is lost when a thing breaks in a way that cannot be repaired. Almost every single one of my old phones and laptops could have been resold to somebody else if it had been designed to be <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/most-repairable-apple-products">repairable</a>.</p><p>In a world this resource constrained we cannot afford that kind of&nbsp;waste.</p><p>Imagine that all manufactured goods have digital twins on the blockchain. As the assets change hands and experience wear and tear every repair is logged. Soon we can see what is repairable and resellable, what can be patched and mended, and what is just dead-loss scrap. If every single thing we buy has a unique ID and a permanent place to store its records, things will change. Manufactured goods cannot fail to improve in every way when exposed to the harsh light of transparency. Nobody wants to buy junk. A property rights transfer is as simple as having a neutral third party check that the item matches the blockchain record of the object, and an NFT is transferred to move the legal ownership.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> has built this. Gold <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/ntfa">bullion</a>, <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">art</a> and <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/third-millennia-collection-1">collectibles</a> to start, but pretty soon we will present prototypes for real estate transactions and consumer goods. I believe this is the unstoppable adoption-driving blockchain use case everybody has been searching for: a better way to buy physical things than anything Web2 has offered. <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/engineering-consumption-ac3bd74b1a21">Read more about this approach to managing our environmental footprint in the Mattereum Manifesto.</a></p>The Investment, Consumption, Production, Waste&nbsp;cycle. Mattereum embodies this theory of&nbsp;change <p>My company Mattereum deeply reflects this theory of change: we are (in the long run) a carbon accounting and radical resource efficiency company. I built the company to implement a theory of change I believed in: the World Computer cleans up the global economy. Computation on the global computer allows us to slash our carbon footprints.</p><p>Mattereum also <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/07/07/mattereum-sells-350000-year-old-hand-axe-a-dali-and-tibetan-buddhist-statue-as-real-world-asset-nfts/">sells</a> half a million year old stone hand axes as NFTs. We believe that art and antiquities, luxuries and collectibles, are excellent initial markets for Mattereum. While the world wakes up to the carbon challenge, we still need to develop the technology. There are many excellent here-and-now use for a system which binds objects to multi-faceted statements of truth about the objects. Very soon, blockchain scaling solutions will enable Mattereum to add trade in clothing, laptops, and eventually all manufactured objects. Real estate is an amazing use case too, and we expect prototyping in late Q4&nbsp;2021.</p><p><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">Here are some of the first physical artworks we are selling on&nbsp;OpenSea.</a></p><p>There’s also a lovely collection of <a href="https://ntfa.io/">Never Touch Fiat Again</a> gold bars here. NFT art combined with gold bullion: you can literally take physical delivery of the gold bars! Built in partnership with <a href="https://lohkowallet.com/">Lohko&nbsp;Wallet</a>.</p><p><a href="https://opensea.io/accounts/NTFA">NTFA's account | OpenSea</a></p><p>The way this system works is that for each individual NFT, such as this digital art piece backed by physical gold&nbsp;—</p><p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014300224093421569">https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/47824387705324153400210554042155132922682187088261737780213014300224093421569</a></p><p>— there is a <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/">Mattereum Asset Passport</a> which gives a legally binding set of promises about the gold bar associated with the&nbsp;NFT.</p><p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/ntfa.20210319.100.alpha.001.150768/">Mattereum Asset Passport: Valcambi Suisse Gold Bar - 100g - Vector 777</a></p><p>You can check where the gold bar is vaulted and how it is insured. Pretty soon the Mattereum + <a href="http://unn.finance">Union</a> partnership will produce a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/mattereum-union-risk-protection-for-the-digital-physical-economy-628371e4cf8a">DeFi-based protection system for buyers</a>. This is a perfect example of the modular and composable nature of services in the Ethereum defi ecosystem: <a href="https://lohkowallet.com">Lohko</a> handles the gold, NTFA handle the art, Mattereum handles the proofs and provenance, UNN provides additional risk handling, and an as-yet-unnamed lender will soon be lending money against these gold bullion&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Of course, we would not be doing this if there were not some more fundamental purpose: every gold bar sold in this system has CO2 offsets purchased from <a href="https://nori.com/">Nori</a>, offsetting not only the CO2 burned by Ethereum mining on the NFTs, but also the CO2 emitted by the original mining of the gold&nbsp;itself.</p><p>We started with gold in vaults because it is one of the highest value and best controlled global supply chains: a good fit for management by NFTs and smart contracts. Fine art is a close second, although it is much harder to prove art fraud than gold fraud. High end liquor is another great area, because so much of the product is stored in high security warehouses. As we get more of these key assets into the system, it will become clear to more people how totally revolutionary this application of the World Computer really&nbsp;is.</p> What is Ethereum’s Theory of&nbsp;Change? <p>Ethereum’s theory of change is comprised of the theories of change of every person working with Ethereum.</p><p>I feel like I’ve made a good case for the potential to use Ethereum tokenization of CO2 and offsets, and as an instrument for the eradication of waste in areas like consumer electronics.</p><p>What are the other areas we could use Ethereum to transform?</p><p>For example, is DeFi the key to accelerating solar and wind energy installations? Funding vaccine research? Could we get that deep sky scan done? Fund space missions?</p><p>What is your vision of Ethereum’s theory of change? What are the elements of global transformation that you feel the World Computer genuinely enables?</p><p>I mean the stuff that matters. Save the world with the World Computer.</p> An economy with a&nbsp;future <p>Things change in fundamental ways <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State">when they have names</a> (or other unique identifiers). ISBN numbers empower libraries. ISIN numbers enable the global financial architecture to function. Namespaces rule everything.</p><p>An Ethereum contract address can map on to any underlying data structure you like. If you use IPFS the immutable data it connects to can be of arbitrary size. A single namespace for all objects and assets is possible. You just need the data structures to represent what is vital about the&nbsp;object.</p><p>Just imagine that for a moment. An Ethereum address attached to every physical thing, and every asset, you own. Orthogonal legal operators for sale, rental, escrow, use as collateral on a loan, or fractionalization and equity release. Those legal operators are based on Ricardian contracts, so they look like legal contracts to a court. But to a smart contract, they look like another smart contract: a digital/legal bridge that creates property rights. Mattereum calls this the Smart Property Register. For anything you own. And everything that everybody else owns&nbsp;too.</p><p>Everything carbon calculated, and fully offset. There would be trillions of dollars a year of offsets going into planting forests and restoring wetlands and everything else. It might be ten years before we have built a blockchain that can handle that kind of data load, but I guarantee you, it is&nbsp;coming.</p><p>In that world a huge number of humanity’s fundamental problems just evaporate.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/evangineer">Mamading Ceesay</a> coined the term “Economies of Omniscience” to describe the total economic transformation that such a world will bring. No more delays, no more things that don’t fit in the back of the truck so there have to be two runs. A computer figures that stuff out, because it has the data to figure it out. If a thing was made using CADCAM then the original digital models ought to be available on chain. Read the barcode or scan the NFC, download the CAD files, pass it to a piece of software which knows how to pack stuff in trucks: “yes it will all fit” and it does. These are the “economies of agility” which are enabled by actually being able to use computers to work with the material world properly. Better still, since the discovery of zkSNARKs and other zero knowledge methods, we can create “blind omniscience” where the coordination systems run perfectly but without any actor being able to see more than their part of the system. In short, the advantages of central planning, without a central planner. A privacy preserving panopticon. Technology now enables us to scale this paradoxical tower.</p><p>Now imagine this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gntV6AePOM">operational</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spime">paradigm</a> applied across everything: when you fly, you borrow everything you need when you land. It’s all waiting for you at the airport. When you move house anything which it is cheaper to sell and rebuy on the other end is waiting for you when you arrive. When you need tools for a job they come from your neighbours. It all starts with being able to identify physical property, clearly record its condition, and bind it to legal frameworks that enable it to transact.</p><p>Then we apply this to the industrial economy: no more shortfalls or warehouses of feedstocks which won’t be used for months. All the advantages of Just In Time, but coupled to the capability to buy and sell components directly to other companies, or your suppliers. Immediate configuration of capability by pre-designing systems using computers, and then provisioning the purchasing for all the necessary items using smart contracts. Option everything you need to buy, then when you have options on everything and you know it will all work if everybody does their jobs, execute the options. It’s a revolution like Just-In-Time manufacturing, but across all organizations rather than simply down a single supply chain: a Just-In-Time industrial web.</p><p>Then property can be fully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_utilization_theory">utilized</a> at all times, and we can create years of economic growth just from increases in fundamental process efficiency without increasing our ecological footprint at all! We are rearranging physical things and their legal property using software. We do this to optimise their utility and their disposition. Optimization and simulation pave the way to globally efficient logistical solutions.</p><p>We can use the World Computer to teach matter to dance. And a dancing world might be able to feed all of us because perfect coordination frees up vast resources.</p><p>It is a moral imperative that the Ethereum community starts to get serious about climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>My work with Mattereum is a culmination of decades spent thinking on how to manage scarce resources on the planet such that people’s basic necessities of living are secured, even in the worst of situations.</p><p>I’ve distilled some core insights on the technological and social transformation of material culture in a little book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1629340329&amp;sr=8-1">The Future of Stuff</a>, in which I explore how things came to be and how we can build a better path forward where humanity can live in equilibrium with the&nbsp;planet.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1629340329&amp;sr=8-1">The Future of Stuff</a></p><p>If long-reads aren’t your preferred media, our company podcast extends this discussion to other builders and thinkers who are shaping material culture across a range of industries.</p><p><a href="https://podcast.mattereum.com/">The Future of Stuff</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World?

Each one encompasses a <a href="https://knowhow.ncvo.org.uk/how-to/how-to-build-a-theory-of-change">theory of&nbsp;change</a>.</p>  The problem is governments. Bitcoin will destroy governments.  Solar panels, wind farms, batteries and so on will get so cheap we will entirely stop using coal, oil and gas, and the planet will&nbsp;heal.  We can grind up mountains made of <a href="https://www.projectvesta.org/science#Introduction">olivine</a> into new beaches, which will soak up CO2 faster than humans are pumping it out, at a fairly affordable cost.  The problem is <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/The_Invisibles_Vol_1_3">cities</a>. If people would just go back to human-scaled settlements with deeper personal interconnectedness, we would stop over-consuming physical things to meet our unmet emotional needs. Society needs&nbsp;therapy.  The problem is giant squid from beyond time have invaded the human group mind and are making us drive ourselves to extinction by pretending to be our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJdJEEZvhsA">gods</a>. The magician-artist Alan Moore figured it out and killed them during the process of producing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6eJkZJ1opo">Watchmen</a>, and freed from their awful influence humans will make better decisions. The world is slowly&nbsp;healing.  The planet is <a href="https://www.sapiens.org/culture/gaia-hypothesis-covid-19/">conscious</a> and will defend itself from human overpopulation by sending a&nbsp;plague.  The problem is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism">capitalism</a>. We can reorganize global society along eco-socialist lines and there will be enough for everybody’s needs, but nobody’s&nbsp;greed.  The problem is trauma. Widespread use of MDMA-assisted <a href="https://maps.org/research/mdma">psychotherapy</a> will create saner humans on average, and these saner humans will start living&nbsp;right.  The Pentagon’s <a href="https://astronomy.com/news/2021/07/pentagon-ufo-report-no-confirmed-aliens-but-the-government-wants-to-learn-more">UFO</a> reports make it very clear that our understanding of the laws of physics as we understand them are incomplete. Either the beings operating these devices, or our physicists who learn from observing them, will use these newly discovered laws of physics to save&nbsp;us.  <p>Now clearly nobody could believe in all of these possible futures at the same time. You’d be mad. Not only do they contradict each other,&nbsp;they..</p>  Contradict the laws of&nbsp;physics  Contradict all possible models of history and human&nbsp;nature  Contradict… in fact there are an almost infinite list of things that other people’s models of the future can contradict.  <p>But apart from the one idea I put on that list to test people, intelligent people can hold and argue any one of those&nbsp;beliefs.</p><p>Can you pick which one is the stupid&nbsp;one?</p> World Models <p>In fact, what models of the future we take seriously are tightly tied to two things. These two implicit pieces of mental furniture are profoundly important in understanding why we as humans find it so difficult to agree on how to save each-others’ lives, which is what the world demands of us&nbsp;now.</p><p>The first piece of mental furniture is our world model: what we believe to be the facts of the situation. No human mind can contain the entire global situation. Our world model is inevitably partial and incomplete. It takes us time to ingest information. Our lifespans are not infinitely long. The sheer volume of a field like chemical engineering could take 12 lifespans to master. Or&nbsp;120.</p><p>So the world model system in our minds contains some sub-functions:</p>  A curiosity metric for estimating what information is worth fitting into our world model — what do we choose to learn&nbsp;about?  An existing set of facts that we consider to be true — the world model&nbsp;itself  A mechanism for discarding facts which are no longer thought to be true: the deletion&nbsp;rules  A model of who’s facts we will trust, which forms a trust&nbsp;graph  A detail filter which throws away things like precisely which elements go into making solar panels, now that the Indium Crisis is not thought to be a factor in production  A social harmonizer which tries to make sure that our world model is close enough to that of our tribe (including family, close friends, employers, or even the voting public) to keep our world model from becoming a survival liability  <p>It’s clear in the era of covid misinformation that even relatively small points of scientific knowledge (“are vaccines safe?” “do cloth masks work?” “do FFP3 masks <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1663">work</a>?”) result in dramatically different management of this deadly disease — and even the fact that covid is deadly is hotly debated in some&nbsp;circles.</p><p>It is unsurprising that in an age of infinite information choices, it has become extremely rare to meet two educated people who believe the same things about the world. Our world models have become distant from each other and fractured, because the curiosity metric is empowered by Google to find out anything.</p><p>Even if we stay in the domain of solid academic publications, where you focus results in completely different models of the&nbsp;future.</p> Theories of&nbsp;Change <p>The second piece of mental furniture is our theory of change. Not everybody has a theory of change. Many people share a few basic (and wrong) theories of change based on&nbsp;history.</p><p>Typical working folk are not consciously trying to change the world, for the most part. They’re trying to provide for their kids, their parents, and their own old age. This can turn into “who dies with the most toys wins” but for the most part people are spending on schools and elder-care. The yachts are few, but the prep schools are&nbsp;many.</p><p>The big formulaic theories of change, mostly rooted in historical analysis, are given names like Marxism or Socialism or Capitalism. Each one of these political movements, and all the others like them, contain a historical analysis and a proposed set of actions. In other words, a world model and then a theory of change that operates on that world&nbsp;model.</p><p>However, as people are increasingly self-educating on the internet our world models have become increasingly diverse and disassociated. It becomes harder and harder to synchronize world models with the people around us to participate in collective action. If our general world models do not match up, it is even less likely that our theories of change will match. Another way of saying this: if we cannot agree on the past and the present, it is unlikely we will agree on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoAyizBrk0M&amp;t=22s">future</a>.</p><p>Ethereum does not have a particularly strong theory of change. It starts as a direct evolution of bitcoin: “bitcoin <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html">plus</a> smart contracts.” A simple sense of “this is the next step” technologically is enough to get that started. Afterwards the lack of political consensus between the early founders of the Ethereum project resulted in a sort of forced Swiss neutrality. The exchange of fire about whether Ethereum should be a corporation left enough political fallout that the question of where Ethereum was on the political landscape has gone generally unanswered. <a href="http://radicalmarkets.com/">Radical Markets</a> is probably the political brand most closely associated with Ethereum. But even that has taken a back seat to the rainbow unicorns and various animal-themed token projects. We have here a technology without an ideology.</p><p>Unfortunately the world is still on&nbsp;fire.</p> Proposing an explicit theory of change for&nbsp;Ethereum  Should Ethereum even have a theory of&nbsp;change? <p>Is it possible for the Ethereum community to share a theory of change, given how culturally diverse the community is? The DeFi people and the NFT people, for example, barely&nbsp;touch.</p><p>You could frame this as “the internet does not have a theory of change, so why should Ethereum?” But actually the internet does have a theory of change: “a little bit of everything, all of the&nbsp;time.”</p><p>Omniversal access to information! The internet superhighway. Freedom to&nbsp;know!</p><p>However you frame it, this is the internet’s theory of change — individuals using the internet all embrace this model, at least a little bit, by virtue of their actions. It may be implicit, but that theory of change is universal: somehow, hollering at strangers on the other side of the world using social media will fix things.&nbsp;Somehow.</p><p>So at the very least there are a handful of universals in the Ethereum theory of change, the implicit factors. The basic structures in the world model&nbsp;include:</p>  Not your keys, not your&nbsp;crypto  Anyone can create a smart&nbsp;contract  Radical inclusion through open access to infrastructure  Anonymity and pseudonyms are absolutely recommended  Ethereum runs everywhere in the&nbsp;world  <p>Usually the whole theory of change is summarized as “decentralization”. There’s an idea of tearing down monopolies and dispensing with middle men, kind of freeing up markets to Do The Right Thing freed from exploitation because perfect competition gets rid of rentiers.</p><p>And that’s about as close to a theory of change — a coherent story about how we are going to save the world — as Ethereum gets these&nbsp;days.</p><p>I am very clear that “decentralization” needs a lot of unpacking and context to be a valid way of looking at what the blockchain does. Permissionless also needs serious unpacking in a situation where (for example) exchanges decide which tokens to list. A lot of sketchy projects slip by because we do not get down to the details of who actually makes the decision. Decentralized can often mean oligarchical because one token means one vote, for example. Permissionless usually fares a little better, but then how do people know who to trust or who is being scammed by who? It is not like we have universally adopted Ethereum-wide public key infrastructure and identity infrastructure for projects.</p><p>Also note how much this theory of change shares with bitcoin’s theories of change. Now that EIP 1559 has firmly placed Ethereum on the deflationary path there is no doubt that a lot of the bitcoin-style reasoning about Ether as money will start to converge.</p><p>So in this sense, many of the parts of this theory of change do not belong uniquely to Ethereum. The basic structures of this world model are heavily overlapped with cryptocurrency in general, rather than applying specifically to smart contracts or the whole world computer&nbsp;context.</p><p>Something as revolutionary as Ethereum should have a more clearly articulated theory of change, I think — and not one, but several! Ethereum’s theories of change may be plural, but we would be making a lot more impact if they were clear and explicit: how are we going to help save the&nbsp;world?</p> Who am I to propose&nbsp;this? <p>I came into the Ethereum project in 2014. I decided to quit my job in military academia because it was impossible to change the world from that position in the ways that I wanted to. I wanted to retool the world’s militaries for climate change operations through civilian-military cooperation on disaster relief. It was a dead&nbsp;end.</p><p>Then I heard a story about a team working on a bitcoin-like smart contract system, and recognized that it was going to change the world. I chose to dedicate my life to making it&nbsp;work.</p><p>I was already well experienced with digital currency, having been a full send user of e-gold in the late 1990s. I knew my way around ERIGHTS and ESPEAK, capability based operating systems and all the rest: I had, after all, been a crypto activist in the 1990s when crypto meant “encrypted communications” not “digital currencies.” My background in distributed systems went back into the 1980s (!). I had a choice between the Ethereum technical track in Berlin, or the Ethereum Communications track in London and I chose to stay put rather than move. Comms needed help, and I’d done quite a bit of work for charities doing communications. I wound up as <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">the release coordinator for the Ethereum launch</a>. Critically, I was managing community expectations about what would be released and when. It’s all ancient history now but for a while I was one of the public faces of the entire&nbsp;project!</p><p><a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">The Ethereum Launch Process</a></p><p>I’m telling you this now so you understand that I was deeply grounded in the Ethereum project, but in no way foundational to it. I’m often confused as being one of the original Gang of 8, but I was something like employee&nbsp;30.</p><p>The Gupta World Model<br>A word about <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-2-world-models-theories-of-change-cd8aecfd53de">my world model</a>, since world models are what we’re talking about. I’d spent most of my time since 9/11 working on climate change, poverty, natural disaster, and plagues in the think tank world, military academia, and charities. It had been an extremely hardcore 12 years, and I was burned out, bitter, and filled with experience of bureaucracy, corruption in power hierarchies, and the disastrous nature of governance and government. It was, in short,&nbsp;bleak.</p><p>So I viewed Ethereum as a chance to hang up my “end of the world” hat. I got to work with the direct challenges of getting the world the smart contract platform it so desperately needed. I was part of a fabulously talented team of legends. It was a big turn in my&nbsp;life.</p><p>One of the phrases I’d picked up during my time in military academia was “unity of action without unity of command.” I picked it up from Lin Wells (famous for the Wells Memo on <a href="https://library.rumsfeld.com/doclib/sp/2382/2001-04-12%20To%20George%20W%20Bush%20et%20al%20re%20Predicting%20the%20Future.pdf">predicting the future</a> among other things.) This was, to me, the goal of Ethereum: to coordinate the world so we could increase efficiency, reduce waste, and take care of all of humanity’s concerns more effectively.</p><p>Some people heard “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs">World Computer</a>” as “a computer that spans the world” but I heard world computer as “a computer that heals the world.” I had a very clear sense of what I wanted from this thing: I wanted a system which could out-perform current models of capitalism (intensely wasteful and wrongfully productive) without requiring political turmoil to adopt. I wanted an evolution in the culture and the machinery of the market, to produce a world with carbon accounting and an end to world hunger because crops no longer rotted in the&nbsp;fields.</p><p>I had not worked out the details, but that’s where I thought the project was&nbsp;going.</p><p>Where do we go from&nbsp;here?</p><p>Part 3:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World?

The certainty of death has always been a part of humanity’s shared heritage. But now things are different: forests are on fire all over the world. Canada’s boiling, Siberia is melting. Every few weeks some new horror: now the Amazon is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/14/amazon-rainforest-now-emitting-more-co2-than-it-absorbs">emitting</a> more CO2 from burning than it soaks up from growing. The serious ecologists are all <a href="https://eos.org/features/the-emotional-toll-of-climate-change-on-science-professionals">completely traumatized</a>, watching the whole thing unfold. It is clear that things are just <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/09/world/global-climate-change-report-un-ipcc/index.html">trashed</a> and it’s getting worse year on&nbsp;year.</p><p>Also we are being profoundly ineffective on the solutions side. The solar panel conversion is fast. But it’s a quarter as fast as it would be if we redirected defense budgets to the actual threats we face, rather than being scared of other humans. We have worse problems than other humans now. Or, rather, the dangerous thing that other humans do now is not invade our countries and steal our stuff. Other humans are now dangerous to us simply by existing. They eat food. They drink water. They grow crops. They work in factories.</p><p>Their collective impact is killing the world. Our collective impact is killing the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The system accounts for money down to the penny. The system can tell you the protein grams and calorific content of every piece of food in the store. But the system will not tell you how much your new car speeds up the death of the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The system lies by omission. It measures what is good for the money people, but only when the world was made of empires and exploitable natural resources. Now we have to measure different things for even the money people to&nbsp;survive.</p><p>The system is rigged. The system is unable or unwilling to change fast enough to leave us with a working&nbsp;world.</p><p>And I mean us. Even at 50, I’m going to be fully impacted by the whirlwind we are mid-way through unleashing. By the time I’m <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/global-warming-limit-of-1-5-c-may-be-breached-by-2040-says-new-ipcc-report-78355">70</a> or 80 the entire world will be fully reaping what we have&nbsp;sown.</p> The rise of bitcoin&nbsp;mining <p>I’ve been with the bitcoin story since the beginning — since the prehistory of crypto currency, in fact. Unlike most of the people in the space I have never owned or held a significant amount of bitcoin: a series of defense jobs made me uncomfortable with the idea of having poorly-understood cryptographic software running on my laptop. I also have some religious prohibitions about speculative finance and zero-sum economic activities like gambling. I’m not going to explain those right now, but it is sufficient to say that I am not crypto rich, and am a fairly neutral observer: I am not talking up my own book right&nbsp;now.</p><p>People completely forget the first iteration of bitcoin. In 2010, bitcoin was mined on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rise-of-asics-bitcoin-mining-history">laptops</a>.</p><p>Mined. On.&nbsp;Laptops.</p><p>It was essentially a basic income scheme for laptop owners. A person could download the bitcoin mining software and run it on their machine at night and have a few bitcoin in the morning. As more people did it, the mining reward was spread thinner and thinner. Bitcoin was, at that point, libertarian socialist (which is to say Anarchist) if it had any politics at all. Very broad participation in economic production was possible, and the rewards were distributed evenly.</p><p>There was no particular return to capital because people were mining on laptops they had already owned. Nobody was buying hardware to run bitcoin&nbsp;on.</p><p>This was a radically different period in history. Nothing worked the same way that it does now. I remember railing against the arrival of ASIC mining, because as far as I was concerned, it ended the revolutionary potential of&nbsp;bitcoin.</p><p>I was wrong, but not in the way you&nbsp;think.</p><p>In the early phases of bitcoin, the workers owned the means of <a href="https://tedcurran.net/2013/04/own-the-means-of-production-what-karl-marx-knew-about-opportunity-in-the-digital-economy/">production</a>.</p><p>After ASIC <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rise-of-asics-bitcoin-mining-history">mining</a> was invented there was a role for capital in the bitcoin ecosystem. Commissioning production of ASICs is extremely expensive. It takes a ton of up front investment.</p><p>The reward is to be able to mine bitcoin cheaper than anybody else&nbsp;can.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rise-of-asics-bitcoin-mining-history">The Rise of Specialized Mining Equipment on Bitcoin - CoinDesk</a></p><p>Once that role for capital was established, bitcoin went from being libertarian socialist with workers entirely owning the means of production (because they owned their own laptops) to something else. Bitcoin became anarchocapitalist. The line between libertarian socialism and anarchocapitalism has always been&nbsp;thin.</p><p>Gupta’s Libertarian Observation <a href="https://www.appropedia.org/User:Vinay_Gupta#Gupta's_Libertarian_Observation">states</a>:</p><p>Free people create free markets. Free markets do not necessarily create free&nbsp;people.</p><p>Because there is no doubt that if people have political freedom they will engage in trade. But if that trade creates a situation in which workers do not own the means of production — that is to say, the profit created from labour is returned to capital and not to labour — then markets move from being an expression of liberated circumstances to being just another instrument of oppression.</p><p>For people who have a hard time grasping this: there is a difference between a road and a toll&nbsp;road.</p> How is bitcoin going to save the&nbsp;world? <p>Since bitcoin was invented there have been several distinct stories about how bitcoin is going to change the&nbsp;world:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/top-10-bitcoin-maximalist-tweets-of-all-time-8857bc28767c">Maximalism</a>/Hyperbitcoinization<br>Bitcoin will change the world by overtaking the dollar and bankrupting the world’s governments by making it impossible to tax the citizenry. As this became less probable a new narrative emerged…  Banking the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/yayafanusie/2021/01/01/stop-saying-you-want-to-bank-the-unbanked/">Unbanked</a><br>Bitcoin will change the world by banking the unbanked, and bringing sophisticated financial infrastructure to the entire world. People in developing world countries will be able to trade globally. Facilities like microfinance will be administered largely by machines making it economically efficient to deploy capital in villages and farms all around the planet. But this turned out to be hard, nearly intractable. Progress was slow and even the remittance market largely refused to convert to a bitcoin-by-default configuration.  Store of <a href="https://builtin.com/finance/crypto-wont-replace-gold">Value</a><br>Bitcoin will change the world by transforming the centralized financial institutions like pension funds and ETFs into bitcoin holders, providing a “store of value” which cannot be inflated out by governments. Bitcoin is in some sense “digital real estate” in that, like land, there is only so much to go around and if you own it, you own it. Note that this theory of change is confined to bitcoin holders: it’s not a dream of global transformation in the way the first two stories were. Bitcoin has begun to mainstream, but at the cost of its world-transforming values.  Maximalism 2.0<br>There is a potential future phase of the Bitcoin story, which is the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/inflation-rampant-buy-bitcoin">inflation</a> hedge story. Right now inflation is pretty low, or being passed off as a very temporary situation. If this changes and the US economy sees sustained inflation and people watch their savings shrink year on year then things will become extremely dramatic and not in a good way. The “store of value” argument will go from being relatively esoteric to being a mainstream lived experience for an enormous number of people, and bitcoin will be back at phase one all over again: a threat to the primacy of government in the currency&nbsp;market.  <p>Now pause for a moment&nbsp;here.</p><p>Climate change is trashing the planet. Bitcoin is hugely CO2 intensive to produce. It has no environmental value system built into it. It creates no environmental benefit by existing. There are some <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-bitcoin-may-actually-speed-up-the-transition-to-renewable-energy-2021-05-18">weak arguments</a> about how bitcoin mining is accelerating the transition to renewables in some way. But at the end of the day, electricity is being consumed, and those renewable resources could be powering anything. It’s just shilling.</p><p>I believe that crypto is an integral part of the human future: I think it’s the necessary backbone for fixing a lot of the world’s problems.</p><p>But not like this. Not like&nbsp;this.</p><p>Bitcoin inside of the existing narrative is probably a very, very good thing for bitcoin holders in the event of inflation inside of America. But even if those people thrive the world still&nbsp;burns.</p> The economy without a&nbsp;future <p>The correct value of many of our most “valuable” financial assets is&nbsp;zero.</p><p>Ski towns in places with no snow. Island fortresses in hurricane belts. Almond orchards in areas with no water to feed the crops. Real estate in flood plains. All of the oil and coal in the ground. All of&nbsp;it.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranded_asset#Climate-related_asset_stranding">Stranded asset - Wikipedia</a></p><p>It’s worth nothing because in the future it will be illegal, uneconomic (carbon taxes) or both. The people who hold those assets currently hold nothing but that’s not what they report to their shareholders. The size of this financial catastrophe cannot be overstated. But it is a direct result of mismanagement by fund managers and boards who chose to ignore climate change. They have wound up as “bag holders” with portfolios stuffed with worthless coal, oil and gas “assets.”</p><p>They’d have done better to buy bitcoin. At least bitcoin might be worth something in&nbsp;future.</p><p>Even with scenarios like geoengineering most of these assets remain completely worthless: we are not going to wind up in a world where we geoengineer the entire climate and then continue burning oil and coal like nothing ever happened. At the very least the costs of the geoengineering will be passed directly on to the coal, oil and gas producers.</p><p>Have I mentioned the continuing catastrophic subsidization governments are doing of their own fossil fuel industries, while making vague noises about unenforceable climate targets? That’s a topic for another&nbsp;essay.</p><p>But if we take out all the assets which are wiped out in a fully scale climate change scenario there is basically nothing left of the current economy: the oil companies are gone, coal, natural gas wiped out. Entire industries like almonds. Fishing. You can just go down the list: gone, gone, gone, wiped out, worthless, gone. Other industries rocket into existence: solar, wind, renewables, batteries, energy efficient construction, you name it. An entire universe goes, and a different one is&nbsp;created.</p><p>But the pension funds, the behemoths of the financial landscape, are gigantically underwater to climate change. That’s another way of saying the old people who are relying on those pension funds to provide them money to live on further into their old age are not going to get paid. The money they saved their entire lives was pumped into worthless assets in nearly every future scenario. By the time they are old enough to pull the money out of the pension fund, the pension fund is worth 20% of what it was worth because the economy that it invested in is&nbsp;gone.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.vox.com/22291568/climate-change-carbon-footprint-greta-thunberg-un-emissions-gap-report">lifestyle</a> you have ordered is out of&nbsp;stock.</p>Banksy ‘Out of Stock’ — <a href="https://streetartlondon.co.uk/blog/2011/12/banksy-out-stock/">Street Art&nbsp;London</a><p>Part Two:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-2-world-models-theories-of-change-cd8aecfd53de">Can the World Computer Save the World?

<p><a href="https://www.idealinnovations.com/">Ideal Innovations, Inc</a>. (I-3) is hoping to boost its international prospects after receiving a new patent from the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). The patent was formally issued on July 20, and concerns a new International Biometric Identification System (IBIS) that enables secure biometric authentication while still preserving people’s privacy across state lines.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, the IBIS is geared toward large organizations that have customers and employees in multiple jurisdictions. The system does not send any biometric information across international borders. Instead, the system authenticates each user locally, and sends confirmation of that event back to head office to provide a high level of identity assurance without forcing people to disclose unnecessary personal information.</p>



<p>I-3 designed the IBIS to make it easier for organizations to comply with the different privacy laws they will encounter in different parts of the world. Since the actual biometric data is never transmitted, they can ensure that their <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/regulatory-change-opens-door-selfie-id-germany-idnow-74202104/">data collection practices are compliant with local laws</a>, knowing that there is no risk of accidentally violating another country’s laws when the organization needs to verify someone’s identity in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/canadian-privacy-commissioner-calls-stronger-facial-recognition-regulations-051401/">another part of the world</a>.</p>



<p>According to I-3, the IBIS is intended to replace outdated forms of authentication like uniforms and ID cards, both of which can be compromised. The new system allows organizations to realize the benefits of biometric authentication while prioritizing privacy.</p>



<p>“IBIS is a significant step forward with regard to the use of biometrics internationally, in that it provides for identification verification of subjects from different countries without sharing of biometric information between those countries,” said I-3 CEO&nbsp;Bob Kocher.&nbsp;“We imagine applications where partner nations, working in international assistance, humanitarian, and even <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/archive/ideal-innovations-awarded-58-9-million-by-dhss-office-of-biometric-identity-management-to-assist-the-biometric-support-center/">military operations domains</a>, can rapidly and securely vet individuals from other countries biometrically, without compromising that individual’s personal information.”</p>



<p>I-3 was recently <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ideal-innovations-gets-accredited-administer-facial-identification-proficiency-test-022402/">accredited to conduct proficiency tests</a> for those using facial recognition technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aware.com/">Aware</a> is highlighting the utility of its Knomi platform for organizations that are trying to reopen in the wake of COVID-19. The company stressed that Knomi is a contactless biometrics platform, which means that there is less risk of contagion for people using the system.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, Aware contrasted Knomi with a more traditional access control or check-in system, which would force multiple users to interact with a shared touchscreen or kiosks. Knomi, on the other hand, registers and identifies users with face or voice recognition. Those technologies take less time than a manual entry form, which reduces congestion at points of entry and makes it easier to enforce social distancing requirements.</p>



<p>Knomi itself can <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-announces-update-for-on-device-version-of-knomi/">function on a mobile device</a>, or be deployed as a server- or browser-based solution. Aware advocated for its use in a number of different sectors, including <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-makes-case-face-based-visitor-management-systems-060301/">office buildings</a> and public-facing businesses like restaurants and arenas. In the case of the former, the technology can help with access control, insofar as it can use facial recognition to identify registered employees when they arrive at work. By the same token, the system can onboard new users quickly, making it a convenient option for large-scale guest and visitor management.</p>



<p>The Knomi platform offers <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-biometric-solution-attains-ibeta-pad-level-1-compliance-102606/">passive liveness detection</a> to guard against spoofing, and can <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/awares-knomi-platform-can-now-recognize-voice-biometrics-905201/">identify users with voice recognition</a>. Aware has argued that the solution has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-explains-why-vaccine-passports-should-be-backed-with-biometrics-033003/">additional applications in transportation</a>, where it can speed up processing procedures at international borders.</p>



<p>“The demand for touchless authentication solutions has never been higher, and we’re proud to have a trusted solution in Knomi that meets this demand immediately,” said aware President and CEO Bob Eckel. “Knomi’s face and voice authentication solution replaces fraud-prone passwords. It is also an ideal solution for touchless workflows, providing our customers and users with some much-needed peace of mind after COVID.”</p>



<p>Knomi was recognized with an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-garners-cybersecurity-excellence-award-knomi-biometric-solution-021806/">IT Cybersecurity Excellence Award</a> back in February. The technology has since been integrated into <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/imprivata-epcs-self-enrollment-solution-features-aware-knomi-tech-706071/">Imprivata’s electronic prescription system</a>.</p>

<p>The auditory AI start-up <a href="https://www.raisonance.com/">RAIsonance</a> has unveiled a new sound-based biometric authentication solution. The SoundPass offering is geared toward access control, and is intended to make it safe to return to public spaces in the wake of COVID-19.</p>



  



<p>SoundPass is comparable to voice recognition in the sense that it uses sound prompts to create a secure biometric signature. The difference is that that signature is based on a forced cough rather than the spoken word. To use it, people will simply be asked to cough, just as they would when they are at the doctor’s office. If that cough matches sounds that the user has produced in the past, they will be authenticated. If not, they may be denied access to a physical venue.</p>



<p>While the choice of a cough may seem strange, it does have the added advantage of serving as a basic diagnostic tool. A forced cough will have a particular timbre when a person is healthy. However, that can change when a person is sick, or has been exposed to potential hazards. As a result, a cough can serve as an early warning system, and potentially make indoor spaces safer if those who are sick cannot enter and expose other people to an infection.</p>



<p>SoundPass itself is being released as a collection of three apps. The Personal version is free to use, while the Plus version is available for $25 per person annually, and will generate a new QR code every single time that user coughs to verify their identity. That QR code can then be scanned with the Access app to provide proof of identity at different points of entry.</p>



<p>RAIsonance was founded in 2020 in direct response to COVID-19, with financial backing from the National Science Foundation. The company believes that its solution will be popular in the security and healthcare sectors, and indicated that it is working on a separate software-as-a-medical device tool to help diagnose various respiratory ailments. That product is also slated for release before the end of 2021.</p>



<p>SoundPass is not the first <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fda-approves-tiger-techs-wearable-covid-19-detection-system-033006/">diagnostic tool</a> to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fitbit-wins-army-contract-to-trial-covid-detecting-biometric-wearables-911032/">emerge during the pandemic</a>, though many of the other solutions have used <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/lifeq-releases-new-version-covid-detection-app-general-public-060702/">wearable devices to track people’s symptoms</a>. The RAIsonance offering has much lower equipment requirements, and could prove to be popular with organizations looking for a more affordable health screening solution.</p>

<p>It is with great pleasure that today I am officially announcing that Chris Hart has joined the Civic Board of Directors and has succeeded me as Civic’s CEO. On behalf of the board, I would like to congratulate Chris on this appointment and thank him for his contributions since 2017 as our COO!</p>



<p>Chris is deeply committed to our mission. He has an exceptional understanding of the ecosystem’s technology, and a compelling strategic vision for the company. I am confident that Civic will continue to reach new heights under his leadership. Chris’ background and track record as Civic’s long-serving COO make him particularly well qualified to assume the mantle of CEO, and I have every confidence that he is the right person to lead Civic into the future.</p>



<p>As part of this change I will become the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors at Civic. In this new role, I will continue to be active at a Board and strategic level within the company, and look forward to contributing to Civic’s future successes. Jonathan Smith, our co-founder and CTO, will continue in his current role, and is more excited than ever about Civic’s next phase.</p>



<p>Over the past six years, Civic has become a leader in identity-based solutions for the fast-emerging blockchain compliance and identity space. Civic is in a great place, and my role change is timely given the many positive developments this year. This timing also coincides with the appointment of <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/new-board-member-maja-vujinovic/">Maja Vujinovic to the board</a>, which was done largely to support the company and advance our strategy.</p>



<p>Last summer, in light of the crippling impact of high ETH gas fees on Civic Wallet, we made a strategic decision to move our company to an ecosystem that can support a high volume B2B model. This was one of the primary reasons why we were one of the first crypto companies to be <a href="https://www.civic.com/blog/civic-announces-integration-with-solana-blockchain/">integrated with Solana</a>. As the company shifts to scale sales and ramp up growth in this category, we will be well served by Chris Hart’s strong marketplace, mobile and crypto background.</p>



<p>Most importantly, in my final message as CEO I want to thank all of you, from our community to our team and our investors, for your tireless contributions to Civic’s success over the past many years. I know that in Chris and Jonathan’s able hands, our amazing culture will produce identity services that will support the viability of the digital asset ecosystem and make the world a better place. As Executive Chairman, I will remain heavily involved with Civic but from a different vantage point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m looking forward to the many new milestones ahead for Civic. My conviction and excitement for Civic has never been stronger. Congratulations again to our new CEO, Chris Hart!</p>

<p>Popular cruise line Royal Caribbean is celebrating the groundbreaking of a new cruise terminal in Galveston, Texas, that will encompass 150,000 square feet of space and feature biometric technology aimed at making check-in faster and safer for vacationers. </p>



  



<p>The new facility — which is formally known as “Terminal 3” — has actually been under construction for nearly two months now, though the official groundbreaking ceremony was recently held to coincide with Royal Caribbean launching its first ship from Galveston in more than 18 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>The $110 million terminal will be outfitted with biometric authentication by way of facial recognition, as well as mobile check-in capabilities as a way of expediting the movement of travelers.</p>



<p>Further details regarding which specific biometric authentication system will be used are unavailable at this time,  but it’s possible that it could resemble U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-brings-biometric-simplified-arrival-system-miami-112403/">Simplified Arrival program</a>. Simplified Arrival uses facial recognition to identify travelers arriving to the United States by scanning their faces at the primary inspection point and comparing the image captured and the biometric data contained within to the image on the individual’s passport, visa, or other official government document.</p>



<p>Royal Caribbean’s new facility, Simplified Arrival, and other similar programs around the world that feature contactless biometrics to improve the safety and flow of travelers have been <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sita-report-creates-roadmap-future-air-travel-072203/">growing in popularity</a> over the past several months due in part to the challenges the travel industry has faced as a result of the pandemic.</p>



<p>Currently, the expected completion date for Terminal 3 is November of 2022. </p>

<p><a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> is strengthening its presence in the Benelux (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg) region. To that end, the company has signed another partnership and is opening up a new office in Amsterdam to provide better support for its existing customers.</p>



  



<p>The partner in question is <a href="https://www.lynkco.com/en/">Lynk &amp; Co</a>, a smart mobility specialist that offers service to consumers on a membership basis. Onfido will be outfitting the company with its flagship onboarding solution, which uses document recognition to verify the authenticity of a photo ID, and facial recognition to match that ID to its proper owner. The deal builds on Onfido’s recent success in the Benelux area, where the company’s year-over-year sales are up 216 percent.</p>



<p>In that regard, Lynk &amp; Co joins a Benelux client roster that already includes <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/events/future-of-fraud-management-for-businesses/">LeasePlan Bank</a> and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-onfido-expands-identity-verification-partnership-bunq-121204/">challenger bank bunq</a>. Onfido indicated that its new Amsterdam office will act as a regional headquarters, and help meet the growing demand for digital identity services in Benelux and on the European continent more generally. It will also help combat identity fraud, which has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-finds-more-amateur-activity-2020-identity-fraud-report-120808/">increased during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.</p>



<p>“Benelux is a growing hotbed of international fintech activity that requires robust identity verification for KYC,” said Onfido CEO Mike Tuchen. “This has been an area of growth for Onfido and we’re committed to providing the best possible service to our existing customers, as well as growing our business in the region.”</p>



<p>“By automating KYC processes with identity verification, businesses are protected against sophisticated fraud and benefit from an improved onboarding process for their customers,” added Michael Van Gestel, Onfido’s Global Head of Fraud and GM for the Netherlands.</p>



<p>Onfido itself has enjoyed <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-breaks-revenue-record-again-in-q2-update-707273/">record growth</a> during the pandemic. Lynk &amp; Co, meanwhile, has released an SUV coupe that uses a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/goodix-provides-fingerprint-authentication-system-lynk-co-connected-car-031906/">built-in fingerprint sensor from Goodix</a> to authenticate its drivers.</p>

 What Is Identity Authentication 

<p>Identity Authentication verifies a user’s identity by specific means. We obtain detailed user metadata from the Identity Provider (IdP) to determine whether a user has access to particular resources.</p>

 Identity Authentication Modes 

<p>There are two main categories of identity authentication: traditional mode and centralized mode.</p>

 Traditional Authentication Mode 

<p>In the traditional authentication mode, each application service needs to support authentication separately, such as accessing the login interface when the user is not logged in. The interface returns a <code>301</code> jump page. All application services need to develop the logic to maintain the session and interact with the identity provider for authentication.</p>

<p>You can see the flow of traditional authentication in the figure below.</p>

<p>First, the user initiates a request, then the gateway receives the request and forwards it to the corresponding application services, and finally, the application services interact with the identity provider to complete the authorization.</p>

<p></p>

 Centralized Identity Authentication Mode 

<p>Unlike traditional authentication, the centralized identity mode removes user authentication from the application services. Take Apache APISIX as an example; you can see the centralized identity authentication process in the figure below.</p>

<p>First, the user initiates a request, then the gateway itself takes charge of the user authentication process, interacting with the identity provider and sending them an authorization request. The identity provider returns user identity information (user info). After the gateway identifies the user, it forwards the user identity information (user info) to the services in a request header.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Compared with the traditional authentication mode, centralized identity mode has the following advantages:</p>

 
   Centralized auth simplifies the application development process, and reduces the development application workload and maintenance costs by avoiding the need to repeat the development of authentication code for each application. 
   Centralized authentication mode improves business security. At the gateway level, it can intercept unauthenticated requests in time to protect back-end applications. 
 

 What Is OpenID Connect 

<p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a centralized identity authentication mode. The benefit of using OpenID Connect is that users only need to register and log in with one OpenID Connect identity provider’s website and use one account’s password information to access different applications. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> is a common OpenID Connect identity provider, and the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect plugin supports OpenID.  As a result, the plugin can replace traditional authentication mode with centralized identity authentication.  In this case, we’re using Okta.</p>

 OpenID Authentication Process 

<p></p>

 
   APISIX initiates an authentication request to the Identity Provider. 
   The user logs in and authenticates on the Identity Provider. 
   The Identity Provider returns to APISIX with the Authorization Code. 
   APISIX requests the Identity Provider with the Code extracted from the request parameters. 
   The Identity Provider sends an answer message to APISIX with the ID Token and Access Token. 
   APISIX sends the Access Token to the Identity Provider’s User Endpoint for authentication. 
   After passing the authentication, the User Endpoint sends the User Info to APISIX to complete  authentication. 
 

 How to Configure Okta Authentication Using the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Configuring Okta authentication using the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect plugin is a three-step process that allows you to switch from traditional authentication to centralized identity authentication mode. The following sections describe the steps to configure Okta authentication using the OpenID Connect plugin for Apache APISIX.</p>

 Prerequisites 

<p>Have an <a>Okta account</a> ready for use.</p>

 Step 1: Configuring Okta 

 
   
    <p>Log in to your Okta account and click Create App Integration to create an Okta application.</p>

</code>   

 Step 4: Access Apache APISIX 

 
   
    <p>Visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:9080/get</code> and the page is redirected to the Okta login page because the OpenID Connect plugin is enabled.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   Enter the username and password for the user’s Okta account and click Sign In to log in to your Okta account. 
   After successful login, you can access the get page in httpbin.org. The <code>httpbin.org/get</code> page will return the requested data with <code>X-Access-Token</code>, <code>X-Id-Token</code>, and <code>X-Userinfo</code> as follows. 
 

   <code>  "X-Access-Token": "******Y0RPcXRtc0FtWWVuX2JQaFo1ZVBvSlBNdlFHejN1dXY5elV3IiwiYWxnIjoiUlMyNTYifQ.***TVER3QUlPbWZYSVRzWHRxRWh2QUtQMWRzVDVGZHZnZzAiLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL3FxdGVzdG1hbi5va3RhLmNvbSIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vcXF0ZXN0bWFuLm9rdGEuY29tIiwic3ViIjoiMjgzMDE4Nzk5QHFxLmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTYyODEyNjIyNSwiZXhwIjoxNjI4MTI5ODI1LCJjaWQiOiIwb2ExMWc4ZDg3TzBGQ0dYZzY5NiIsInVpZCI6IjAwdWEwNWVjZEZmV0tMS3VvNjk1Iiwic2NwIjpbIm9wZW5pZCIsInByb2Zpb***.****iBshIcJhy8QNvzAFD0fV4gh7OAdTXFMu5k0hk0JeIU6Tfg_Mh-josfap38nxRN5hSWAvWSk8VNxokWTf1qlaRbypJrKI4ntadl1PrvG-HgUSFD0JpyqSQcv10TzVeSgBfOVD-czprG2Azhck-SvcjCNDV-qc3P9KoPQz0SRFX0wuAHWUbj1FRBq79YnoJfjkJKUHz3uu7qpTK89mxco8iyuIwB8fAxPMoXjIuU6-6Bw8kfZ4S2FFg3GeFtN-vE9bE5vFbP-JFQuwFLZNgqI0XO2S7l7Moa4mWm51r2fmV7p7rdpoNXYNerXOeZIYysQwe2_L****",

</code>   

<p>X-Access-Token: Apache APISIX puts the access token obtained from the user provider into the <code>X-Access-Token</code> request header, optionally via the <code>access_token_in_authorization_header</code> in the plugin configuration Authorization request header.</p>

<p>X-Id-Token: Apache APISIX will get the Id token from the user provider through the base64 encoding into the <code>X-Id-Token</code> request header, you can choose whether to enable this function through the <code>set_id_token_header</code> in the plugin configuration, the default is enabled.</p>

<p></p>

<p>X-Userinfo: Apache APISIX will get the user information from the user provider and put it into <code>X-Userinfo</code> after encoding it with Base64, you can choose whether to enable this feature through <code>set_userinfo_header</code> in the plugin configuration, it is set to be on by default.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you can see, Apache APISIX will carry the <code>X-Access-Token</code>, <code>X-Id-Token</code>, and <code>X-Userinfo</code> request headers to the upstream. The upstream can parse these headers to get the user ID information and user metadata.</p>

<p>We have shown the process of building centralized identity authentication from Okta directly into the Apache APISIX Gateway. It is easy to sign up for a free Okta Developer Account to get started. Our approach reduces developer overhead and enables a safe and streamlined experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bio-key.com/">BIO-key</a> has achieved staggering year-over-year revenues increases, thanks in part to its acquisition of the PortalGuard Single-Sign On solution, suggest figures from the company’s latest quarterly update.</p>



<p>Revenues were up 223 percent year-over-year, jumping from about $307k in the second quarter of 2020 to $992k in the latest quarter. In a statement, the company attributed much of the increase to license fee revenues, noting that such revenues from its PortalGuard acquisition, which closed on June 30 of 2020, were not in included in the results from a year ago. COVID-19 disruptions had also depressed revenues in that period.</p>



<p>BIO-key’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-completes-acquisition-of-pistolstar-107022/">acquisition of PortalGuard</a>, via its purchase of the solution’s maker, PistolStar, marked a significant strategic shift for the company. Whereas BIO-key had previously focused primarily on fingerprint-based authentication solutions, PortalGuard brought an extensive non-biometric authentication platform into its portfolio, and promptly delivered a number of new contracts for BIO-key.</p>



<p>BIO-key announced <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-announces-official-launch-portalguard-idaas-113008/">a cloud-based version of the platform</a>, dubbed “PortalGuard Identity-as-a-Service”, in late November of 2020, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-adds-new-passwordless-authentication-features-portalguard-idaas-platform-020301/">added new passwordless authentication features</a> to the platform earlier this year.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, BIO-key has remained focused on biometric solutions as well. Earlier this year, the company launched a palm-scanning app called BIO-key MobileAuth with PalmPositive, as part of the PortalGuard IDaaS platform. And in a statement announcing BIO-key’s latest results, CEO Michael DePasquale indicated that the company plans to ad support for facial recognition and voice recognition to its MobileAuth solution in the future.</p>



<p>Other important business developments for BIO-key include the continuing expansion of its Channel Alliance Partner program, which saw over 40 new members in the first half of this year; and its biometric ID projects in Africa. Commenting on the latter, DePasquale explained that activities have been delayed due to the impact of COVID-19, but that his firm anticipates “a reacceleration of activity” in the remainder of the year.</p>



<p>BIO-key’s bottom line for the latest quarter was a net loss of $1.2 million – a significant improvement over its net loss of $1.6 million in Q2 of 2020. Looking ahead, the company says it’s on track with respect to its full-year revenue guidance of $8 million to $12 million, with DePasquale noting that the company could “potentially achieve profitability,” depending on customer order activity and other variables.</p>

Where we are with the infrastructure/crypto bill Photo: European Central&nbsp;Bank<p>The reality is that the U.S. government is going to want more control and oversight over the $2 trillion and rising crypto economy. That includes DeFi and NFTs and everything else blockchain. That’s inevitable.</p><p>It should be a good thing, though. It’s validation that crypto is important. Like the legalization of marijuana, it’s also an opportunity for new tax revenues. For investors and developers and entrepreneurs, having regulatory clarity protects their efforts and&nbsp;money.</p><p>Of course, things might get a little messy along the way. Such is the case with really new things that break the rules we thought we understood.</p><p>So where are we with the infrastructure bill and its crypto tax provision, reporting requirements, and overly broad definition of the term “broker?”</p><p>As we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-172-crypto-allies-fail-to-amend-infrastructure-bill-2f4d81e73e55">discussed last week</a>, a compromise amendment was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/senate-compromise-infrastructure-bill">rejected by a lone senator at the final&nbsp;hour</a>.</p><p>Now the bill will go to the House, where the battle&nbsp;resumes.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-13/treasury-seeks-to-quell-fears-crypto-tax-rules-are-overly-broad?sref=3REHEaVI">Bloomberg reports</a> that the U.S. Treasury will release guidance on the new provision:</p><blockquote>The U.S. Treasury Department is set to clarify that only cryptocurrency companies it considers brokers will need to comply with proposed IRS reporting requirements, aiming to quell concerns over a provision in the bipartisan infrastructure bill passed by the&nbsp;Senate.</blockquote><blockquote>Other firms key to the nearly $2 trillion crypto market — from developers and miners to hardware and software providers — won’t have any new requirements, so long as they don’t also act as brokers, according to a Treasury official. The Treasury’s guidance won’t grant blanket exemptions based on how firms identify themselves and instead will focus on whether a firm’s activities qualify it as a broker under the tax code, the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.</blockquote><blockquote>The guidance, which could be made public as soon as next week, is an attempt to address concerns in the cryptocurrency industry that the $550 billion infrastructure bill would require a host of companies with ties to digital assets to report data to the Internal Revenue Service that they don’t have. The tax provision, estimated to raise $28 billion over a decade, was included in the legislation as a way to help pay for new investments in roads and&nbsp;bridges.</blockquote><p>Which seems like a positive development. But if you remember, it was also Janet Yellen and the Treasury fighting back against changes to the original wording of the bill. From Yellen’s perspective, that makes sense. Let’s start overly broad, and then release guidance that’s more specific. It allows the Treasury to cover all their bases and the necessary wiggle room if they want to maneuver in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The guidance is also probably a move to help push the bill through the House without as much of a fight. But we’ll see how much this really appeases the crypto community.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/treasury-prepares-crypto-carve-out-from-infrastructure-bills-tax-reporting-provision-report">Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>According to Cornell Law, the U.S. tax code defines a broker&nbsp;as:</blockquote><blockquote>“A) a dealer, (B) a barter exchange, and © any other person who (for a consideration) regularly acts as a middleman with respect to property or services.”</blockquote><blockquote>Treasury is reportedly planning to exempt non-broker parties on a case-by-case basis, a far cry from the more sweeping exemptions the industry had&nbsp;sought.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/us-senate-sends-infrastructure-bill-to-house">US Senate Sends Infrastructure Bill to House — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/senate-compromise-infrastructure-bill">Lone Senator Rejects Crypto Compromise in Infrastructure Bill — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/senate-fails-to-amend-crypto-tax-provision-in-infrastructure-bill/">Senate Fails to Amend Crypto Tax Provision in Infrastructure Bill — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/sec-brings-and-settles-first-case-in-crypto-linked-defi-sector-11628266336">SEC Brings and Settles First Case in Crypto-Linked DeFi&nbsp;Sector</a>   2. Felix Salmon on crypto regulations <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-50f20bda-46a8-431b-8a64-ae7b8bbd89de.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: SEC chair Gary Gensler — who has taught a course on cryptocurrencies at MIT — gave an important speech last week laying out a maximalist vision for the degree to which his agency can and should regulate the asset&nbsp;class.</blockquote>  FTX, the fastest-growing crypto exchange, last valued at $18 billion, wants to become a regulated stock exchange where stocks can be traded on the blockchain.  Ethereum, the upstart rival to bitcoin, is in the process of moving to a more centralized system that transfers power to the largest holders of the currency, including its founder, Vitalik&nbsp;Buterin.  Stablecoins, which by their nature are inextricably linked to TradFi, or traditional finance, have already started to dominate crypto trading and quell its more anarchic&nbsp;fringes.  <blockquote>How it works: A more regulated system would help solve problems like the difficulty of buying a home using the proceeds of crypto sales, or customers of NBA TopShot being unable to transfer their money to banks, including JPMorgan and Wells&nbsp;Fargo.</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: We’re now clearly at the beginning of the end of cryptocurrency as an anarcho-libertarian Utopia.</blockquote>  Most crypto activity continues to take place outside the U.S., often in unregulated (and very risky) venues. But when the U.S. wants to regulate global financial activity, it generally finds it very easy to do&nbsp;so.  <blockquote>Go deeper: Yahoo’s Roger Parloff has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-profile-085444366.html">a big profile</a> of FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried that examines in much more detail the regulatory tightrope he’s&nbsp;walking.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stablecoin-shakeup-messi-s-crypto-compensation">Stablecoin Shakeup; Messi’s Crypto Compensation</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/daos-vcs-put-6m-behind-governance-startup-tally">DAOs, VCs Put $6M Behind Governance Startup Tally — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/polygons-new-gaming-studio-launches-with-cricket-nft-platform">Polygon’s New Gaming Studio Launches With Cricket NFT Platform — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fortune-raises-over-1-3m-in-nft-of-cover-art-sale">Fortune Raises Over $1.3M in Cover Art NFT Sale — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://gokhshteinmedia.com/2021/08/has-xrp-gone-debit/">Has XRP Gone&nbsp;Debit?</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/ether-burns-hit-100-million-post-eip-1559-activation/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Ether Burns Hit $100 Million Post EIP-1559 Activation — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/neuberger-berman-begins-offering-exposure-to-crypto/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Neuberger Berman Begins Offering Exposure to Crypto — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/cryptocurrency-theft-hackers-steal-600-million-in-poly-network-hack.html">Hackers return nearly half of the $600 million they stole in one of the biggest crypto&nbsp;heists</a>  <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/08/05/locating-stablecoins-within-the-regulatory-perimeter/">Locating Stablecoins within the Regulatory Perimeter</a>  <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/113874/tether-new-reserves-report-june-2021-treasury-bills">Tether significantly increased exposure to treasury bills as of&nbsp;June</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-over-defi-opensea-just-overtook-uniswap-on-ethereum-usage">NFTs Over DeFi: OpenSea Just Overtook Uniswap on Ethereum Usage — CoinDesk</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/114189/poly-hack-attacker-return-funds-id-slowmist">Poly Network attacker returns $256 million of the stolen cryptocurrency</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/hackers-steal-over-600m-biggest-in-defi-history/">Hackers Steal Over $600M; Biggest in DeFi History — Blockworks</a>   3.

 Global Crypto Exchanges Begin Phased Deployment of Veriscope: The Decentralized Solution to the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Bridgetown, Barbados, August 17, 2021 — Today, Shyft Core, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.deribit.com/">Deribit</a>, <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/">Bitfinex</a>, <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/">BitMEX</a>, <a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a>, <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/">Huobi </a>and other collaborating Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), announced the launch of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, a decentralized compliance framework and smart-contract platform for VASPs to enable travel rule compliance.</p><p>Participating exchanges are collectively initiating the phased deployment of Veriscope on the Shyft Network, a decentralized infrastructure designed to aggregate and embed trust, validation and discoverability into data stored on public and private ecosystems.</p><blockquote>“In 2019, the FATF tasked the industry to develop a technical response to the Travel Rule (Recommendation 16). This was no easy task as there are a number of technical challenges to doing so — particularly discovery of who a counterparty VASP is to a transaction. The Veriscope solution provides for an answer to this problem that causes the least customer friction, whilst at the same time respecting data privacy, data consent, and security to the greatest extent.” <br> — Malcolm Wright, Chief Compliance Officer at BitMEX and Chair of the Advisory Council at Global Digital&nbsp;Finance</blockquote><p>Veriscope is the result of a collective effort of some of the largest exchanges (by global volume), set out to collaboratively build <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/introducing-veriscope-a-decentralized-solution-to-the-fatfs-travel-rule-d7f3a0b99245">a decentralized solution for global compliance standards</a>, including the FATF’s Travel Rule guidance. Veriscope was designed, built and programmed to assist exchanges to meet these requirements by facilitating address discoverability, and KYC data exchange without unnecessary exposures of user’s&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“In order to truly make data transmission systems work at the scale of the largest VASPs today, we need open solutions that provide the highest level of security on behalf of our users. Blockchains enable global systems that address coordination while at the same time ensuring auditability across hundreds of countries, millions of users, and billions of transactions. Coming together as a global coalition to deploy this solution ensures the rest of the industry has a unified standard, and an open architecture, to help everyone meet global regulatory requirements. It is our responsibility to give clarity, lead regulatory standardization during this transition phase, while also helping smaller VASPs to define secure data requirements that sit at the forefront of regulatory transformation.” <br> — Jonathan Farnell, Director of Compliance at&nbsp;Binance</blockquote><p>By linking user consent-permissioning with VASP-to-VASP data transmission, Veriscope’s design ensures VASPs can determine the difference between honest transactions and data attacks while maintaining GDPR requirements and a trustless audit trail across counterparties. This coordination architecture eliminates the reliance on centralized trust and long-term reconciliation with counterparty VASPs that may or may not exist in the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>“Technology that allows VASPs to distinguish between transfers that are coming from or going to another VASP — solving the discovery problem — fulfills an important role in travel rule compliance. Veriscope’s solution for the discovery problem may be helpful in accelerating travel rule compliance and, as a consequence, the adoption of cryptocurrencies by traditional financial institutions.”<br> — Peter Warrack, CCO of&nbsp;Bitfinex</blockquote><blockquote>“The goal of Veriscope was to design a utility that would enable a decentralized coordination system to address global data transmission requirements. In achieving this goal, Veriscope ensures that VASPs maintain full business sovereignty, determines counterparty requirements cross-jurisdictionally, while maintaining a decentralized system that isn’t owned by any one group of VASPs.”<br> — Joseph Weinberg, Shyft Network Co-founder</blockquote><p>To ensure Veriscope’s success, the participating exchanges also created the <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-launches-the-veriscope-governance-task-force-in-collaboration-with-some-of-the-8d045e7443f3">Veriscope Governance Task Force</a>. Chaired by Rick McDonell, former Executive Secretary to the FATF, and Josee Nadeau, former head of the Canadian delegation to the FATF, the Task Force came together to collaboratively work on governance requirements for counterparty onboarding, information indexing, and Know Your Business&nbsp;(KYB).</p><p>Regarding the Task Force, Rick McDonell said: “all systems require a reliable governance framework and workable operational rules. This is true for both the real world and the virtual world. But while the real world has had a long history of devising systems the virtual world has not. This is especially the case in the transfer of money or value which, with new technologies, allows instant transfers but has not had the balancing rules for compliance with global standards and national regulatory requirements. This is now changing with the launch of the collaborative Veriscope system which bridges the gap between highly efficient technology and the need to provide accurate, timely and protected compliance information.”</p><blockquote>“Deribit is glad to join Veriscope as it offers an important step towards adhering to the Travel Rule requirements, whilst at the same time protecting client sensitive information. Global regulatory standards and requirements are changing and we strongly believe the best approach is a coordinated effort by globally trusted platforms to form a feasible approach and set new sensible standards.”<br> — Jos van Griensven, Head of Legal &amp; Compliance at&nbsp;Deribit</blockquote><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/ashford">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>
Eric Newcomer, Chief Technology Officer at WSO2 is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4606" title="Identity Is the New Blue"> The Rise of the Developer in IAM </a>on Monday, September 13 starting at 6:40 pm at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Eric some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>What significant identity projects have you been involved in? </p>
<p>
Well, long time ago, I did an application for Salomon Ski for their warehouse subsidiaries around the world. And for that application - because there was no solution - I had to create my own identity management service. So, I got to know quite well what it takes to do that. And I would never do it again, of course, now that there are such good offerings on the market, I would just buy them. It is much more efficient to have a single solution across a company than have each application person develop their own. But it gave me a great insight into exactly what's needed, what's there, what you have to do, how hard it is to maintain administratively, the overheads, and this kind of thing. So, I had that basic experience of having coded one of these things a long time ago. Then when I joined Citi, about 10 years ago now, we had a very strong identity management function there, which had to do more with identity cards and payment cards than anything else.</p>
<p>But we did go into a sponsored partnership with Microsoft, where we worked with Kim Cameron, who is well known in the industry for his identity thought leadership. And we were working on things around how to decorate or enhance the social login credentials from Facebook and Google and things like that to make them strong enough for banking, which was, I thought a very interesting approach to things. And on top of that, at Citi we had done identity cards for the Department of Defense. This was one of our big contracts, and we were trying to think how could we enhance those cards to have payment information, which gets you into a whole other level of identity management, again, strong enough for banking. And then there was another aspect to this [that] we tried to morph that into, which was for the payments systems [for] social security in Italy to get a proof of life identity. It's another interesting challenge in that area, [we] worked with Microsoft on it a bit. Unfortunately, none of these things ever really came to fruition, but it was a great time, a great background, great education for me on identity management, a great chance to work with one of the leading figures in the field as well.  </p>
<p>And, last but not least, I should just add my recent role at Citi. [My] most recent role was head of security, architecture and strategy for the consumer bank. And there, I got involved in the Google project where we were federating the identity of Google users with Citi users in order to enable this Google Pay application to do banking services. And that was very interesting, not the least of which was the culture difference between what it means to have an identity in the Google world and what it means to have an identity in the banking world, but we did manage to smush those together, and that project should be coming to fruition sometime this year. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When you say “everything is code” what do you mean by that? </p>
<p>
Yes, it's a kind of a catchphrase, I guess you might say, but if you look at the world and you see code becoming greater and greater part of our lives with all these smart devices and smartphones and smart homes and smart cities and cars. You know, Tesla basically reinvented the car as a mobile computer on wheels that happens to be drivable. And you have the internet of things, you have Alexa in your home, you have all of these devices at the edge, you know, the Xbox game statistics doing an amazing job of adding computing at the network edge. So, computers and code is just becoming everywhere and becoming a part of our daily life. So for everything is code, I think in the case of security, it becomes also a mentality, or a kind of a culture change, where we start thinking about how can we do as much in code as possible, since the world is moving to code, and we'll need to have a security code as part of all of these devices and all of these smart things. They need to be secure, perhaps more than ever, because of the proliferation of them and perhaps [because] of the lack of attention on security aspects in the early days of creating these devices and their APIs, and so on.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In what sense is identity management becoming code, and how is that useful? </p>
<p>
I think two main aspects here. One of them is the cloud influence. When you bring an application to the cloud - to Amazon, GCP [Google Cloud Platform], Azure - you don't have an operations department anymore to stand up your infrastructure. [You] use APIs, and this is becoming [a] more and more popular trend because it's also very efficient and creates an ability to automate deployments and automate the provisioning of infrastructure that otherwise we would have had to do manually or ask somebody to do and put in a ticket to change something or so on. So, there's this whole aspect of how can we automate the whole provisioning, management, [and] administration process that's kind of going on, not only in the cloud, but also moving to on-prem as applications become more and more automated, security testing becomes more and more automated, [and] standing up of infrastructure and management of infrastructure becomes more and more automated.  </p>
<p>So, you've got that aspect, and you want to make sure security is a key part of that and works well with all of those trends because security needs to be baked in, right from the beginning, in any of these efforts of moving apps to the cloud, or creating digital solutions, or creating IoT solutions - all of these things. As much as those things are being automated, security needs to be automated as well and the infrastructure and the administration of it. And the other aspect is on the coding part, the code that you need to implement security policies and processes also needs to be made available as external libraries that developers can download and integrate into their projects as seamlessly as possible because a lot of developers don't have a lot of security skills and have trouble, of course, keeping up with all the rapid advancement in the security area where things are evolving almost daily between, you know, new techniques for authentication and authorization, new attack surfaces, new ways to protect APIs, [and] new attacks on APIs.   </p>
<p>It's very hard for developers to keep up with all of that, and still deliver the business functionality they are meant to deliver. And this creates in some cases, and we saw this at Citi fairly clearly when I was running the security architecture team, that developers sometimes would not want to pay much attention to security until it was too late. It’s a very common thing, and we we'd have to review projects and say, no, you haven't done your encryption correctly. You don't have your authentication done to Citi standards. You cannot go to production. And they would get very angry with us, of course, because they want to please their business sponsors, go to production, meet their deadlines. We just wanted them to think about security from the beginning so we wouldn't end up in this kind of position. And some of the people would, but having the security libraries and security capabilities available as code makes it easier, and helps break down some of these traditional barriers between the security teams and the application development teams. </p>   
<p>So that you can say to them, here, just take these pre-built libraries, these policy definitions, and implement the company standards. Please include them in your development process as early as possible. Make sure you have the automated testing so you can test those APIs for the correct authentication, authorization capabilities and policies, check all the vulnerabilities, put in the code scanning, put in the container scanning - everything in the pipeline. So, there's this whole process of getting into the coding process, the modern coding automation processes with pre-built security code, security tools, and getting that “shifting left” is one of the terms for it - as much as possible. And to help do that, we want to provide as much of the security capabilities and policies in code as possible.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can organizations ensure that IAM code is wherever it is needed, when its needed, and that it is automated like any other code? </p>
<p>
Well, as I was previously saying, the “security as code” trend, provides a lot of code that's available in library form for handling things such as identity access management, and that in particular, is a specialization of the security as code trend, where it’s becoming more available from different vendors, from industry sources, from open source libraries -  that a lot of the code that you need to include in your applications, mobile apps, web apps, internet of things apps, is available as a downloadable library. So, what you want to do is make sure when you're doing your development, that you identify the library specific to identity access management functionality, and for policies, that you need to include in your code chain as you're building it out and as you're testing it. Another important aspect of this, is to make sure you have automated tests, especially for the identity of APIs, for example, which can be a real vulnerability.   </p>
<p>When you publish APIs, you need to have a strong identity, and that needs to be tested as well as part of the identity access management as code capability. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can attendees of EIC expect in your presentation? </p>
<p>
I'm really looking forward to EIC and to talk. I'll talk about the topics we mentioned today, and go into more detail about how exactly it can be done so that we can improve time to market, which is a critical thing. Sometimes you have this problem where security is not baked in, and you can't really put it in very well at the end. How do we avoid that problem? How can we shift left? How can we include the code in our pipelines? How can we ensure we have the right levels of testing? In other words, it's kind of the bits and bytes of the mechanics of doing this kind of thing, as well as just covering the concepts in a bit more detail.   </p>
<p>What does it mean to think about security as code, in particular for the IAM space? And so we've got the conceptual, how do you think about it? How do you do it? And then with a particular focus on being productive and getting that code to market with as few hurdles as possible, avoid those security guys saying no, get the time to market productivity for those APIs and for those digital transformation projects, as smooth as possible, while relying as much on security as code, IAM as code, as possible. Why [to]do it and how to do it. </p>

<p>Diagnostic is a series of essays and hosted conversations exploring the challenges of building more inclusive digital economies. For hosted (virtual) conversations, like the one described below, Caribou Digital convenes a diverse set of experts and thought leaders with unique insights on an issue and gives them the opportunity to explore a topic together. The conversation here occurred in June 2021 and included investment officers from large foundations as well as thematic experts and employees from multilateral and bi-lateral donor organizations. The conversation was private to facilitate open exchange so the following is an edited summary of key themes and not attributed to any participant.</p><p>The conversation we discuss here was kicked off by reviewing a post called “<a href="https://medium.com/dfs-lab/fortune-at-the-middle-of-the-pyramid-3a6886eb97f3">Fortune at the Middle of the Pyramid</a>” that uses high-resolution income and consumption data to understand opportunities and limitations of various for-profit investment strategies in sub-Saharan Africa. While that post focused more on private sector concerns, in the Diagnostic discussion we tried to understand the implications for aid, government, and donor policy (i.e. the “development sector”).</p><p>A large set of impact investor, international donor, and government anti-poverty policy is based on the notion that for-profit companies can be induced to serve the poor with life changing services like banking or schooling but the limits of the for profit model are not always taken into&nbsp;account</p><p>According to the <a href="https://thegiin.org/research/publication/impinv-survey-2020.">Global Impact Investor Network (GINN)</a>, there was $715B USD under management by global impact investors in 2019. The majority of the investors surveyed are targeting market-rate returns and attempting to improve the lives of low-income people as their primary impact. This is to say that most of them believe they can help low-income populations by investing in for-profit companies who serve them or their communities with some kind of good or&nbsp;service.</p><p>Beyond the impact investing sector, there is a much broader set of development actors (donors, governments, and other aid organizations) whose strategies implicitly or explicitly embody a similar belief — that with proper support, the private sector will serve low income people with products and services that improve their lives in meaningful ways and thus help them out of&nbsp;poverty.</p><p>Identifying the limits to this kind of for-profit model is thus quite important for a large number of impact investing and development strategies. In this Diagnostic, we summarize our research and the discussion of our panel of experts around the question of whether the poor can be a profitable market segment. This is a necessary condition for for-profit companies to want to serve the poor at&nbsp;all.</p><p>African data showing the shape of consumer purchasing power at different levels of income shows that the largest segment of consumers below $2 per day control only a small fraction of total purchasing power</p><p>The main data source we are going to look at is PovCalNet, a decades old project by the World Bank to compile comparable measures of income and consumption across countries. Using detailed household surveys, PovCalnet attempts to estimate daily consumption per adult in each household.</p><p>The example depicted above shows how we used this data to calculate the height of the below curve at each point along the x-axis. The height is the amount of discretionary spending power wielded by the entire population at each level of consumption (total income * y % which is discretionary * total number of people at this income). Thus, we believe this amount is a good proxy for spending power (and thus for the size of the market opportunity) for non-food, non-essential goods. (We address food and essentials below.)</p><p>Adding in realistic cost to acquire and serve low income customers shows most of the poor to be unviable as customers</p><p>Importantly, we can see that aggregate discretionary spending is relatively small — below $3/day — despite the fact that the majority of the population live at this level. Their incomes are low and spent almost entirely on necessities. The graph peaks around $4–$6, which is where the smaller number of people is best offset by higher income. Beyond that, everyone gets richer rapidly, but the population numbers fall even faster than income rises — thus absolute spending power falls. Interestingly, the spending power (calculated as the area under the curve) of the consumers in the $5–$10 band of income (which comprise only ~10% of the population) is about double that of the $0–$4/day group (which comprise&nbsp;~85%).</p><p>This is the key observation of the analysis — this dynamic will create strong incentives to push for-profit companies to serve the much smaller group in the $5–$10+ band. This is especially true to the extent that product developers must make a trade-off and tailor their products to be more attractive to one group and less attractive to the other. (There are very few universal products;most must be tailored and thus a trade-off must be&nbsp;made)</p><p>Curves in this figure represent the total disposable income net of cost to acquire and serve where hypothetical costs increase from curve 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).</p><p>Lowering the cost of acquisition and distribution is&nbsp;key!</p><p>So far we’ve only considered spending figures — for-profit actors care about profits, so we have to consider customer acquisition costs as well as the cost of goods sold. Factoring these costs into the equation changes the picture quite a bit, as seen in the curves above. As costs rise, some consumers at the very lowest end will become infeasible (i.e. even if we captured all their discretionary spending, which is nearly impossible, the cost to acquire and serve would still be higher.) Also, the peak of the curve will shift to higher income brackets for two reasons. Not only is there more money, but also it is distributed across fewer people, so the cost to acquire a dollar of discretionary spending is assumed lower. In the graph above, we can see that the peak goes from $5 to closer to $20 as costs rise and the area under the curve (the total potential market value) shrinks dramatically.</p><p>Another way to look at this graph is in reverse — any entrepreneur that can design distribution models that dramatically lower cost to acquire and serve will create huge market value and make many more people feasible as customers (perhaps there are government or donor investments that can also have this&nbsp;effect).</p> From the Diagnostic conversation: <p>There may be business models that can serve populations despite a lack of significant purchasing power and thus show promise as poverty alleviation strategies based in the private&nbsp;sector</p><p>The financial inclusion field is one area of development policy that seeks to identify for-profit delivery models for services that will benefit low-income consumers. One area of discussion centered on the kinds of financial services models that could be successful. One observation was that this logic essentially rules out savings-based models, as they depend almost entirely on discretionary income and tend to have high acquisition costs due to most people’s low urgency for savings. An exception might be the voluntary savings circles, but most participants actually see those as credit. Insurance seems to suffer a similar fate. The very basic package of P2P remittances, bill payments, and credit that has become the standard mobile money offering seems to be pretty close to what is sustainable for lower-income populations. This is partly because these products are high-margin due to the degree of need and can almost be seen as necessities (sending money or borrowing it in an emergency can be very urgent&nbsp;needs).</p><p>The discussion also touched on products (like airtime or fast moving consumer goods) that can be sold as individual package pricing where profit is guaranteed at the level of the individual sale. Because there is no risk of acquiring a customer that is unprofitable, producers of these services are likely to be more open to serving the poor and see them as a limited but potentially profitable subsegment.</p><p>Finally, the group discussed cross-subsidy models (like Facebook) where a richer segment of the user population can cross-subsidize unprofitable lower-income users. <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-land-where-facebook-loses-money-d850c6593f70">Caribou Digital’s analysis of Facebook users</a> in the developing world shows that while Facebook makes lots of money on users in North America, Europe, and Latin America, they likely lose money on users in Africa and a few other parts of the world where user discretionary income is too low. Thus advertisers are not willing to pay the premiums they are willing to pay elsewhere (very much in-line with this analysis indicating they have low discretionary income), and lower-quality devices and constrained usage patterns make them harder to serve. We estimate that Facebook loses something like a dollar a year on hundreds of millions of users in the developing world. But because Facebook’s revenues are tens of billions of USD per year, these losses are likely considered a cost of doing business when running a global platform that benefits from the network effects of having everyone on board. But this strategy depends on the money-losing population of users being a relatively small fraction of the total user base, and one where the total losses are limited. Thus, outside of the handful of massive global platforms where this applies, cross-subsidy models are not a feasible way to serve the population below the poverty line with digital services.</p><p>Very low-cost acquisition models might also break this logic, at least to the extent they assure the population in the $4–$8/day range are feasible as customers. Finally, models focusing on selling food and daily necessities also have potential, as shown below. There was some excitement about models that focus on agriculture value chains as a perennial development sector that has recently seen more activity from new technology startups. It was noted that the development sector has not paid as much attention to models focusing on small business supplier marketplaces and last-mile logistics even though they often have necessities and food at the core — perhaps because they have mostly focused in urban areas to&nbsp;date.</p> Focusing on models that deliver food and basic necessities helps expand the opportunity for the private sector, but it is still an uphill&nbsp;battle. <p>The above analysis assumes that most companies are creating services that target discretionary expenditures. Above we show the same curve when we include all expenditures, including primary necessities like food. When considering basic necessities, we now see a much larger market and one where the peak of consumer spending power is at a lower level of income — now in the $2–$5 range. This comports with the “Bottom of the Pyramid” argument that there is significant spending power among the lower income populations when it comes to food, and other primary necessities. Nevertheless, we still show relatively limited aggregate spending power for the large group of people who live on less than $2/day, which biases the for-profit sector to higher incomes. Most digital and technology powered models do not focus on necessities, but we believe there is significant scope to do&nbsp;so.</p> What are the key takeaways from this&nbsp;data?   Purely B2C models that seek to sell discretionary goods or services directly to low-income African households are unlikely to be profitable due to low discretionary income and the relatively high costs of acquiring and serving customers.  The largest block of discretionary income is in the hands of the population who live at $4-$8/day. These folks are not formally poor by global development standards.  With realistic acquisition costs factored in, the incentive is more often to target $10+/day, which represents only about 5% of the population in most of&nbsp;Africa.   From the Diagnostic conversation: <p>Two conclusions for the wider implications of impact investing and the poor as a profitable market&nbsp;segment</p>  You can’t spend your way out of poverty — you have to increase&nbsp;income!  <p>One area the group went into in some depth was whether models that increase income could break the logic above. Digital services that include remittances, gig work platforms, marketplaces where SMEs can be sellers, and productive lending all potentially increase income and thus don’t depend as much on the initial income of the user (in fact, they increase it). We believe these models should be pursued aggressively by the development sector to the extent it can be shown any of these models increase welfare along with increasing income (many rigorous studies within the microcredit sector have not shown increases in welfare from productive lending, for example, despite the narrative that they were a way for low income people to pull themselves out of poverty).</p><p>2. The development sector could use a strategic repositioning from financial inclusion towards digital livelihoods</p><p>Some of the participants noted a trend of development actors pivoting away from financial inclusion as an example of a strategy focusing on delivering a service via for-profit providers to low-income populations. As one participant noted: “We did focus groups at some point and financial services was never anything the poor asked for. They ask over and over for jobs and ways to increase income.” So that participant’s organization is now more focused on broader financial sector development that will lead to increased economic growth and therefore jobs.</p><p>The group noted a number of development actors who had undergone similar strategic repositionings towards digital livelihoods or jobs. Often the repositioning was towards digital livelihoods, including platform marketplaces where people can go to find gig work (e.g. Uber, Gojek, Upwork) or seller marketplaces (e.g. Alibaba, Jumia) or a wider range of informal digital livelihoods (MSMEs who transact over WhatsApp or Facebook). Many of these opportunities are new and seem to present significant opportunities, though the potential downsides of the digital platform economy are also important to understand. Caribou Digital maintains a site with a trove of research and references in this new area called <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">Platform Livelihoods</a> and DFS Lab has looked at the Indonesian landscape in this area&nbsp;<a href="https://dfslab.net/our-research/">here</a>.</p><p>Finally, there was some discussion about what would be difficult about such a transition for many donors. Even if it does turn out livelihoods have a better business model and are what people actually want, it can be hard for donors to move in this direction. Since livelihoods cut across sectors, donors will need to understand multiple sectors at once, as well as the fast-moving dynamics of digital platform economies. It can also be more nuanced because dealing with digital platforms has potential positives and negatives where data privacy, working conditions, and the general balance of power is tilted in favor of platforms in setting the terms of engagement with workers or sellers. These nuances can be hard to navigate. For donors and governments it is relatively easy to defend giving a digital savings account, and harder to justify demanding gig-work with relatively low wages (even if this is clearly something that the workers benefit immensely from and want because it improves their&nbsp;lives).</p> What do we take away from this exercise? <p>This data helps quantify some of the key reasons most startups and technology companies as well as more traditional corporations target only a relatively small subset of the population at the higher end of the income spectrum in&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>In doing so, it also calls into question the notion that funding innovation or subsidizing the private sector in other ways will result in reaching the lower-income population. Realistic levels of customer acquisition costs may make much of this population unprofitable to serve regardless of the model or the technology. And, even if they are feasible, for-profit models will almost always be pushed by incentives to focus their marketing on the population above key global poverty line measures (e.g. $1.90 or $3.10) and potentially even try to discourage lower income people from using their services (especially if the total cost to acquire and serve make those people unprofitable).</p><p>In light of this logic, one of the areas our group identified as high potential for further research and donor intervention was digital livelihoods which give people a chance to improve their income directly. We hope to see more work in this area down the&nbsp;road.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/what-are-the-limits-of-the-private-sector-in-serving-the-poor-3ee9a9a468fc">What are the limits of the private sector in serving the poor?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is a guest post featuring Vadim Slavin, director of the credentials platform at GlobaliD.</p><p>“So what is your digital trust halo?” — you ask. It is the combination of different traits and qualities of your digital footprint comprising your digital identity.</p><p>“Can you be more&nbsp;… umm… clear?” I’ll&nbsp;try.</p>Image: James St.&nbsp;Louis Your trust halo is the amount of trust others attribute to your identity&nbsp;online. <p>Consider a Facebook profile requesting access to your Facebook group. The profile was created yesterday and already has 300 friends. Take a look at another one. It was created 11 years ago and has a long history of Facebook posts, friends commenting on its feed, and a carefully curated album of travels around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Both of these are someone’s identities. Which of these will you trust more? You instinctively assess the trust halo of each profile/identity to answer this question.</p><p>So how can we distill this instinctive measure into a formulated approach?</p><p>Consider the following 7 attributes which help determine the size of the trust halo of your digital identity. As you read about these, think about your own identity, digital or not, and how these concepts apply to&nbsp;it.</p> Community. <p>From the early days of human collectivization, the participation in a community has been a great indication of trust. A new member of the tribe would not be trusted as much as older&nbsp;members.</p><p>A smaller community enables greater visibility and transparency. Collectively, members of the community who know us well can vouch for us and can quickly call out behavior not typically attributed to us. One can suppose that in a digital community, the longer you stay a part of it, the longer the members&nbsp;… tolerate your presence, the more trust one can attribute to your&nbsp;persona.</p><p>Of course it all depends on each particular case:</p>  how long you have been a&nbsp;member  how reputable the group&nbsp;is  how selective the group was to admit&nbsp;you  how engaged you have been to be visible to the group (see&nbsp;below)   Engagement. <p>The collective reputation of the community will influence your trust halo more if you are an active member of this community. This means that engagement and visibility will greatly enhance the trust attributed to your presence in this community (see&nbsp;below).</p> Leadership. <p>The ultimate measure of trust transferable to your identity is whether you actually started the community which others consider reputable. Have you heard of a fella by the name of Brian Epstein [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Beatle">ref</a>]? Would you ever trust the management of your band to this guy? Now look him up. How about&nbsp;now?</p> Reputation. <p>Perhaps nothing is more synonymous with trust than reputation. It is easier to earn reputation through engagement and leadership in a community. Reputation speaks not only about who vouches for you, it is also about what you have done. Perhaps it’s the predictions you made that came true, or maybe it’s the people you helped that are grateful or the length of time you kept your reputation unspoiled.</p> Vouches. <p>What is the best way to represent your reputation? Get vouched by someone who has a great deal of it themselves. Part of that reputation may just rub off on you. But be careful, negative reputation is transferable via a vouch as&nbsp;well.</p> Investment. <p>Yes, you can invest in your identity—curate it, build your reputation over time, avoid unnecessary confrontation and backlashes, and protect it from takeover by malicious actors. You have a LinkedIn account for 10 years with a healthy pattern of recommendations? There is more trust in whether this account is real. Why? Because you showed proof of&nbsp;work!</p> Verifications. <p>Last but not least — verifications. What can you prove about yourself or what others, trusted by the community, can prove about you. Have a real passport verified? It matches your verified driver’s license and a selfie you just took? What if you can verify that the face on the passport matches the face most commonly found on your account’s pictures? Now we’re&nbsp;talking.</p><p>Can you be trusted not to say mean things online? Not directly, but hey, if you value your identity, if you built a reputation and invested in your digital footprint, you are more likely to be a good guy with your real information verified rather than a bad&nbsp;actor.</p><p>Final thoughts. No single factor will influence your trust halo. Just like there isn’t a single definition of trust — it’s in the eye of beholder. Trusting someone to predict the rise and fall of the XRP isn’t the same as trusting someone not to pretend to be someone else.

<p>Inroads are made and celebrated and then a paradigm shift halts progress. Think about when the world got internet-connected mobile devices. Suddenly we were more connected than ever and less private than ever. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, smart home devices and artificial intelligence (AI) are today’s paradigm shifts. Data is proliferating at mind-boggling speeds—we generate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-5?aid=ogsm072517_1&amp;sf100871281=1">2.5 quintillion bytes of data</a>&nbsp;a day, and created&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/?sh=3a2c926060ba">90 percent</a>&nbsp;of the world’s data in the past two years.&nbsp;The data privacy issue is now discussed in terms of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">crisis</a>.</p>



<p>A 2020&nbsp;<a>report</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;The Brookings Institution’s Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology (AIET) Initiative says,&nbsp;“As artificial intelligence evolves, it magnifies the ability to use personal information in ways that can intrude on privacy interests by raising analysis of personal information to new levels of power and speed.”</p>



<p>And then we have the human factor. Despite knowing the risks to their privacy and safety from leaving their&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/what-is-digital-exhaust-and-why-does-it-matter/">digital exhaust</a>&nbsp;unchecked, many consumers fail to take any sort of remedial action (such as using&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>).&nbsp;This is known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404818303031">privacy paradox</a>, that disconnect between&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer concerns</a>&nbsp;about privacy and their actual actions to protect it. Users can make all sorts of other privacy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/human-error-cybersecurity-stats/">missteps</a>&nbsp;too, like falling for phishing and other scams, failing to properly secure accounts with strong and unique passwords and 2FA, mishandling sensitive corporate information, and using unsecured Wi-Fi networks. As long as humans are fallible, a comprehensive privacy solution will remain elusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020 we made some optimistic but cautionary&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">predictions</a>&nbsp;for privacy out to 2030. We believe the next eight or nine years can bring step change towards a brighter privacy future, but a neat package of solutions tied with a bow, not so much. Any one of the factors at play—</p>



  the data collecting machines and the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">business models</a>&nbsp;driving them  consumer rights and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">expectations</a>  <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">regulatory advancements</a>  <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">criminal activity</a>  corporate social responsibility  the rise of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/07/the-business-benefits-from-using-decentralized-identity-technologies-for-customer-identity-management/">decentralized identities</a>  ongoing fallout from&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>  



<p>—could change the privacy game at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>No privacy system is perfect. That’s the basis of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;as a data (and military) protection strategy: no system is perfect, breaches are always possible, so it’s wise to manage the risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So long as change is constant, humans are humans, and capitalism is alive and well, the privacy problem can never be fully solved. And with no airtight privacy solution in sight, consumers won’t have much choice but to protect their own data privacy. Risks to privacy and safety will increasingly become the cost of admission to the digital landscape. And&nbsp;tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and the capabilities in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, our business toolkit for rapidly deploying branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions, will thus become essential.</p>

			 DeFi vs Regulation: Round One<br>
 
<p>Due to their decentralized nature, the crypto and DeFi markets have always been complicated subjects when it comes to legislation.</p>
<p>It is currently becoming a big mess: in the last few months, we have seen legislators in Europe, and more recently in the US, struggling to bring compliance and control in the space, mostly because they are trying to regulate wallets like bank accounts. Let me tell you: it is not going to work that way. Blockchain participants are not financial institutions and the information is either private or public, for all participants. If a law is not applicable, I guess it loses its meaning at some point.</p>
<p>Debates about the Infrastructure Bill in the US are really fun (and scary) to follow because the capabilities of the technology are not considered at all. How could blockchain participants declare to the IRS if they don’t know who their counterparties are? In the same way, discussions about MiCA and new rules for AML in Europe are going in the wrong direction. Why? Because wallets are actually browsers for the internet of value, not vaults. Controlling your own wallet (as a sole owner of the private key) doesn’t prevent other parties from sending tokens to you, or even taking them back! Wallets don’t contain the tokens, they are just access points. What if someone else (person or smart contract) has access as well?</p>
<p>So, what is the solution? The answer is simple: identities on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Let’s dream about a secure system to identify investors, agents, assets, and things on the blockchain. This system would ensure the confidentiality of data, and at the same time, ensure the eligibility of the identity owners for the permissioned tokens or permissioned DeFi protocols they want to use. One or several wallets could be connected to each onchain identity. It would act as a compliance layer on top of wallets.</p>
<p>The good news is that we have made this system, it’s called <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/">ONCHAINID</a>. It is already used for the management of €8B+ of tokenized compliant and controllable securities on public blockchain networks.</p>
<p>ONCHAINID is a blockchain-based identity system that allows users to create and manage self-sovereign identities on DLT. This identification solution allows the enforcement of regulatory legal and other compliance processes and rules on digital assets or on any other web-based system that requires identity validation. The main added value of ONCHAINID is that it enables compliance and identity verifications within the pseudonymous framework of public blockchain networks.</p>

<p>Requirements for identity verification to travel across borders or enter amenities is an everyday fact of life. Whether you’re collecting cinema tickets or hopping on a plane, you will be required to provide some kind of identification. As the world begins to see progress in its fight against COVID-19, debates are abounding about the next level of identification and the benefits of vaccination passports, as proof that an individual has been inoculated against the virus. In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56812293">Denmark</a> zoos, theme parks and other attractions have reopened with requirements for vaccination passes as verification upon entry. Elsewhere, the European Union is reportedly developing a digital green certificate to permit citizens who have been vaccinated to travel freely among its member nations. In the United States, individual states will decide how they want to police vaccination, while elsewhere in the developing world, countries are still fighting the brutal virus and have yet to consider what a recovery plan will look&nbsp;like.</p><p>There is much controversy around the topic. While many have questioned the right of governments to promote vaccination plans in this way, others have questioned the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/covid-vaccine-passports-health-experts-are-deeply-concerned.html">fairness</a> in requiring them when less wealthy countries may be unable to commit to significant vaccine plans at this point. At this stage though, in order to ensure the swift recovery of the global economy, plans must be put in place that will help the world to reopen in a safe and secure manner. There is huge pent up demand for air travel, with a recent study by <a href="https://www.redpointglobal.com/press-releases/67-of-consumers-frustrated-by-travel-industrys-messaging-throughout-the-pandemic/">Redpoint Global </a>showing that nearly half of vaccinated Americans plan to travel this summer. Vaccination passports will play a part in these plans and they must be administered in the right way in order to ensure we aren’t taking away one problem and creating&nbsp;another.</p><p>The options for verification vary greatly. In Denmark for example, as well as using QR codes and identification features to allow holders to enter public spaces, they will accept paper verification, while in Iceland they are accepting American travelers who can produce ‘vaccination cards’. The risks of physical passes are strong; they are highly susceptible to forgery and much easier to copy than digital entities. The innate value of a COVID-19 passport is high, meaning that criminals will be incentivized to forge and sell fakes or stolen ones on the black market. A recent event in I<a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/covid-vaccine-scam-texts-and-calls-5376336-Mar2021/">reland</a>, whereby scammers used fake vaccination appointment calls to steal sensitive personal information, reflected how criminals are on the lookout for opportunities to use the current crisis as a means to conduct illicit activity, make money and steal personal information. In order to ensure their ability to do so is limited we must look to digital identity solutions.</p><p>That isn’t to say that digital solutions don’t have their flaws. Covid-19 tracker apps and online vaccination passports pose inherent safety risks. Placing public health information onto large internal databases requires individuals to have significant trust in the parties they are sharing their information with. Unless controlled properly, users will be required to hand over significant amounts of data to third parties, with little oversight of how it is being used and who is controlling it. Recently, tech giant Microsoft offered its technologies to assist with the vaccination program in the United States. While its resources are significant, there are inherent moral and technological risks associated with involving a massive conglomerate into public health matters, as they may become privy to highly sensitive public health information.</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions offer an ideal solution to the data privacy and identity risks associated with COVID-19 passports and other verification methods. End-to-end solutions that run on blockchain enable private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. Growing privacy concerns, as exasperated by intricate global supply chains and the challenges of the pandemic, mean that we must look to decentralized identity and blockchain technology to help us manage the huge swathes of sensitive information necessary to keep the world open. Reflecting its faith in the benefits of using blockchain for COVID-19 passports, the state of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nys-blockchain-based-covid-19-passport-is-now-live">New York</a> recently launched a blockchain passport built in conjunction with IBM. Using this technology, the passport allows individuals’ information to exist on the platform but requires them to give verification to anyone trying to access it. Its immutable format means that third parties involved in the platform, such as IBM, will not be able to access or see this sensitive information.</p><p>In essence, blockchain ensures that data remains immutable, secure and cannot be edited or (to some extent) copied. Using this technology, hospitals will be able to upload vaccine statuses and health information, but only the owner (i.e the person who is vaccinated), will be able to give access to the data, making it inherently compliant with GDPR and other regulatory requirements. These solutions can be integrated onto any platform, while remaining decentralized and secure. This therefore makes it possible for different applications and unconnected jurisdictions to use the same function despite using different platforms. It is important to note that individuals must also take responsibility for protecting their sensitive data by investing in decentralized identity solutions. Through these technologies, users can securely manage their digital identity by storing it on a phone or on a trusted cloud storage with a private key that grants access to the verified user&nbsp;only.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

Collators are located in orange coloured&nbsp;areas.<p>13 August 2021, Berlin — KILT Protocol today announced the selection of the first 16 collators that will comprise the Initial Collators Programme. This cohort represents a distributed network of collators from around the world who are well known in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.</p><p>The number of active collators will gradually increase to 75 after KILT’s mainnet launch, and become permissionless as the network matures. The Initial Collators include:</p>  <a href="https://botlabs.org/">BOTLabs GmbH</a>,&nbsp;Germany  B.T.E BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH,&nbsp;Germany  Canontech, Switzerland  <a href="https://twitter.com/__c0d3">Cody King</a> of Codenode, Canada  <a href="http://www.dwellir.com/">Dwellir AB</a>,&nbsp;Sweden  <a href="https://galaniprojects.de/">galaniprojects GmbH</a>,&nbsp;Germany  <a href="https://zcloak.network/">Glacier Blockchain Technology Co.</a>, Ltd.,&nbsp;China  <a href="https://martin222.medium.com/">Martin</a>, Germany  Pacobits of <a href="https://stakely.io/">Stakely</a>,&nbsp;Spain  Petr of <a href="https://polkadotters.medium.com/">Polkadotters</a>, Czech&nbsp;Republic  Shez of <a href="https://www.staking4all.org/">Staking4All</a>, South&nbsp;Africa  Skedley, Germany  <a href="https://stakenode.medium.com">STAKENODE</a>, Poland  <a href="https://stakin.com/home">Stakin</a>, Estonia  Tjwelde, Germany  Yarco Hayduk of <a href="http://pragma-invest.com/">Pragma Ventures</a>, Ukraine  <p>KILT’s mainnet will launch after it secures a Kusama parachain slot. As mentioned in our earlier <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilts-parachain-plans-an-update-efb9a9e35394">blog post</a>, KILT’s parachain will include staking and our <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-token-economy-an-update-db207611f5ce">initial token economy</a> at launch. This means the first phase of staking will be possible on KILT from&nbsp;genesis.</p><p>To prepare for KILT’s launch, we selected and onboarded this first group of collators over recent weeks. In the near future we anticipate the number of collators will be gradually increased to 75 active collators, with a possible maximum of 150 collators (active and candidates). Collator selection will become permissionless when decided by governance, after the Sudo key is removed and KILT is decentralised.</p> Collator and Delegator Framework <p>Kusama uses a Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system, with validators securing the Relay Chain and validating blocks. KILT uses a modified version of DPoS called <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">Limited Delegated Proof of Stake</a> (LDPoS). In this system, collator nodes hold the data of the blockchain, collect transactions and build&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Delegators can choose a collator to back with their stake, thus increasing the total stake on that collator. One collator can have a maximum of 25 delegators backing them, where delegators with higher stakes for one collator displace delegators with smaller amounts at stake for the same collator.</p><p>Block rewards go to the collator who produces an actual block, and their delegators. By putting their stake on a collator, delegators signal their trust in quality performers. As recognition for bootstrapping and maintaining the system, the delegator rewards are higher in the first years and then decrease as&nbsp;follows:</p>  At the start, collators receive rewards up to 10% per annum on their stake from the first year. The reward rate decreases by 2% per year (which would mean that in the second year, the rewards will be up to 9.8% per&nbsp;annum).  Delegators receive rewards up to 8% per annum on their stake in the first year, 6% in the second year. From the beginning of the third year there will be no reward for delegators, as it is anticipated that by then other KILT functions will be in place that will provide opportunities for token holders to support the system and earn&nbsp;rewards.  <p>We chose this LDPoS mechanism as part of a carefully-considered token economy that aims to have relatively low inflation, starting at 5% and decreasing to 1% within the first 6 years and slowly moving to 0% afterwards.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials for Web 3.0. KILT enables innovative business models around identity and privacy, addressing the need for reliable identity solutions in the digital world. It allows users to claim personal attributes, have them attested by trusted entities, and store the claims as self-sovereign credentials. KILT Protocol is developed by BOTLabs GmbH in Berlin and is the technology on which SocialKYC, a decentralised identity verification service, is&nbsp;built.</p><p>Press contacts:</p><p>Christine Mohan, christine@kilt.io</p><p>Elisa Dratsdrummer, elisa@kilt.io</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-first-cohort-of-kilts-initial-collators-programme-4e4b65159246">Announcing First Cohort of KILT’s Initial Collators Programme</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The first in a series of articles on Ontology’s contribution to the coming Web 3.0&nbsp;era. <p>From how we communicate with one another, to how we work, to how we consume entertainment and acquire knowledge, the internet has pervaded practically every aspect of our lives. The internet’s rise has coincided with a corresponding rise in the influence of what has become known as “Big Tech”, a collection of technology companies responsible for the online platforms and services we use on a daily basis. These companies created platforms that attracted millions (in some cases, billions) of users. In order to use such platforms, users are required to provide information in the form of email addresses, phone numbers, etc. The tech companies discovered that they could monetize these data points by using them to create targeted advertisements and also by selling them to third-parties.</p><p>The current Web 2.0 world has come to represent the era of “Big Data”, a world in which users provide private data to centralized tech platforms that utilize the data to enrich themselves. In essence, these “free” platforms have transformed their users into a kind of product. You, the user, have very little (if any) control over how your data is utilized once it is shared with a given tech platform. And since it is stored on a centralized platform, it is prone to hacking. Numerous data breaches have occurred in recent years, exposing the private information of millions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>We are currently in a transition phase between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. The Web 3.0 era promises a world in which we are no longer at the mercy of centralized platforms. It is a decentralized world; one that will allow people to reclaim ownership and control over their private&nbsp;data.</p> What is Web&nbsp;3.0? <p>There are different opinions on what Web 3.0 is with no clear definition. The “Semantic Web”, “Global Brain”, and “IoE” proposed by Tim Berners-Lee still seems out of reach. According to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/web-3-0-technologies-in-business.html">Deloitte</a>’s 2019 report on The Spatial Web, compared with Web 2.0, the era of Web 3.0 will undergo qualitative changes at three levels: interaction, computation, and information.</p>Source: Deloitte analysis adapted from Gabriel René and Dan Mapes, The Spatial Web: How Web 3.0 Will Connect Humans, Machines, and AI to Transform the World (Amazon,&nbsp;2019).<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/01/06/what-is-web-3-0/?sh=70aa418758df">Forbes</a>, the rise of technologies such as distributed ledgers and storage on blockchain will allow for data decentralization and create a transparent and secure environment. This helps to address the centralized Internet quandary described above. When users are able to control their data (and decide who can access it) independently, centralized platforms will be unable to covertly harvest private data. In addition to improving privacy, this should also help prevent data breaches, as the data will no longer be stored on centralized servers. In sum, Web 3.0 puts the power back in the hands of users, bidding farewell to the data hegemony and data exploitation of the centralized platforms.</p><p>Ontology, a blockchain for self-sovereign identity and data, is helping bring about the Web 3.0 era. Thanks to Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, ONT ID, netizens no longer need to place their trust in centralized platforms. If a person needs to verify aspects of his identity online, he can do so knowing that his data remains private and secure. Right now, individuals unknowingly provide huge swaths of data to centralized platforms that store it on centralized servers. Ontology enables users to create a decentralized identity that they can carry with them and utilize across multiple platforms. Decentralized identity is a core pillar of the coming Web 3.0 infrastructure and Ontology is poised to provide the tools necessary to facilitate the transition away from Web 2.0, characterized by centralized data platforms, and towards the decentralized and open Web 3.0&nbsp;era.</p> Web 3 and&nbsp;Ontology <p>Compared with the current Web 2.0 landscape characterized by centralized platforms that store and monetize user data, Web 3.0 represents a more open, transparent, and decentralized future. Blockchain has been an open and collaborative project from the very beginning. When Ethereum emerged, it was known for its neutrality, open source, and programmability, and thus became one of the largest and most active blockchain communities in the world. The blockchain industry still needs time to mature if it is to become a truly decentralized and interoperable network for Web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>In line with the openness of Web 3.0, Ontology was based on the concept of “multi-chain compliance, multi-layer expansion, and on-chain and off-chain hybrid application mode”, Ontology is an interoperable public chain supporting cross-chain transactions and Layer 2 solutions that enhance performance. It is also equipped to work with a variety of industries, both traditional and blockchain-based.</p><p>Ontology’s smart contract system utilizes a universal multi-virtual machine solution, being the first to support NeoVM, Native Ontology, and Wasm contracts in 2020. This year, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support was added, giving developers the widest variety of VM options currently available. After the EVM tests are completed, Ontology will become the first public chain to support four virtual machines.</p><p>As a highly interoperable chain network and the multi-virtual machine solution, Ontology is equipped for the coming transition to Web 3. Whether you are a senior blockchain developer or a traditional web developer, you can quickly become familiar with the Ontology development environment, easily deploy blockchain applications, and enjoy fast block confirmation speeds and low deployment costs. Ontology has matured into a comprehensive system with multifunctional, lightweight, highly available, concurrent, multi-language, cross-contract, cross-virtual machines all in one place and compatible with any region, any ecology, any language, and any business.</p><p>Our exploration of Ontology and Web 3.0 continues next week in Part 2 of this&nbsp;series.</p><p>References</p><p>1.

   Blockchain and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) are often talked about as complementing technologies. But do you really need blockchain to enable&nbsp;SSI?  Before we answer this question, it merits to note that SSI is a digital movement that aims to enable individuals or organizations to have sole ownership of their identity, and to have control over how their data is shared and used.

<p>Blockchain and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI) are often talked about as complementing technologies. But do you really need blockchain to enable&nbsp;SSI?</p><p>Before we answer this question, it merits to note that SSI is a digital movement that aims to enable individuals or organizations to have sole ownership of their identity, and to have control over how their data is shared and used. It functions on cryptographic key pairs which can be based on blockchain technologies.</p><p>As always, let’s answer this question with an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Frank is a traveler who is going on a vacation from Singapore to Germany. As per the existing government norms, he has to be fully vaccinated to board the flight. He is eligible to travel but has to present his vaccination details to the airport authorities to get the boarding&nbsp;pass.</p><p>So, there are three parties involved here — the healthcare facility that issued vaccination details (<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>), Frank, and the airport official who will check the credential. In other words, the healthcare facility is the issuer of a credential, Frank is the owner, and the airport official is the verifier.</p><p>Now, let’s get down to the implementation. How can the airport official verify the credibility of Frank’s vaccination, given that the healthcare facility is not in the same network as that of the verifier?</p><p>One possibility is to use blockchain technology to store the credential because it is immutable and&nbsp;secure.</p> Using Blockchain for&nbsp;SSI <p>No discussion of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> is ever complete without questions about blockchain. This is because blockchain provides the perfect alternative to centralized repositories as the credentials can be stored on blocks and linked to the larger&nbsp;network.</p><p>Since the blockchain network is spread across multiple computers, there’s no single owner. Also, the very nature of blockchain makes it impossible to change data, and this means you have high levels of online security and credibility.</p><p>In all, blockchain is a secure way to store and share your credentials and be in complete control of your data at all times, thereby enabling&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>That said, blockchain is not the only option for enabling SSI as there are other ways of implementing it such as IPFS, DID anchoring, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/peer-dids-an-off-ledger-did-implementation-5cb6ee6eb168">peer DIDs</a>, public-key cryptography, and more. You can even use gateways to avoid interacting with blockchains directly.</p><p>To give you an idea, let’s look at how <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public-key cryptography</a> is used for enabling&nbsp;SSI.</p> Using Public Key Cryptography <p>Public key cryptography secures the communication among entities, and in the process, enables the implementation of&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>Here’s a brief workflow of how it&nbsp;works.</p>  The healthcare facility issues the credential and signs it with its private key, and encrypts it with Frank’s public&nbsp;key.  Frank decrypts the credential using his private key and stores it in his digital wallet. When it’s time to present it to the airport authorities, he signs it with his private key and encrypts it with the verifier’s public&nbsp;key.  Finally, the verifier decrypts the credential using its private key and validates both the holder and the issuer using their respective public&nbsp;keys.  <p>As you can see, blockchain is not needed to implement SSI&nbsp;here.</p> Using IPFS <p>Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a versioned file system that stores files and tracks their versions. It is a distributed file network where the file URL of the actual file is shared among&nbsp;users.</p><p>For example, let’s say the vaccination details are stored in /ipfs/ZTmu48720mlp/vaccinations/frank.txt and this file can be shared directly with the concerned authorities. Here, the URL is similar to HTTP requests, except that the actual file name is used instead of the location where it is stored. Here, the cryptographic hash on the file is a part of the URL, and this is also what secures its contents.</p><p>Blockchain is not needed here as&nbsp;well.</p> Using Peer&nbsp;DIDs <p>In a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/peer-dids-an-off-ledger-did-implementation-5cb6ee6eb168">peer DID</a>, there’s no network involved. Here, the healthcare center creates a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifier</a> (DID), puts it in a DID document, and sends it directly to the airport authority. Likewise, the airport authority creates a DID, puts it in a DID document, and sends the doc to the healthcare facility</p><p>So, both entities create their records and send the metadata of their records to each other, so one can use that metadata to look up the record of the other. This information can also be cryptographically encrypted for security.</p><p>Again, no blockchain here.</p><p>To conclude, blockchain can be used for enabling SSI, but it is not the only way to implement SSI. The choice depends on the company/developer who is implementing it.</p><p>We hope this will get you thinking about enabling SSI using an option that best suits your application or business requirement.

  <p>Modern applications must work smoothly on high loads and with a high number of concurrent users. Traditional Java applications run blocking code and a common approach for scaling is to increase the number of available threads. When latency comes into the picture, many of these additional threads sit idle, wasting resources.</p>

<p>A different approach increases efficiency by writing asynchronous non-blocking code that lets the execution switch to another task while the asynchronous process completes.</p>

<p>Project Reactor is a Java framework from VMware that implements the <a href="https://www.reactive-streams.org/">Reactive Streams</a> specification. This initiative provides a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure for the JVM and JavaScript runtimes. It is the foundation of the reactive stack in the Spring ecosystem and WebFlux applications. Some studies suggest that performance differences are negligible in Spring applications unless the application makes more than 500 API requests per second. Thus, it’s not mandatory to do asynchronous programming, but it is the right approach for specific use cases.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll summarize some core Reactor concepts, introduce the Scheduler abstraction, and describe how it is used to encapsulate blocking code and prevent Java reactive applications from stalling.</p>

 Reactor Execution Model 

<p>Reactor is an API for doing asynchronous programming. You describe your data processing as a flow of operators, composing a data-processing pipeline.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Using the assembly line analogy, the initial data flow from a source, known as the <code>Publisher</code>, goes through transformation steps and eventually the result is pushed to a consumer, known as the <code>Subscriber</code>. A <code>Publisher</code> produces data, and a  <code>Subscriber</code> listens to it. Reactor also supports flow control via backpressure, so a <code>Subscriber</code> can signal the volume it’s able to consume.</p>

 Nothing Happens Until You Subscribe 

<p>In general, when you instantiate a <code>Publisher</code> (a <code>Flux</code> or a <code>Mono</code>) you are describing an asynchronous processing pipeline. When combining operators, no processing happens–you are describing the intent. This is called assembly time. You only trigger the data flow through that pipeline when you <code>subscribe</code>. The <code>subscribe</code> call emits a signal back to the source, and the source starts emitting data that flows through the pipeline. This is called execution time or subscription time.</p>

<p>A cold publisher generates data for each subscription. Then, if you subscribe twice, it will generate the data twice. All the examples that follow below will instantiate cold publishers. On the other hand, a hot publisher starts emitting data immediately or on the first subscription. Late subscribers receive data emitted after they subscribe. For the family of hot publishers, something does indeed happen before you subscribe.</p>

 Operators <code>map</code> and <code>flatMap</code> 

<p>Operators are like workstations in an assembly line. They make it possible to describe transformations or intermediate steps along the processing chain. Each operator is a decorator, it wraps the previous <code>Publisher</code> into a new instance. To avoid mistakes, the preferred way of using operators is to chain the calls. Apply the next operator to the last operator’s result. Some operators are instance methods and others are static methods.</p>

<p>Both <code>map()</code> and <code>flatMap()</code> are instance method operators. You might be familiar with the concept of these operations from functional programming or Java Streams. In the reactive world, they have their own semantics.</p>

<p>The <code>map()</code> method transforms the emitted items by applying a synchronous function to each item, on a one-to-one basis. Check the example below:</p>

   <code>public class MapTest {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MapTest.class);

    @Test
    public void mapTest() {
        Flux.range(1, 5)
                .map(v -&gt; transform(v))
                .subscribe(y -&gt; logger.info(y));

    }

    private String transform(Integer i){
        return  String.format("%03d", i);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Note: You can find this test and all the code in this tutorial in <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-reactive-service-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In the code above, a flux is created from a range of integers from 1 to 5. The <code>map()</code> operator is passed a transformation function that formats with leading zeros. Notice that the return type of the transform method is not a publisher and the transformation is synchronous–a simple method call. The transformation function must not introduce latency.</p>

<p>The <code>flatMap()</code> method transforms the emitted items asynchronously into Publishers, then flattens these inner publishers into a single <code>Flux</code> through merging, and the items can interleave. This operator does not necessarily preserve original ordering. The mapper function passed to <code>flatMap()</code> transforms the input sequence into N sequences. This operator is suitable for running an asynchronous task for each item.</p>

<p>In the example below, a list of words is mapped to its phonetics through the Dictionary API, using <code>flatMap()</code>.</p>

   <code>@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class FlatMapTest {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FlatMapTest.class);

    public static class Word {

        private String word;

<p>There is a rich vocabulary of operators for <code>Flux</code> and <code>Mono</code> you can find in the reference documentation. This handy guide can help you choose the right operator: <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#which-operator">“Which operator do I need?”</a>.</p>

 Reactor Schedulers for Switching the Thread 

<p>Project Reactor provides the tools for fine-tuning the asynchronous processing in terms of threads and execution context.</p>

<p>The <code>Scheduler</code> is an abstraction on top of the <code>ExecutionService</code>, which allows submitting a task immediately, after a delay or at a fixed time rate. We’ll share some examples below of the various default schedulers provided. The execution context is defined by the <code>Scheduler</code> selection.</p>

<p>Schedulers are selected through <code>subscribeOn()</code> and <code>publishOn()</code> operators, they switch the execution context. <code>subscribeOn()</code> changes the thread where the source actually starts generating data. It changes the root of the chain, affecting the preceding operators, upstream in the chain; and also affects subsequent operators.</p>

<p>Using <code>publishOn()</code> switches the context for the following operators in the pipeline description, downstream in the chain, overriding any the scheduler assigned with <code>subscribeOn()</code>.</p>

<p>The scheduler examples ahead will use <code>TestUtils.debug</code> for logging the thread name, function, and element:</p>

   <code>public class TestUtils {

    public static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TestUtils.class);

    public static &lt;T&gt; T debug(T el, String function) {
        logger.info("element "+ el + " [" + function + "]");
        return el;
    }
}
</code>   
 No Execution Context 

<p><code>Schedulers.immediate()</code> can be seen as the no-op scheduler, which the pipeline executes in the current thread.</p>

   <code>@Test
public void immediateTest() {

    logger.info("Schedulers.immediate()");

    Flux.range(1, 5)
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map"))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.immediate())
            .subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe"));
}
</code>   

<p>The test above will log something similar to:</p>

 <code>2021-07-29 09:36:05.905 - INFO [main] - element "1" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "1" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "2" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "2" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.906 - INFO [main] - element "3" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "3" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "4" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "4" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "5" [map]
2021-07-29 09:36:05.907 - INFO [main] - element "5" [subscribe]
</code> 

<p>Everything executes in the main thread.</p>

 Single Reusable Thread 

   <code>@Test
public void singleTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.single()");

    Flux.range(1, 5)
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map"))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.single())
            .subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
</code>   

<p>When running the test above, you will see a log similar to this:</p>

 <code>2021-07-13 23:19:16.456 - INFO [main] - element 1 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 2 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 3 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 4 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [main] - element 5 [map]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.457 - INFO [single-1] - element 1 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.465 - INFO [single-1] - element 2 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.465 - INFO [single-1] - element 3 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.466 - INFO [single-1] - element 4 [subscribe]
2021-07-13 23:19:16.466 - INFO [single-1] - element 5 [subscribe]
</code> 

<p>As you can see, the <code>map()</code> function executes in the main thread, and the consumer code passed to <code>subscribe()</code> executes in the single-1 thread. Everything after the <code>publishOn()</code> will execute in the passed scheduler.</p>

<p>You may have noticed there is a <code>Thread.sleep()</code> call at the end of the test. As part of the work is passed to another thread, the <code>sleep()</code> call delays the application exit, so the worker thread can complete the task.</p>

 Bounded Elastic Thread Pool 

<p>A bounded elastic thread pool is a better choice for I/O blocking work, for example, reading a file, or making a blocking network call. It serves to help with legacy blocking code if it cannot be avoided.</p>

   <code>@Test
public void boundedElasticTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.boundedElastic()");

    List&lt;String&gt; words = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    words.add("a.txt");
    words.add("b.txt");
    words.add("c.txt");
    Flux flux = Flux.fromArray(words.toArray(new String[0]))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .map(w -&gt; scanFile(debug(w, "map")));

    flux.subscribe(y -&gt; debug(y, "subscribe1"));
    flux.subscribe(y -&gt; debug(y, "subscribe2"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}

public String scanFile(String filename){

    InputStream stream = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(filename);
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(stream);
    String line = scanner.nextLine();
    scanner.close();

    return line;
}
</code>   

<p>The test above should log something similar to this:</p>

 <code>2021-07-15 00:41:51.443 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "a.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.443 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "a.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.446 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file a.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "b.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file b.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.447 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "c.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.448 - INFO [boundedElastic-2] - element "A line in file c.txt" [subscribe2]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.448 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file a.txt" [subscribe1]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.449 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "b.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.451 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file b.txt" [subscribe1]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.452 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "c.txt" [map]
2021-07-15 00:41:51.453 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "A line in file c.txt" [subscribe1]
</code> 

<p>As you can see in the code above, the <code>flux()</code> is subscribed twice. As the <code>publishOn()</code> is invoked before any operator, everything will execute in the context of a bounded elastic thread. Also, notice how the execution from both subscriptions can interleave.</p>

<p>What might be confusing is that each subscription is assigned one bounded elastic thread for the whole execution. So in this case, “subscription1” executed in boundedElastic-1 and “subscription2” executed in boundedElastic-2. All operations for a given subscription execute in the same thread.</p>

<p>The instantiation of the <code>Flux</code> above produced a Cold Publisher, a publisher that generates data anew for each subscription. That’s why both subscriptions above process all the values.</p>

 Fixed Pool of Workers 

<p><code>Schedulers.parallel()</code> provides a pool of workers tuned for parallel work, with as many workers as there are CPU cores.</p>

   <code>@Test
public void parallelTest() throws InterruptedException {

    logger.info("Schedulers.parallel()");

    Flux flux = Flux.range(1, 5)
            .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map"));

    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe1"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe2"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe3"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe4"));
    flux.subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe5"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
</code>   

<p>The test above will log something similar to the following lines:</p>

</code> 

<p>As you can see, different subscription executions interleave, and as I am testing with only four CPU cores, four workers seem to be available: parallel-1, parallel-2, parallel-3, and parallel-4. The <code>subscription5</code> operations, execute in parallel-1.</p>

<p>Again, observe how all operations for a given subscription are executed in the same thread.</p>

 Using Both <code>publishOn</code> and <code>subscribeOn</code> 

<p>When the <code>publishOn()</code> and <code>subscribeOn()</code> operators are used, the <code>subscribe</code> call accepts a consumer. The consumer will execute in the context selected by <code>publishOn()</code>, which defines the scheduler for downstream processing, including the consumer execution. At first, this might be confusing to understand, so check the following example:</p>

   <code>@Test
public void subscribeOnWithPublishOnTest() throws InterruptedException {
    Flux.range(1, 3)
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v, "map1"))
            .publishOn(Schedulers.parallel())
            .map(v -&gt; debug(v * 100, "map2"))
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic())
            .subscribe(w -&gt; debug(w,"subscribe"));

    Thread.sleep(5000);
}
</code>   

<p>The log should look like the following lines:</p>

   <code>2021-07-29 08:40:30.583 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "1" [map1]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.584 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "100" [map2]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "100" [subscribe]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [boundedElastic-1] - element "2" [map1]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "200" [map2]
2021-07-29 08:40:30.585 - INFO [parallel-1] - element "200" [subscribe]
...
</code>   

<p>As you can see, the first <code>map()</code> operator executes in the boundedElastic-1 thread, the second <code>map()</code> operator and the <code>subscribe()</code> consumer execute in the parallel-1 thread. Notice that the <code>subscribeOn()</code> operator is invoked after <code>publishOn()</code>, but it affects the root of the chain and the operators preceding <code>publishOn()</code> anyways.</p>

<p>A probably simplified <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#howtoReadMarbles">marble diagam</a> for the example above might look like this:</p>

 Reactive Java Spring Services 

<p>In Spring WebFlux, it is assumed applications don’t block, so non-blocking servers use a small fixed-size thread pool to handle requests, named event loop workers.</p>

<p>In an ideal reactive scenario, all the architecture components are non-blocking, so there is no need to worry about the event loop freezing up (reactor meltdown). But sometimes, you will have to deal with legacy blocking code, or blocking libraries.</p>

<p>So now, let’s experiment with Reactor Schedulers in a Reactive Java application. Create a Spring WebFlux service with Okta security. The service will expose an endpoint to return a random integer.</p>

<p>The implementation will call Java <code>SecureRandom</code> blocking code. Start by downloading a Spring Boot Maven project using <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>. You can do it with the following HTTPie command:</p>

   <code>http -d https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  bootVersion==2.5.3 \
  baseDir==reactive-service \
  groupId==com.okta.developer.reactive \
  artifactId==reactive-service \
  name==reactive-service \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.reactive \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==webflux,okta
</code>   

<p>Unzip the project:</p>

   <code>unzip reactive-service.zip
cd reactive-service
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.reactive.service</code>, and add the <code>SecureRandomService</code> interface:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

public interface SecureRandomService {

    Mono&lt;Integer&gt; getRandomInt();
}
</code>   

<p>And the implementation <code>SecureRandomServiceImpl</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import java.security.SecureRandom;

@Service
public class SecureRandomServiceImpl implements SecureRandomService {

    private SecureRandom secureRandom;

    public SecureRandomServiceImpl() {
        secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    }

    @Override
    public Mono&lt;Integer&gt; getRandomInt() {
        return Mono.just(secureRandom.nextInt());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Think for a moment about the <code>getRandomInt()</code> implementation. It’s hard to resist the temptation to wrap anything whatsoever in a publisher. <code>Mono.just(T data)</code> creates a <code>Mono</code> that will emit the specified item. But the item is captured at instantiation time. This will invoke the blocking code at assembly time, perhaps in the context of an event loop thread.</p>

<p>For now, let’s move forward to create the package <code>com.okta.developer.reactive.controller</code>, and add a <code>SecureRandom</code> class for the data:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

public class SecureRandom {

    private String value;

    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(String value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public SecureRandom(Integer value){
        this.value = value.toString();
    }
}
</code>   
<p>Create the <code>SecureRandomController</code> class:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

import com.okta.developer.reactive.service.SecureRandomService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@RestController
public class SecureRandomController {

    @Autowired
    private SecureRandomService secureRandomService;


    @GetMapping("/random")
    public Mono&lt;SecureRandom&gt; getSecureRandom(){
        return secureRandomService.getRandomInt().map(i -&gt; new SecureRandom(i));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add <code>spring-security-test</code> dependency to the pom:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>SecureRandomControllerTest</code>:</p>
   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.controller;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.AutoConfigureWebTestClient;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOidcLogin;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class SecureRandomControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient webTestClient;

    @Test
    public void testGetSecureRandom() {
        webTestClient.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
            .get()
            .uri("/random")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run with:</p>
   <code>./mvnw test -Dtest=SecureRandomControllerTest
</code>   
<p>The test should pass, but how can you make sure the REST call won’t freeze up the service’s event loop? Use <a href="https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound">BlockHound</a>!. Blockhound is a Java agent that detects blocking calls from non-blocking threads, has built-in integration with Project Reactor, and supports the JUnit platform.</p>

<p>Add the Blockhound dependency to the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.projectreactor.tools&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;blockhound-junit-platform&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0.6.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>It has been reported that when <a href="https://github.com/reactor/BlockHound/issues/173">Spring Security is enabled, BlockHound does not detect blocking calls</a>.</p>

<p>Disable security for the test profile. Add the file <code>src/test/resources/application-test.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>spring:
  autoconfigure:
    exclude:
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.client.reactive.ReactiveOAuth2ClientAutoConfiguration
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.resource.reactive.ReactiveOAuth2ResourceServerAutoConfiguration
      - org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.reactive.ReactiveSecurityAutoConfiguration
</code>   

<p>Rerun the test, and you should see the following error:</p>

 <code>reactor.blockhound.BlockingOperationError: Blocking call! java.io.FileInputStream#readBytes
	at java.base/java.io.FileInputStream.readBytes(FileInputStream.java) ~[na:na]
	Suppressed: reactor.core.publisher.FluxOnAssembly$OnAssemblyException:

		at java.base/java.security.SecureRandom.next(SecureRandom.java:798) ~[na:na]
</code> 

<p>As the log above shows, <code>SecureRandom.next()</code> produces a call to <code>FileInputStream.readBytes()</code>, which is blocking.</p>

<p>The <code>SecureRandomService</code> returns a <code>Mono</code> publisher, but it is an Impostor Reactive Service!</p>

   <code>return Mono.just(secureRandom.nextInt());
</code>   

<p>The implementation above has logic up front, first the calculation <code>secureRandom.nextInt()</code> and then the assembly.</p>

<p>What is the right way to wrap a blocking call? Make the work happen in another scheduler.</p>

 Encapsulation of Blocking Calls 

<p>Blocking encapsulation needs to happen down into the service, as explained in the <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#faq.wrap-blocking">Reactor documentation</a>. The scheduler assignment must also happen inside the implementation.</p>

<p>Create the class <code>SecureRandomReactiveImpl</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.reactive.service;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Primary;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;
import reactor.core.scheduler.Schedulers;

import java.security.SecureRandom;

@Service
@Primary
public class SecureRandomReactiveImpl implements SecureRandomService {

    private SecureRandom secureRandom;

    public SecureRandomReactiveImpl() {
        secureRandom = new SecureRandom();
    }

    @Override
    public Mono&lt;Integer&gt; getRandomInt() {
        return Mono.fromCallable(secureRandom::nextInt)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.boundedElastic());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the test again and the BlockHound exception should not happen. Avoid the logic up front and assemble the pipeline. Everything should be fine.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s do an end-to-end test. Run the application with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080/random</code> and you should see the Okta sign in page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sign in with your Okta account and you should see a response similar to this:</p>

   <code>{
  "value": "-611020335"
}
</code>

 Interview CFO of Credify MAURIZIO RAFFONE 



<p>With over 20 years of experience in capital markets and international finance, Maurizio Raffone had worked in various leading roles at renowned banks and in different environments including corporates, academics, and start-ups. Thus, he has been witnessing the development of global finance through diverse lenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recognizing such potential of Fintech development, Maurizio Raffone has been taking a role as a Fintech consultant, and now, he is our Chief Financial Officer at Credify. In this interview, we had a discussion with him about the impacts of the pandemic on the global financial market and the opportunities for Fintech’s development in this period. In addition,&nbsp; Maurizio Raffone also shares some lessons that we could learn from developed countries to revive emerging markets.</p>



”..it is truly game-changing, putting the user firmly at the center of all innovation.”



 How does the global financial market react under the impact of COVID-19? 



<p>Global financial markets have been incredibly resilient in the face of the pandemic. Stock markets are solidly up, there has not been any banking crisis and we have seen continued investments in privately-funded companies. This has been mainly thanks to an aggressive monetary policy and fiscal support by many of the leading world economies.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the actions that the global financial market has been taking in order to overcome the COVID recession? 



<p>Leading central banks have been pumping money into their economies for years and as this was about to slow down, COVID hit and their loose monetary policies were extended. I think it is a bit more difficult for emerging economies to match the developed countries’ strategies, however, they indirectly benefit from them too, given developed markets are open for exports and corporates continue their global investments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In my opinion, emerging markets’ governments need to take this opportunity to support the rapid modernization of the regulatory, financial, and technology infrastructure of their countries, in order to implement leaner and more efficient means of economic growth. The key to successfully combating the COVID-induced difficulties is to make it easier to do business for people and companies.</p>







 Please share your opinions on the role of Fintech in recovering and developing developed countries’ financial market during and post COVID-19. 



<p>Fintech firms can play a crucial role in kick-starting the economy and ensuring less privileged people can also improve their economic situation. Access to credit, for example, is fundamental for people and businesses at a time of economic hardship: I believe fintech companies can help by being able to provide support when perhaps some of the traditional financial institutions aren’t willing or capable to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not because fintech companies necessarily take more risks than traditional lenders, but because they generally operate with a much lower cost base and are able to provide more customized services, meaning that their clients can be offered a financial service that they actually afford.</p>



<p>Furthermore, fintech firms have a strong track record in providing very clear solutions to specific problems their clients face and are able to turn an idea into a service fast. I see this characteristic of fintech companies as being particularly useful in this COVID climate as there is a lot of uncertainty over lockdowns, travel bans, and so forth.</p>







 In terms of developing countries, what internal and external factors do you think could support or hinder Fintech development? 



<p>Many emerging economies have not fully embraced fintech from a regulatory perspective, so some of the potential innovation and developments are either taking place in a bit of a grey zone or not at all. I think it is crucial for governments to create a framework where fintech innovation is promoted whilst protecting retail clients/users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in some countries, generally in the more developed economies, financial regulators have launched fintech sandboxes, essentially allowing selected fintech firms to test their solutions and technology, collaborate with established financial institutions, and get limited access to clients. This way, they can evaluate the suitability of their services and the legal and regulatory approach that may be required. These sandboxes not only help the selected fintech firms understand better how to operate their business model but also help regulators learn about new technologies and come up with regulations that can help the introduction of new services and financial products to the market.</p>



 What is your advice for financial and non-financial firms from emerging countries to catch up with Fintech’s development in the future? 



<p>Financial and non-financial firms from emerging countries need to educate themselves with the latest technologies and business models and applications and experiment a little more. It is very natural to feel more defensive at a time of difficult market conditions such as now. However, that’s exactly the time to push on with innovation and bring better solutions to their clients.</p>



 About the CFO 



<p>Maurizio Raffone has more than 20 years of experience in capital markets and international finance with a track record of structuring, trading, originating and selling structured finance transactions.</p>



<p>He worked in leading positions at many large and prestigious banks, namely Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank AG, Bear Stearns &amp; Co., and UniCredit.</p>



<p>Acknowledging the emergence of technology into the financial market and its developing trend in decentralization, Maurizio Raffone has made a major turn to the Fintech industry for the last couple of years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maurizio obtained his master’s degree in Financial Economics from the University of Cambridge, and a first-class honors degree in Economics and Management from Royal Holloway College of the University of London.</p>

Mike Kiser,  Senior Identity Strategist at SailPoint and passionate storyteller, is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4603/1" title="Identity Is the New Blue"> Identity Is the New Blue</a> on Monday, September 13 starting at 6:00 pm. at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Mike some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why use the history of a color as an analogy for identity?  </p>
<p>
Great question. I think as I tend to think about identity and other technology and innovation, what fascinates me most is not even how much the technology works, but how it impacts society, how it impacts culture and the semantic value that that technology has. I was looking at museum artifacts because I'm actually on vacation, as you can see. And I started to notice that there was a lack of blue everywhere I look. And so reading more about the trajectory of blue, it really was an easy analogy there to think about how blue has impacted society over the years. And the growth in its semantic use by the culture and by society at large, and by taking lessons from Blue's narrative path, we can see kind of where identity is and where it may be going and how we want, or don't want it to wind up like the color blue as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How does the rise of the color blue, specifically, parallel identity?   </p>
<p>
Well, blue, as I said was particularly fascinating because in the old days, old, old, really old days, it wasn't really used for technological reasons and for cultural impact reasons as well. And so over time, innovation hit, wave after wave of technological innovation. And along with that, the culture started to appropriate blue. It went from kind of non-existence – not even used to describe the sea like you see behind me. Terms like green or even brown or yellow, believe it or not, were used to paint the sea or to talk about the sea. And then this changed 13 hundreds or so when some innovation hit and it became massively popular among a niche group of people – the wealthy, the affluent – and so what that already showed was that the early adopters had an advantage and the early adopters have had an advantage in identity, as well.</p>
<p>As blue progressed, it became the color of normalcy, kind of a normal color. There weren't a lot of outliers. It was still too new to have a lot of cultural weight. And so it was kind of an open Greenfield for people to inject it with their own meaning. It was a safe color. And so it became from the rich, the affluent and powerful, it transitioned into something more common and more accepted by society because it didn't have any negative earlier connotation. And then finally blue exploded in the last century or two into one of the West's most popular color of all colors of all time. I see identity kind of going through a similar progression, maybe cyclical progression, where it doesn't quite exist in a culture or a subculture, and then innovation and culture work together to foster adoption and to drive new use cases to where ideally in the future, I think identity. And it would benefit everyone in terms of being ubiquitous and not just ubiquitous, but also popular. And so I'm wanting to propose in my talk at the European Identity and Cloud Conference this year, a parallel between the two and then people can come find me and we can argue about it later and discuss it regardless of whether or not you agree with me. It's a great framework for discussing the technology and the cultural impact of something like identity.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is driving the progression of identity today: innovation or cultural significance? </p>
<p>
If you had asked me 5, 10 years ago, I would have said innovation. In part because I was younger, in part because the world was different. I think now it's almost impossible to split apart those two notions – or one drives the other, drives the other. We've seen in the past year how quickly the world can change. You look at the impact of COVID for instance, and COVID mandates, and identity being used to validate who's vaccinated, who's not. What your health status is. These things can turn on a dime. And so I think it's kind of a false question in a way to say, is it one or the other? I think it's an unholy weaving of both together – and one takes the lead and then the other takes the lead. But by knowing that they're equally powerful or can be equally powerful then we can seek to harness that and try and steer the path of identity towards a beneficial, good direction, rather than one that might be more malicious. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What obstacles stand in the way of identity becoming as popular as blue? </p>
<p>
Great question. I think one of the primary obstacles standing in the way of identity continuing its ascendancy and it's move towards popularity is quite frankly, ease of use. The people we're talking about here are not identity professionals, they’re not practitioners, they're not even technologists. Think of someone who you would not think of interacting with identity, and that's the target audience that I'm thinking about or contemplating in terms of identity being popular. For that to work, it's not going to be technology as such that is going to move them to adopt that. I think what it's going to be is something that's natural, part of their daily process, where they don't think about it. And so I think we haven't achieved that yet. And that's one of the main barriers, as opposed to, say, the next wave of innovation or technology. If it's not as easy to use – as a friend of mine says – as a spoon, then we've kind of lost the battle there already.  </p>

<p>IDnow enables an automated identity verification solution for highly regulated use cases, complying with Anti-Money-Laundering-Law in Europe.</p>
<p>IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, is expanding its automated solution AutoIdent for additional highly regulated use cases, including areas regulated by the Anti Money Laundering Act (AML), such as banks and financial service providers.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent is an AML Act compliant identity verification solution that operates as an automated process and meets the high-security requirement. It serves a wide range of industries and use cases, such as onboarding a player for online gaming, opening a bank account, or signing a loan agreement. Taking advantage of a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES), IDnow AutoIdent seamlessly blends state-of-the-art technologies into an easy, secure and fully compliant identity verification process.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent including QES, is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1) d). If the use case requires an even higher level of assurance IDnow AutoIdent including QES could be combined with a bank transfer, turning it into a fully compliant remote onboarding solution in accordance with the German AML Act – Geldwäschegesetz (GwG), under Section §12 sentence 1 Nr 3.</p>
<p>“Our belief in providing an advanced identity verification platform which increases security improves conversion and streamlines our customers’ onboarding process across geographical borders drives us forward. By making our automated solution AML-compliant with additional regulations, our customers can offer a faster process and therefore a better user experience while ensuring high security and regulatory standards. This gives our customers, who operate in a constantly evolving environment, the peace of mind and the flexibility to choose the solution that meets their needs best,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow.</p>
<p>The IDnow platform, which includes AutoIdent as a building block, effortlessly orchestrates all necessary components into a seamless, secure and AML-compliant identity verification.</p>
<p>Depending on the customer’s needs, the onboarding process offers total flexibility. Further components of the IDnow platform can added, e.g., eSign, the add-on for the digital contract signing opening up additional use cases such as taking out a consumer loan in a wholly digital process.</p>
<p>In recent years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 800 customers worldwide. In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader for identity technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German identity Trust Management AG, enabling IDnow to offer its customers one of the broadest identification solutions through a single, integrated platform.</p>

<p>Summary: We explore how to issue credentials using secure messaging.</p><p>At MATTR, we’ve pioneered a way to request and receive credentials using <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-oidc-credential-provider-7845391a9881">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a> capability.</p><p>However, if you already have a robust mechanism in place to authenticate users, then setting up additional OIDC capability is unnecessary. Sending credentials using secure Decentralized Identifier (DID) messaging or directly with a QR code is a safe, convenient alternative. In this article, we’ll explore this alternative method in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>The MATTR mobile wallet supports two main channels for issuing a credential:</p>  OpenID Credential Provider  Secure DID messaging  <p>Note: We’re building DID messaging on the JOSE stack to facilitate signing and encryption.</p><p>OpenID Credential Provider</p><p>If you haven’t yet authenticated a user, using OpenID Credential Provider offers a secure way to authenticate a user at the point of credential creation. It involves setting up and configuring an OpenID Provider to work alongside the MATTR VII OIDC Bridge Extension — simple if you’re already using OIDC infrastructure, but more complex to set up from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Secure DID messaging</p><p>If you’ve already authenticated a user through another method, issuing a credential through a secure DID message is a reliable alternative to OIDC. This approach works well if you’re authenticating users through a website login or even in person (like a classroom or training&nbsp;centre).</p><p>Let’s see how this might work in practice.</p><p>1. Authentication</p><p>Before issuing a credential, you need to authenticate the user. The most common way to do this is having a user login to a session on your&nbsp;website.</p><p>2. Linking</p><p>Now that you’ve authenticated the user, you need to link their DID to the session of the user. This DID will be generated by the wallet they are using to hold the credential. You can obtain it in a few different ways:</p>  If the user already has a credential you’ve issued, and you trust they are still in control of the subject DID in the credential, you can create a new credential based off the DID inside the credential.  If the user needs to link their DID from their mobile wallet, you can use a <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/dids/did-auth-oidc">DID Auth</a> flow to make sure you’re obtaining a validated DID that the user can prove they&nbsp;own.  If you needed to verify credential data from the user as part of the transaction anyway, you’ll need to use the Holder DID from the Verifiable Presentation as the determining DID.  <p>For very simple use cases like demo and testing, if a user has the MATTR mobile wallet they can use a Public DID — they can simply copy the DID and pass it to you out-of-band.</p><p>3. Constructing the credential and&nbsp;message</p><p>Now that the DID is ‘known’ and we’ve authenticated the user, a Verifiable Credential is <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/issue-basic">created</a> using the MATTR VII platform. This credential is then packaged into a secure DID message format to be delivered to the recipient. Because the subject DID is known, the DID message can be encrypted to ensure the data is safe in transit. Use the <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/api-reference/v1.0.1#operation/encryptMessage">messaging endpoints</a> to easily perform this&nbsp;step.</p><p>4. Delivery</p><p>The MATTR mobile wallet can read DID messages in either a secure DID message, QR code or deep-link.</p><p>Sending a secure DID message is an easy way to push messages to mobile wallet holders.

611 Million Dollars Was Stolen Today In The Largest DeFi Hack In Cryptocurrency History<p>Introduction: What Is&nbsp;DeFi?</p><p>Decentralized finance, otherwise known as DeFi, has revolutionized the paradigm of traditional finance as we know it. But what is decentralized finance, and how has it impacted the way monetary instruments operate? Decentralized finance is, in essence, an umbrella term that consolidates cryptocurrency or blockchain applications geared towards disrupting traditional financial intermediaries. Centralized financial intermediaries are non-existent in the world of DeFi and non-custodial applications are the embodiment of how DeFi operates. Such intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges or banks are traditional financial entities that operate as an intermediary, enabling your finances to be at the mercy of organizations other than yourself; although this maybe enticing, many individual’s wish to have complete autonomy and control over their own finances.</p><p>DeFi utilizes smart contract technology, such as Ethereum to allow individuals to borrow, lend, speculate on the price of securities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, real estate etc. and earn interest at rates unheard of in your traditional savings account. Decentralized finance is no longer exclusive to Ethereum; many blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Aergo, ICON, Vechain (and many more) have conceived of their own blockchain applications dedicated to decentralized finance.</p><p>DeFi Exposure: Are Your Coins At&nbsp;Risk?</p>This Chart Above Analyzes How, In Accordance To How Fast DeFi Has Taken Off, The Amount Of Hacks That Have Occurred Coinciding With It: Notice, Todays Hack Hasn’t Been&nbsp;Included<p>As DeFi has risen as a dominant force in the blockchain space, hackers and malevolent entities have capitalized on such a paradigm and over the course of the last two years (including Tuesday’s attack), DeFi hackers have effectively stolen over 1 billion dollars since 2020. Put that into perspective, one billion dollars in less than two years has been stolen by numerous investors and that could be you if you ignore the risks of not securing your cryptocurrency assets. Just because a DeFi application has been audited, doesn’t mean that it can’t be hacked; this is an unfortunate truth within the web of blockchain technological applications, especially ones in their infancy. It is important to highlight the numerous attacks that have occurred in 2021 alone to garner perspective on how much of a risk you can be in if you don’t take necessary precautions.</p><p>In February 2021, DeFi platform Yearn Finance had a flash loan attack; as Yearn Finance is one of the largest aggregators in the space, this comes as no surprise. Being one of the largest aggregators in the space, this allowed hackers to siphon 11 million dollars worth of users funds from the Dai Vault through a smart contract exploitation. This allowed the hackers to garner approximately 2.7 million dollars in profit after having to spend over 8 million dollars in fees. The hackers were able to successfully attack the platform by exploiting the flash loan feature on Yearn Finance, which arbitraged from other DeFi platforms within the blockchain sphere. Not only did Yearn Finance suffer an exploitation, but Alpha Homora’s Iron Bank Exploit also occurred during the same month because of their very own flash loan feature as well. This time, the protocol lost a whopping 37 million dollars. The hackers borrowed millions of stablecoins from Cream Finance’s IronBank, doubling their loans after every succeeding one. It is evident that these hacks are a result from smart contract exploits, which many thought were indominable. Fast forward to March and we saw the Meerkat Finance Exploit which was a yield farming protocol on the Binance Smart Chain which was reported being hacked one day after it went live resulting in approximately 73,000 BNB being lost (approximately 13 million dollars). Paid Network had an infinite mint attack where the hackers resulted in 180 million dollars being lost by minting PAID tokens causing massive inflation, sending its value down 85% within a few hours. Easy Fi, another DeFi platform on Polygon, was hacked for 75 million dollars and the team had to initiate a hard fork to recover most of the lost funds. These are just a FEW DeFi hacks that have occurred in 2021 alone, and many more have been reported (like the one that happened today, the largest in DeFi history). Many investors have also suffered from DeFi rug pulls since the inception of decentralized finance, but what exactly is a rug&nbsp;pull?</p>The Infamous Rug Pull: A Dominant Malevolent Action In&nbsp;DeFi<p>Imagine a rug being pulled from under you, you fall and possibly fail to get back up, think as this as a synonymous notion towards your cryptocurrency finances resulting from rug pulls. A rug pull is an event where a protocol token is launched on a decentralized exchange such as Pancake or Uniswap and paired with a prominent cryptocurrency asset such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. Liquidity providers known as yield farmers are then actively pursued by anonymous hackers and social media magnets that promise absurd Annual Percentage Yields. Smart contracts, unfortunately being able to be exploited, once they have enough funds locked into the smart contract, the developer, who has complete authority and control over the operation of the smart contract, withdraws all the funds from the liquidity pools and disappears with the&nbsp;funds.</p><p>611 Million In Cryptocurrency Stolen: The Great DeFi Hack: Tuesday, August 10th,&nbsp;2021</p>The Biggest DeFi Hack In History Occurred Today: But Why, And&nbsp;How?<p>Today, over 611 million dollars was stolen in a massive hack that will go down as the largest DeFi hack in blockchain history up until this point in time. This hack, reporting over 600 million dollars in losses, outweighs all the DeFi hacks from February-April combined! But how did this happen and why? It started with Poly Network, a network dedicated to swapping cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Poly Network was attacked on three different chains, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon and were transferred to the hacker’s addresses. Poly Network swaps tokens across different blockchains, which include Ethereum, Ontology, Binance and Polygon. Based on the statement created by Poly Network, over 273 million dollars in Ethereum assets were taken, 253 million dollars in Binance Smart Chain assets and 85 million in USDC. The hack was so massive that Tether, a controversial stablecoin, even got involved and freezed 33 million dollars worth of the coin to prevent further exploitation. The hack, forced O3, a trading pool that utilizes the Poly Network to trade tokens on different blockchains, to cease functionality, disrupting the cross-chain interoperability that was created on the Poly Network. This hack wasn’t a result of a rug-pull, but of an issue with cryptography which enabled the hacker to take these funds. This hack is eerily similar to the AnySwap attack, which resulted in 7.9 million stolen in July because the hacker was able to exploit the private key. This quote creates perspective on how incumbent it is to secure your coins “just eight month into 2021, more DeFi hacks and exploits have occurred than throughout the years 2020 and 2019.” As DeFi, blockchain and cryptocurrency markets expand, so will malevolent entities, and crimes will rise as a result which is why we must stay vigilant.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425073987164381196">@PolyNetwork2</a></p></blockquote><p>How To Secure Your Coins From DeFi&nbsp;Exploits</p>Protect Your Coins From Exploitation Or Face The Consequences!<p>While DeFi protocols have initiated rapid innovation and transformation of traditional and blockchain finance, their is numerous rooms for error and exploitation. It is incumbent that you, the investor, understand the risks and consequences thereof of participating in decentralized finance applications. The first and obvious method of securing your cryptocurrency assets is to get a hardware wallet. Whether your coins are on an exchange or within a DeFi protocol, I’m sorry to say, they’re not your coins. Hardware wallets negate the risk of your coins being exposed as they store your cryptocurrency assets&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Such cryptocurrency wallets such as Trezor run on open source coding, which many argue makes them more secure because open source codes are consistently watching for vulnerabilities and being open source makes it impossible for any entity to open up a “back-door.” The Ledger is also another hardware wallet that is fantastic for security, however, their database was breached in 2020, which was irresponsible and absurdly ridiculous; you would think a secure digital asset wallet company would know better to not keep customers information on their databases. My advice to you as an investor, is to never use your real name when buying these hardware wallets, make sure you’re buying them from the real Trezor or Ledger website, don’t have it mailed to your house and use a fake burner email address. Consistently keep your keys stored offline and never stored on your computer or cell-phone, never trust, always verify websites and never vaunt your cryptocurrency holdings on social media (we all have egos, but they can be a detriment to your finances and mental health). There are also some DeFi protocols that offer insurance risks in case of a smart contract vulnerability or hack (think of this as if your money was in an FDIC insured bank account but your bank goes under, your funds will still be safe). In short, keep your private keys safe, offline and buy a hardware wallet and be wary of any DeFi protocols that have been previously hacked.</p><p>Conclusion: DeFi, A Massive Innovation With Unfortunate Risks</p>All Innovations Are Accompanied By Risks: As DeFi Grows, So Will Hacks: Secure Yourself!<p>This article was not meant to bash or to create a negative perspective on DeFi: decentralized finance is a massive innovation within the web of blockchain and the financial paradigm as a whole. But with any innovation comes massive risks, and it is incumbent that investors are aware of such risks when participating in these activities. Always remember, not your keys, not your&nbsp;coins!</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>At Onfido we’re continually innovating and thinking about how we can improve important things like our communication, customer experience, processes and services. After all, one of our core values is ‘find a better way’ and Onfidoers practice this in their daily work. When Patrick Cahill from the Onfido legal team attended an Onfido University session ‘Introduction to Design Thinking’, hosted by the fantastic design team, it sparked a discussion about how in the legal team we could learn from this approach and adopt it in different ways in our interactions with customers, Onfidoers and external lawyers (to name a&nbsp;few).</p><p>Queue the fantastic Adam Bradley from the design team, who put his hand up to help turn legal minds upside down and facilitated replacing wigs and gowns with post it notes and sharpies! Adam worked with Patrick in developing and facilitating a series of workshops which explored legal design thinking. Legal design isn’t a new concept and there’s even a fab <a href="https://www.legalgeek.co/legaldesign/">Legal Geek conference</a> where you can learn more about it. Margaret Hagan from Stanford Law School’s Legal Design Lab <a href="https://www.legalgeek.co/learn/legal-design-wtf/">summarises legal design</a> really&nbsp;well.</p><p>“Legal Design is an innovation approach — that means focusing on the humans within the legal system to understand where the crucial breakdowns in the system right now exist — and to make the creative leap to define what a better system might&nbsp;be.</p><p>It means a priority on who the ‘users’ of the system are — whether it be people who are ‘lay’ outsiders trying to use it to solve problems, or the ‘professionals’ who work inside it. A legal design approach has us talk to these people, observe them, co-create with them, and test with them — so that we can make a system that actually solves problems, and does so in the most usable, useful, and engaging way possible.</p><p>A legal design approach can help us create small changes to huge overhauls. You can use it to make better documents, products, services, organisations, or policies. It is about using creative, human-centered strategies to find better ways forward, to serve people&nbsp;better.”</p><p>With Adam’s help and guidance, the first step was to figure out how we’d facilitate the workshops and what areas the workshops should cover. Planning was key for this step and using <a href="https://miro.com/">miro</a>, we identified objectives and outcomes for the team and created a structure of how to achieve those outcomes. As design thinking was a relatively new concept for the team, we kicked off with a 101 in design thinking approach, so the legal team were armed with the right tools, encouraged to put aside any preconceptions and prejudices and to come to the workshops with a user centred problem solving&nbsp;mindset.</p>A screen grab of part of the miro board that we worked&nbsp;on<p>The following workshop focused specifically on who the users of Onfido’s legal terms: (i) who they were, taking a broad brush approach beyond the obvious users (characteristics and expertise); (ii) the context in which they engage with legal terms; (iii) what they hope to achieve in using the legal terms; and (iv) potential challenges they face when using the legal terms. From distilling this information, in our next workshop we moved onto reviewing some of the problems that we wanted to solve for each of our users. For example, receiving lots of redline and that the context/background of a clause may not be&nbsp;clear.</p><p>Our last workshop looked at solution ideation and we were encouraged by Adam to think outside of the box and come up with ideas that pushed boundaries. There was definitely no right or wrong answer at this stage of the process. Taking the problems above, we looked at potential solutions such as providing an explanation of each clause to external lawyers, adopting a pre-contract intake form and doing more internal education to our Growth team to foster a deeper understanding of contract positions.</p><p>The workshops were hugely beneficial to the legal team and we’ve now got lots of ideas and insights in how to solve some of the problems that our users face. Having an awareness and understanding of design led thinking also means that we’ll continue to view problems through a user-centred lens and continue to collaborate cross functionally to improve and iterate on the service and systems we provide as a legal team, pushing boundaries and innovating as we grow with our wig, gowns, post it notes and sharpies.</p><p>If you’re interested in finding out more about our experience and legal design thinking, please feel free to reach&nbsp;out.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-cahill-23865461/">Patrick Cahill</a> is Legal Counsel at Onfido and a Visiting Fellow at the Centre for Commercial Law Studies,&nbsp;QMUL.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adambradleyuxr/">Adam Bradley</a> is UX Researcher at&nbsp;Onfido.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/onfidos-legal-design-journey-7b950950af2e">Onfido’s Legal Design Journey</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Automated Vending Technology Showcased in Black Fire Innovation’s Living Lab</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO and LAS VEGAS (August 11, 2021) — <a href="https://www.civic.com/">Civic Technologies</a>, a leading innovator in digital identity solutions, and Black Fire Innovation, the hospitality technology hub created by Caesars Entertainment, Inc., and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), today announced that a vending machine using Age Verification by Civic will be serving up an assortment of non-alcoholic beverages to Black Fire’s tenants. The technology is based on Identity.com’s open source identity verification ecosystem.</p>



<p>Designed specifically to dispense beer, canned wine and similar age-restricted beverages, the vending machine being piloted at Black Fire is filled with sparkling water, energy drinks and canned espresso for demonstrative purposes only.</p>



<p>The vending machine is housed in Black Fire to demonstrate the importance and utility of private identity verification to the top innovators who work in Black Fire’s concept-testing lab.</p>



<p>“Now, we’re finding new ways to assist the hospitality industry within Black Fire, the home of disruptive innovations. By making digital identity verification easy — without sacrificing privacy — Civic offers forward-looking technology that will help foster more breakthroughs across gaming and entertainment,” said Robert Rippee, Executive Director of UNLV’s Black Fire Innovation Hub.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make an age-restricted purchase at the vending machine, a user simply signs up for Civic Wallet and is authenticated as a real person. Civic verifies the user’s age at the vending machine using Identity.com’s open-source identity verification ecosystem. Users have more control over their personal information and the ability to purchase age-restricted products anonymously.</p>



<p>“We’re delighted that our groundbreaking identity-verification vending machine has found a new home in Black Fire Innovation’s Living Lab,” said Vinny Lingham, CEO and co-founder of Civic. “We’re proud to bring automated age verification technology to innovation leaders in the gaming, hospitality and entertainment industries.”</p>



<p>A vending machine selling age-restricted products, including beer, is just one application of private identity verification. Other real-world opportunities for identity verification technology abound, especially when it comes to enhancing the entire customer experience — both online and offline — including opportunities for product enhancement across vendors and properties without collecting any personal data. Civic and Black Fire Innovation are confident that this collaboration will lead to new customer insights and better casino rewards programs. Vending machines with Age Verification by Civic are currently in use around the United States in partnership with a large vending partner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Anonyome Labs, our solutions help mitigate violence and abuse that is&nbsp;tech-facilitated&nbsp;(via a computer, device or app). We empower people to be able to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. We provide survivors and those at risk of harassment, violence and abuse, real and effective tools for protecting their personal information.</p>



<p>In May 2020, we proudly became a partner of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/anonyome-labs-joins-global-fight-against-stalkerware/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>,&nbsp;a global working group uniting advocacy groups, software developers, security firms, victims and survivors, in the fight to protect consumers against stalkerware and to eliminate abusive technology and software.</p>



<p>We are also growing our own safety initiative, known as Sudo Safe.&nbsp;Through Sudo Safe, we partner with organizations that promote safe use of the Internet as well as those organizations that support at-risk people who may have a specific need for privacy and security in their life.&nbsp;Our goal is to support at-risk users, and to be a privacy resource for organizations supporting their members.</p>



<p>Sudo Safe encourages the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, to help people keep their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;private.&nbsp;MySudo enables people to communicate and interact with other people and services without using their own information such as personal phone number, email address and credit card, which mitigates the risk of that information being used for tracking or stalking.</p>



<p>See how an&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/why-i-use-mysudo-as%e2%80%afan%e2%80%afeducator/">educator uses MySudo</a>&nbsp;to privately and safely communicate with students and their families.</p>



<p>Remember, MySudo helps disconnect a user’s online accounts and activity from their private information, such as personal phone number and email address, which mitigates the risk of that information being used for tracking or stalking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can explore MySudo through our 90 second&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">explainer video</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/06/8-strong-privacy-and-security-features-youll-find-in-mysudo/">Here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/all-the-privacy-features-packed-into-mysudo-app/">here</a>&nbsp;we also explain all the privacy and safety features in the app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Traditional credit scoring is a lagging indicator of financial health 
 Credit scores do not follow individuals across borders 
 62 million Americans have a thin credit file or are credit invisible 
 Millennials are lagging behind other generations in building credit 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed problems with traditional credit scoring

<p>Open banking data augments the foundation of credit histories and credit scores by providing real-time insights into cash flow, stable income and the actual room in someone’s monthly budget to afford a loan or a new purchase.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans have thin credit files meaning they don’t have enough data in the credit bureaus to even create a score. By looking at data from their bank account, lenders can determine if they are able to to pay back a loan based on income and expenses, not the lack of data.</p>
<p>Above all, consumer-permissioned data helps to empower consumers with control over their data, access to better financial products and a simple way to connect with fintech apps or financial services.</p>

<p>UPDATE, 19 August 2021:<br>We have made two updates to the Token Metrics document, originally published on 11 August&nbsp;2021:</p>  Page 1: Initial circulating supply: 34 million (revised from 32.5&nbsp;million)  Page 2: Composition of crowdloan reserve is now divided between the two categories “Unvested and unlocked” and “Vested linearly over 6&nbsp;months”.  <p>_________________________________________________________________</p><p>It’s exciting times for KILT as we get closer to <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-plans-for-crowdloan-coins-reserved-to-thank-community-3ed48ab3a63d">crowdloan</a> and mainnet launch on KILT’s continuous path to decentralisation. In addition to building and auditing our technology, we have been fine-tuning our token economy in order to incentivise functionalities in the network, while simultaneously aiming to avoid the pitfalls of high inflation.</p><p>We are delighted to present our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf">updated token metrics</a> to you, the KILT community. These tokenomics are revised from KILT’s initial framework.</p><p>The KILT Coin is critical to operating KILT; it is needed to perform credential verification transactions on KILT’s blockchain and also powers governance. There will be a limited supply of KILT Coins that are gradually introduced into the system over&nbsp;time.</p> Key Metrics   Total supply at Token Generation Event (TGE): 150 million pre-minted KILT&nbsp;Coins.  Initial circulating supply: 32.5&nbsp;million.  The remaining pre-minted coins will be gradually unlocked over a period of 6 to 60&nbsp;months.  Initial inflation will be around 5% per annum, dropping to 1% per annum within the first 6 years and then slowly moving towards&nbsp;0%.  There would be only one KILT network and one KILT Coin, regardless of whether KILT moves from Kusama to a Polkadot parachain, as determined by community governance.  <p>And it’s important to remember that <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilts-parachain-plans-an-update-efb9a9e35394">KILT’s parachain will launch</a> with significant activated functionality — staking for collators and delegators, and the initial token economy outlined in our tokenomics document. This means the first phase of staking will be possible on KILT from&nbsp;genesis.</p> Migration of KILT from Kusama to Polkadot Parachain <p>The tokenomics is designed to reward the KILT Treasury with 10 million KILT Coins linearly over the first five years. In the future, governance may decide to exchange these accumulated KILT Coins for DOT and use them to bid for a Polkadot parachain slot.</p><p>If KILT moves from Kusama to Polkadot, we assume that governance would transfer the existing KILT Coins without changing the balances or owners of these KILT Coins, and without changing the metrics and economics.</p><p>We hope the community finds this tokenomics update useful. By carefully designing the framework for the KILT system, we aim to enable a new economy around the KILT&nbsp;Coin.</p><p>Finally, we want to thank our builders and partners for supporting KILT’s mission of restoring digital identity and dignity to the individual.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-token-economy-an-update-db207611f5ce">KILT Token Economy: An Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Hello Monethians! We’ve are hard at work accomplishing the goals set in Monetha’s Roadmap for 2021. These past months proved to be fruitful and we would like to share with you what has been achieved since we last spoke. So, let’s get into&nbsp;it.</p> Validation of the&nbsp;concept <p>Our main goal for H1 2021 was to validate the concept of the Monetha Identity and make sure that it is valuable both for businesses and consumers. As stated in the roadmap, we aimed to fulfill three main objectives:</p>  Onboard advisors,  Determine data points with high value for businesses,  Engage early adopters from eCommerce businesses.  <p>We have been working closely with several eCommerce shops from the United Kingdom and Baltic states, testing our ideas and assumptions under real-life conditions to find out what value zero-party and first-party data can bring and what exactly it should be to have the best&nbsp;effect.</p><p>As a result, we have shaped a solid basis to the B2B side of the Monetha Identity platform. Its value goes far beyond simply bringing businesses zero-party data from Monetha Identity users. Instead, it aims to bring businesses ready-to-use marketing insights based on all data they have. The solution enriches first-party data that businesses already have with Monetha’s zero-party data and analyzes it as a whole using machine learning algorithms.</p><p>We also have onboarded affiliate and loyalty program advisors from Italy, Spain, France and Poland. They will be handling regional markets and validating our product-market fit&nbsp;there.</p> Monetha Identity application <p>The team is currently focused on the analytical part of the solution, i.e., turning raw data into valuable insights while keeping it in accordance with GDPR and other privacy acts. All development works on the improved MVP are going to begin in September.</p><p>Starting from October, a new Product Director of Monetha Identity with vast experience in eCommerce loyalty will join Monetha. He will be leading the development of the consumer part of the solution and, among other things, help to design the most effective utilization of MTH token within the whole ecosystem.</p><p>The Monetha team thanks you for your continued support and we can’t wait to share more news with you when they will be ready for a public announcement. In the meantime, you can reach us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Monetha.io">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Monetha_io">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Monetha/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://t.me/monethagroup">Telegram</a>. Until next&nbsp;time!</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/community-update-august-2021/">https://www.monetha.io</a> on August 11,&nbsp;2021.</p>

<p>IDnow enables an automated identity verification solution for highly regulated use cases, complying with Anti-Money-Laundering-Law in Europe, including Germany.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, August 12th, 2021, IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, is expanding its automated solution AutoIdent for additional highly regulated use cases, including areas regulated by the Anti Money Laundering Act (AML/GwG), such as banks and financial service providers.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent is an AML Act compliant identity verification solution that operates as an automated process and meets the high-security requirement. It serves a wide range of industries and use cases, such as opening a bank account, signing a loan agreement, or onboarding a player for online gaming. Taking advantage of a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) and existing online bank accounts of the user, it seamlessly blends state-of-the-art technologies with existing identity and banking data into an easy, secure and fully compliant identity verification process.</p>
<p>IDnow AutoIdent including QES, is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1) d). The process can include a one-cent-bank transfer, turning it into a fully compliant remote onboarding solution in accordance with the German AML Act – Geldwäschegesetz (GwG), under Section §12 sentence 1 Nr 3. According to the AML law, automated identity proofing in connection with a reference transaction is permitted, pursuant to Article 32 eIDAS.</p>
<p>“Our belief in providing an advanced identity verification platform which increases security improves conversion and streamlines our customers’ onboarding process across geographical borders drives us forward. By making our automated solution AML-compliant with additional regulations, our customers can offer a faster process and therefore a better user experience while ensuring high security and regulatory standards. This gives our customers, who operate in a constantly evolving environment, the peace of mind and the flexibility to choose the solution that meets their needs best,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow.</p>
<p>The IDnow platform, which includes AutoIdent as a building block, effortlessly orchestrates all necessary components into a seamless, secure and AML-compliant identity verification.</p>
<p>Depending on the customer’s needs, the onboarding process offers total flexibility. Further components of the IDnow platform can added, e.g., eSign, the add-on for the digital contract signing opening up additional use cases such as taking out a consumer loan in a wholly digital process.</p>
<p>In recent years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 800 customers worldwide. In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader for identity technology, ARIADNEXT, and the German identity Trust Management AG, enabling IDnow to offer its customers one of the broadest identification solutions through a single, integrated platform.</p>

				  Jointly-developed LAVCE platform solves the problems of privacy and security for sharing sensitive health data, such as COVID tests and vaccine records.   
			  
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, August 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ — Indico, the leading developer of decentralized identity blockchain networks and software, in a partnership with Liquid Avatar Technologies, a publicly listed, global blockchain, digital identity and fintech solutions company and Vector Laboratories (“Vector Labs”), an Ontario, Canada licensed laboratory healthcare verification organization , have launched the first Canadian blockchain-based decentralized identity solution for issuing and verifying COVID test results. </p>
<p>Supported by Indicio’s credential exchange tools, the Liquid Avatar Verifiable Credential Ecosystem (LAVCE) enables people to receive a digital credential from Vector Labs confirming their COVID test result. This can be verified when it is presented without an individual having to share any private, personal data or be tracked. LAVCE can be integrated with healthcare facilities, testing labs, government agencies, schools,  sports arenas, transportation, trade shows, and workplaces to confirm health status and assist efforts to reduce new outbreaks. It combines a mobile app from Liquid Avatar for individuals, a SaaS model platform for healthcare issues, and a software development kit (SDK) that can power mobile apps, corporate portals, and government websites. This approach makes it possible for all types of organizations to support digital wallets and verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>“Liquid Avatar Technologies shares Indicio’s vision—the world needs technology that works for people by delivering real privacy and security,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “When we launched the Indicio Network, we saw the need for a space for innovative companies to collaborate on changing how we manage identity, enable verification, and create trust. Our partnership with Liquid Avatar Technologies, one of many, shows what can happen when innovators solve pressing problems with ground-breaking technology.”</p>
<p>Both Indicio and Liquid Avatar are steering committee members of the Linux Foundation Public Health’s Cardea project, designed to provide public health agencies around the world with open source interoperable privacy-preserving technology to manage COVID testing and vaccination. The LAVCE credential also aligns with the Global COVID Credential Network and the Good Health Pass Collaborative.</p>
<p>“LAVCE is leading the market for interoperable, privacy-preserving identity that provides a flexible yet uniform approach to revealing health and other verifications when necessary” said David Lucatch, CEO. “Privacy and security of personal data is essential to a ‘return to normal’ and a host of other activities.  Having a patchwork of systems can quickly get out of hand. Supported by the expertise of Indicio, LAVCE makes it quick and easy to handle test data and other verifiable credentials in a way that earns people’s trust, keeps them safe, and helps open up society.”</p>
<p>Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. is a minority equity holder in Indicio.tech</p>

Before we dive into explaining this amazing opportunity, we don’t want to waste your time. So,&nbsp;if you don’t have Australian&nbsp;citizenship or&nbsp;permanent residency,&nbsp;or if you are representing a&nbsp;recruitment agency or an&nbsp;offshore/provider, then this&nbsp;is not for you. We understand you may be an awesome candidate, or have access to great candidates, but we will not consider such applications at this time.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Lead&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;team, where you can contribute to the success of our product team developing our globally awarded personal data platform. The Meeco platform is comprised of suite of products including a decentralised wallet, key management store, exchange for identity, credentials &amp; tokens and secure data enclave (vault).




 




At Meeco we build the tools to enable people and organisation to access, protect and create mutual value from personal data. We are personal data pioneers offering a range solutions powered by Meeco and decentralised on Hedera Hashgraph.




 




We are passionate about building a new digital economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, for the benefit of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organisations enter a relationship of mutual value and build a new, more meaningful way to personalise digital services. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more about our thinking and the vision that drives us.




 




We have built a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia, Belgium and the UK. Collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, and each bring a unique personal data story that advances our mission.




 About the role 





 




We are a global team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK. The platform team currently consists of 17, responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and documenting several services that, all together, form the backbone of our platform.




 




Currently our technology stack consists mainly of several Ruby on Rails, Elixir and Java components for the backend services. For frontend, we primarily use Javascript and Dart for smartphone and decentralised applications, based upon blockchain and distributed ledger technology.




 




We’re a company that embraces innovation, so it is likely that our technology stack will continue to evolve and change. We are not averse to adding other technologies if the need arises for specific services.




 




We take pride in building software that is easy to understand, clean, well-structured and properly tested. We have formed our own opinions on how to write good code that are a result of programming for more than two decades. Sometimes, we have even found ourselves going against the popular vote on several topics.




 




• We favour the explicit over the implicit




 




• We treat frameworks as tools and not as an unquestionable authority




 




• We embrace the relational database and its possibilities and as such treat it as a first order citizen.




 




The following will help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 




• Being a technical leader; mentoring, triaging problems, offering a guiding hand




 




• Coming up with a detailed plan on how to approach high-level requirements including tasks and&nbsp;estimations




 




• Supporting the team to allocate and distribute the work according to individual capabilities




 




• Designing and implementing&nbsp;new services&nbsp;with business logic called from&nbsp;existing &amp; new&nbsp;endpoints




 




• Investigating bug reports that inevitably occur, helping a colleague identify problems




 




• Reviewing and approving Pull Requests




 




• Implementing data integrations to&nbsp;enable end-users access public&nbsp;and&nbsp;private&nbsp;data, this might include open banking,&nbsp;social, health, wearable, weather, travel or IoT&nbsp;data




 




• Working&nbsp;with the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;Standards&nbsp;for&nbsp;implementations for distributed ledger&nbsp;implementations including Verifiable Credentials, Distributed Identity including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>




 




• Working on leading-edge payments solutions including micro-payments and tokens




 




• Contributing to a more transparent, open and trust-based personal data eco-system.




 About you 





 




We are looking for someone who has a deep understanding of how to write RESTful resources exposed as APIs, cares about clean code (a lot) and is ready to learn (a lot). It is a big plus if you have experience writing these web-based applications in Ruby on Rails and/or in building decentralized applications in blockchain technologies.




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the center, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical solutions. Google won’t help you as much in this case as it requires a combination of existing tech and emerging solutions. One class of technology that we are exploring and see great potential is in the distributed ledger space. A good understanding and professional experience building decentralised applications or dealing with DLT is a big plus.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most.




 




In addition to established experience as a developer, we expect that you have at least 2+ years experience in steering a team. using an agile methodology, be it scrum or a derivative.




 




You are able to support our executive team (Technology, Product, Design and Commercial Officers) in writing up technical proposals, along with translating Meeco’s technical vision into practical goals that support the commercialisation of our products.




 




The following is our crazy wish-list. It is not necessary that you have all this experience, but the more proven competencies you have will increase your chances of success in the role:




 




• You have taken lead on directing and implementing solutions to complex, unbounded (technical) problems based on limited scope




 




• You have a track record of setting direction for teammates




 




• You know how to take steps in improving the quality of existing and future software




 




• You are comfortable communicating your ideas both verbally as well as written. We love to create diagrams to describe future systems.




 




• You have used more than one programming language to build software, which can&nbsp;of course include&nbsp;hobby&nbsp;and passion&nbsp;projects




 




• We have a soft spot for functional programming, so maybe you have too




 




• We build both&nbsp;backend&nbsp;and frontend&nbsp;applications, so&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;any relevant frontend programming experience, especially with JavaScript, TypeScript and/or Angularjs&nbsp;would be awesome




 




• You have used languages with built-in concurrency models like Go, Erlang, or Elixir




 




• If you have a language you love, tell us about it!




 




• You have a good understanding of what goes on in a RDBMS, especially Postgresql. You are familiar with devops&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Azure&nbsp;would be a bonus.




 




• You know how to use Docker and Kubernetes.




 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have a team to show you the ropes. A good set of solid programming skills, natural leadership and to care about our mission is all you need.




 




You might have a computer science or related degree, or you might not. This is not what we are about. We care about what you know now and how you are improving yourself every day.




 




This is a job where we&nbsp;support&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;However, we do have an office at Stone &amp; Chalk at Docklands in Melbourne. Given the leadership and mentoring aspects of the role,– we would like you to be in the office at least three days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and self directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed. We love you asking for help!




 





 What we offer 




We pay a competitive start-up package based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 What we have achieved 




We are&nbsp;early&nbsp;pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.

 From 2015 to 2021 we have seen an upheaval in crypto regulation. In that time, regulators and supranational organizations, such as the FATF, have begun to set standards and expectations to address financial crime in crypto. As more jurisdictions issue guidance to apply their existing frameworks to the cryptoasset world, one trend has emerged: the manner in which a jurisdiction regula

<p>From 2015 to 2021 we have seen an upheaval in crypto regulation. In that time, regulators and supranational organizations, such as the FATF, have begun to set standards and expectations to address financial crime in crypto. As more jurisdictions issue guidance to apply their existing frameworks to the cryptoasset world, one trend has emerged: the manner in which a jurisdiction regulates cryptoasset products will likely mirror its approach to traditional financial product. Countries with laissez-faire attitudes toward market regulation have, broadly, more quickly accepted cryptoassets than those that enact stronger controls over traditional financial products.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I’ve always been a bit baffled by the enduring popularity of MySQL. I mean, it’s great and we have been using it in many internal projects for years, but what makes it so popular even nowadays, when the competition from other vendors, commercial or open-source, is so strong? And yet, 26 years after the first release, MySQL is still the most popular open-source database in the world, an integral part of every web development stack, the one product you expect to find on every hosting platform, and, of course, in every public cloud.</p>
 MySQL: a database for all applications? 
<p>Developers love MySQL because it’s easy to deploy and operate, the learning curve is extremely low, it implements a “de facto standard” connection interface, and, most importantly, it’s lightweight and fast. Well, at least to a certain extent.</p>
<p>While “vanilla” MySQL is perfectly capable for small- or medium-scale projects, its popularity extends to the enterprise world as well, with companies like Facebook or Siemens operating massive infrastructures with database instances expertly tuned for high performance and availability. Other companies opt for managed offerings offered by cloud service providers – every major CSP has its own database service based on MySQL but augmented with its native services and sometimes with proprietary advanced capabilities.</p>
<p>However, even when highly tuned for the performance of transactional (OLTP) workloads, MySQL just isn’t designed for analytical processing (OLAP), since its database engine simply lacks the necessary functionality. Thus, even the most hardcore MySQL fans must face the necessity of a data movement and integration process with a separate database optimized for analytics. This process is not only time-consuming and expensive but also prone to significant security and compliance risks, especially in a public cloud.</p>
 Same database, but 1000x faster! 
<p>Back in December 2020, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/mysql-analytics-engine-almost-too-good-to-be-true">we have already covered the solution</a> Oracle offers for this problem: the service that at the time was called MySQL Analytics Engine - renamed MySQL HeatWave soon after. Based on the in-memory database technology that the company has perfected over the years in the labs and real-world environments, the service is designed to run alongside an existing managed MySQL database, access its transactional data directly, optimize it for OLAP processing, and execute analytical queries, returning the results as if they were obtained by MySQL database itself.</p>
<p>From the user’s perspective, this works completely transparently, with the additional infrastructure fully managed by Oracle. The only metrics that change for a customer are performance (thousands of times faster than any plain MySQL) and cost (much lower thanks to the software being optimized for low-cost compute, storage, and networking on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure).</p>
<p>Fast forward to August 10th, 2021, and the company has just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUbnOTlJ7mI">announced the next major release</a> of the service with a machine learning-based automation capability called MySQL Autopilot. The unique value remains the same: Oracle Cloud customers can keep their data in the same MySQL database and still easily and efficiently run complex analytical queries against it, without any third-party tools or processes involved. However, the service is now significantly faster than before with the addition of MySQL Autopilot and the new Scale-Out Data Management layer.</p>
 Autopilot is not just for cars 
<p>The new HeatWave release incorporates multiple performance improvements thanks to its AI-based decision logic that uses a combination of automated analysis methods to identify the most efficient data management and query execution parameters, which are continuously optimized even further as the service learns on new queries. HeatWave is designed to tune its ML models separately for each user and can now even predict how the optimization will improve in the future with explainable change recommendations.</p>
<p>Other newly introduced AI-based capabilities include memory usage prediction that helps estimate the required cluster size just from a small sample of existing data; concurrent execution optimization that ensures that short queries are prioritized over the longer ones running in parallel, thus delivering interactive results earlier which is useful for mixed workloads; and significantly improved internal scalability to ensure that reload times remain constant regardless of the data size.</p>
<p>All these optimizations, according to Oracle, lead to the ability of the service to outperform its major competitors by a factor of at least 1400x, while remaining more economical in terms of overall cost than any other managed MySQL service. I’m sure you’ll find many tests and comparisons on Oracle’s website, but for me, the cost factor is not the most important by far.</p>
 Security and compliance benefits 
<p>At KuppingerCole, we focus primarily on the security of database solutions and compliance aspects of storing and processing data in the cloud. The very idea that your data no longer needs to move between data stores with different access models and security controls or that it has to be exposed to a complex and error-prone ETL process has massive security and compliance implications: this dramatically reduces the risks of accidental exposure that leads to data breaches, and, inevitably, to compliance fines. It’s also worth noting that HeatWave now enforces full data encryption, both at rest and in transit – a setting that users cannot deactivate.</p>
<p>In a way, Oracle continues to bridge the gap in functionality between MySQL, its popular open-source product, and the Oracle Database (ODB), the flagship enterprise one. One could argue that everything HeatWave can offer now, ODB already could do years ago. However, the company is making this functionality available to an entirely new audience, ensuring that people can utilize their familiar technology for new business use cases without the need to change anything in their existing applications.</p>
<p>And, of course, by being fully compatible with MySQL-based services offered by competitors (like Amazon Aurora or RDS) at the API level, HeatWave makes it easy for potential customers to migrate to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, while still avoiding the danger of vendor lock-in. After all, MySQL is MySQL on every platform, and if you ever have to move away from Oracle, you’ll face no technical difficulties whatsoever. Well, other than a 1000x performance drop, that is…</p>

A brief history of the infrastructure bill’s crypto controversy <p>Let’s catch up. Last Monday, we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-171-how-crypto-will-be-regulated-in-the-u-s-1185eddf7c6e">chatted about the U.S. infrastructure bill</a>, and how crypto found itself included as a potential source of tax revenue to help fund some of the stuff we’d like to build in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>That in and of itself is not necessarily contentious. The issue was around the use of the term “broker” and how it was too broadly defined such that anyone — developers, node operators, users might all be lumped under the umbrella of “broker.”</p><p>Around the time that I published last week’s newsletter, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-cryptocurrency.html">last minute concessions</a> pushed by the crypto industry and its lobbyists had just made its way into the bill. It seemed like that may have been the end of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Instead, a “fierce lobbying war” ensued as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the Biden administration <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/06/crypto-bitcoin-infrastructure-senate/">fought the&nbsp;changes</a>.</p><p>And so — lines were drawn and key players emerged. Because crypto is apparently <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/09/cryptocurrency-influence-washington-infrastructure-fight-502792">a really big&nbsp;deal</a>:</p><blockquote>“This has definitely been a wake-up call to crypto,” said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbying group. “But on the flip side, I think Washington is starting to see that crypto is more of a force than anybody ever anticipated.”</blockquote><p>Jake Chervinksy has <a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1423653975459516416">a great tweetstorm explainer of the ongoing battles and warring factions</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a>) — Senators Wyden, Lummis, and Toomey on the side of crypto, Senators Portman and Warner on the other, and Yellen and the Biden administration looking nervously on.</p><p>But as of Sunday night, no agreement had been&nbsp;reached.</p> 2. An overview of Team&nbsp;Wyden <p>From <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/09/cryptocurrency-influence-washington-infrastructure-fight-502792">Politico</a>:</p><blockquote>Lobbyists scored a clear victory by winning over Wyden, the top Senate Democrat responsible for writing tax legislation. Wyden, who has served in Congress for four decades, has long had a soft spot for emerging technologies.</blockquote><blockquote>His Democratic predecessor at the helm of the Finance Committee, Max Baucus of Montana, was hired earlier this year as an adviser to the digital currency exchange&nbsp;Binance.</blockquote><blockquote>Wyden teamed up with Toomey and Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) to offer an amendment to scale back the tax reporting rules so they would not capture software developers and miners. The proposal put Wyden at odds with the White House and fellow Democrats. In response, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), in cooperation with the Biden administration, came up with an alternative amendment that would have fewer exclusions.</blockquote><blockquote>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen personally spoke with Wyden to push back against his amendment, an administration official said. She and the White House believed his language would tie Treasury’s hands when it came time to develop regulations spelling out the details of how the rules would&nbsp;work.</blockquote><blockquote>“Crypto’s success with Wyden is one of the most fascinating D.C. influence developments of 2021, and one I suspect other industries will be studying throughout the rest of the decade,” said Jeff Hauser, who tracks corporate lobbying as executive director of the Revolving Door&nbsp;Project.</blockquote><blockquote>Wyden said in a statement that he has spent his career “working from the proposition that Congress needs smart answers to tech policy that actually improve people’s&nbsp;lives.”</blockquote><blockquote>“When civil rights groups, tech experts and folks in Oregon raised concerns that this provision could be interpreted to regulate independent developers and force programmers to create government backdoors, I took their concerns seriously,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote> 3. The Toomey-Warner-Lummis-Sinema-Portman amendment <p>And then Monday afternoon, <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/minority/toomey-warner-lummis-sinema-portman-announce-agreement-on-digital-asset-reporting-requirements-in-infrastructure-bill">a compromise emerged between the two factions</a>:</p><blockquote>“There’s broad agreement that digital asset exchanges behaving as brokers should be required to report transactions just like other kinds of brokers already do. There is also concern that tax evasion and non-compliance are becoming significant issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Some have expressed confusion concerning the underlying text of the infrastructure bill, suggesting it would result in the application of reporting requirements far too broadly and ensnare individuals, developers, and other elements of this ecosystem that could not comply with a reporting mandate.</blockquote><blockquote>“We’ve worked with the Treasury Department to clarify the underlying text and ensure that those who are not acting as brokers will not be subject to the bill’s reporting requirements. While we each would have drafted this solution differently, we all agree it’s important to ensure that these obligations are properly crafted to apply only to entities that are regularly effectuating transactions of digital assets in exchange for consideration. To best memorialize this common understanding, we propose to incorporate this important amendment into the infrastructure bill and urge our colleagues to join us in enacting this bipartisan clarification.”</blockquote><p>At the time of this writing, the Senators are on the floor requesting unanimous consent on adoption of the Toomey-Warner-Lummis-Sinema-Portman amendment. <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1424758804667895817">Jerry Brito’s tweetstorm on the compromise amendment</a> is worth checking&nbsp;out.</p><p>But it appears that Senator Ricahrd Shelby (R-AL) objected to the compromise (for apparently unrelated reasons). <a href="https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1424830138995417096">According to Chervinsky</a>, the compromise amendment is already&nbsp;dead.</p><p>Two possible outcomes?

What Gary Gensler and the SEC is up&nbsp;to Photo: Third Wave Think&nbsp;Tank<p>The new SEC chief <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03">spoke at Aspen last week</a>. First, he’s on the same page as Jay Clayton on the topic of&nbsp;ICOs.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-chair-gensler-agrees-with-predecessor-every-ico-is-a-security">They’re all securities</a>:</p><blockquote>“Generally, folks buying these tokens are anticipating profits, and there’s a small group of entrepreneurs and technologists standing up and nurturing the projects,” Gensler said in prepared remarks. “I believe we have a crypto market now where many tokens may be unregistered securities, without required disclosures or market oversight.”</blockquote><p>Gensler also hinted that the SEC might start targeting exchanges next:</p><blockquote>“A typical trading platform has more than 50 tokens on it. In fact, many have well in excess of 100 tokens. While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50 or 100 tokens, any given platform has zero securities,” Gensler&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-pro-rata-f62e200a-033e-41ee-a5dd-ece2362c2ef3.html">Dan Primack on&nbsp;Gensler</a>:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: While Gensler is less hard-line than Clayton on existing laws being all that are needed to regulate this new world of digital tokens, he’s quite firm in his view that much of the investment in crypto is driven by speculation and hope of profits — and should be regulated as&nbsp;such.</blockquote>  “Standing astride [of the law] isn’t a sustainable place to be,” he&nbsp;warned.  <blockquote>Details: Gensler noted that while existing laws are quite clear when it comes to figuring out if something is a security, his agency may need new laws from Congress to help better regulate new crypto trading platforms.</blockquote>  He also said that some of them “are trying to play arbitrage between the jurisdictions” of various countries, making it all the more important for his agency to have the right&nbsp;tools.  The emergence of the “decentralized finance” protocols that let participants execute various transactions directly with each other instead of using intermediaries are creating new unregulated ways for people to engage in activities that would otherwise fall under strict&nbsp;rules.  Gensler also signaled his agency could move to finally approve some form of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund — a vehicle many have tried to get approval for, unsuccessfully so far given regulators’ concerns over market manipulation risks.  Also on his watch list: stablecoins, which he noted can be used to get around regulatory oversight.  <blockquote>The bottom line: Expect to hear a lot more about cryptocurrencies from the&nbsp;SEC.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile the SEC took actions against <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-145">a DeFi protocol</a> and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-147">a crypto exchange</a> on Friday and Monday, respectively.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-will-police-cryptocurrencies-to-maximum-possible-extent-chair-gary-gensler-says-11628007567">Crypto ‘Wild West’ Needs Stronger Investor Protection, SEC Chief&nbsp;Says</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-chair-gensler-agrees-with-predecessor-every-ico-is-a-security">SEC’s Gensler Agrees With Predecessor: ‘Every ICO Is a Security’ — CoinDesk</a>   5.

 Social Agriculture — understanding Kenyan farmers’ use of social media platforms for agricultural practices Kenyan farmer using a Facebook group to sell&nbsp;produce.<p>Caribou Digital is excited to embark on a new research project to understand how Kenyan farmers use social media platforms as part of their agricultural practices. We’ve spent the last few years with the support of the Mastercard Foundation exploring the phenomena of platform livelihoods — the <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-working-trading-renting-and-engaging-in-digital-marketplaces-b144ffcc1141">ways people earn a living by working, trading, renting, or engaging in digital marketplaces</a> — and the many diverse ways in which individuals and small businesses are engaging with digital technology. While each of these ways is distinct in its own right, they all have “digital marketplaces” and platformization at their&nbsp;core.</p><p>Beginning in 2019, our early work in this area explored “p<a href="https://mse.financedigitalafrica.org/2019/01/platform-practices/">latform practices</a>”. In 2020, our colleagues conducted a global <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/QYDEL-v1.01.pdf">literature review</a> and held <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/qydel2020/">discussions with 80 young platform workers and sellers</a> to establish an overarching approach to Platform Livelihoods, encompassing eight key sectors: microwork and freelancing, local services, asset sharing, farming, micro- and small enterprises, ride-hailing, creatives, and logistics.</p><p>Since then, we have been doing deeper dives into the intersectional topics that make this so urgent — exploring Platform Livelihoods and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">Resilience in the Face of Covid</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/how-can-we-make-platform-livelihoods-better-for-young-women-especially-during-and-after-covid-19-696b3974bf61">Platform Livelihoods and Gender</a> in Kenya, Nigeria, and Ghana. This new project will take a deep dive into the new form of “social agriculture” being innovated in Kenya, where Facebook and WhatsApp groups create new connections between farmers and their&nbsp;markets.</p> Research goals <p>This work is exploratory, intended to test and develop our hypothesis that the use of social media is a significant part of Kenyan farmers’ agricultural life. There is <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/micro-and-small-enterprises-mses/">growing evidence </a>of the ways micro-enterprises and entrepreneurs appropriate social media to pursue “social commerce”, and how the tech titans are rushing to fold transaction and commerce support into Instagram, Facebook, WhatApp, and TikTok. We know many farmers are using the same tools — as just two examples, the Digital Farmers Kenya group on Facebook has 431,000 members andhe Kenya Dairy Farmers Forum has 209,000 members. But we don’t know how widespread the farmers’ use of social platforms is, or how these platforms are being used. In short, while the digital development community has come to know a lot about social commerce, it needs to know more about social agriculture.</p><p>Importantly, this is a study based on exploring and understanding what Kenyan farmers are doing themselves with the tools available to them. It is not a study of instrumental (information and communication technologies for development) ICT4D; we are not examining the digitization of agricultural value chains nor studying specialized transaction marketplaces like DigiFarm or Twiga. It is explicitly grounded in our understanding of d<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-transformation-needs-a-narrative-three-takeaways-to-help-define-it-9f06dae3e3aa?source=collection_home---4------6-----------------------">igital transformation as an always ongoing process, irrespective of “developmental”interventions</a>. In this study we seek to understand digital transformation in the context of Kenyans’ use of social media platforms for agricultural practices, and to identify ways in which this might be supported with careful, intentional interventions to mitigate challenges and support Kenyan farmers to make use of the tools and capabilities they already&nbsp;have.</p><p>We’re excited about this research, the insights we anticipate will surface, and the opportunity to work with new partners. We will share more of the work as we progress, and are looking forward to engaging with those working on similar questions, and welcome questions, comments, and suggestions.</p><p>For any further information, please contact Emrys Schoemaker: <a href="mailto:emrys@cariboudigital.net">emrys@cariboudigital.net</a> or on Twitter at&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/emrys_s">@emrys_s</a></p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/cariboudigital">@CaribouDigital</a> on Twitter for&nbsp;more.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/social-agriculture-understanding-kenyan-farmers-use-of-social-media-platforms-for-agricultural-f48203c44b31">Social Agriculture — understanding Kenyan farmers’ use of social media platforms for agricultural…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 OceanDAO Round 9 is Open&nbsp;🌊🌊  300K USD available for sustainable data-oriented projects! <p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p>For those new, OceanDAO is a community-curated funding system directed towards projects building in the Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">The Ocean ecosystem becomes self-sustainable</a> as the builders of the Web3 data economy leverage Ocean Protocol to create products, services, and resources that the community finds valuable.</p><p>Grant Funding Categories:</p>  Building or improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building and/or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself  <p>For up-to-date information on getting started with OceanDAO, we invite you to get involved and learn more about Ocean’s community-curated funding on the <a href="http://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>The goal is to grow the DAO each round. We encourage the $OCEAN ecosystem to apply or reapply AND to vote! Thank you to all of the participants, voters, and proposers.</p> OceanDAO Round 9 Announcements and Guidelines  Round 9 Information <p>There is $300,000 USD in grant funding available in Round 9. The maximum request limit per proposal is $17,500&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Please Note: The amount requested is in USD, but the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline (September 7th at midnight GMT). This determines how many OCEAN will be awarded if a proposal is voted to receive a&nbsp;grant.</p><p>A total of $87,500, or approx. 30%, of “Total Round Funding Available” is earmarked for New Projects. Earmarked proposals are eligible for the entire “Total Round Funding Available”; returning (general) grants are eligible for the remaining $212,500, or approx.&nbsp;70%.</p><p>As a builder, submit your project proposal to the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-9/68">Round 9 Ocean Port Forum</a>. As a voter, this is where you can see all the expanded proposal details to make an informed vote decision.</p><p>Additionally, you can check out the OceanDAO Round 9 <a href="https://www.notion.so/Round-9-Proposals-73ef48e765de43778891faa8172c2488">Proposal Submission Dashboard</a> to see all the proposals in one place as they are submitted.</p><p>The grant proposals from the <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">snapshot ballot</a> that meet these criteria are selected to receive their Funding Amount Requested (in OCEAN) to foster positive value creation for the overall Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p> Reporting: Updates &amp; Project&nbsp;Standing <p>To provide more transparency across the DAO and help guide projects towards completion, we are introducing a Project Standing Dashboard &amp; system to report&nbsp;updates.</p><p>If you are submitting proposals for grants and actively working on a project, you should submit updates that allow OceanDAO participants to understand your progress.</p><p>It is recommended to focus on the original Grant Deliverables and outcomes promised originally while tackling any challenges, successes, and failures.</p><p>Make sure to update your Project Deliverables to remain in good standing, and continue to Submit Proposals.</p><p>Important note: existing Projects will only be able to participate in the Voting process if their project is in a “Completed” or “Funds Returned” standing.</p><p>Please visit the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> 1-Project / 1-Proposal: Proposal Template &amp; Advisor&nbsp;Roles <p>Coordination is important in every DAO. To increase transparency and reduce confusion, we are recommending every project reports their “Core Team” and their “Advisors”.</p>  In a given round an individual can only be on one “Core Team” but could be “Advisor” on any number of&nbsp;teams.  If any person is in &gt;1 team as a “Core Team” member, and not an “Advisor”, then every proposal that person is in will be disqualified.  If a “Core Team” member has previously received a grant, any project in the future with that participant will not be eligible for a “New Team”&nbsp;earmark.  <p>We have updated the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Grant-Proposal-Template">Grant Proposal Template</a> to make this easy for teams to communicate their project structure.</p><p>At the end of the day what matters is not how many projects you are on BUT shipping the actual project deliverables. And if you’re unable to ship your deliverables, the community has the ability to ask questions and vote how they&nbsp;choose.</p> Vote Counting: Yes minus No&nbsp;Votes <p>In Round 9 we are introducing a weight to “No Votes”. This means that “No Votes” will be used to calculate a “Final Score” for each proposal. Projects that receive greater than 50% Yes Votes, will then have a “Final Score” calculated by the formula&nbsp;below.</p><p>Final Score = Yes Votes - No&nbsp;votes</p><p>Grantees are determined by highest “Final Score”. Funds are distributed in descending order, until there are no funds remaining. Any remaining funds will be&nbsp;burned.</p> Decentralizing Rules: Bot&nbsp;Checking <p>In Round 9 we are taking initiatives to further decentralization. This means that select project deadlines will be determined by&nbsp;DAOBot.</p><p>DAOBot Deadlines:</p>  Your proposal needs to be submitted by Proposal Submission Deadline&nbsp;date.  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/project-criteria#details-of-criteria">Requiring 500 OCEAN</a> (criteria #3) will be determined by DAOBot. You need to have 500 OCEAN in specifically an ETH Wallet address (OCEAN on other blockchains will not be accepted for the 500 minimum parameter; eg BSC or Polygon are ineligible).  Existing projects need their [Proposal Standing] to be in “Completed” or “Refunded” to participate in the Voting&nbsp;process.

Graham Williamson,  Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole, is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4664" title="Meeting Expectations – 5 pillars for IoT project success"> Meeting Expectations – 5 pillars for IoT project success</a> on Tuesday, September 14 starting at 7:20 pm. at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Graham some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you describe the current state of the IoT industry sector?</p>
<p>
If there was one word to use to characterize the current state of the IT sector, it would be ‘exciting.’ The current situation we have is over the last few years, there has been a significant decrease in the cost of equipment, infrastructure, and there has been a significant increase in the functionality of that infrastructure. So, we are at a juncture where things that weren't viable just a few years ago now are, and I would encourage any organization to think through how they can make use of automated processes, monitoring of things that were too expensive to monitor before and see how they could improve their customer service through the use of IoT (Internet of Things). Because if they're not, it’s likely their competitors are, so focus on what you can do, analyse the cost of doing that and then run an experiment and see if it's going to generate the facilities that you'd like to. </p>
<p>I mean, if we just think back a few years, we can now in the packaging industry, track a package from here in Australia through to Munich in Germany, and we can do that real-time. It's a phenomenal capability we now have. If we think in the industry 4.0 area, we can now assist in a manufacturing process far better than we ever have been able to do before. Can I tell you a little story? Penfolds wine is a Penfold producer here in Australia, ships to China. One of the problems they do have is counterfeiting of their wine. So, one of the features now, the factors that they used in determining whether a wine is counterfeit is the level of filling in a bottle through their IoT systems. They fill a bottle to 750 ml to the micro millimeter. So obviously in comparison with the counterfeiter, that's a significant benefit. So, think through the things that you can do with IoT, give it a shot. And I think we'll find that the viability of an IoT supportive process is pretty significant these days.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A recent survey indicated that many IoT deployments fail to achieve expectations. Why is that?</p>
<p>
I think there’re several factors that lead to this level of satisfaction that you achieve from an IoT installation. One of the features that we have with IoT industries is quite fragmented, which means that you have to have a good understanding of the capability of a vendor or a consulting organization that you might engage to help with your actual deployment. And I'll be the first one to agree that that's not easy. Now, many of the vendors [and] customers that were actually part of that survey had actually done an experimental deployment. So, they had this idea and they wanted to try it and see how it worked.</p>
<p>And in doing that, they didn't really know what their expectations were. And if you don't know what your expectations are, it's pretty hard to meet them. So, I would suggest that as you enter into the IT space – if it's the first-time installation for you – that you think through what it is you want to achieve. You document what you want to achieve. You communicate to others in your organization, what you want to achieve. And then that will help make sure that that implementation will actually do what you're trying to achieve for that particular installation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can be done to increase the level of satisfaction for IoT deployments? </p>
<p>
As with many projects, good project management is very important for an IoT deployment and project management comes in two parts. First, the planning phase, and then there's the execution phase. In the planning phase, you must determine what the requirements are for the project. What are the deliverables for the project? You must engage the correct stakeholders for that. So, the more communication you do with you and your organization to tell people what you're trying to achieve, the more people will come, [be] interested in what you're doing, assist with what you're doing, and the net result then, will have a wider base to determine if it's satisfactory for what they want. The execution phase is important to have a steering committee. So again, you're engaging people within the organization. It's not just one little group in the group in the organization is going ahead and doing this.  </p>
<p>You're engaging with a wider base in your organization. And the steering committee is responsible for reviewing progress. You need to make sure that you do set the progress for what sort of schedule you’re going to be on, what are the milestones you want to achieve? What is the budget for that particular project? And once that's approved, you need to manage to that. So, the execution phase requires the review process to happen. It requires the steering committee to be active in removing roadblocks to the project. And with that wider base, that's looking at focusing on helping with the project deployment, we'll find the satisfaction going up. The number of successful projects that we're going to achieve will increase.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How important is cybersecurity to IoT deployments? </p>
<p>
I made a projection a couple of years ago that we were going to experience a catastrophic event in the IoT space. Now we have had some interesting events happen, nothing I would classify as catastrophic yet. So, I will still hold to that. If there's one area that we need to apply all the knowledge and the tools that we have, it's in IoT. So, at the device level, we need to make sure how are we managing those? Who has access to them? What sort of a process do we go through when we update them? At the controller level, we need to know who's got access to those. What's the access control list within those devices. At the SCADA level, if we've got a SCADA system, that's a computer that we need to protect just as we protect other computers within our organization.  </p>
<p>So, we need to include that in our cybersecurity strategy and tie it into the tools that we have. Now, if we've got a security operation center, it should be monitoring our IoT systems as well. Then there's the output of IoT systems. IoT systems generate a lot of data. In many cases, that data is not properly looked after. And there's people that would be competitors who would be very interested in that data. And so, we need to use the normal processes we have of protecting our data, make sure the database has the security controls on it we want. Make sure we aggregate data and then delete. The chronic problem in IoT systems is the volume of data we need to aggregate it and then delete what we don't need. We need to make sure that we anonymize data if it's going to be put into a place where other people can get a hold of it. </p>
<p>So, we need to think through all of those things that in the information technology centre side, we're pretty good at and apply them to the operational technology side when it comes to IoT data. If we look at some of the problems we've had in the cybersecurity field. So, it was an account takeover problem in a water filtration plant in Florida earlier this year, that could well have been avoided by making sure that the IoT system had the same security level supply to it as we do in the information technology side. So, there should be no remote management software on an IoT system. And please make sure you don't have any mail server anywhere close to any IoT system. And then there was the problem that we had with the software being injected, malware being injected into software, distributed to thousands of companies, you know, we need to make sure that we put the protection in place that allows that to be caught. And I think the industry has done an excellent job of making sure they close that loop. So, let's apply some of the knowledge that we have from the information technology side, in the operational technology side. </p>

<p><br></p>
<p>What advice would you give to someone deploying their first-IoT infrastructure? </p>
<p>
That it would be a very exciting time deploying the first IoT deployment solution. If there was one thing that I would say you must do is manage expectations, make sure that the people that are monitoring that project and looking at its deliverables, know what their expectations are for that particular project. I think you need to make sure that that initial deployment isn't too big. Don't try and boil the ocean on your first try. What you want to do is to have a limited deployment that allows you to gain experience and the experience that the team builds up in its initial deployment obviously is going to then feed through to the rest of the project so that we might then think of. So, segment your solution, do one bit at a time, and make sure that you communicate and celebrate the success that you have as you proceed. And so, communication is a very important part of that initial IoT deployment to make sure that people are aware of what it is you're trying to achieve. And then use that when they say, okay, we've achieved it. </p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the third interview in this series, Ontology speaks with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dilipishara1990">Dilip</a>.</p><p>1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology?</p><p>After researching several blockchain projects, I eventually discovered Ontology. The reason I was drawn to Ontology is because its vision aligned perfectly with what I believe&nbsp;in.</p><p>2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand?</p><p>I firmly believe in Ontology’s vision and mission and am eager to contribute more to the ecosystem. I decided to build a Sinhala community from scratch in June 2019 and turned it into one of the largest Ontology multilingual communities and one of the largest Sinhala crypto communities in the industry. I utilized my previous marketing and communication skills training and was able to build a very fast-growing crypto community in Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p><p>3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger?</p><p>Spreading knowledge and news via our community. By working closely with the Ontology team, I can share accurate information to help the <a href="https://t.me/OntologySrilankan">community</a> understand the project’s vision and specific&nbsp;goals.</p><p>4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you?</p><p>As every cryptocurrency enthusiast knows, Ontology is one of the best blockchain-based projects in the world. I think being a part of a project like this and improving my skills at the same time is the best thing I could be&nbsp;doing.</p><p>5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out?</p><p>Unlike other blockchain communities, Ontology tries to give the best to their community. They work hard to keep their communities up-to-date with their latest developments, which I think every blockchain-based community should&nbsp;do.</p><p>6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others?</p><p>In Sri Lanka, cryptocurrency followers are mostly based on Telegram and Twitter. As a Harbinger, most of the time I keep in contact with crypto lovers through Telegram. So I decided to focus primarily on Telegram.</p><p>7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger?</p><p>In Q3 of 2019, I was named Admin of the Quarter. I received this honor after increasing the community by 336%; I also hosted offline and online events to help promote Ontology. This is my most memorable experience of being a Harbinger. Being an admin is easy. But being a reputed community admin one hundred percent depends on you. You will definitely be rewarded for keeping active and working&nbsp;hard.</p><p>8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words?</p><p>Unique, Authoritative, Trustworthy.</p><p>9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more or less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow?</p><p>In my view, keeping close contact with the community is one of the most important things to grow the community. And making community members motivated by arranging events and giving away gifts is also a key&nbsp;factor.</p><p>10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these?</p><p>To stand out among the 100 best cryptocurrencies is really hard. Ontology proved its worth by gaining a lot of community members. It also made ONT one of the best cryptocurrencies out of thousands of other cryptocurrencies.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the fourth interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>Verifiable Credentials help you build solutions that empower customers to manage their own data. </p> Sunsetting the Attestation Protocol.<br> <p>Bloom has been at the forefront of decentralized identity development since 2017. Back then, there were no existing Decentralized Identity standards or specifications to guide the engineering efforts. Bloom created from scratch a proprietary attestation protocol and developer tooling around it. The attestation core protocol was built using Whisper and Ethereum with its main features being requesting, issuing and sharing attestations. </p><p>On November 19th, 2019 the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">Word Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">published</a> the Verifiable Credential (VC) open standard. The new W3C-VC specification became the accepted standard for building VC based applications and tools. </p><p>To transition fully to the W3C VC standard, Bloom decided to deprecate the proprietary attestation format and adopt the new open VC standard. The transition will fulfill the vision of giving Bloom users complete, secure control of their private data, while allowing interoperability with the rest of the VC ecosystem.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials?  <p><br>What is a credential?!</p><blockquote>
<p>A set of one or more claims made by an issuer. A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#ecosystem-overview">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#ecosystem-overview</a></p>
<p><br>We use various types of IDs daily. Whether it's to drive a car, apply for a job, or enter a secure building we need an ID card, a diploma or a secure badge. Today it is difficult to express education, healthcare data, bank account details, and other types of third-party personal information on the Web. The complexity of defining digital credentials on the Web makes it difficult to receive the same benefits that physical documents provide us in the physical world. </p><p>The Verifiable Credentials open standard is a data model that describes how we could handle these types of interactions using the internet privately and securely. The addition of technologies, such as digital signatures, makes verifiable credentials more tamper-evident and more trustworthy than their physical counterparts. </p> How Verifiable Credentials work?<br> <p>There are three main roles involved in a verifiable credential interaction:</p><p>Issuer. A role that is responsible for asserting claims about a subject, creating a verifiable credential based on these claims, and sending the credential to the holder.</p><p>Holder. An entity that acquires, possesses or presents a verifiable credential. Example holders include students, employees, and customers.</p><p>Verifier. A role that is responsible for receiving one or more verifiable credentials for processing. Example verifiers include employers, security personnel, and websites.</p><p>The figure below provides an example verifiable credential ecosystem. As seen in the diagram, the holder of a verifiable credential sits at the center of a triangle of trust, mediating between the issuer and the verifier:</p> 
 The Issuer trusts the Holder 
 The Holder trusts the Verifier 
 The Verifier trusts the Issuer 
 
<p>Any role in the triangle can be played by a person, an institution, a device, or a smart contract.</p><p>Note that anyone can create verifiable credentials, the person or entity verifying the credential decides if they trust the entity that issued it. For example, imagine an American university accepting an International student based on her local high-school diploma.</p> What's Next?<br> <p>The Bloom team is excited about the recent developments in the Decentralized Identity space, especially when it comes to universal Verifiable Credentials. Since publishing the open standard by W3C, Bloom has been working with the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a> and authored one of the first Verifiable Credentials wallet protocols, called WACI. The code was made open-source and <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/bloom-donates-waci-790f902ac9bd">donated to the DIF</a>. <br><br>As the Bloom mobile app and its associated services fully migrate to Verifiable Credentials open standard, the users will be prompted to re-claim their credentials. Once your Verifiable Credentials have been claimed, you can sit back and be proud of the fact that you are a part of the Decentralized Identity movement.</p><p>Bloom is excited to have you on board!</p>

Description:  When you show up for work, what persona is on display? Can you truly be yourself in your role? For women in historically male-dominated fields and those with non-traditional backgrounds, it’s unfortunately common to have to hide parts of their identity at work. Richard and Helen discuss this systemic problem, how it’s contributing to the resource gap in fields like cybersecurity, and how we can build different paths for success for people with diverse identities and backgrounds. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [4:30] Helen shares the career path that led her to cybersecurity and her struggles to fit into the field. [6:55] Are you able to bring your authentic self to your workplace? [11:02] The experience that taught Richard just how hard fitting into an industry can be for underrepresented groups. [13:10] The drivers behind unacceptable behaviors among otherwise really smart people. [15:15] Proof that change is finally happening. [20:01] There is no benefit to alienating any group in any industry, even the “old white guys.” [25:22] Signals that are driving people away from the security industry, and how we can start effecting meaningful change.[31:27] The systemic problems behind the socioeconomic and cultural characteristics that lead to shortages in the industry.[32:52] Helen’s advice for leading as a strong female in any career. &nbsp; Quotes:    “My experience with coming into the field as a minority is still commonly shared with a lot of people.”—Helen   “When you show up to your job, are you able to bring your authentic self to the role? —Helen   “We seem to have gotten to a point where, as an industry, we can finally have discussions about this.”—Helen   “You’ve got to start where people are, not where you think they should  be.”—Helen    “Do what you can to be as authentic as possible, and change your environment to enable it.”—Helen     Mentioned in This Episode:  The Ohio State  Office of Compliance and Integrity

<p>Gary Gensler, current Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said last week that he sees a significantly increased role for the SEC in regulating the cryptocurrency industry. Gensler made clear that existing securities laws would continue to be applied to the crypto sector, with the application of the Howey Test remaining the key determinative criteria for whether or not a particular cryptocurrency is, in fact, considered a security in the United States. The Chairman was also keen to clarify that while enhanced regulation of centralized exchanges may be the most obvious path for the SEC to pursue, decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and Sushiswap are not beyond the commission's reach.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Amazon Web Services is one of the most popular cloud computing platforms on the planet. There’s a good chance you will need to work in an AWS environment, which means publishing to one of their web server services like Elastic Beanstalk. The AWS platform is enormous, and this can be an intimidating task for a developer. Luckily, Amazon has released their AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2013-2015 and AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2017-2019, which make publishing your web applications to Elastic Beanstalk a snap.</p>

<p>In this article, you will build an ASP.Net MVC web application on .Net 5 using Visual Studio 2019. You will secure this application using Okta. Okta makes it easy to create a secure application with their SSO provider. Once your application is complete you will publish it to a production Elastic Beanstalk instance using the AWS Toolkit.</p>

 What You’ll Need 

 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2019</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5</a> 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">An Okta Developer Account</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">The Okta CLI tool</a>

 Write Your MVC Application 

<p>Open Visual Studio 2019 and select Create a new project. Under Templates select ASP.Net Core Web Application and give your application a meaningful name. I named mine <code>Okta_AWSToolkit</code>, and my namespaces in code will reflect that.</p>

<p>Next, press Create then under Create a new ASP.NET Core web application select ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) and ensure that ASP.NET Core 5.0 is selected.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Wait a few moments for Visual Studio to scaffold the project.</p>

<p>Next, you will install the necessary dependencies for the application. In this instance, you will only need the Okta AspNetCore package from NuGet. You can install this with the package command <code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 3.5.0</code> or by using the package manager interface.</p>

<p>Your application should have a file called <code>appsettings.json</code>. You will use this as a template for your appsettings files for development and production. Add the following JSON to it.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "",
    "ClientId": "",
    "ClientSecret": "",
    "CallbackPath": "/okta/callback"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This file lacks any sensitive information, so you can check this into your source control. You will populate two files shortly: <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and <code>appsettings.Production.json</code>. For now, you can add those files and add the same template as <code>appsettings.json</code>.</p>

<p>Next, open your <code>HomeController.cs</code> file and add the following code.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Okta_AWSTookit.Models;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Okta_AWSTookit.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; _logger;

        public HomeController(ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Profile");
            }

            return View();
        }

        [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
        public IActionResult Error()
        {
            return View(new ErrorViewModel { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This controller has an <code>Index</code> action that will be your home page. Under the <code>Index</code> action you are checking if the user is authenticated. If they are, then you will redirect them to the <code>Profile</code> page, otherwise, they can continue to the Home page.</p>

<p>Next, create a controller called <code>AccountController.cs</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;

namespace Okta_AWSTookit.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Login()
        {
            if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Logout()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(
            new[]
            {
                OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme
            },
            new AuthenticationProperties()
            {
                RedirectUri = "/Home/Index"
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This controller contains <code>Login</code> and <code>Logout</code> actions. There are no views here since Okta will deliver the login page for you. The <code>Login</code> action should check that the user is not authenticated before returning the <code>ChallengeResult</code>. The <code>Logout</code> action redirects the user to the Home page.</p>

<p>The last controller you need is the <code>Profile</code> controller. Add a new controller called <code>ProfileController.cs</code>. The code follows.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

namespace Okta_AWSTookit.Controllers
{
    public class ProfileController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;ProfileController&gt; _logger;

        public ProfileController(ILogger&lt;ProfileController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [Authorize]
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The only purpose of this controller is to serve the <code>Profile/Index</code> page. The <code>Index</code> action is decorated with the <code>Authorize</code> attribute, which will automatically send unauthenticated users to the Okta login page.</p>

<p>Next, you can begin to work on your views. The first thing to edit is <code>Layout.cshtml</code>. Replace the boilerplate code with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;@ViewData["Title"] - Okta with Jenkins&lt;/title&gt;

    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" /&gt;

<p>Much of this code is the same as the boilerplate, with one major exception. You’ve added a <code>Login</code> button to the navbar that turns into a <code>Logout</code> button if the user is authenticated.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>Home/Index.cshtml</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

 <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="display-4"&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a brief tutorial on using &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2019&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;.Net 5&lt;/a&gt;, Secured with &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</code> 

<p>This page provides some additional information about the project and replaces the standard ASP.NET introduction.</p>

<p>Finally, add a new view for <code>Profile/Index.cshtml</code> and add the following code.</p>

 <code>@*
    For more information on enabling MVC for empty projects, visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=397860
*@

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Profile";
}

&lt;div class="jumbotron"&gt;
    Welcome to your Profile
&lt;/div&gt;
</code> 

<p>There’s not much going on here, we just present a page for users to understand that they are authenticated and have made it to the profile page. You can edit this page with whatever code you feel fits here.</p>

<p>Finally, you need to edit your <code>Startup.cs</code> code to enable and configure authentication with Okta. Replace the code in this file with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_AWSTookit
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
            {
                options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
            })
           .AddCookie()
           .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
           {
                // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
               OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
               ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
               ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
               CallbackPath = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:CallbackPath")
           });

            services.AddControllersWithViews();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
                app.UseHsts();
            }
            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
            {
                endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This file brings it all together. You have registered the Okta component using the <code>appsettings</code> file that matches your <code>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</code> variable. Now you can easily change your Okta application depending on your environment.</p>

 Create your Okta Development Application 

<p>You’ll need to create an Okta application for your development environment. You can use the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI tool</a>. Download the CLI tool and run <code>okta login</code>. This will walk you through the login process. Once that is completed run <code>okta apps create</code> and follow the prompts on the screen. Select web as your application type. For your Redirect URI, use the web address provided from your application and append <code>/okta/callback</code> to it. For your Post Logout RedirectURI, use the same domain. This time, append <code>/signout/callback</code> to it. If you have multiple authorization servers you can select default for this application. After a moment, the CLI will write your Client Id, Client Secret, and Issuer to a file called <code>.okta.env</code> in the same directory you were working in. Take these values and add them to your <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: you will only need the Domain portion of your Issuer, not the full URL. You can then delete the contents of <code>.okta.env</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time you can begin your project and ensure everything is working as you expect in development mode.</p>

 Set up the Amazon Tool Kit 

<p>Now it’s time to publish your application to your Elastic Beanstalk. You should have already installed the AWS Toolkit extension, but go ahead and install it now if you haven’t. The first time it opens, you’ll see a screen with instructions on how to set up the extension.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The screen will instruct you to log into the IAM Users page in the AWS console and create a user. Click on that link and set up a new user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Create the new user, then attach an administrator or power user policy to the user. Next, you will be presented with the Access Key and Secret Key. Copy and paste those into the AWS Toolkit, then press save, and close.</p>

 Publish to AWS Elastic Beanstalk 

<p>Next, right-click on your project and click Publish to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This will open a new wizard to guide you through the publish process.</p>

<p>First is the application tab. Select Create a new application environment and then select Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under the Application Environment screen select the production version of your environment. This action will automatically populate the URL for your Elastic Beanstalk instance. You’ll want to check to make sure the URL is available before moving forward.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under the Options tab, the only change you need to make is to use a t2.micro instance to maintain your free tier status. If you need to scale up later Amazon makes that easy through the AWS Toolkit.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Under the options tab you will want to select the Release configuration.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, on the view tab, click Deploy and wait a few minutes for the site to be published and the server to be live. You will receive a notification when it is ready. From there, you can click the link to your site to see the published version. However, at this time, you will notice your login screen doesn’t work as expected. This is because you still need to populate your production Okta credentials.</p>

 Create Your Okta Production Application 

<p>Open your CLI again and go through the <code>okta apps create</code> wizard. However this time, instead of using the <code>localhost</code> domain provided by Visual Studio, replace the domain in your Redirect URI and Post Logout RedirectURI with the domain at which AWS published your application. After a moment, the CLI will again write your details to <code>.okta.env</code> and you can replace your <code>appsettings.Production.json</code> values with these new ones. Again, only use the domain of your Issuer in the domain field of your appsettings file.</p>

<p>You will need to publish your application to AWS one last time to ensure that the updated <code>appsettings.Production.json</code> reaches the server. Once that is complete you should be able to log in to your application again.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The AWS Toolkit is a powerful tool that helps you integrate with AWS Cloud services easily from Visual Studio. This article is a brief introduction to the capabilities of the tool. If you use AWS for development, I recommend exploring all the features of the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio.</p>

It Is Evident That Blockchain Markets Have Seen An Unprecedented Ride Since The Beginning Of This&nbsp;Year<p>Introduction: Bullish vs. Bearish: Bullish Comeback Or&nbsp;Trap?</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, Bitcoin, Ethereum and the totality of blockchain markets have surged in value at an unprecedented rate. Bitcoin, reached an all time high in mid April of approximately $63,000 per coin and Ethereum, reaching an all time high of $4100 dollars shortly after on May 10th. Since then, cryptocurrencies have seen a major pullback, to a point where Bitcoin has tumbled down to $28,000 (although recently recovering to approximately $42,000) and Ethereum stumbling down to $1800. Although the recent Ethereum London Fork and the consistent burning of Ethereum has been identified as a major catalyst on why Ethereum is roaring back to the $3000 dollar mark. Blockchain markets surpassed two trillion dollars in total market capitalization nearly three months ago, where cryptocurrency markets at the time of writing this article has pulled back to approximately 1.72 trillion dollars. The big question is, are we in a bull market, are we in a bear market, or are we a “Goldilocks Zone” where within the next few weeks we will determine the answer to this question, only time will&nbsp;tell.</p><p>Opinion: Until Bitcoin, Ethereum And Major Altcoins Rally To Near Their All-Time-Highs, We’re Only In An&nbsp;Uptrend</p>The Cycles Of Bitcoin: Bullish And Bearish: Choose Your&nbsp;Side<p>Bitcoin has seen numerous bullish and bearish trends since its inception in 2009; the markets have seen lengthening cycles and diminishing cycles and as of right now, it is difficult to determine such a notion, hence, I will coin the term “Goldilocks Zone Of Determination” as we enter Q3 of this year. Until Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins regain their all-time-highs, it is a very imprudent call to presume we’re either in a bear market or a bull market. Although the market capitalization in totality has risen in recent weeks, and 24 hour volume is now over 100 billion once again, it is evident that only time can determine whether or not this bullish momentum will continue, or we will break down to the downside as this market did in May and late&nbsp;July.</p><p>AERGO: The Great Comeback: Valuation Resurgence Since&nbsp;June</p>AERGO Has Seen A Massive Resurgence In Monetary Valuation Since Its June Low: Regaining A 3X In Valuation As Of August&nbsp;6th<p>AERGO, the fast and scalable hybrid blockchain designed for private and public blockchain entities, has seen a massive rally since the “Great Altcoin Drop Of May-June 2021.” On June 21st, AERGO hit a yearly low of approximately&nbsp;.078 cents, but that didn’t stop the AERGO team from delivering and the fruits of their labor has become evident with the recent resurgence of price valuation of the token. Since the low in June, AERGO has regained massive monetary valuation, rallying approximately 240% into August, vaunting a price of approximately&nbsp;.196 cents at the time of writing this article. As of today, AERGO has risen approximately 1.47% on the daily timeframe and has found equilibrium between 16 and 21 cents; to put this into perspective, if an individual invested $10,000 dollars in June, as of right now, in early August, that investment would be worth approximately $24,000 dollars. The great question is, why has AERGO risen so much in valuation since June, well, there are many variables and events that have occurred that should be outlined that could be labeled as catalysts for the recent&nbsp;rise.</p><p>The AERGO Team: The Team That Never Stops Working: Mainstream Validity</p>The AERGO Team Has Capitalized On Mainstream Validity Through NFT Artistic Exhibition’s In Seoul, Being Featured In Korean News&nbsp;Networks<p>The AERGO team has recently capitalized on the NFT craze, providing artists with a mainstream and in-person digital exhibition for all to see! Provided by CCCV, a product of Blocko XYZ, is an incubated project by the AERGO Foundation which aims to anchor member data on the AERGO public mainnet. Recently, NFT technology has been consolidated into the CCCV product and exhibition; this exhibition enabled viewers to choose 3 out of 20 NFT works on display, and if the written work matched the top three votes, they win a prize. Provided below is a video of the exhibition. In person NFT inception, combination and collaboration, amalgamated with prizes of up to 2 million won, has given AERGO a cutting edge in mainstream adoption in the Korean community.</p><p>The Seoul Drama Awards: Democratized Voting Brought To You By&nbsp;AERGO</p>NEWSIS, A Korean Based News Agency, Highlighted The Recently Developed AERGO Voting Pikkle D’app: Realizing Its Potential For The Seoul Drama&nbsp;Awards<p>Democratized digital voting is an incumbent necessity during the Era of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the AERGO team understood this functional approach to democracy. The Seoul Drama Awards, first conceived in 2005, has begun utilizing Pikkle for online voting for the Asia Star Award, which will begin on the 9th and conclude on the 20th. Many famous Asian Actors and Actresses have been nominated for the Award, which include Taiwanese actress Song Woon-hwa, Indonesian Amanda Manopo, Japanese actress and model Kentaro Sakaguchi and Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi. In totality, a number of 129 male/female actors spanning 5 nations including Wang Yibo and Thai actors Kitty-Chicha Amatayakul are nominated for this award, and online voting will commence utilizing AERGO’s very own Pikkle. As of July 21st, Pikkle has become domestically live in South Korea and an international version is coming in the very near future. This is mass adoption at its core; democratized voting, domestic legitimacy, and the consolidation of the Pikkle D’app/AERGO Public Blockchain and famous Asian actors and actresses.</p><p>MOU’s In Broadcasting: Television Pastime’s Highlighted And Archived Through AERGO And&nbsp;Blocko</p>Blocko XYZ, Has Recently Signed An MOU With&nbsp;MBC<p>It isn’t everyday where blockchain projects sign MOU with one of the largest broadcasting companies in their respective nations, well, AERGO has just completed such a feat. It is important to reference how and why this event is a massive win for Blocko and AERGO as a whole. MBC (Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation) is one on the leading South Korean television and radio network companies. Munhwa actually means the word “culture” in Korean, and this word highlights the ethos of what Blocko and MBC are looking to create through NFT technology; the preservation of Korean television pastimes over the course of 60 years. MBC has existed for 60 years, founded on February 21st, 1961. The Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation is headquartered in Digital Media City in Mapo-Gu, Seoul and has the largest broadcast production facilities throughout the entirety of South Korea including digital production centers in IIsan and outdoor sets in Yongin Daejanggeum Park. Blocko, the technical partner of AERGO, has signed an MOU for the “Archive By MBC” program, which entails Korea’s first NFT broadcasting project, which aims to tokenize memorable and sentimental television moments in Korean television over the last 60 years. If this isn’t the zeitgeist of mass adoption within the blockchain space, I don’t know what&nbsp;is.</p><p>Conclusion: Whether We’re In A Bull Market, Bear Market, Or The “Great Goldilocks Zone” AERGO Continues To&nbsp;Work</p>Bull Or Bear: AERGO Aims To Become The Go-To Mass Adopted NFT And Hybrid Blockchain Platform Of&nbsp;Korea<p>AERGO has recently seen a resurgence in monetary valuation over the course of the last two months. This resurgence can be attributed to a variety of factors which include NFT mass adoption, the launch of blockchain based voting application Pikkle, and MOU’s signed with South Korea’s largest broadcasting agency. It is evident, whether this market continues to rise, or decides to fall, AERGO is here to stay, and will achieve its vision of the behemoth of South&nbsp;Korea.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>We’ve been testing the Holo hosted version of Elemental Chat for two weeks now, and so far everything is working well. Most messages arrive quickly, even as new participants join and post messages.</p><blockquote>At time of writing, there are 245 participants who’ve posted 5405 messages in 94 channels!</blockquote><p>We are seeing some performance issues; messages sometimes take a while to arrive in the browser. But we knew we’d see things like this. What we are not seeing is big slowdowns as more people join and write more messages.</p><blockquote>The 245th participant is getting pretty much the same experience as the first. In fact, performance and reliability have been better than we expected so far.</blockquote> Speed improvements coming soon with sharding <p>Currently Holochain is operating in ‘full-sync’ mode, which means that every node gets every message. This is not that different from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain (except that there's no costly consensus step), and it means there’s still room to make things faster.</p><p>If you’ve followed the Holochain project for a while, you’ll know that this isn’t the final design. Holochain intends to become fast and cheap enough for everyday applications by splitting the data processing burden up into manageable chunks or ‘shards’ (also known as ‘neighbourhoods’) of participants. We call this rrDHT. (If you want to know more about how rrDHT works and why we built it, you can read this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/#rrdht-a-relaxed-agent-centric-distributed-hash-table">tech deep dive</a>.)</p><p>Once sharding is implemented in Holochain, we expect performance to be a lot faster, even as thousands of participants join. The good news is that this work is already complete and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/834#pullrequestreview-721386771">ready to be merged</a> and tested!</p> What’s next? <p>Elemental Chat is still in pre-release testing, and we should begin inviting the public to use it once the <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a> starts. We’ve already been taking email addresses for pre-registration; <a href="https://register.holo.host/elemental">register</a> if you’d like to try it out too!</p><p>Once the Holochain team has finished testing sharding, it’ll be included in a new Holochain release, deployed on a small set of HoloPorts, and tested by our pre-release testers. Once it passes that round of testing, it’ll be deployed on all HoloPorts.</p> Holochain v0.0.102 released (breaking changes) <p>Holochain has seen another update. The biggest item is a breaking change for validation callbacks: the <code>must_get_*</code> host functions have finally landed, which means <code>get</code> and friends can no longer be used in validation callbacks. You can read more about this change in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-holo-networks/#breaking-changes-in-develop-decryption-function-and-must_get">last Dev Pulse</a>.</p><p>Holochain now compiles on Windows too! Damien, a hApp developer and Holo alumnus, contributed a patch that fixes a compatibility bug in the Lair keystore. You can now use the Windows-native Rust toolchain to build Holochain and your DNAs. This doesn’t mean we’re officially supporting Windows yet, but it does look like you can use it as your primary development OS now.</p><p>There are also some performance improvements, bug fixes, and added/changed conductor API endpoints. Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.102/CHANGELOG.md#holochain-00102">changelog</a> for details.</p> What’s next?   <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/834#pullrequestreview-721386771">Sharding code</a> is finished and being tested. I expect there’ll be a bit of performance tuning and bug fixing before it’s released, but the core dev team is planning to include it in release v0.0.103.  The HDK is about to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/886">parallelise</a> all sorts of expensive functions — getting entries, getting links, and making zome calls to other peers, zomes, and cells. This should make those functions a lot faster if there’s a lot to do — no more looping over calls in serial. This is already in <code>develop</code> and should be included in the next release as well.  The HDK is also about to support <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/868">countersigning as a built-in feature</a>. This set of host functions and entry types will abstract away the complexity that makes countersigning difficult to do well. At first you’ll need to solicit and gather countersignatures in your code, either synchronously or asynchronously, but eventually there will be affordances to make this process even simpler. The first iteration will likely come in the release after sharding.

 #BeyondtheRules — Balanced governance and ‘behaving well’ everywhere, every&nbsp;day. <p>#BeyondtheRules is a collaborative exploration around ‘public good’ governance held from summer 2020 to summer 2021 between <a href="http://blackthrive.org/">Black Thrive</a>,<a href="https://www.yorkmcn.org/"> York MCN</a>,<a href="https://www.demsoc.org/"> Democratic Society</a>,<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/"> Dark Matter Labs</a> and<a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/"> Lankelly&nbsp;Chase</a>.</p><p>Our original enquiry for this project started with a premise that our governance and categorisation of ‘public good’ (intended collective benefit) is unfit for the (complex, systemic) challenges we face. More about that&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-e3ab44f0dc3">here</a>.</p> On Governance <p>Governance is a seemingly innocuous term, one that can seem to mean everything and nothing simultaneously. According to Alain Deneault in “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20822679-gouvernance">Gouvernance — Le Management Totalitaire</a>”, the word governance evolved in 15th century France, with the meaning of “behaving well”. Its meaning and use has been appropriated in different ways over time and today is a term that we tend to associate with ‘those in power’. It seems lofty and authoritative, rather than a question for all of us, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Over the last year, we’ve looked at what it means to consider governance not as something separate to our day-to-day, but as a system of many interconnected parts — from individual behaviours to organising systems to structural deep codes — which together make up how we collectively behave. The question is: how can all of those interconnected parts work together towards a just, livable future? Not in theboardroom but everywhere, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll share some of the headline factors that we notice to play a key role in a system of governance. We’ll explore how these are connected to many other parts, and invite you to consider how they show up in your own setting. The factors we focus on here are accountability, responsibility, risk-holding, power and autonomy.</p><p>We are finding that looking at how these factors are balanced and distributed across a system can help to reveal how (in)justly and/or (in)effectively governance might play out in a system, enabling us to see more clearly the parts that are connected and how these could show up in a different way.</p><p>Balance: the balance of power, autonomy, responsibility, risk-holding and accountability in one&nbsp;actor</p><p>The understandings we apply when we use those terms&nbsp;are:</p>  Power ‒ the ability to shape conditions  Autonomy ‒ the freedom to do things in a way that you deem&nbsp;fit  Responsibility ‒ the burden/ability to take&nbsp;action  Accountability ‒ the burden to justify your&nbsp;approach  Risk-holding — bearing consequences of the&nbsp;results  <p>Power, autonomy, responsibility, risk-holding and accountability show up as distinct, but deeply interconnected factors in a system that provide balance to one another. Power and autonomy, we might consider as enablers — factors that convey ability, ease and freedom. Accountability and risk-holding, we might consider as burdens — factors that place an onus on the actor (noting that this language just tries to convey whether the factor creates a freedom/ability or an onus; an enabling factor can still feel or be perceived as a burden and burdens may be embraced as an enabler, gift or honour). Responsibility can be both an enabler or/and a burden — it might be a freedom I choose to exercise; it might involve duties/actions that I need to fulfil. Where we experience an imbalance between the enablers and the burdens that actors may hold in a system, we see an environment conducive to corruption, inefficacy and/or injustice; conditions that erode trust and indeed our collective belief in that&nbsp;system.</p><p>For example, I might have the power to shape the outcome of, say, a COVID-19 procurement process, without risk-holding or accountability for the outcome ‒ this would be an imbalance in governance, in a way that allows for the prioritisation of personal interests over collective benefit.</p>An imbalance in governance conducive to corruption<p>Or I might have responsibility to, say, support somebody to secure work, without autonomy to provide that support in a way that I think would be genuinely effective and tailored to them. This would create a form of imbalance in governance which results in the loss of potential in my ability to innovate and improve things, resulting in that as a system we lose the chance to learn and&nbsp;grow.</p>An imbalance in governance undermining creativity and innovation<p>As someone facing illness, I might bear the consequences (risk-holding) of a failing health system, with minimal power or autonomy to influence whether I can receive the treatment that I need; an imbalance of governance leading to injustice.</p>An imbalance in governance leading to injustice<p>Conversely, when these factors come into balance, we can see how more fair, creative, effective and just conditions can become possible.</p><p>For example, where I have responsibility to design a programme intended for collective benefit, and also autonomy to do it in the way I see is best, I can innovate freely and bring my creativity and understanding to the challenge. This position may give me power in that system (ability to shape conditions). Where I also have risk-holding (I will directly bear consequences of negative results) and also accountability for the approach that I take, I am likely to consider risks and take informed and responsible directions. Thus, where I have a balance of power, responsibility, autonomy, risk-holding and accountability in a system, I am most likely to be able to take customised approaches that care for efficacy and plausibility of the&nbsp;result.</p>A state of balance for full&nbsp;agency<p>Distribution: the balance of power, autonomy, responsibility, risk-holding and accountability between&nbsp;actors</p><p>We also need to consider how these governance factors out between actors in a&nbsp;system.</p><p>Let us consider this in the context of an imagined charitable structure, for example, to help to illustrate what we mean by distribution. This table tries at a very headline and rough level to map out how power, accountability, power, autonomy and responsibility might lie across different actors in an example&nbsp;case.</p> Example of how governance might show up in a Charity by&nbsp;role <p>Power is spread somewhat across this structure but has particular accumulation in actors such as Trustees and senior executives. If these actors are not also the people who the charity is set up to support, we might find a scenario where power is concentrated in people who are furthest from the specifics and realities of the matter. Risks, meanwhile, may have a certain spread across the system, but since charities are by nature set up to support people who are already holding risks in the wider system — risks which can be exacerbated in the case of malfunction by the charity — the highest risk-holding may well be held by people that the charity is set up to support. Indeed, this may be more the case where that charity provides a critical function to people (for example, if a food bank is mismanaged and a result is that I can’t access food that I need, the consequences I bear could be significant. If a sports charity is mismanaged and my sports class is cancelled, the direct consequences to me might be disappointing but less&nbsp;severe).</p><p>When we look at the balance and distribution of governance in this structure we might consider:</p>  How can we better distribute the power across the system so that those closest to the details and specifics of the matter have the most power to shape direction and execution?  How can we design the system so that risk held by people who the charity is set up to support is reduced or mitigated, and more evenly&nbsp;spread?  <p>These are questions that nowadays charities are often expected to address in their fundamental governance set-up. What is clear is that trying to truly address these imbalances requires more than just some tweaks to the existing structure. Indeed, if the structure in place exists within the logic of traditional line management, rank and the bounded division of duties, this imbalance is coded into the architecture.</p><p>And yet, when we think about the huge transition that we have ahead of us for a just livable future to be possible, it is clear that we need to unleash the agency of every one of us to be able to take on responsibility, create with autonomy, be accountable, to take on risks and assume power — each uniquely, in ways that we determine — towards that&nbsp;future.</p><p>So if this rebalance in governance is critical and we truly want to address it, what sort of questions do we start to consider?</p><p>You might, say, start with a review at the structure of the organisation, starting perhaps with the Trustee Board, which — rather than holding a function of strategy and decision-making — could play a more valuable role as a governance auditor for the system. They could hold to account the integrity of the organisation’s governance to its mission, auditing the balance of power, accountability, autonomy, responsibility and risk-holding in the organisation and whether the organising methods are appropriate for&nbsp;it.</p><p>This would allow the strategic decision-making of the organisation to be concentrated in people closest to the questions they need to make decisions about. These people may be supported with information, protocols &amp; considerations from a central team. Rather than ‘line managers’, central teams could actively work to compound learning within the ecosystem and across other partners and actors; who navigate the necessary compliance and regulation that the organisation sits within; and who actively consider how we carve pathways towards justice in the way that they approach the day to day&nbsp;work.</p><p>As we begin to unravel the traditional lines of fixed hierarchy, we start to consider what this means for how we approach pay. We begin to question what pay rewards or incentivises or what function it plays in a system. By linking pay to rank in a system we create a series of incentives to accumulate power and responsibility in a system even where it may not be our place; when we start to unpack this and<a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/Framing-Provocation-Reimagining-the-Wage-1d2140e1fb1d42efa55a00cd3bbd2f57"> reimagine its role</a> it reveals questions about fairness, purpose, process, market norms, regulation and more for us to work&nbsp;through.</p><p>Decision-making, in turn, becomes a critical question, requiring us to reimagine who can take decisions and by which process in this more distributed system.</p><p>And as we start to think about shifting the processes, mechanisms and structures across an organisation or system, we quickly begin to reveal the deep codes that shape the scope of that change. The regulation, which — for example — prescribes what work a charity can engage in and the way that it must be reported and assessed. Accounting, which invites us to consider our financial progress according to profit and reserves rather than the value created for different actors in the system. Contract Law, Intellectual Property and many other codes that shape and constrain how and where we can reimagine how we show&nbsp;up.</p><p>Meanwhile, our charity does not exist in a vacuum, but rather in response to existing issues that often sit at a larger socioeconomic level. The weaker the collective infrastructure, the more risk is concentrated in particular individuals in a system. Having in place social infrastructure from universal healthcare, universal mental healthcare and universal basic income, can significantly mitigate the risk-holding that falls on individual shoulders. We begin to touch upon socioeconomic questions and what infrastructure we need to really enable a balanced governance in our&nbsp;systems.</p><p>This invites us to look at our mental models, narratives and our behaviours in this system, particularly the mental models that have underpinned structural systems of oppression — of class, gender, sexuality, health, race, ethnicity and more — that fundamentally undermine a chance at real justice. These might be mental models and narratives of stratification, white supremacy, extraction, command, control and separation.</p><p>Structural (and intergenerational) privilege facilitates actors to have more time, capacity, confidence, trust and safety, all of which in turn enable a person to accumulate (and sometimes hoard) power, autonomy, responsibility in a system over time. These inequalities aren’t just linear, but also geological; they are not behind us, they are embedded in the layers of rocks we are standing&nbsp;on.</p><p>All of these factors heavily shape the frameworks within which individual choices and their implications are shaped, all in different ways for each of us. Despite the constraints, human history is a story of constant resistance, re-imagination and reform. We can make the commitments — each in our own ways — to step into power (even where it is not welcomed), to step away from power (especially when it is not deserved), to hold oneself accountable (including when not externally mandated), to exert autonomy (including when not permissioned) and to take on or to mitigate&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Whatever the approach, one of the key threads through our enquiry is that how we show up at a personal level deeply influences how these patterns in governance shift, be that interrogating our mental models, conditions, trends, behaviours; embracing rest, joy, celebration, love; resisting, reimagining, committing and/or persisting.</p> About Beyond the&nbsp;Rules <p>In researching these question in #BeyondtheRules over the last year, we have been humbled to speak to individuals, groups and people from social organisations, movements, grantmaking bodies and others who have gradually been unpicking these questions — shifting the way they approach pay, incorporated lived experience into their decision making, taken a more distributed approach to power and accountability, reimagined the grantmaking relationship, campaigned for regulatory reform and more. Individuals and groups that, by acutely focusing on one piece of the jigsaw or looking holistically at many, have been moulding the forces at&nbsp;play.</p><p>As a group of partners in this project, we have been seeking to unravel and make sense of the interconnections between the many factors at play and how they interact, their histories and stories, who is working on them and what they are learning&nbsp;. We are currently writing up our findings to share with the hope that it might add a brick to the collective deep democratising that we need&nbsp;ahead.</p> Reflection: governance in your&nbsp;setting <p>As you head into this time over August, a period where you might have the ability to step back and listen more deeply, to breathe and have moments of silence, we invite you to reflect on some questions with us in relation to the governance in your own settings, wherever these may be (although we should note that these questions are more tailored to social organisations, movements or grantmakers than, say, public services):</p><p>On risk-holding, accountability and&nbsp;power:</p>  Who faces risks and who accrues benefits in the work that you&nbsp;do?  What type of consequences, and to what&nbsp;degree?  Who is currently asked to justify their approach and who is&nbsp;not?  <p>Bear in mind that risk-holders and accountable actors in these situations may bear consequences affecting various factors, such as physical health, mental health, finances/wealth, relationships and social capital, time and energy, reputation, and/or current and future opportunities. They may be human or non-human actors, present-day or in the&nbsp;future.</p>  How (and how much) do structural factors (relating e.g. to regulation, social security, the economic market etc) influence how risk manifests in your&nbsp;system?  How much is within your system’s scope to influence?  What does it really mean for there to be a balance between who shapes the conditions of your work and who bears the potential consequences of&nbsp;it?  <p>Consider how these questions leak into wider structural matters and how you are incorporating these factors into your work. Where are you focusing your sites of influence and are you thinking about how all of the issues interconnect.</p><p>Look to dig into ideas with curiosity. For example, somebody bearing consequences of a system may not always be well placed to have power over all parts of an action that affects them. For instance, I as a patient would bear the consequences of a poorly executed medical procedure, however it does not mean that I should carry out the procedure myself. I would, however, want to be free to decide whether I wanted that procedure, and would want to be able to trust that the person carrying it out has the sufficient knowledge and expertise to do it. I might also want patients like me to have been involved at some point in shaping some of the processes itself.</p><p>Where direct representation might not be possible, why is this (/has this been) the case, and what are the checks and balances needed to how conditions are&nbsp;shaped?</p><p>When thinking about representation, consider that groups of people are not homogenous. A woman can adopt a patriarchal ideology. A person of colour can internalise or even uphold ideas of white supremacy. A gay cis man can be unaware of his transphobia as much as anybody else outside the 2SLGBTQ+ umbrella. A working class person can be convinced to see immigrants as the economic problem in their country. So when we consider the important role of lived experience in governance, we can also ensure that decisions are shaped by people who bear or have borne consequences as well as the insights relating to the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>On responsibility and autonomy:</p>  How much autonomy is given to corresponding types of responsibility?  How do you pay people for the types of responsibility taken? Does (if so, how?) structural privilege link to the roles that you reward the&nbsp;most?  What other benefits do different people accrue as a result of the types of responsibility they hold (reputational, benefits, networks, opportunities…?)  <p>People will likely have different types of responsibility that they hold. When you hold a meeting, who takes minutes, who makes coffee, who sets the agenda. Who holds responsibility for the overall integrity of the work. Who takes responsibility to communicate, to make relationships.</p><p>Reflect on how different types of responsibilities are incentivised or rewarded and how systems of oppression may influence the frameworks of choice that we have when considering to take on these different types.</p><p>If you can, draw what you see. Step into it. Embody it, or depict it. What comes to you as the fundamental changes that you may need to be considering. What do you see and&nbsp;feel?</p><p>After a year looking at ways that many people have approached answering these kinds of questions, we are excited to share with you some of our findings and to hear what is coming up for&nbsp;you.</p><p>We will be hosting a conversation on 2nd September at 2pm (UTC+1) to share more and to invite your contributions; we hope that you can join us. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/beyond-the-rules-open-house-tickets-166296690879">Quick registration here</a></p><p>This blog was authored by Annette Dhami, Thomas Theodore and Himanshu Rohilla of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> (graphics by Sharmada Nagarajan) with the input and support from Natalie Creary of <a href="http://blackthrive.org/">Black Thrive</a>, Catherine Scott of <a href="https://www.yorkmcn.org/">York MCN</a>, Alex Zur-Clark of <a href="https://www.demsoc.org/">Democratic Society</a> and Joe Doran of<a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/"> Lankelly&nbsp;Chase</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-balanced-governance-and-behaving-well-everywhere-every-day-5aa852b4843e">#BeyondtheRules — Balanced governance and ‘behaving well’ everywhere, every day.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>È ormai di dominio pubblico l’attacco ransomware estremamente grave ai danni di una importante Pubblica Amministrazione italiana.</p>



<p>Con la crescita della digitalizzazione e dei dispositivi connessi in rete, questa tipologia di attacchi ai danni di Pubbliche Amministrazioni e grandi imprese private sta registrando una crescita esponenziale sia in Italia che all’estero.</p>



<p>Come confermato dal <a href="https://clusit.it/rapporto-clusit/">rapporto Clusit 2021</a>, nell’anno della pandemia si è registrato il record negativo di attacchi informatici nel mondo, con un incremento pari quasi al 12%&nbsp;rispetto all’anno precedente.</p>



<p>L’ultimo grave caso è quello appena registrato in Italia in cui, secondo le prime indiscrezioni, l’ingresso dell’agente malevolo all’interno dei sistemi informatici della PA, è stato possibile attraverso delle credenziali compromesse della VPN di un dipendente in smart working.</p>



<p>InfoCert, la più grande Autorità di Certificazione a livello europeo, grazie al centro di competenza security di Swascan (Tinexta Cyber), ha la possibilità di verificare immediatamente l’esposizione di PA e Imprese ai rischi informatici e, soprattutto, la presenza o meno di credenziali compromesse e botnet che potrebbero, se usate, compromettere la business continuity, oltre che arrecare un grave danno alla reputazione dell’Organizzazione.</p>

  <p>ASP.NET Web Forms framework has been the cornerstone technology of .Net for web development since the release of .Net Framework in 2002. ASP.NET Web Forms includes a layer of abstraction for developers so that you don’t need to care about HTML, JavaScript, or any other front-end technology. It provides a development flow similar to building desktop apps, a way for developers to build a web page by drag and drop, an event-driven programming model, and stateful controls thanks to the built-in state management. These features incurred lots of complexity, but it was worthwhile when web development was still in its infancy.</p>

<p>Web development has evolved a lot in recent years. Browsers have become more powerful and implement various standards that allow access to users’ devices. Client-side frameworks such as React and Angular simplify client-side development and have become increasingly popular. These frameworks and other benefits are available only if you can write the front-end JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Maintaining the back end and front end in two different languages comes with a cost. There isn’t much code reuse, tools and frameworks are different, and it’s challenging to keep up with constantly evolving technologies.</p>

 Introduction to Blazor 

<p>WebAssembly and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a> come into play to address the challenge of managing front-end and back-end development effectively. WebAssembly is a new open standard of byte code for the Web that runs in every modern browser. Blazor is a C# based client-side UI framework that runs directly in the browser via WebAssembly. It can also run on the server-side and process user interaction over a real-time connection with the browser.</p>

<p>Blazor and ASP.NET Web Forms have a lot in common: They are both component-oriented, event-driven, and provide a stateful programming model. If you are an ASP.NET Web Forms developer, Blazor will feel familiar.</p>

<p>In this article, I will describe how to migrate a simple ASP.NET Web Forms project to Blazor.</p>

<p>To continue, you will need:</p>

 
   A basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio 2019</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core">.NET Core SDK</a>

 Overview of the Web Forms Project 

<p>The project that I will migrate is a simple web app where I can track my daily intake of calories and calories burned by exercise. The project looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Web Forms markup and underlying code looks like this:</p>

   <code>&lt;asp:Content ID="BodyContent" ContentPlaceHolderID="MainContent" runat="server"&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
 &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Daily consumed and burned calories&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;br/&gt;
   Showing data for:
   &lt;asp:TextBox runat="server" TextMode="Date" Text='&lt;%# DateTime.Today.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd") %&gt;' ID="dateTextBox"&gt;&lt;/asp:TextBox&gt;
   &lt;asp:Button runat="server" Text="Show" OnCommand="ShowData"/&gt;

       &lt;/asp:TemplateField&gt;
       &lt;asp:TemplateField HeaderText="Calories"&gt;

       &lt;asp:CommandField ShowDeleteButton="True"&gt;
         &lt;ItemStyle Width="100px" HorizontalAlign="Center"&gt;&lt;/ItemStyle&gt;
       &lt;/asp:CommandField&gt;
     &lt;/Columns&gt;
   &lt;/asp:GridView&gt;
   
   &lt;h3&gt;Total Consumed: &lt;asp:Label runat="server" ID="totalConsumedLabel" &gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt; Total Burned: &lt;asp:Label runat="server" ID="totalBurnedLabel" &gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
 &lt;div class="col-md-6"&gt;

</code>   

<p>Now, let’s migrate the project to Blazor. First, I will create a new Blazor project.</p>

 Create a Blazor Project 

<p>Fire up Visual Studio, create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project, select Blazor App, and click Next. Name the app CaloriesTracker.Blazor and click Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next window, select Blazor Server App. Now, click Create, and Visual Studio will create a new server-side Blazor project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can create the project by running the following command in a command shell:</p>

   <code>dotnet new blazorserver -o CaloriesTracker.Blazor
</code>   

<p>Blazor Server hosts Razor components on the server in an ASP.NET Core app and handles UI updates over a SignalR connection. The Blazor runtime sends events from browser to server and applies UI updates to the components that the server sends back. This strategy is similar to the approach used by the ASP.NET AJAX <code>UpdatePanel</code> control that handles partial page updates in response to trigger events. The main difference is that Blazor Server maintains an active connection to the server, and all the UI state stays on the server instead of <code>ViewState</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see what you get when you create a new project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since the Blazor Server is hosted in the ASP.NET Core project, <code>Startup.cs</code> and <code>Program.cs</code> serve the same purpose. Specifically, <code>Startup.cs</code> configures services and the app’s request pipeline. The Pages folder contains <code>_Host.cshtml</code>, which hosts the Blazor app. The <code>razor</code> files in the Pages folder are the Blazor pages that comprise the app. Similarly, the Shared folder contains shared layouts such as the app’s main layout and reusable components such as the navigation menu. You can think of <code>MainLayout.razor</code> as a <code>Site.Master</code> file in the WebForms project and <code>NavMenu.razor</code> as some <code>ascx</code> component.</p>

<p>Click F5 in Visual Studio or run <code>dotnet run</code> to run the project. You should see:</p>

<p>NewProject Run</p>

<p>Next, I will migrate Entity Framework Core configuration and <code>CaloriesTrackerService</code> to the Blazor project.</p>

 Migrate Entity Framework Core to Blazor 

<p>Migrating non-UI-related code is pretty straightforward. I will use SQLite in the Blazor project, too, so first, add the necessary package to the project:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
</code>   

<p>Now, copy the <code>Model.cs</code> file from the WebForms project to the Data folder in the Blazor project. Next, I need to create an initial migration and apply the migration, so I will run:</p>

   <code>dotnet ef database update
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
</code>   

<p>This code creates CaloriesTracker.db database in the root of the folder.</p>

<p>Finally, copy <code>CaloriesTrackerService.cs</code> to the Data folder as well. The code works without making any changes to it, but I will go ahead and use C# 8.0 syntax to save a couple of lines:</p>

   <code>public class CaloriesTrackerService
{
    public List&lt;Food&gt; GetFood()
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        return caloriesContext.Food.ToList();
    }

    public List&lt;Exercise&gt; GetExercises()
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        return caloriesContext.Exercises.ToList();
    }

    public void AddFood(int foodId, DateTime date)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();

        caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Add(new CalorieDiary()
        { 
            AddedAt = date, 
            FoodId = foodId 
        });

        caloriesContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public void AddExercise(int exerciseId, DateTime date)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();

        caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Add(new CalorieDiary
        {
            AddedAt = date,
            ExerciseId = exerciseId
        });

        caloriesContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public void DeleteRecord(int id)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Remove(new CalorieDiary { Id = id });
        caloriesContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public List&lt;CalorieDiary&gt; GetDailyList(DateTime date)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        var list = caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Where(diary =&gt; diary.AddedAt == date)
                        .Include(d =&gt; d.Food).Include(d =&gt; d.Exercise)
                        .OrderByDescending(diary =&gt; diary.Id).ToList();

    return list;
    }
</code>   

<p>Finally, I will register <code>CaloriesTrackerService</code> with the DI in <code>Startup.cs</code>. In the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method add the following line:</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton&lt;CaloriesTrackerService&gt;();
</code>   

<p>Now you are ready to migrate the UI portion of the project to Blazor.</p>

 Migrate Web Forms Markup to Blazor 

<p>First, right-click on the Pages folder, click Add, select Razor Component and call it <code>CaloriesTracking</code>. You can also create the page by running:</p>

<p><code>dotnet new razorcomponent -n CaloriesTracking -o Pages</code></p>

<p>The top section of the page will contain the markup for this page, and the <code>@code</code> section contains the code that handles events of various components on the page.</p>

<p>Now, add a <code>@page</code> directive at the top of the component, set URL to caloriestracking, and inject an instance of <code>CaloriesTrackerService</code>:</p>

   <code>@page "/caloriestracking"
@using CaloriesTracker.Blazor.Data
@inject CaloriesTrackerService CaloriesTrackerService
</code>   

<p>Next, add the <code>CaloriesTracking</code> component to the menu in <code>NavMenu</code> component:</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="@NavMenuCssClass" @onclick="ToggleNavMenu"&gt;
  &lt;ul class="nav flex-column"&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="" Match="NavLinkMatch.All"&gt;
        &lt;span class="oi oi-home" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Home
    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="caloriestracking"&gt;
        &lt;span class="oi oi-plus" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Calories Tracker
    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Run <code>dotnet watch run</code> in a command shell and navigate to the page by clicking on Calories Tracker in the navigation menu. Leave the app running, and every time you save a file, the app rebuilds, and the browser reloads the page.</p>

<p>Go back to the <code>CaloriesTracking.razor</code> file and add the following markup:</p>

   <code>@if (!initialized)
{
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
}
else
{
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-6"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Add Food&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;EditForm Model="addItemModel" OnValidSubmit="@HandleAddFoodValidSubmit"&gt;
        Select Food:
        &lt;InputSelect @bind-Value="addItemModel.FoodId" style="width: 150px"&gt;
        @foreach (var value in food)
            {
            &lt;option value="@value.Id"&gt;@value.Name&lt;/option&gt;
            }
        &lt;/InputSelect&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-secondary"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/EditForm&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-6"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Add Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;EditForm Model="addItemModel" OnValidSubmit="@HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit"&gt;
        Select Food:
        &lt;InputSelect @bind-Value="addItemModel.ExerciseId" style="width: 150px"&gt;
        @foreach (var value in exercises)
            {
            &lt;option value="@value.Id"&gt;@value.Name&lt;/option&gt;
            }
        &lt;/InputSelect&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-secondary"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/EditForm&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>In the code section, add the following code:</p>

   <code>private bool initialized = false;

private List&lt;Food&gt; food;
private List&lt;Exercise&gt; exercises;

AddItemModel addItemModel = new AddItemModel();

protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    food = CaloriesTrackerService.GetFood();
    exercises = CaloriesTrackerService.GetExercises();

    initialized = true;
}

private void HandleAddFoodValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddFood(addItemModel.FoodId, DateTime.Today);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(DateTime.Today);
    addItemModel.FoodId = -1;
}

private void HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddExercise(addItemModel.ExerciseId, DateTime.Today);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(DateTime.Today);
    addItemModel.ExerciseId = -1;
}

class AddItemModel
{
    public int FoodId { get; set; }
    public int ExerciseId { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the markup and the code. First, check if the data has been loaded. If data hasn’t loaded, display a Loading text in the browser.</p>

<p>Once the list of foods and exercises loads, the markup renders two forms: a food intake form and an exercise form. Both forms display a <code>select</code> element that shows items from a list of foods or exercises. The <code>select</code> value is bound to either the <code>addItemModel.FoodId</code> or the <code>addItemModel.ExerciseId</code> property using the <code>bind-Value</code> attribute. Both forms are bound to the <code>addItemModel</code> model, and when the form is submitted, it will invoke either the <code>HandleAddFoodValidSubmit</code> or the <code>HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>OnInitialized</code> method runs when the component initializes, and I use it to load data for the food and exercise elements. If you need to perform asynchronous initialization, override the <code>OnInitializedAsync</code> method instead. After the data is loaded, and <code>initialized</code> is set to true, Blazor will re-render the component. The <code>HandleAddFoodValidSubmit</code> and <code>HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit</code> methods handle the form submission and saving of the selected food or exercise items to the database. Switch to the browser, and you should see the two select boxes:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, let’s add a grid to show the records from the database and switch between different dates. Add the following markup at the start of the <code>else</code> code block:</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Daily consumed and burned calories&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;EditForm Model="@changeDateModel" OnValidSubmit="@FilterByDate"&gt;
    Showing data for:
    &lt;InputDate @bind-Value="changeDateModel.FilterDate" /&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Show&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/EditForm&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;

    @if (dailyList.Count != 0)
    {
    &lt;table class="table"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Calories&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        @foreach (var item in dailyList)
        {
            &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@(item.Exercise?.Name ?? item.Food.Name)&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@(-item.Exercise?.Calories ?? item.Food.Calories)&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;button @onclick="@(e =&gt; DeleteRecord(item.Id))" class="btn btn-danger"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        }
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Total Consumed: @dailyList.Sum(d =&gt; d.Food?.Calories) Total Burned: @dailyList.Sum(d =&gt; d.Exercise?.Calories)&lt;/h3&gt;
    }
    else
    {
        &lt;h3&gt;No Records Found&lt;/h3&gt;
    }
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The EditForm shows input for selecting a date, and the grid renders the records returned from the database. Just like the other forms, it is bound to <code>changeDateModel.FilterDate</code>, and the <code>FilterByDate</code> method loads data from the database:</p>

   <code>private void FilterByDate()
{
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}
</code>   

<p>When you click the Delete button in the grid, the <code>DeleteRecord</code> method will receive the ID of the record that you want to delete:</p>

   <code>private void DeleteRecord(int id)
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.DeleteRecord(id);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}
</code>   

<p>The final code for the <code>CaloriesTracking</code> component looks like this:</p>

   <code>private bool initialized = false;

private List&lt;Food&gt; food;
private List&lt;Exercise&gt; exercises;
private List&lt;CalorieDiary&gt; dailyList;

AddItemModel addItemModel = new AddItemModel();
ChangeDateModel changeDateModel = new ChangeDateModel { FilterDate = DateTime.Today };

protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    food = CaloriesTrackerService.GetFood();
    exercises = CaloriesTrackerService.GetExercises();
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);

    initialized = true;
}

private void DeleteRecord(int id)
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.DeleteRecord(id);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}

private void FilterByDate()
{
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}

private void HandleAddFoodValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddFood(addItemModel.FoodId, changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    addItemModel.FoodId = -1;
}

private void HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddExercise(addItemModel.ExerciseId, changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    addItemModel.ExerciseId = -1;
}

class AddItemModel
{
    public int FoodId { get; set; }
    public int ExerciseId { get; set; }
}

class ChangeDateModel
{
    public DateTime FilterDate { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>Go back to the browser, and you should be able to track your calories:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that I have finished migrating the code from WebForms to Blazor, I will secure the app so that no one except me knows how much sweets I eat 😃.</p>

 Securing Your Blazor Application 

<p>In this tutorial, I will use Okta to quickly secure the API in order not to have to roll my own identity provider and deal with all the tricky details. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication, and all OpenID Connect flows out of the box. These features take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>I will use <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> to manage my Okta account and register a new application for this project.</p>

<p>Run <code>okta start</code> if you don’t have an Okta account, or run <code>okta login</code> if you already have one.</p>

<p>Once you configure Okta CLI with your account, run <code>okta apps create</code> to create a new Okta application. I will use CaloriesTracker again as the name of the app.</p>

<p>On the Type of Application step, enter 1 to select Web, and on the next step, enter 4 for Other.</p>

<p>I will use <code>https://localhost:44360/authorization-code/callback</code> and accept the suggested URL for Post Logout Redirect URI for the redirect URI. When you hit enter, the Okta CLI creates a new app and saves the configuration to your home directory in <code>.okta.env</code> file:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, go back to Visual Studio and add <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
</code>   

<p>Next, open the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file, add a new section <code>Okta</code> below the <code>Logging</code> section, and put in your app’s details. Copy <code>clientId</code> and <code>clientSecret</code> from the <code>.okta.env</code>:</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": ""
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now, go the <code>Startup</code> class and add this code in <code>ConfigureServices</code> method:</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
{
    OktaDomain = Configuration["Okta:Domain"],
    ClientId = Configuration["Okta:ClientId"],
    ClientSecret = Configuration["Okta:ClientSecret"]
});
</code>   

<p>Also, add the following line to the <code>Configure()</code> method after the <code>app.UseRouting();</code> line:</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
</code>   

<p>Next, let’s create <code>login</code> and <code>logout</code> pages. As Blazor uses SignalR for the client and server-side communication and Okta uses the OpenID protocol that relies on HTTP, you need to perform authentication outside of the Blazor app.</p>

<p>To solve this issue, I will create two Razor pages for these endpoints. Run the following commands in a command shell:</p>

   <code>dotnet new page -n Login -na CaloriesTracker.Blazor.Pages -o Pages
dotnet new page -n Logout -na CaloriesTracker.Blazor.Pages -o Pages
</code>   

<p>This code will create <code>Login.cshtml</code> and <code>Logout.cshtml</code> pages in the project’s Pages folder.</p>

<p>Open the <code>Login.cshtml.cs</code> and change the <code>OnGet</code> method like this:</p>

   <code>public async Task OnGet(string redirectUri)
{
    await HttpContext.ChallengeAsync(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties
    {
        RedirectUri = redirectUri
    });
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>HttpContext.ChallengeAsync</code> method starts the authentication process with Okta based on the configuration I did in the <code>Startup</code> class.</p>

<p>Similarly, replace the <code>OnGet</code> method in <code>Logout.cshtml.cs</code> with this:</p>

   <code>public async Task OnGet()
{
    await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" });
    await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
</code>   

<p>This code ends the Okta session and signs out the user.</p>

<p>Now, let’s plug these pages into the Blazor app.</p>

<p>Open the <code>App.razor</code> file and replace it’s content with this:</p>

   <code>&lt;Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly"&gt;
    &lt;Found Context="routeData"&gt;
        &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
        &lt;Authorizing&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Authorizing please wait...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/Authorizing&gt;
        &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Sorry&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You're not authorized to see this page. You need to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;/AuthorizeRouteView&gt;
    &lt;/Found&gt;
    &lt;NotFound&gt;    
        &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;    
    &lt;/NotFound&gt;
&lt;/Router&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>AuthorizeRouteView</code> component ensures that you can see only the pages that the user is authorized to visit.</p>

<p>After this, open the <code>CaloriesTracking.razor</code> component and add <code>@attribute [Authorize]</code> at the top of the code so that only authorized users can view it.</p>

<p>Finally, you need a way to authenticate users. I will create a new component, <code>AccountControl</code> in the <code>Shared</code> folder and add in the following code:</p>

   <code>@inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;a href="logout"&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="login?redirectUri=@(NavigationManager.Uri)"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>AuthorizeView</code> view will either display a Log out link for the user or a Log in link for authentication. The <code>AuthorizeView</code> component exposes a <code>context</code> variable, which I use to get the information about the logged-in user.</p>

<p>Put the component in the <code>MainLayout.razor</code> file above the About link and run the app. When you click the Calories Tracker you will see a message that you don’t have access to this page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Log in link, and the app will redirect you to Okta for authentication. When you log in, Okta sends you back to the app, where you’ll be able to access the page that only authenticated users can see:</p>

<p></p>

<p>That’s it! You have now finished migrating a WebForms project to Blazor and secured it with Okta.</p>

<p>Open banking is rapidly growing and responding to the call for greater consumer empowerment,&nbsp; giving people and businesses across the globe easy and secure access to their financial data so they can better manage their money, secure loans, and make payments. Finicity’s connections cover 95% of direct deposit accounts in North America. Today, our signed data access agreements with most of the nation’s largest financial institutions, credit card companies, and wealth management institutions cover 63% of our open banking platform traffic with direct API access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect that our direct-API Data Access Agreements will increase coverage of our data traffic to over 80% by the end of 2021.&nbsp; Direct-API connections greatly reduce the use of user credentials in the financial services market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have clearly set the industry bar and expect to continue to lead the market with direct data access.&nbsp;</p>
 Finicity’s Continued Leadership in Financial Data Access 
<p>Signing data access agreements has always been an integral part of keeping the consumer first by enhancing simplicity, control, and security. In Q2, Finicity has continued to build strong partnerships by signing DAA’s with leading financial institutions such as <a href="https://www.navyfederal.org/resources/articles/security/securing-your-financial-data.html">Navy Federal Credit Union</a>, <a href="https://ir.jackhenry.com/news-releases/news-release-details/jack-henry-finicity-partner-empower-community-financial">Jack Henry</a>, and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/green-dot-data-access-agreement/">Green Dot</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity’s integration to Jack Henry’s&nbsp; <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3152246-1&amp;h=494671961&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fbanno.com%2Fdigital-toolkit%2F&amp;a=Banno+Digital+Toolkit">Banno Digital Toolkit</a> enables community financial institutions to provide consumers with the freedom to control, access, and share their financial data, creating a real-time picture of their financial health. The more than 400 community financial institutions using the Banno Digital Platform will be able to deliver this holistic financial experience to consumers through secure API access to third-party financial institutions, fintechs, and financial partners of their choice at zero lift and zero cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greendot.com/">Green Dot</a> and <a href="https://www.navyfederal.org/">Navy Federal Credit Union</a> will connect their customer’s bank accounts to Finicity’s open banking platform so they’ll be able to link their accounts to third-party apps to connect, manage, and move their money securely, manage how and what personal data is accessed by those third parties, revoke that access when desired, and have more transparency as they use their data.</p>
<p>These new relationships, on top of the ones that have been fostered since 2017, help expand the reach of our open banking platform and pave the path for evolution in the financial industry. With a greater network, more data can be attained providing higher quality products and services.</p>
 Finicity’s Commitment to Data Stewardship 
<p>Open banking has improved innovation, accessibility, and convenience and has changed the way people and financial institutions experience money. In the United States, Finicity is leveraging its best-in-class data connections as we continue to add direct API connectivity for financial institutions.</p>
<p>To provide access to real-time information, the network of data is expanding and providing more opportunities. Data Access Agreements (DAAs) are put in place to provide access to financial data to expedite the financial experience in the digital age, allowing for innovative services that benefit both the financial institution and consumer. The agreements also set the stage for how the parties involved will communicate and exchange financial data based on consumer consent.</p>
<p>Finicity’s commitment to responsible data practices is defined by the CATTS principles – control, access, transparency, traceability, and security.

<p>As global demand for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) continues to grow, Northern Block and German-based <a href="https://esatus.com/">esatus AG</a> announce a strategic partnership that will be very beneficial for Governments and Large Enterprise.</p>
<p>New to SSI?? Here’s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjbN9ulHXIU">Introductory Video on SSI</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this partnership is to help organizations exploring the deployment of digital wallet and verifiable credential solutions. The partnership enables organizations to continue reaping the benefits of their Identity and Access Management (IAM) investments, while parallelly moving certain processes towards SSI.</p>
<p>esatus has worked in the SSI space since 2015 and has contributed to many publications about SSI. They have developed their own identity and access management solution&nbsp;SOWL, based on Self-Sovereign Identity technology.</p>
<p>More recently, esatus has helped build the IDunion consortium, a public-private partnership of companies and institutions, which implemented and governs the Hyperledger Indy-based IDunion public identity utility. IDunion’s aim is to establish one of the leading and most secure identity networks in Europe, in harmony with the European legal framework (especially eIDAS and GDPR). See the SSI Orbit Podcast: <a href="https://northernblock.io/roles-of-government-and-private-sector-in-digital-id/">The Roles of Government &amp; The Private Sector in a Digital ID Program, with&nbsp;Sebastian Manhart</a> to learn more about Digital ID in Europe and where eIDAS is heading.</p>
<p>As Canada itself moves towards the use of Verifiable Credentials within their digital identity strategies, being able to leverage learnings from real national use cases in Europe are important things to take into consideration.</p>
<blockquote><p>“More and more countries are moving towards user-centric digital identity solutions. That means that global partnerships like these are crucial to ensure compatibility between various trust ecosystems. We’ve been long collaborators with the esatus team. They bring a wealth of IAM knowledge and expertise, which is a phenomenal use case for SSI,” – Mathieu Glaude, CEO Northern Block.</p></blockquote>
<p>Through their NB Orbit SSI Platform, the first commercial-grade&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">verifiable credential platform in Canada</a>, Northern Block has been focused on facilitating the deployment of trust ecosystems, while enabling organizations and consortiums to build decentralized business models. NB Orbit is a scalable way to build ecosystem solutions with authentic data, with the onboarding of Verified People and Verified Businesses built into the core.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Northern Block has a great platform for creating ecosystem solutions. They’ve built a large network of credential issuers in North America that make it easy to kick-start an ecosystem solution focused on authentic data. With this partnership, we will now be able to conduct quick pilot projects demonstrating how SSI and existing IAM investments complement each other and can bring value,” – Dr. André Kudra, CIO at esatus AG.</p></blockquote>
<p>Northern Block will leverage esatus’ proven technology stack that connects SSI with standard authentication and authorization sources. This means that Verifiable Credential and Digital Wallet solutions can seamlessly be deployed with workforces and customers, while integrating with SAML, AD, oAuth2, OIDC and more.</p>
<p>esatus remains focused on the European market, while Northern Block has a strong focus on the Canadian and North American market.</p>
<p>Both companies are founding members of the Trust over IP Foundation, and share a common goal of enabling digital trust in our everyday lives. For details about the Trust over IP Foundation, visit:&nbsp;<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">https://trustoverip.org/.</a></p>

 Julia Reinhardt, Privacy and AI Governance Professional, on data policy, GDPR, and its impact on&nbsp;SMEs <p>In the latest episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to Julia Reinhardt. She is a San Francisco-based expert in Artificial Intelligence governance and privacy and public policy consultant. As a Mozilla Fellow in Residence, Julia assesses the opportunities and limitations of European approaches on trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Silicon Valley and their potential for U.S. businesses and advocacy. During our conversation, Julia spoke about the different facets of GDPR's impact on Silicon Valley and the challenges of upcoming AI regulation. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> Impact of GDPR on Silicon&nbsp;valley <p>GDPR has had notable and immediate impacts worldwide. It has also brought awareness to Silicon Valley that privacy is important to people in Europe and other world regions. It’s a human right that in the US, many had not considered significant. The global conversation around privacy has shifted in the past three years since 2018 and so have the laws. As a direct result of GDPR in Europe, countries like Japan, Brazil, India, and China are in the process of passing GDPR inspired privacy laws. In addition, California has a new privacy law, which went into effect in 2020 due to&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>GDPR has also shown Silicon Valley that one of their biggest markets, Europe has its own set of rules, and the US has to follow them to be a player there and earn money in the region. And as a result, many US-based organizations that process personal data of people worldwide have decided to apply GDPR and extend all the rights that go with it to their customers who don’t need to be European residents and live outside of Europe. It gives them an edge in global compliance, and it’s easier for them to handle complaints and requests. In addition, GDPR offers them a legal framework and a set of standards.</p><p>“I need to mention that a disappointing factor with the GDPR laws is the enforcement. Even when tech companies do get hit with billion-dollar fines, for them, it’s a tap on the wrist. And so far, GDPR hasn’t changed the underlying business models, the way money is made on the internet, and surveilling people’s behavior. So it’s not just the business model of a company; it is the economic model on which the entire internet is based — that doesn’t have privacy, top of mind. Changing that requires fundamental and probably painful adjustments to the way things have been structured. That’s something that GDPR so far hasn’t been able to achieve. And that is definitely a bit disappointing.”</p> AI regulations in Europe and their global challenges <p>Julia worked as a German diplomat for almost 15 years, managing bilateral relations, navigating crisis, communication, heading up high-level protocol, participating in EU negotiation processes, and promoting innovation and outreach in the Western&nbsp;US.</p><p>As part of her work today, she mentions that she intends to make sure that the upcoming AI regulation from Europe does not again cause that lagging behind for small players because in the field of AI — size matters. “The more data you can gather, the better your AI system works. We’re already pretty far down the road to monopolization because big players in the market have access to an impressive range of data. They can also afford to gather high-quality data, which then enables them to build better-performing AI. And for small-scale providers, what’s most important is the clarity of the guidance. The draft that the European Commission tabled also has been a very long time in the making. It’s the most ambitious and the most comprehensive attempt at reining the risks linked to the deployment of AI that we have seen so far across the globe. It’s a bold new step.” You can read an analysis of the AI regulation proposal&nbsp;here.</p><p>Now in 2021, we’re at the stage of transforming these principles into practical rules and regulations. The rules that the European Commission proposed wouldn’t cover all AI systems. For instance, they do cover systems deemed to pose a significant risk to the safety and fundamental rights of people living in Europe. It’s a risk-based approach, and it has several layers. And those layers have different rules for different classes of AI systems; some are prohibited, some are considered high risk, and some follow specific rules only. And then others where, you know, they just say you have to be more transparent.</p> Going deeper into regulations: Code testing for Algorithms <p>You have to know in which category your AI system falls. For some uses of AI, the commission proposes an outright ban and says it’s an unacceptable threat to citizens. For example, an AI system causes physical or psychological harm by manipulating people’s behavior or exploiting their vulnerable abilities, like age or disability. Other examples are social scoring systems where people collect points and facial recognition in public spaces by law enforcement authorities — not all facial recognition is banned but those used by police in public areas. Although, there are exceptions.</p><p>Most of the regulatory draft focuses on AI, which is considered high risk, and what is high risk is defined in the regulatory draft. So that’s kind of problematic uses in the recruiting field in the employment admissions context, determining a person’s creditworthiness, or eligibility for public services and benefits, and some applications used in law enforcement and security and judiciary. And for those, these systems have to meet different requirements and undergo a conformity assessment before they are in the European&nbsp;market.</p><p>To ensure that an AI system complies with several requirements around serious risk management, it has to use data sets in training, validation, and testing that are relevant, representative, free of errors, etc. Documentation about a high-risk AI system must be really extensive and very precise — why you chose certain designs? Why you designed it in a specific way? The keyword is always human oversight. So high-risk AI systems must be designed to allow people to understand the capabilities and limitations of a system and counter so-called automation bias. Also, if necessary, reverse or override the output. It’s like code testing for algorithms.</p> Loopholes in AI regulation: Not the final&nbsp;world <p>The European Parliament and other bodies in Europe have already called for much stricter rules in some draft elements. In addition, certain member states believe that it should be more stringent in some cases. However, this is not the final&nbsp;word.</p><p>“In my personal opinion, I do think that the exceptions such as in facial recognition are too wide. It’s just difficult when you ban very specific uses of facial recognition but then actually in industry or private uses — there’s no ban at all. Even in the uses of law enforcement, you have certain areas where it can be used. Practically speaking, law enforcement in Europe will buy facial recognition systems on the market, wherever they’re produced, and use them in those specific cases that there would be allowed to. How do you really want to make sure that they don’t use them for other things? I think that’s a huge loophole. I do think that facial recognition has the potential to actually undermine our free society. In the end, so there’s a lot to criticize about this&nbsp;draft.”</p> Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:   2:16 — 6:56 Julia’s journey from being a German diplomat to now an advisor bin data policy and regulations in the&nbsp;US.  6:56 — 12:48 GDPR’s impact on Silicon&nbsp;Valley  15:55 — 20:38 Impact of GDPR on Big tech and SMEs in the&nbsp;U.S  20:38 — 25:53 How do the proposed AI regulations impact the&nbsp;U.S?  25:53 — 29:58 Detailed analysis of AI regulations  29:58 — 35:55 Loopholes and challenges of the AI regulation?  35:55 — End Does innovation and AI regulation go hand-in-hand?  <p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

  <p>The Networking and Cryptography library (NaCl pronounced “salt”) is a software library that provides the core operations required to build cryptographic tools. Sodium is a fork of NaCl with an extended API; it’s portable, and binaries are available to be used by various programming languages and operating systems. It comes in the form of a library called <code>libsodium</code>.</p>

<p>Although there are several Python and Go cryptography libraries, it is primarily a matter of personal choice which one to use. One advantage of <code>libsodium</code> is that it is available for many languages.</p>

<p>Today, we will use <code>libsodium</code> in Python to encrypt messages and decrypt them using <code>libsodium</code> in Go. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>NOTE: You can find the code for this project on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/python-go-libsodium-example.git">GitHub</a>.</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Libsodium Application 

<p>First, if you don’t already have Python on your computer, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install a recent version of Python 3</a>.</p>

<p>Next, create a directory where all of our future code will go:</p>

   <code>mkdir libsodium
cd libsodium
</code>   

<p>To avoid issues running the wrong version of Python and its dependencies, we recommend creating a virtual environment so that the commands <code>python</code> and <code>pip</code> run the correct versions:</p>

   <code>python3 -m venv .venv
</code>   

<p>This creates a directory called <code>.venv</code> containing the Python binaries and dependencies. The new directory should be added to the <code>.gitignore</code> file and then activated for use:</p>

   <code>source .venv/bin/activate
</code>   

<p>You can run the following command to see which version you are running:</p>

   <code>python --version
</code>   

<p>Next, install the PyNaCl library:</p>

   <code>pip install pynacl
</code>   

<p>Next, if you haven’t already installed Go on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, make the directory a Go module and install the Go crypto library:</p>

   <code>go mod init crypto
go get golang.org/x/crypto
go mod download golang.org/x/sys
</code>   

 What is Public Key Encryption 
<p>Public key or asymmetric encryption requires the generation of two numbers called keys. One key is the private key, which only the owner knows. The second key is public; it is published and widely known.</p>

<p>A message encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted using the public key. Anyone who possesses the public key can decrypt the message. The public key holder knows the message could only have been encrypted by the private key owner.</p>

<p>Conversely, a message encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key. You can be sure that only one person can view the message. The strength of the encryption depends on how much “effort” it takes to break the math without access to the decryption key.</p>

<p>A secure way of exchanging messages is to use two sets of keys, one for each party involved. Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob and ensure that only Bob can receive it. Bob wants to ensure that only Alice could have sent it. To achieve this, Alice first encrypts the message using her private key, then she encrypts it with Bob’s public key.  To recover the original message, Bob decrypts the message with his private key, and then with Alice’s public key.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The above explanation is simplified slightly. In the example below, Bob’s private key and Alice’s public key are used to generate an encryption key.  The same key is generated using Alice’s private and Bob’s public key, <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption#purpose">creating a shared key</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The encryption and decryption processes require complex computation. Low-level libraries do exist for doing this, but they are not very convenient to use. Using <code>libsodium</code> greatly simplifies the process.</p>

 How to Create Key Pairs with <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>First, we are going to write a Python program to generate public-private key pairs. Create a script called <code>generate_keys.py</code> containing the following code:</p>

   <code>import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey
from nacl.encoding import HexEncoder
import sys

def write(name, hex, sp):
    filename = 'key_' + name + '_' + sp 
    file = open(filename, 'wb')
    file.write(hex)
    file.close()

def make_keys(name):
    sk = PrivateKey.generate()
    write(name, sk.encode(encoder=HexEncoder), 'sk')
    pk = sk.public_key
    write(name, pk.encode(encoder=HexEncoder), 'pk')

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage:", sys.argv[0], "name")
    sys.exit()

make_keys(sys.argv[1])
</code>   

<p>The program uses <code>libsodium</code> to generate a key pair. It also uses <code>libsodium</code> to encode the keys as hexadecimal strings for portability. These hexadecimal key strings are written to files using <code>write()</code> function. The <code>make_keys()</code> function generates a public-private key pair. The <code>PrivateKey.generate()</code> function returns the private key.</p>

<p>Libsodium objects have an <code>encode()</code> function to encode the object. In this case, it uses <code>HexEncoder</code>. The public key is an attribute on the private key object. The name of the key owner is passed as a command-line argument.</p>

<p>Now run the program to generate keys for Alice and Bob:</p>

   <code>python generate_keys.py alice
python generate_keys.py bob
</code>   

<p>The files <code>key_alice_sk</code>, <code>key_alice_pk</code>, <code>key_bob_sk</code>, and <code>key_bob_pk</code> should have been created.</p>

 Encrypt a Message with <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>The message to be encrypted is a text file containing the poem “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll. The poem itself is somewhat cryptic, as the meaning of the words is open to interpretation! Rather fittingly, “Jabberwocky” was first published in the book Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.</p>

<p>Download the “Jabberwocky” poem to <code>jabberwocky.txt</code>:</p>

   <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/libsodium/main/Jabberwocky.txt &gt; Jabberwocky.txt
</code>   

<p>Libsodium makes it very easy to encrypt messages. It uses a <code>Box</code> object constructed from your private key and the recipient’s public key. The box is then used to encrypt a message. Create a file called <code>encrypt.py</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey, PublicKey, Box
from nacl.encoding import HexEncoder
import sys

class EncryptFile :
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.sk = PrivateKey(self.get_key(sender, 'sk'), encoder=HexEncoder)
        self.pk = PublicKey(self.get_key(receiver, 'pk'), encoder=HexEncoder)

    def get_key(self, name, suffix):
        filename = 'key_' + name + '_' + suffix
        file = open(filename, 'rb')
        data = file.read()
        file.close()
        return data

    def encrypt(self, textfile, encfile):
        box = Box(self.sk, self.pk)
        tfile = open(textfile, 'rb')
        text = tfile.read()
        tfile.close()
        etext = box.encrypt(text)
        efile = open(encfile, 'wb')
        efile.write(etext)
        efile.close()

encrypter = EncryptFile('alice', 'bob')
encrypter.encrypt('Jabberwocky.txt', 'message.enc')
print('Done!')
</code>   

<p>We use the names of the sender and the receiver to construct the  <code>EncryptFile</code> class. <code>EncryptFile</code> uses the <code>get_key()</code> helper function to read the hexadecimal encoded key from a file. Libsodium <code>PublicKey</code>and <code>PrivateKey</code> objects are constructed from the encoded keys. The <code>encrypt()</code> function constructs a <code>Box</code> object from the sender’s private key and the recipient’s public key. Then the message is read from a text file as a byte string and is encrypted by the box. The encrypted message is saved to a file for transmission.</p>

<p>Note that this generates a 24-byte random, one-time-use number called a nonce (“Number used ONCE”). The purpose of the nonce is to ensure that if the same message is encrypted more than once, the resulting encrypted message will be different. The nonce forms the first 24 bytes of the encrypted message.</p>

<p>Encrypt the poem by running:</p>

   <code>python encrypt.py
</code>   

 Decrypt a Message with Go and <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>We are going to write a simple Go program that can decrypt a message. Create a file named <code>decrypt.go</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"

	"golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box"
)

var PublicKey [32]byte
var SecretKey [32]byte

func GetKeys() {
	sk, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("key_bob_sk")
	keysk, _ := hex.DecodeString(string(sk))
	copy(SecretKey[:], keysk)
	pk, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("key_alice_pk")
	keypk, _ := hex.DecodeString(string(pk))
	copy(PublicKey[:], keypk)
}

func Decrypt() {
	enc, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("message.enc")
	var nonce [24]byte
	copy(nonce[:], enc[:24])
	crypto := enc[24:]
	message, _ := box.Open(nil, crypto, &amp;nonce, &amp;PublicKey, &amp;SecretKey)
	fmt.Println(string(message))
}

func main() {
	GetKeys()
	Decrypt()
}
</code>   

<p>Go is a strongly typed language, so we have to create 32-byte arrays to store the keys. The <code>GetKeys()</code> function reads Bob’s private key and Alice’s public key for the files. They are converted from hexadecimal strings into byte arrays and copied into the fixed-length arrays. The <code>Decrypt</code> function reads the encrypted message into a byte array. The nonce needs to be separated from the encrypted message and copied into a 24-byte array. The <code>box.Open()</code> function performs the decryption and then prints the decrypted message.</p>

<p>Run the application to see the poem “Jabberwocky” restored:</p>

   <code>go run decrypt.go
</code>   

 What is Secret Key Encryption 

<p>Secret-key encryption uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt a message. It is commonly used as a faster alternative to public-key encryption. The key itself is a fixed-length random number. As there is only a single key, both the sender and recipient need a copy of it. This requires a key exchange which is often performed out of band or by using public-key encryption.</p>

 Encrypt a Message with <code>libsodium</code> and Secret Key 

<p>We will again encrypt the poem “Jabberwocky,” but this time using secret-key encryption. For convenience, we will again generate and store the key in a file:</p>

   <code>gpg --gen-random 2 32 &gt; key_secret
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Secure key exchange must be used between parties holding any shared secret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Create a file called <code>encrypt_shared.py</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey, PublicKey, Box
from nacl.encoding import HexEncoder
from nacl.secret import SecretBox
import sys

class Encrypter :
    def __init__(self):
        file = open('key_secret', 'rb')
        self.key = file.read()
        file.close()

    def encrypt(self, textfile, encfile):
        box = SecretBox(self.key)
        tfile = open(textfile, 'rb')
        text = tfile.read()
        tfile.close()
        etext = box.encrypt(text)
        efile = open(encfile, 'wb')
        efile.write(etext)
        efile.close()

encrypter = Encrypter()
encrypter.encrypt('Jabberwocky.txt', 'message.sec')
print('Done!')
</code>   

<p>This time the constructor creates a random secret key and stores it in a file. The <code>encrypt()</code> function uses a <code>SecretBox</code> to encrypt the message. Once again a 24-byte nonce is automatically created and prepended to the encrypted message.</p>

<p>Run the script to create the key and encrypted message files:</p>

   <code>python encrypt_shared.py
</code>   

 Decrypt a Message with <code>libsodium</code> and Secret Key 

<p>The Go code for decryption is quite simple. Create a file called <code>decryptsec.go</code> containing the following code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"

	"golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox"
)

var SecretKey [32]byte

func GetKey() {
	sk, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("key_secret")
	copy(SecretKey[:], sk)
}

func Decrypt() {
	enc, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("message.sec")
	var nonce [24]byte
	copy(nonce[:], enc[:24])
	crypto := enc[24:]
	message, _ := secretbox.Open(nil, crypto, &amp;nonce, &amp;SecretKey)
	fmt.Println(string(message))
}

func main() {
	GetKey()
	Decrypt()
}
</code>   

<p>In this case, only the secret key is extracted from the file using the <code>GetKey()</code> function. The program reads the encrypted message from a file and extracts the nonce. Finally, the function <code>secretbox.Open()</code> decrypts the message using the nonce and the secret key.</p>

<p>Run the program to see the “Jabberwocky” poem restored:</p>

   <code>go run decryptsec.go
</code>   

 Learn more about Python, Go, and <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>NaCl, Libsodium, and the language-specific wrappers around them simplify the process of encrypting and decrypting messages. Most cryptographic libraries provide low-level operations that are complex to use. The box mechanism performs encryption and decryption in a single function call. All you need is the data, the key or keys, and a nonce.

<p>There is a theoretical elegance to a fully transparent, informed, granular&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/consent-2/">consent</a>&nbsp;approach in consumer&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;— but is it really viable?</p>



<p>Consent is good in theory. It’s a way for an individual to give explicit permission to permit or deny particular types of data processing or sharing by a service. But in practice, consent alone falls short on many fronts.</p>



 Consent fatigue is real. 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-to-avoid-consent-fatigue/">Consent fatigue</a>&nbsp;is where a user grows so weary of the frequent and complex consent requests from digital interactions, they click past them to avoid the time suck and brain drain. The best example of consent fatigue is privacy notices. Back in 2008,&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-to-avoid-consent-fatigue/">researchers</a>&nbsp;estimated that the average US user would likely encounter 1,462 privacy policies a year and consume around&nbsp;<a href="https://techland.time.com/2012/03/06/youd-need-76-work-days-to-read-all-your-privacy-policies-each-year/">76 days</a>&nbsp;if they read them in full. Fourteen years on, privacy policies are a mainstay of our digital lives.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-attitudes-and-experiences-with-privacy-policies-and-laws/">Pew Research</a>&nbsp;reports 81 percent of adults are being asked at least monthly to agree to a privacy policy but only 9 per cent are always reading the policy before agreeing to the terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can we rely on ‘informed consent’ if the&nbsp;informed&nbsp;part is largely missing?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Consent doesn’t scale well from the consumer’s perspective. 



<p></p>



<p>Most people visit a small number of sites frequently and a large number of sites infrequently. And most don’t want a blanket setting for all the sites and services they use. Global opt-in or opt-out isn’t necessarily viable for the way many of us interact online, where we may want different choices for different types of web sites or services. Telling each site what we do and don’t want is cumbersome and resource-intensive. Circle back to consent fatigue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while the&nbsp;<a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a>&nbsp;appears to reduce the amount of effort a user needs to expend to exercise some data sharing choices consistently across multiple web sites, the web site or service must be set up to react appropriately to receiving a GPC directive from a user’s app or browser. We’re still better off with the GPC than without it, but this type of limitation voids its potential as a universal panacea without regulatory enforcement.</p>



 Consent brings an unbalanced cost-to-effort ratio.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Expanding on our last point, web tech expert&nbsp;<a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Robin</a><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/"> </a><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Berjon</a>&nbsp;says: “All that consent does is that it offloads privacy labor to the user, and only under very specific conditions does it increase the user’s autonomy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a reason why data brokers love consent so much and won’t ever stop talking about “transparency and choice“: it works in favor of whichever party has the time to invest in creating a consent funnel, and that’s never individuals.”</p>



<p>Of course, some services are trying to comply with regulations in the absence of an industry standard for consent notice design—and this inconsistency is yet another issue with a whole privacy model relying on consent.</p>



 Consent is easily manipulated.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Robin Berjon</a>&nbsp;weighs in on this point too: “Digital self-determination in the face of privacy issues is highly manipulable and that’s even&nbsp;without&nbsp;dark patterns.” Add in&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">dark patterns</a>&nbsp;by services capitalizing on fatigued consumers and suddenly users are giving up far more data and privacy than they intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/10/most-eu-cookie-consent-notices-are-meaningless-or-manipulative-study-finds/">EU study</a>&nbsp;into cookie consent notices reveals this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“…&nbsp;the majority are placed at the bottom of the screen (58%); not blocking the interaction with the website (93%); and offering no options other than a confirmation button that does not do anything (86%). So no choice at all then.</p>



<p>A majority also try to nudge users towards consenting (57%) — such as by using ‘dark pattern’ techniques like using a color to highlight the ‘agree’ button (which if clicked accepts privacy-unfriendly defaults) vs displaying a much less visible link to ‘more options’ so that pro-privacy choices are buried off screen.</p>



<p>And while they found that nearly all cookie notices (92%) contained a link to the site’s privacy policy, only a third (39%) mention the specific purpose of the data collection or who can access the data (21%).”</p>



<p>It should come as no surprise that big platforms like Facebook and Google are masters at using dark patterns for consent. They design the process to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/07/26/privacy-debate-reveals-how-big-techs-transparency-and-user-control-arguments-fall">make it difficult</a>&nbsp;for the user to set privacy choices and understand them. Most consumers twiddle all the dials and think they’ve set all possible privacy protections, when in fact they have not.</p>



<p>What’s more, the guidance from big platforms on how to make good privacy choices is often not readily consumable and is intentionally skewed in their favor. They want to keep the data tap turned on full.</p>



 Consent can be convoluted. 



<p></p>



<p>Even when companies are trying to do the right thing, they tend to offer consumers privacy choices and implications that are difficult to grasp. In the GDPR for example, consent is spoken about in terms of criteria:&nbsp;informed,&nbsp;transparent,&nbsp;timely,&nbsp;contextual,&nbsp;granular. Regulations almost add to the convolution for the consumer.</p>



 Consent is only one (limited) tool in the toolkit. 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Berjon</a>&nbsp;reminds us: “The answer to problems caused by consent isn’t more consent, automated consent, or consent that covers more processing. It’s to use consent where and when it is the right tool to increase people’s autonomy, and to stop pretending that you can bang nails in with it in all the other cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He notes: “Lindsey Barrett summarized the situation well when she described notice and choice as ‘<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3354129">a method of privacy regulation which promises transparency and agency but delivers neither’.</a>”</p>



 So, what’s the outlook for consent? 



<p></p>



<p>Despite growing concern over consent alone as a mechanism for protecting&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>,&nbsp;no one is taking it off the table just yet. Consent is one of six lawful bases to process personal data under&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">Article 6</a>&nbsp;of the GDPR. Consent is also present in other data protection regulations too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In looking to tame the beast, IAPP contributor&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-there-a-role-for-consent-in-privacy/">Robert Gelman</a>&nbsp;wonders whether “it’s possible that consent can play a meaningful and fair role in consumer privacy if an independent third party sets the terms of consent rather than a business desperate to have consumers agree to its terms?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He says: “Perhaps a truly neutral third party standing between the consumer and the business seeking choices involving privacy might produce a better and fairer outcome.”</p>



<p>In exploring the notion of a third-party consent mechanism, Gelman cites the US Do Not Call Registry and Apple’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT feature</a>&nbsp;as two data points proving a viable role for third parties: “In both cases, a third party sets the terms and the methodology for consumer choice. In the one case, Apple set the terms. In the other case, the FTC did. This is not what happens when a website unilaterally sets the terms of consent. A one-sided approach is why consent does nothing for consumers today.”</p>



 Our position on consent 



<p></p>



<p>Since Anonyome Labs started in 2014 we have felt that while nothing is wrong with consent approaches in theory, the consumer needs more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that if regulations aren’t toothy on enforcement, it will result in big companies doing the wrong thing anyway. Regulations alone aren’t going to protect consumers from insolent companies and those beyond reach (outside the jurisdiction but doing business within it).</p>



<p>Consent is unnecessary when dealing with companies whose interests are aligned with the consumers’. But if interests aren’t aligned, a company may work hard to make it difficult for the user to withhold or withdraw consent.</p>



<p>Our consumer app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;steps in when the consumer can’t make consent choices in their favor or it’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/fight-the-fatigue-data-privacy-really-does-matter/">all too hard</a>. MySudo is a useful tool because it mitigates consent where the user needs to and keeps it in check where the user wants more control over their personal data.</p>



<p>It’s unlikely the privacy problem will ever be fully solved. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and the capabilities in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, our business toolkit for rapidly deploying branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions, will always have a place and their role will grow ever more important.</p>

					<p>The worldwide adoption of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) has the potential to increase people’s access to goods and services, including for disadvantaged individuals across the globe. For example, more than one billion people in the world do not have a government ID¹, causing them to be excluded from a variety of services like banking and healthcare. If done properly, SSI can empower disadvantaged individuals with a digital identity that they control and can easily prove to others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic discussed these topics and more as we participated in a panel discussion titled “SSI for Economic Empowerment: Lessons from Africa” at the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> Global Forum 2021. Anna Johnson, Trinsic’s Director of Marketing, was the panel moderator, and the four panelists were:<br><br></p>  Fabian Portmann, CTO, <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/">Farmer Connect</a>  Bryan Pon, Director of Strategy, <a href="https://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a>  Thea Sommerseth Myhren, CEO, <a href="https://www.diwala.io/">Diwala</a>  Lohan Spies, CTO, <a href="https://www.yoma.africa/">Yoma</a>  <p><br>All four of the companies listed above are implementing SSI solutions within the African continent, and three of the four (Kiva, Yoma, and Farmer Connect) are using Trinsic to do so. In this event, the panelists shared insights from each of their respective SSI projects which range from empowering African youth to build a digital CV to connect them to future employers to empowering smallholder farmers with supply chain credentials that make some of them bankable for the first time. Below is the video recording and some highlights from the discussion.</p>

					<p>One of the main points of discussion revolved around identifying the unique properties of SSI that make it adept at economically empowering people in Africa. The panelists had varying thoughts and perspectives to share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lohan from Yoma focused on the fact that many people in Africa do not have any form of identity—not even a national identity. He explained that SSI will make a massive impact from an economic perspective because SSI makes it possible for those who have no form of identity to build it up from scratch to the point where they have access to services they may have not had access to before. He also talked about the fact that people can take the credentials wherever they go (even cross-border) and use them to prove things about themselves and unlock economic opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bryan from Kiva talked specifically about two SSI properties that Kiva’s stakeholders find of value. The first is the ability to have peer-to-peer connections where the verifier of the credential doesn’t have to “phone home” to the issuing party to authenticate a credential. The second is the ability to support multiple credential issuers without having to harmonize or sync their databases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the discussion continued, the panelists talked about the current challenges they are facing with implementing their SSI solutions in Africa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fabian from Farmer Connect brought up their focus on solving the end user adoption challenge which is due to multiple factors including end users’ literacy, access to cellular networks, or lack of smart phones. He stressed the importance of making the technology inclusive enough to address these circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thea from Diwala also focused on end user adoption and specifically mentioned the challenge of onboarding. She explained that in remote areas, people may not have an email or a phone number, so standard onboarding methods become much more complicated. She emphasized the importance of teaching digital literacy where needed and the importance of building solutions that are inclusive so no one gets left behind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To wrap up the discussion, the panelists discussed what was needed for SSI to be ultimately successful in Africa. Overall, the panelists shared the same sentiment that can be summarized with a quote from Thea when she said, “I think the future for SSI [in Africa] is collaboration. We all need to work together in terms of building the standards, building open source, and understanding how we actually enable this ecosystem to work across the whole sector.”</p>

What clear legislation might look&nbsp;like  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. Crypto is growing up — and that means regulations are&nbsp;incoming <p>With Bitcoin touching $1 trillion in market capitalization and the explosion of DeFi and NFTs this cycle, crypto has fully captured the hearts and minds — or at least the attention — of the mainstream — which includes lawmakers and regulators alike.</p><p>One indicator? China — which has become somewhat of a bellwether for where things might be heading Westward, in part due to how the government is structured over there. If China decides to do something, they’ll just do it. It’s not quite as straightforward for the Biden administration.</p><p>And what has China been doing? <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-08-01/china-tech-crackdown-communist-party-policy-changes-behind-1-trillion-selloff">Cracking down on Big Tech</a> — for starters. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/china-cracks-down-on-crypto-related-services-in-ongoing-war-on-bitcoin.html">But also&nbsp;crypto</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f6c876-22bb-498c-a425-78287455a3e1">the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p><blockquote>In contrast, China is pressing ahead with a more forceful, unified top-down vision, setting the stage for transformational dynamics that have the potential to extend well beyond the country&nbsp;itself.</blockquote><blockquote>What happens next will have profound implications for financial services, monetary policy, investment outcomes, payment platforms and the configuration of global reserve currencies. It will also influence the control and use of big data, as well as China-US technological and economic competition.</blockquote><p>The reality is that the crypto revolution matters — a lot — with plenty of long term implications. Governments around the world — from east to west — are going to want to get a handle of things. They’ll want to try to gain some semblance of control.

How crypto ended up in Biden’s infrastructure bill Photo: Joe Campaigning<p>Unlike China’s top-down approach, President Biden has to deal with the legislative process. In this case, that means inserting crypto stuff into the $1 trillion infrastructure bill.</p><p>Beyond the expectation of raising $30 billion in taxes, of note is how the bill defines “brokers” (along w/the reporting requirements).</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/infrastructure-cryptocurrency-taxes-871cee3f-1e29-4888-8a06-f997e713030a.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: In an updated text of the bill, senators have narrowed the definition of “brokers” that would fall under the new transaction reporting requirements, but it’s still not specific enough, according to industry insiders.</blockquote>  The new version defines a broker as “Any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another&nbsp;person.”  The worry is that even the new definition still doesn’t explicitly (or more clearly) exclude parties like miners, node operators, and software developers.  “Such a requirement is essentially forcing miners, lightning nodes, etc., to identify others on the network,” Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1421903482693488642">tweeted</a>. “Not only is this nonsensical from a technical perspective, such a mandate would very likely be unconstitutional surveillance.”  <blockquote>Between the lines: This is yet another example of the cryptocurrencies only getting attention from lawmakers when they want something. The industry has been clamoring for clearer regulations and laws, and a slew of bills have emerged over the years, but things today are far from a neat and comprehensive set of&nbsp;rules.</blockquote><p>And this just in — after some last minute pushback from crypto lobbyists, lawmakers have amended the&nbsp;bill.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-cryptocurrency.html">the NYTimes&nbsp;report</a>:</p><blockquote>After receiving pushback from cryptocurrency lobbyists, lawmakers revised that section of the bill to “clarify” the definition of a broker rather than expand upon&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>The legislation also removed language that explicitly targeted “any decentralized exchange or peer-to-peer marketplace.” It replaced that with a broader definition that characterizes brokers as anyone “responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another&nbsp;person.”</blockquote><blockquote>The cryptocurrency industry has been adamant that the tougher tax enforcement should not apply to miners, or creators, of digital money, or the “node operators” that keep the software behind transactions moving.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/politics/infrastructure-cryptocurrency.html">Cryptocurrency in the Infrastructure Bill: The industry won last-minute concessions.</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/updated-infrastructure-bill">Updated US Infrastructure Bill Narrows Crypto Reporting Rule — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/infrastructure-cryptocurrency-taxes-871cee3f-1e29-4888-8a06-f997e713030a.html">Crypto industry faces $30 billion tax threat from infrastructure bill</a>  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-companies-fearful-of-28-billion-tax-plan-in-infrastructure-bill-2021-8">Crypto organizations say $28 billion tax plan in Senate infrastructure bill poses an ‘imminent threat’ to the&nbsp;industry</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-cryptocurrency.html">Infrastructure Deal Puts Cryptocurrencies in Washington’s Cross&nbsp;Hairs</a>   3. A Ripple Test to replace the Howey&nbsp;Test? <p>All of which is more or less fine. The U.S. government gets another revenue stream. Individuals and businesses have clarity around reporting rules (now that the “broker” thing seems to be adequately addressed).</p><p>Where there’s a clear lack of clarity, however, is with the industry at large when it comes to securities regulations — as evidenced by the ongoing SEC v. Ripple&nbsp;lawsuit.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/ripple-xrp-sec-lawsuit-impact-on-crypto-industry/">Fortune</a>:</p><blockquote>Whatever the ultimate court decision or settlement, the outcome is certain to impact the cryptocurrency world. The case is already turning up pressure on both the SEC and Congress to clarify the law and regulation governing cryptocurrency, particularly in terms of when a cryptocurrency is or isn’t a security. “We keep trying to shoehorn cryptocurrency into preexisting regulatory processes, when it’s abundantly clear it doesn’t fit well,” said Goforth. “We’re long overdue in fixing&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/07/22/toward-a-ripple-test-at-the-sec/?sh=719c75ea2e67">here’s Roslyn Layton</a> over at Forbes on a “Ripple&nbsp;Test”:</p><blockquote>At a recent <a href="https://regproject.org/podcast/deep-dive-ep-185/">event</a>, crypto policy scholars discussed the Security and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against fintech startup Ripple and how the case amounted to “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/06/30/sec-assault-on-ripple-provokes-wider-debate/?sh=595863f929e1">regulation by enforcement</a>.” They suggest that the abrupt decision was an attempt by the SEC to sidestep Congress for the needed procedural step to clarify the SEC’s authority in statute. The abrupt determination, after 7 years, that Ripple’s XRP payment protocol and distributed ledger is not a currency but rather a security, has caused many currency exchanges to delist XRP and XRP holders have lost billions of dollars in value. It is hardly the first time that a regulatory agency has overstepped its authority, causing widespread damage to markets, innovators, and consumers. The SEC justified its action under the so-called Howey Test, which comes from a 1946 Supreme Court case which defines the meaning of an “investment contract” within the Securities Act of 1933. Admittedly vague, the Howey Test defines securities as invested contracts dependent on the efforts of others. The scholars suggested that the SEC itself needs a “Ripple Test”, a set of clear, transparent, and objective guidelines on whether an asset like cryptocurrency is a security.</blockquote><blockquote>John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute suggests two minimum requirements to determine whether a digital asset is a security: (a) an explicit promise of ownership or share of the firm’s revenues or profits, and (b) an explicit promise of return on investment. Berlau suggests that these two disclosures are necessary to distinguish cryptocurrency investment from the larger world of investment in which the SEC has no jurisdiction even though vendors hawk the investment value of art, comic books, action figures, cars, and other collectibles. Notably, this determination should be defined in statue by Congress, lest the SEC will continue to freelance on ever-expanding regulatory turf as seen presently in the fractionalized non-fungible tokens (NFTs) used for the distribution of digital&nbsp;art.</blockquote><p>With rumors of a potential settlement in the works last week <a href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1421470726654148615">losing steam</a>, we might have to wait a little bit longer for that regulatory clarity.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/elizabeth-warren-sec-deadline-crypto-regulation">the SEC’s deadline</a> to respond to Elizabeth Warren’s open letter on the risks of crypto was last&nbsp;week.</p><p>By the way, SEC chief Gary Gensler just <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1419685223076347908">joined&nbsp;Twitter</a>.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/07/22/toward-a-ripple-test-at-the-sec/?sh=719c75ea2e67">Toward A Ripple Test At The&nbsp;SEC</a>  <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/ripple-xrp-sec-lawsuit-impact-on-crypto-industry/">Why Ripple’s SEC lawsuit could have a lasting impact on&nbsp;crypto</a>   4. What clear crypto regulation might look&nbsp;like <p>Or what if we didn’t have to wait for the conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit? What if we actually enacted clear legislation around crypto’s security&nbsp;status?</p><p>Seems like a novel idea — one that Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) appears to have taken to, introducing new legislation last week called the <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307">Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act</a>:</p><blockquote>“Innovation in the digital asset sector is creating new goods and services every day as well as many new, high-quality jobs. The United States should provide a legal and regulatory environment which promotes this type of innovation and growth,” said Rep. Beyer. “Digital assets and blockchain technology hold great promise, and it is clear that assets like Bitcoin and Ether are here to stay. Unfortunately, the current digital asset market structure and regulatory framework is ambiguous and dangerous for investors and consumers. Digital asset holders have been subjected to rampant fraud, theft, and market manipulation for years, yet Congress has hitherto ignored the entreaties of industry experts and federal regulators to create a comprehensive legal framework. Our laws are behind the times, and my bill would start the long overdue process of updating them to give digital asset holders and investors basic protections.”</blockquote><p>Some of the bill’s&nbsp;goals:</p>  Create statutory definitions for digital assets and digital asset securities and provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with authority over digital asset securities and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with authority over digital&nbsp;assets;  Provide legal certainty as to the regulatory status for the top 90% of the digital asset market (by market capitalization and trading volume) through a joint SEC/CFTC rulemaking.  Require digital asset transactions that are not recorded on the publicly distributed ledger to be reported to a registered Digital Asset Trade Repository within 24 hours to minimize the potential for fraud and promote transparency;  Explicitly add digital assets and digital asset securities to the statutory definition of “monetary instruments,” under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), formalizing the regulatory requirements for digital assets and digital asset securities to comply with anti-money laundering, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements;  <p>So what would constitute a security under Beyer’s proposed legislation? (You can check out <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/uploadedfiles/beyer_028_xml.pdf">the full text&nbsp;here</a>.)</p> “(82) DIGITAL ASSET SECURITY — <br>“(A) IN GENERAL. — The term ‘digital asset security’ means a digital asset that:  “(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:  “(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.  “(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.  “(III) Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the digital asset) of the issuer.  “(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer’s liquidation.  “(ii) In the case of an issuer with service, goods, or platform that is not wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with respect to any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings) which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset, issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service, goods, or platform of the issuer.  “(B) RULE RELATING TO DIGITAL ASSETS. — The term ‘digital asset security’ does not include any digital asset other than the digital assets described in subparagraph (A). Any digital asset not described in subparagraph (A) shall be considered to be, and regulated as, a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a et seq.).”. <p>Seems reasonable.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307">Beyer Introduces New Legislation To Regulate Digital&nbsp;Assets</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/congressman-introduces-new-legislation-to-regulate-digital-assets">Framework to Regulate Crypto, Stablecoins Introduced in US Congress — CoinDesk</a>   5.

How can you incorporate privacy and transparency into the design of&nbsp;CBDC?</p><p>Phantom Yun&nbsp;: Blockchain can be defined as a system that sacrifices performance for the sake of increased security and decentralization. To become a useful and deployable CBDC, any CBDC implementation should perform as faster as other competing payment systems such as credit cards. Also, it is desirable to out-perform most cryptocurrencies to compete in the cross-border payment of choice. For this, we need to solve the blockchain Trilemma also, that is performance, security and decentralization can not be achieved at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>MetaMUI has solved the blockchain trilemma by identifying the fact that the current blockchain is not truly decentralized. It is structurally decentralized but operationally centralized. By reversing this, having structurally centralized but operationally decentralized architecture, we can achieve high-performance blockchain ever possible. MetaMUI can out-perform all blockchain-based platforms and centralized payment platforms.<br>MetaMUI CBDC is the only CBDC platform that can out-perform the so-called (the world’s fastest CBDC), Chinese&nbsp;E-CNY.</p><p>Blockchain-based CBDC should not only solve the blockchain trilemma but also the CBDC design trilemma. Identity, privacy, and programmability, which cannot be easily achieved at the same time. We can not ignore privacy for the sake of achieving legal compliance and implementing programmable money. MetaMUI’s answer to this trilemma is the use of a decentralized identity system such as self-sovereign identity to find the perfect equilibrium of CBDC design trilemma. Self-sovereign identity is very famous for its advanced privacy protection. By having SSID based blockchain system we can incorporate both privacy and transparency into the blockchain-based CBDC system. Also, we use zero-knowledge encryption to protect the transaction privacy of blockchain data.</p><p>#CBDC #MetaMUI #CBPM #Identity_Based_Blockchain #OMFIF #fintech #payments #blockchain #security #Privacy #programmability</p>

 What is MicroProfile? 
 
 
<p>Around 2016, the Java EE specifications had started to stagnate and suffered from long release cycles; as a result, newer web services APIs were falling behind. Created to spur innovation, the new <a href="https://microprofile.io/">MicroProfile</a> project addressed the need to manage the existing Java JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P APIs, along with other new APIs for the evolving micro-services world.</p>
 
 
<p>Fast forward to today, Java EE has moved to <a href="https://jakarta.ee/">Jakarta EE</a> under the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/">Eclipse Foundation</a> and many MicroProfile projects have matured into Jakarta EE projects.</p>
 
 






Some projects change root packages as they move between projects. Anything starting with <code>javax.*</code> may have moved to <code>jakarta.*</code> or <code>org.eclipse.*</code>.



 
 
 
 
 What is Content Negotiation? 
 
 
<p>In server-driven content negotiation, the client makes a request to a server with instructions on the type of response it can handle. When possible, the server responds with the appropriate format or returns a <code>406</code> or <code>415</code> status code.</p>
 
 
<p>At a high level, the conversation looks like this:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Client:<br>
Hey Server!<br>
I’d like to look at <code><a href="https://api.example.com/user/123">https://api.example.com/user/123</a></code>.<br>
I need your response in JSON.<br></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Server:<br>
No Problem Client!  Here is that response…​</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Another more verbose example might be:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Client:<br>
Hey Server!  I need <code><a href="https://api.example.com/user/123">https://api.example.com/user/123</a></code>, preferably in JSON!<br>
But, 😩 I’ll take XML if that’s all you have.<br>
I also need the info in English or French.<br>
Oh, please zip up the contents too.<br></p>
 
 
 
 <code>GET /user/123 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json,application/xml;q=0.9
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Language: en,fr
Host: api.example.com
User-Agent: Client/2.0</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Server:<br>
Hey Client!<br>
All I have is XML (sorry about that), the response is in English,<br>
and I was able to zip it; here you go…​</p>
 
 
 
 <code>                                        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                                        Content-Type: application/xml
                                        Content-Encoding: gzip
                                        Content-Language: en

                                        &lt;user id="123"&gt;
                                          ...
                                        &lt;/user&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>I’d like to take this opportunity to apologize for using XML in this example 🤪</p>
 
 






Agent-driven content negotiation works differently. In this case, the client must already be aware of the server’s capabilities or must determine them by making a request to the server. This communication is not standardized.



 
 
 
 
 Content Negotiation Headers 
 
 
<p>In the previous example, I used the three content negotiation headers:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>Accept</code> - The list of media types the client supports.</p>
 
 
<p><code>Accept-Encoding</code> - The list of compression algorithms the client supports.</p>
 
 
<p><code>Accept-Language</code> - The list of languages the client supports.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>These "accept" headers allow for a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Quality_values">"quality value"</a> or a q-factor to define the client’s preferences. When omitted, the default value is <code>1.0</code>. The example above of <code>application/json,application/xml;q=0.9</code> tells the server that JSON is preferred, but XML would be the next choice.</p>
 
 
<p>The server’s response contains headers to let the client know which options were selected.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>Content-Type</code> - The media type contained in the response.</p>
 
 
<p><code>Content-Encoding</code> - The compression algorithm used.</p>
 
 
<p><code>Content-Language</code> - The language of the response.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>When I examine the request my browser made to display this blog post, it looks something like this:</p>
 







<p>Accept</p>
<p>text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,/;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9</p>


<p>Accept-Encoding</p>
<p>gzip, deflate, br</p>


<p>Accept-Language</p>
<p>en-US,en;q=0.9</p>



 
<p>My browser is telling the server: I’ll take anything, but here’s an ordered list of what I prefer:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>HTML, XHTML, AVIF, WebP, or APNG</p>
 
 
<p>XML or a signed exchange</p>
 
 
<p>Anything else.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The browser supports <code>gzip</code>, <code>deflate</code>, and <code>br</code> compression. Finally, my language preference is US English (as in color spelled without a "u") or any English.</p>
 
 






There is a downside. These headers can also be used for <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">browser tracking and finger printing</a>.



 
 
<p>Enough primer, let’s get on to the code!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a MicroProfile Project With Quarkus 
 
 
<p>Most of the code below should be vendor agnostic, except where noted. Try out the example with your favorite <a href="https://start.microprofile.io/">MicroProfile vendor</a>, and let me know how it went in the comments!</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new project:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.0.2.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.example \
    -DprojectArtifactId=content-negotation \
    -DclassName="com.example.DiceResource" \
    -Dextensions="resteasy-jsonb"
    -Dpath="/roll"
cd content-negotation</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you haven’t guessed, this example is going to evaluate dice notation. The <a href="https://github.com/diceroll-dev/dice-parser">Dice Notation Parser</a> library will evaluate dice expressions such as <code>2d8+2</code> and return the results. Open up your <code>pom.xml</code> file and add the <code>dice-parser</code> dependency:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;dev.diceroll&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;dice-parser&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;0.1.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Update the <code>DiceResource</code> class in <code>src/main/java/com/example/resources</code> to add a <code>GET</code> method:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.resources;

import dev.diceroll.parser.ParseException;
import dev.diceroll.parser.ResultTree;

import javax.ws.rs.*;
import javax.ws.rs.core.*; // wildcard for brevity

import static dev.diceroll.parser.Dice.detailedRoll;

@Path("/roll")
public class DiceResource  {

    @GET
    public ResultTree rollObject(@QueryParam("dice") String dice) throws ParseException {
        return detailedRoll(dice);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Start the server either from your favorite IDE or from the command line with:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn quarkus:dev</code> 
 
 
 






All of the code changes you’ll make should hot reload, but if you don’t see the changes as you continue, just kill the process and start it up again.



 
 
<p>Make sure things are working by making a request—and roll a single six-sided die.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll dice==d6</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 148
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "expression": {
        "numberOfDice": 1,
        "numberOfFaces": 6
    },
    "results": [{
        "expression": {
            "numberOfDice": 1,
            "numberOfFaces": 6
        },
        "results": [],
        "value": 6
    }],
    "value": 6
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now that the app is working, let’s tweak some things and look at how the response changes!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Enable Compression for the REST Resources 
 
 
<p>Compression isn’t one of those features you should need to worry about. You <a href="https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/filters-and-interceptors.html#d0e9756">could deal with the compression logic yourself</a>, but most vendors have a configuration property you can tweak to turn it on.</p>
 
 
<p>For Quarkus, add the following line to your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>quarkus.http.enable-compression=true</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Make another HTTP request and include the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header, and this time we will roll <code>2d6</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll dice==2d6 "Accept-Encoding: gzip"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Encoding: gzip (1)
Content-Length: 106

{
    "expression": {
        "numberOfDice": 2,
        "numberOfFaces": 6
    },
    ...
    "value": 9
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
The response <code>Content-Encoding</code> header was set (HTTPie automatically unzipped the request)


 
 
 
 






 
<p>If you wanted to do the same thing with <code>curl</code> you would need to pipe the result to gunzip:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl localhost:8080/roll\?dice=2d6 -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" | gunzip</code> 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Using the Request Accept-Language Header 
 
 
<p>It’s 2021, and implementing internationalization (i18n) is still hard. In the Java world, i18n usually means creating a <code>Locale</code> object containing the user’s language. It’s a little clunky to use, but the JAX-RS API defines a way to resolve the user’s <code>Locale</code>. Let’s look at a couple of different ways to manage this.</p>
 
 
<p>Add a new endpoint method in <code>DiceResource</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>@Path("/lang")
@GET
public Response getLang(@Context Request request) {
    List&lt;Variant&gt; variants = Variant.VariantListBuilder.newInstance() (1)
            .languages(Locale.ENGLISH, Locale.GERMAN) (2)
            .build();

    Variant variant = request.selectVariant(variants); (3)

    if (variant == null) { (4)
        return Response.notAcceptable(variants).build();
    }

    // set the response header, to the client knows which language was selected
    String lang = variant.getLanguageString();
    return Response.ok(lang)
            .header(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_LANGUAGE, lang)
            .build(); (5)
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Use the variant list builder to select the language from the "Accept-Languages" header.


2
You will need to list all of your supported languages; order is important; the default option is the first if there is no <code>Accept-Language</code> header.


3
Use the request to select the correct variant.


4
If the selected variant is <code>null</code> return a <code>406</code>.


5
Build and return a <code>200</code> response.


 
 
 
 






The <code>VariantBuilder</code> also supports different encodings and <code>MediaType</code> too.



 
 
<p>Try it out! Make a request to <code>/roll/lang</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll/lang "Accept-Language: de"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: de (1)
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Vary: Accept-Language
content-encoding: gzip
content-length: 28

de</code> 
 
 
 


1
Note the <code>Content-Language</code> header.


 
 
 
 
<p>The above approach works well for showing off the API, but it’s a little limited in real-world usages as every endpoint method returns a <code>Response</code> and manages the headers directly. It would be nicer to extract this cross-cutting concern.</p>
 
 
<p>Another option is to use request and response filters. The next example implements both <code>ContainerRequestFilter</code> and <code>ContainerResponseFilter</code> interfaces. Create a new class <code>LanguageFilter</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import javax.ws.rs.container.*;
import javax.ws.rs.core.*; // wildcard for brevity
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Locale;

@Provider
public class LanguageFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter, ContainerResponseFilter {

    final private static String LANG = "LanguageFilter.lang";

    final public static List&lt;Variant&gt; VARIANTS = Variant.VariantListBuilder.newInstance()
            .languages(Locale.ENGLISH, Locale.GERMAN) (1)
            .build();

    @Override
    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext) {
        Variant variant = requestContext.getRequest().selectVariant(VARIANTS); (2)

        if (variant == null) { (3)
            // Error, respond with 406
            requestContext.abortWith(Response.notAcceptable(VARIANTS).build());
        } else {
            // keep the resolved lang around for the response
            requestContext.setProperty(LANG, variant.getLanguageString()); (4)
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext, ContainerResponseContext responseContext) {
        String lang = (String) requestContext.getProperty(LANG);
        responseContext.getHeaders().putSingle(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_LANGUAGE, lang); (5)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Define the supported languages.


2
Select the <code>Variant</code> based on the request.


3
If a compatible <code>Variant</code> is not found, return a <code>406</code>.


4
Add the resolved language string to the request context.


5
Set the <code>Content-Language</code> response header.


 
 
 
 






Having spent years dealing with the Servlet API, I often make incorrect assumptions about how the JAX-RS API is structured. With JAX-RS, the request and response filtering are different interfaces.



 
 
<p>This solution works with any endpoint; test out the original <code>/roll</code> endpoint again. Dice notation allows for basic math, too; try to roll <code>2d8+1</code> (two eight-sided dice plus one).</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll dice==2d8+1 "Accept-Language: en"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept-Language
content-encoding: gzip
content-length: 154

{
    "expression": {
        "left": {
            "numberOfDice": 2,
            "numberOfFaces": 8
        },
        "operation": "ADD",
        "right": {
            "value": 1
        }
    },
    "results": [
    ...
    ],
    "value": 8
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>So far, so good!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Different Responses for Different Clients 
 
 
<p>Up until now, the simple <code>/roll</code> endpoint has been returning JSON, which is excellent if you are building a client that accepts JSON, but it’s not very user-friendly for text-based clients like HTTPie or curl. Two changes are needed to support a plain text response: Annotate the endpoint with an <code>@Produces</code> annotation and add a <code>MessageBodyWriter</code> to convert the dice parser’s <code>ResultTree</code> object into text.</p>
 
 
<p>Add the following <code>@Produces</code> annotation to <code>DiceResource</code>, to indicate it supports both <code>text/plain</code> and <code>application/json</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>@Path("/roll")
@Produces({MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON })
public class DiceResource  {
...</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you make a request to the <code>/roll</code> endpoint now, you will get an ugly response due to a call to the <code>toString()</code> method on <code>ResultTree</code>. 🤢</p>
 
 
<p>To fix this, create a new class <code>TextDiceTreeMessageBodyWriter.java</code> that implements <code>MessageBodyWriter&lt;ResultTree&gt;</code>, which renders something a little easier on the eyes:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import dev.diceroll.parser.Dice;
import dev.diceroll.parser.ResultTree;

import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.WebApplicationException;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MultivaluedMap;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.MessageBodyWriter;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.annotation.Annotation;
import java.lang.reflect.Type;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

@Provider
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN) (1)
public class TextDiceTreeMessageBodyWriter implements MessageBodyWriter&lt;ResultTree&gt; {

    @Override
    public boolean isWriteable(Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType) {
        return type == ResultTree.class; (2)
    }

    @Override
    public void writeTo(ResultTree resultTree,
                        Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType,
                        Annotation[] annotations,
                        MediaType mediaType,
                        MultivaluedMap&lt;String, Object&gt; httpHeaders,
                        OutputStream entityStream) throws IOException, WebApplicationException {

        String result = Dice.debug(resultTree); (3)
        entityStream.write(result.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); (4)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Add a <code>Produces</code> annotation to the class to mark the <code>MediaType</code> it supports.


2
This example keeps things simple and only supports the <code>ResultTree</code> class.


3
Calling <code>Dice.debug</code> will turn the result into text.


4
Write the string to the response stream.


 
 
 
 
<p>Time to test it out! Call <code>/roll</code> again roll <code>3d10k2+1</code> (roll three eight-sided dice and keep the highest two, then add one to the result):</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll dice==3d10k2 "Accept: text/plain"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Vary: Accept-Language
content-encoding: gzip
content-length: 69

3d10k2 + 1 = 8
--3d10k2 = 7
----d10 = 4
----d10 = 2
----d10 = 3
--1 = 1</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Much better! Change the <code>Accept</code> header value to <code>application/json</code> to see for yourself.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Bonus: User Agent for Content Negotiation 
 
 
<p>Using the User-Agent header for content negotiation might not be your first choice. Still, it works great for a few use cases, for example when dealing with legacy clients that don’t correctly handle adding new fields to a JSON response object.</p>
 
 






If you are using Jackson to unmarshal JSON consider adding the <code>@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)</code> annotation to your client code to handle additive changes in REST APIs gracefully.



 
 
<p>One of my favorite examples of using the User-Agent for content negotiation is adding descriptive help to a REST server. I learned this trick from the <a href="https://github.com/spring-io/start.spring.io">Spring Initializer project</a>, which returns different results if you use HTTPie or curl: <code><a href="https://start.spring.io">https://start.spring.io</a></code>.</p>
 
 
<p>To detect the user agent, add an enum that contains basic user-agent parsing logic.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public enum Agents {

    CURL("curl"),
    HTTPIE("HTTPie");

    final private String agentName;
    final private static Pattern TOOL_REGEX = Pattern.compile("([^\\/]*)\\/([^ ]*).*"); (1)

    Agents(String agentName) {
        this.agentName = agentName;
    }

    public static Agents parse(String userAgent) { (2)
        Matcher matcher = TOOL_REGEX.matcher(userAgent);
        String name = (matcher.matches()) ? matcher.group(1) : null;
        return Arrays.stream(Agents.values())
                .filter(agent -&gt; agent.agentName.equals(name))
                .findFirst()
                .orElse(null);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
This regex looks for <code>{name}/{version}</code>


2
Calling <code>Agents.parse(userAgent)</code> will return an enum associated with Curl, HTTPie, or <code>null</code>.


 
 
 
 






User-Agent parsing is a much more complex topic; the above code works well because we are looking for a few specific clients.  This is not a general-purpose solution.



 
 
<p>Now that I have logic to figure out the user-agent, I’ll create a helper class to wrap the logic of returning localized help text. Create a new class <code>Help.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo;
import java.text.MessageFormat;
import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;

public class Help {

    final static private Map&lt;Agents, String&gt; AGENT_HELP_MAP = Map.of(
            Agents.CURL, "help.curl",
            Agents.HTTPIE, "help.httpie"
    );

    public static String getHelp(String userAgent, UriInfo uriInfo, Locale locale) {

        String url = uriInfo.getBaseUri().resolve("/").toString(); (1)

        Agents agent = Agents.parse(userAgent); (2)

        // look up the help key
        String helpKey = AGENT_HELP_MAP.getOrDefault(agent, "help.generic"); (3)

        // Resource Bundle lookup/formatting
        ResourceBundle resourceBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("messages", locale); (4)
        MessageFormat formatter = new MessageFormat(resourceBundle.getString(helpKey), locale);
        return formatter.format(new Object[] { url });
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Resolve the base URL of the request <code>UriInfo</code>.


2
Parse the user-agent header and return an <code>Agents</code> enum.


3
Look up the help text key, or default to <code>help.generic</code>.


4
Get and format a string from a <code>ResourceBundle</code>.


 
 
 
 
<p>Create the corresponding <code>ResourceBundle</code> in <code>src/main/resources/messages.properties</code> :</p>
 
 
 
 <code>help.generic = \
    Welcome to the Dice Parser!!\n\n\
    Roll dice by making a request:\n\
    \    GET {0}roll?dice=2d6\n\
    \    Accept: text/plain\n\n\
    Or get the result in JSON:\n\
    \    GET {0}roll?dice=2d6\n\
    \    Accept: application/json

help.httpie = \
    Welcome to the Dice Parser!!\n\n\
    Roll dice by making a request:\n\
    \    http {0}roll dice==2d6 \"Accept: text/plain\"\n\n\
    Or get the result in JSON:\n\
    \    http {0}roll dice==2d6 \"Accept: application/json\"

help.curl = \

    Roll dice by making a request:\n\
    \    curl {0}roll?dice=2d6 -H \"Accept: text/plain\"\n\n\
    Or get the result in JSON (the default):\n\
    \    curl {0}roll?dice=2d6 -H \"Accept: application/json\"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add a German translation of this file (thanks to Google Translate), in <code>src/main/resources/messages_de.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>help.generic = \

You could use your favorite template framework for this instead of using a <code>ResourceBundle</code> directly.



 
 
<p>Lastly, create a new <code>HelpResource</code> class to tie everything together:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import javax.ws.rs.*;
import javax.ws.rs.core.*; // for brevity

@Path("/")
public class HelpResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String help(@HeaderParam(HttpHeaders.USER_AGENT) String userAgent, (1)
                       @Context Request request, (2)
                       @Context UriInfo uriInfo) { (3)
        return Help.getHelp(userAgent,
                uriInfo,
                request.selectVariant(LanguageFilter.VARIANTS).getLanguage()); (4)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
The User-Agent request header.


2
The <code>Request</code> object (needed to select the correct language <code>Variant</code>).


3
The URI of the request.


4
Pass everything into <code>Help.getHelp()</code> to return the localized help message.


 
 
 
 
<p>The default Quarkus application adds a static <code>index.html</code> file to use as the root resource; delete this file so the new <code>HelpResource</code> can take its place:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>rm src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/index.html</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Put everything you learned together and make a request to <code>localhost:8080/</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/ "Accept-Language: en" "Accept: text/plain" "Accept-encoding: gzip"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Vary: Accept-Language
content-encoding: gzip
content-length: 251

Welcome to the Dice Parser!!

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the launch of the <a href="https://www.globalid.cards/xrp-card/">XRP Mastercard® Debit&nbsp;Card</a>!</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://global.id/">GlobaliD</a> vision, we believe that everyone has a right to not only an identity but also a wallet tied to that identity. With that wallet, they should be able to hold, trade, and spend money and assets of any kind. In essence, it’s about giving everyone a seat at the&nbsp;table.</p><p>The XRP Card takes that one step further, allowing users to spend fiat, crypto, or any other digital asset from their GlobaliD Wallet, powered by <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, anywhere Mastercard is accepted — all while earning up to 5% cash back in XRP&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The XRP Card is also the first ever community-linked debit card of its kind — it’s available exclusively to members of the <a href="http://How%20to%20get%20the%20XRP%20Mastercard®%20Debit%20Card%20Check%20out%20the%20launch%20page%20Watch%20the%20step-by-step%20instructional%20video%20Join%20the%20XRP%20Army%20Group%20on%20GlobaliD%20Read%20the%20FAQ">XRP Army Group</a> on GlobaliD. The longer term vision is to empower any community with the tools to quickly and conveniently issue their own community debit cards to their members, each with their own unique set of traits and rewards programs.</p> How to get the XRP Mastercard® Debit&nbsp;Card   <a href="https://www.globalid.cards/xrp-card/">Check out the launch&nbsp;page</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yMzh6N6xdQQ">Watch the step-by-step instructional video</a>  <a href="https://link.global.id/group-invite?short_link_id=VYaD0jAnLlgj">Join the XRP Army Group on&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <a href="https://care.global.id/en/collections/2990567-xrp-card">Read the&nbsp;FAQ</a>  <p>(For now, the card is only available to U.S. residents, but we’re working hard on international expansion. Residents of Colorado, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, New York, and Virginia are not eligible for the program at this&nbsp;time.)</p><p>All of this is made possible by GlobaliD’s Sovereignty Stack — composed of self-sovereign identity, messaging and groups, and the wallet — what we see as the core building blocks for the next chapter of the internet. It’s one reason why we were able to create the XRP Card in just five months from conception to initial&nbsp;launch.</p><p>We also couldn’t have done it without our ecosystem of partners — including <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, which powers the GlobaliD Wallet, and <a href="https://aptopayments.com/">Apto</a>, whose <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-apto-payments-launches-instant-card-issuance-3a3397e8613a">instant issuance program</a> underpins the XRP&nbsp;Card.</p><p>We caught up with two of the team leads on the XRP Card project at GlobaliD — Paul Stavropoulos and Laura Toh — to chat about the launch, the XRP Card program, and the long term&nbsp;vision.</p> How did the XRP Card get&nbsp;started? <p>Paul: We believe that identity is a combination of the credentials you have, the people you communicate with, and the value that you own. In the context of value, it’s also about how you spend it — which is very personal. It’s a big part of your identity. Right now, the main way people spend is through debit and credit cards. So, we see debit cards as the first step toward allowing folks to spend and make transactions with the value of any kind that they&nbsp;hold.</p><p>We started with the XRP Card because we happen to have a lot of fans that love the value that XRP brings. It was a natural fit to start with the XRP community because they’re active and highly engaged, allowing us to push forward not only our vision for allowing you to spend value that’s associated with identity but also for empowering communities, which we’ll talk about&nbsp;later.</p><p>Laura: Greg [Kidd, GlobaliD co-founder and CEO] has always been an advocate for XRP and crypto at large. He has a reputation for not backing away from difficult conversations around its future — for instance, his <a href="https://youtu.be/v2gLHm-4qRM">first podcast on the SEC lawsuit</a>. So it was a natural fit. We were able to get over 25,000 people on the waitlist in the first week with pretty much no marketing — just a&nbsp;tweet.</p> There’s a lot of debit and credit card programs being marketed at the moment that offer crypto rewards. The XRP Card appears unique in that regard since it’s tied to a specific community. Can you explain the thinking behind&nbsp;that? <p>Laura: The vision for GlobaliD is for everyone to have an identity that allows them to trust and be trusted online — similar to real life. For your digital identity to be worthwhile, you need to be able to do something with it. Our theory is that community (and Groups) is the best way of creating incentives for people to kickstart that approach, where the starting point for your identity is to be able to start interacting with other&nbsp;people.</p><p>Nobody gets a driver’s license for the sake of having a license. You get it because it allows you to do things — whether that’s driving a car or getting into a bar. For us, building communities is a way to make these identities valuable today. When you get your XRP Card, you’re not just getting a way to pay for things, you’re joining a community of like-minded people, who you can trust, interact with, and potentially further down the line, take collective action either socially or financially.</p><p>Paul: The biggest difference between the XRP Card and other offerings out there is that we’re not interested in just putting out a debit card. The long term vision is to empower individuals and groups — to allow them to create communities and have the ability to leverage the collective power of those communities. Eventually, GlobaliD users will be able to not only create groups, but also issue their own community-specific cards, allowing them to create their own merchant networks, reward programs, or even group funding mechanisms in order to leverage the group’s collective financial power. The next big step is implementing a noncustodial wallet — both for users and communities.</p><p>The XRP Card is essentially a reference implementation of that vision — how a decentralized community can organize and use their collective spending power, to earn rewards, and benefit from the way they interact in the real world when they spend money. The XRP Card is a way to build out these communities, and help people bridge that gap to the real world from their online community. It becomes another way to express and establish your identity.</p> What exactly do you mean by collective action? <p>Laura: There are two types of collective action that we’re exploring: first, a community could leverage its size and spending power to get better deals for its members, and second, they could pool funds in order to get access to goods, services, and investments that would be out of reach individually.</p><p>Groups could also grow pooled funds through the card itself — for instance, if they issue a card where a certain portion of the transaction fee goes to the group wallet. It could be a cause-based group aligned with some charity and in that way, the collective spending power of the community to make donations. By spending money with that group card, you’d be passively donating to your favorite&nbsp;charity.</p><p>Paul: Imagine if you’re a community focused on a particular sports team. The group could pool funds to potentially gain access to athletes and interviews. They could host special events, build out merchant rewards for jerseys or drinks at their favorite bars, or they could even help certain members of the community attend their first&nbsp;game.</p> The XRP Card was first announced earlier this year in February and has now officially launched at the end of July. It must have been a mad scramble to get this thing out in about 5&nbsp;months. <p>Paul: I think first and foremost, that’s a testament to the GlobaliD vision and framework, particularly around the Sovereign Stack — identity, messaging, wallet. We see those as the core building blocks for Web 3.0, and with some combination of those building blocks, you could, practically speaking, build anything across the spectrum of fintech products and services. We’ve spent the last few years building that foundation brick by brick so it’s incredible to see it all come together.</p><p>Laura: That being said, our team has been working incredibly hard to get this to market — so shout out to the engineering team, the product team, the design team, and the customer support team. Also, none of this could have happened without our ecosystem of partners — Apto with their instant issuance powering the card, Uphold powering the wallet. Everyone has been heads down working to make the XRP Card a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>But also a special shout out to the community. We wouldn’t be here without you — especially the beta testers! Thank you so much for your engagement, your feedback, and most of all, your positive energy and enthusiasm.</p><p>We’re just all super excited that it’s finally in people’s hands and&nbsp;wallets!</p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/pstav90">Paul</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thelittletoh">Laura</a> on Twitter, and visit <a href="https://global.id/">Global.iD</a></p><p>You might also be interested in:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">GlobaliD joins the Linux Foundation’s Cardea&nbsp;Project</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-apto-payments-launches-instant-card-issuance-3a3397e8613a">Partner Spotlight: Apto Payments launches Instant Card&nbsp;Issuance</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-is-hipaa-compliant-1e8cdf915ab6">GlobaliD is HIPAA compliant</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-receives-soc-2-type-ii-certification-b2b6ea7a6d75">GlobaliD receives SOC 2 Type II certification</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-connects-to-the-indicio-network-2ad5688d72fd">GlobaliD connects to the Indicio&nbsp;Network</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7">GlobaliD shares SSI code at the Internet Identity&nbsp;Workshop</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-the-xrp-mastercard-debit-card-827c0b37445b">Introducing the XRP Mastercard® Debit Card</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the second interview in this series, Ontology speaks with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/EmilioburFdez">Emilio</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>Four years ago before the Ontology project was officially announced, a friend told me about it. I decided to learn more and found that I really liked the project’s vision. I subscribed to their newsletter and… to my surprise, for that alone they gave me a generous airdrop with the launch of their TestNet. I was very pleased that the project did not have an ICO and instead had a fair and equitable distribution of their&nbsp;tokens.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>The purpose of the project was aligned with my thoughts, but there was no information in Spanish about Ontology. I decided to create a Spanish <a href="https://t.me/OntologySpanish">Telegram</a> channel to talk and share opinions with other people, and try to unify all the available information in&nbsp;Spanish.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>When I learned about the purpose of Ontology — i.e. its mission to provide decentralized identity and data management tools to the world — I realized that thanks to this purpose, something beneficial could be achieved for people, giving them back a large part of the freedom they have lost. I think the key role of a Harbinger is to convey that feeling, that things can be changed, and that there are projects like Ontology that are working hard to foster positive change in the&nbsp;world.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Because I feel part of something big; part of a project that wants to give people control of their identity again, and protect their privacy and&nbsp;data.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>There is a part of the community that is only there to speculate with the price and try to make a profit but, little by little, people are transformed and realize that the price is not that important. They understand that the purpose of Ontology goes further and that it will achieve very important changes in people’s daily lives. Then the economic benefits will&nbsp;come.</p> 6. What do you use as your key Ontology community channels for and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>All channels are valuable; the important thing is to know how to communicate the project’s vision and purpose. I enjoy talking about Ontology with new people face to face. It’s fun to share my knowledge about the project and its vision with&nbsp;others.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>Before, when I wanted to talk to someone important from another project on YouTube, it was very difficult; they ignored me. But now when I tell them that I am part of Ontology, they pay attention to me and I can have interesting conversations. Another very comforting thing is when I wear my Ontology shirt and someone comes to talk to me because they know the project — it’s&nbsp;great.</p><p>The advice I would give to someone who wants to become a Harbinger, is that if they feel aligned with the purpose of Ontology, and are able to communicate well with other people and want to be part of a big family, jump in and join&nbsp;us.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Dedicated, Innovative, Ambitious.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more or less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>We have to find a channel where we can explain to a greater number of people the purpose of Ontology; where we come from, where we are, and where we are&nbsp;going.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Create more dApps that solicit community feedback. It is as easy as asking them, “What do you want us to develop?” Then, create a line of work where the community and developers work together.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the third interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

Vittorio Bertocci,  Principal Architect at Auth0, is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4618/1" title="Browser Features vs. Identity Protocols: An Arms Race?"> Browser Features vs. Identity Protocols: An Arms Race?</a> on Tuesday, September 14 starting at 9:50 am. at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Vittorio some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why are browser vendors introducing changes in their products that impact how we do identity today?</p>
<p>
Browser vendors really mean well. What they are doing is looking out for the users and we know that today, one of the big engines of the economy is the ability of advertisers to profile people. Even without their knowledge or consent so that they can serve high-performing ads. And a lot of these tracking occurs by using low-level primitives in the browser, such as cookies, redirects, decorated links. And so, browser vendors are trying to put a stop to it by inhibiting some of those functionalities in particular scenarios, or sometimes, we have had a lot of discrimination, eliminating entire categories or features.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, identity, and in particular, federated identity is built on the same building blocks that are used by the advertisers. And so, the outcome is that any actions against tracking, that do not really understand the difference between ad tracking and federated identity will affect the federated identity scenarios. And so that is basically what is going on right now. 
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the short-term consequences people need to consider, if any? </p>
<p>
The short-term impact of this can be quite painful for a number of customers. Let's say that some changes already went [into] production, so, the famous intelligent tracking protection in Safari and, on the SameSite different defaults in Chrome. The plans that Chrome had to [completely] eliminate third party cookies, which now luckily has been delayed by a couple of years.</p>
<p>And the outcome of those is that entire scenarios can just stop working. So, if, for example, you have a web application which runs mostly in JavaScript and executes code in the browser, and it relies on the ability to access third-party cookies, to get the tokens out of band, instead of actually showing redirects to the user, then, applications might actually be unable to get to those tokens in the background. And so, the experience of the user would be disrupted and the same goes for distributed log out. 
</p>
<p>You log out from one app expecting that you would be logged out from all the apps that are using the same identity provider, but it might not happen. You might end up being logged out only from one app, but still be logged in[to] the other apps. And those are short-term consequences. There are medium-term consequences, which can be far more severe. There are talks about introducing features that limit the way in which your browsers redirect, and that will potentially break SAML, which is extraordinarily adopted.</p>
<p>
A lot of critical infrastructure relies on SAML. And the moment in which those changes will occur, again, with SAML, is basically done - it is not dead, because people are using it, but it is done. There is a longer innovation. If it imposes changes that would require products to change the way in which we do SAML, we would be in big trouble because a lot of websites, institutions, [and] universities would just stop working. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the long-term consequences people need to consider, if any? </p>
<p>
The long-term consequences are more nuanced. One of the things that we as industry are trying to do with browser vendors and identity providers, and identity vendors and similar, is to devise a new class of primitives that allow the browser to do identity explicitly instead of using low level primitives, like cookies and redirects. We could offer APIs that do identity. The challenge with that is that if you go too high in the abstraction layers, you end up with something which is very inflexible. And as we know, from a history of how identity came to be on the internet, we need what we call permissionless innovation, as in, the ability to devise new scenarios, starting from flexible primitives.</p>
<p>
If your primitives are not very flexible because they address specific scenarios – you can address today's scenarios, but there is no guarantee you would be able to address tomorrow’s scenarios. And so, we need to strike this balance and if we fail to do so, we might actually significantly hamper innovation. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>What is the best way for people in the identity industry to help move things forward?</p>
<p>
The absolute best way is to get involved. We have been talking with the browser vendors for a couple of years at this point, all as separate entities, like separate companies, and this is not very efficient. It is not very exhaustive because we all, all identity operators in the industry, have a different perspective and different use cases. So, we have been working in collaboration with the W3C to create a tent, a forum where we can all come together [to] the table and discuss our scenarios and contribute all our points of view. And it is a community group in the W3C called the fed ID (<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">The Federated Identity</a>). And the best way is really to participate. So, to join the group, join the calls, participate in the discussion so that we can move these aspects of identity and browsers forward together. </p>

<p>CARIBBEAN – August 2, 2021 – ShareRing have today announced a pilot program to digitize the KYC (Know Your Customer) process for financial institutions based in the Caribbean region.</p>



<p>The pilot which began on June 1st, 2021, is part of ShareRing’s long term commitment to the region as they roll out their blockchain based identity and verifiable credentials ecosystem across a number of industries including health, events, financial services and travel. The ShareRing Caribbean team leading the project have over 20 years experience in the technology and financial sectors.</p>



<p>This digital ‘eKYC’ pilot will enable credit unions, insurance companies and other financial institutions to receive their customers ID and supporting documents in an encrypted digital format through their mobile device.&nbsp; The solution will eliminate much of the time-consuming aspects of account sign-up processes while still ensuring the institutions operate within the regulatory framework.</p>



<p>ShareRing’s scope includes exploring the potential for credit approvals and identity verification checks from one financial institution to be made available to other similar institutions or third parties.</p>



<p>In a quote from the President of the Barbados Teacher’s Co-operative Credit Union Limited, Ms. Sherry-Ann Scott-King stated – “We are metamorphozing our structure to embrace technological advances, and the use of blockchain technology is the solution to our KYC needs. Partnering with companies such as ShareRing reiterates this, and we’re excited to see the fruits of the project both for our members and the credit union, while ensuring we remain compliant with regulatory requirements.”</p>



<p>The key benefit for the credit union’s customer is having a streamlined digital process without compromising their data security. Using ShareRing’s encrypted ID technology, with its self sovereign and privacy-by-design features, means the customers remain in full control of their private and sensitive data.</p>



<p>“We’re very proud to deploy some of ShareRing’s core functionality to financial organizations in the Caribbean region. We are able to provide blockchain based eKYC solutions which facilitate heightened levels of security and trust between financial institutions and their customers” said Tim Bos, CEO and Founder of ShareRing.</p>

<p>About ShareRing</p>



<p>ShareRing is a technology company which has created an ecosystem where individuals and organisations can transact in a secure and trusted digital environment. Central to establishing high trust levels is ShareRing’s encrypted self-sovereign ID solution, based on blockchain technology, creating an immutable “fingerprint” of an individual’s verifiable personal identity and documents. Self-sovereign means the individual retains full control over their own data since it resides solely on their personal device in an encrypted format, and is never stored centrally.</p>



<p>These features provide: security for the individual user and, confidence for the consumer of the data that the data provided has not been altered in any way since it was uploaded to the blockchain. Through the ShareRing Ecosystem, accessed via ShareRing Apps, ShareRing has created a number of products/solutions which digitize, streamline and radically improve processes across multiple industries and functions including health, financial services, events, travel &amp; hospitality.</p>

<p>Offering digital services is nothing new for the financial services industry. However, we have seen the pace of adoption has increased significantly during the COVID19 pandemic,&nbsp; and along with this has come a rise in fraud and other crime. With its basis in customer trust, security is crucial in the banking industry. Banks have to quickly adapt to the changing environment while ensuring they meet the highest levels of security and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Experts from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/webinar-banking-security-user-experience/">IDnow, Ziglu, Santander, and Scotia Bank recently discussed</a> digitalization, customer onboarding, and digital identity in banking. In particular, how to embrace these technologies to offer the best customer experience whilst maintaining security and trust as the key drivers.</p>
 Growth in digital banking services 
<p>The events of the past 18 months have led to many changes in banking. Webinar participants agreed that the use of digital services has increased significantly, as has the range of services offered – not all of them expected before the pandemic. This has brought with it higher levels of customer onboarding and verification services.</p>
<p>As highlighted during the webinar, a <a href="mailto:https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">study by McKinsey</a> suggests that companies are now seven years ahead in digital transformation due to the pandemic. &nbsp;As an evidence of this remarkable adoption, IDnow shared that it has experienced a growth of up to 1,000% in the demand of verifications.</p>
 Rise in financial crime 
<p>Both unfortunately and unsurprisingly, the rise in digitalization has been accompanied by an increase in financial crime. At IDnow, we have seen overall fraud increases of around 250%&nbsp; – and a 180% rise in document fraud.</p>
<p>James Sullivan,&nbsp;Chief Operating Officer at Ziglu, also agreed and shared his experience at his organisation. James explained how over the past 12 months, they have seen an increase in fraud. This includes a significant rise in impersonation fraud, money mule activities, and scams. The lack of digital IDs in the UK is undoubtedly a contributing factor.</p>
 Building trust is vital for banks 
<p>Data security is paramount for all companies, most importantly for banks as they are the custodians of customers’ personal information and security is the foundation in trust. Rod Boothby, Global Head of Identity at Santander, explained his view of this and the importance to banks, saying:</p>
<p>“People trust banks as a store of their value. That means things like cash, securities, but also data. They know that banks will protect their data – which is very useful when you are trying to establish trust on the internet.”</p>
<p>Rod from Santander and Zemfira Khisaeva from Scotia Bank both highlighted how building trust online is critical. Without getting it right, they are not only risking security, but they are also potentially losing out on customers and revenue. Rod explained how recent digital identity approaches are being developed with data minimisation in mind, which would enable banks to request less information to customers when performing KYC processes.</p>
 ID verification as part of a digital strategy 
<p>The importance of digital identity verification is becoming more evident especially as both the volume of online services and the level of fraud increase. Roger Tyrzyk from IDnow explained how this is a hot topic in many industries now.</p>
<p>As banks add new services and functions, they also face different challenges. This includes thinking about new sources for digital identity, embracing new technologies and ensuring a seamless experience across multiple channels and bankend systems.</p>
<p>A primary drive of the changes we see from a verification technology point of view is how to ensure that the person is who they claim to be. Just capturing a photograph on an ID might not be enough.</p>
<p>Going forward there will be the need for more advanced techniques which can authenticate documents – some examples are the use of video techniques for checking dynamic security features and Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. The use of biometrics such as face, voice, or fingerprints will continue to be widely used as it is today, but the adoption of more robust data protection and security processes will also need to be considered.</p>
<p>Rod also agreed with this and expanded about the key difference between the physical world and the digital world. An ID document or passport can be produced in the physical world, but this is radically different in the digital world. How can it be proved that a person is who they claim to be in during a digital session?</p>
 Identity standards as a catalyst for trust 
<p>During the webinar, all participants expressed how standards shared between organizations are important too. Zemfira from Scotia Bank explained how banks in Canada use the same system to perform these verifications. Rod also shared how Santander (together with other banks) is working on developing an open ID trust framework for digital identity, which is aimed to standardise the verification approach not only for financial services, but also for other industries. Ultimately, this trust framework would allow organizations to onboard customers easily and securely, but with the customer in control of what data is shared.</p>
 Providing identity insurance for banking transactions 
<p>Another new development discussed was the introduction of identity insurance. This could see a small insurance premium on a transition to insure against fraud. Rod from Santander explains how this could greatly help trust and global financial inclusion, claiming that “By transferring the risk we allow people to act as though they are trusted everywhere.”</p>
 Importance of the user experience 
<p>Security, functionality, and better services are great, but what about the customer experience?</p>
<p>Zemfira pointed out that this is not something that has been so important in the past, with security and trust the main drivers. However, the focus has changed over the years as new generations come and challenger banks arise. User experience is moving from a ‘nice to have’ to a key differentiator amongst banks going forward.</p>
 How to achieve a great user onboarding experience 
<p>Participants also shared their views on KYC and the onboarding process, and how to make this process a good one for users. The suggested main areas of interest include:</p>
 
 Ensuring speed of customer onboarding. Users can give up if the process is slow. They are there to engage with your products and services, so get them doing this as soon as possible. 
 Reduce friction points. There is a level of “friendly friction” that customers are prepared to deal with, however it is important to communicate with the customer the value of your products and the reason for this ‘friction’. 
 Aim for a reliable solution: It is also very important to choose the right identity partner which systems and processes have been widely tested 
 
 Compliance is both important and challenging 
<p>There is a real challenge between regulatory requirements and friction points for customers during onboarding and verification. The art of finding the right balance between those two will be a key differentiator.</p>
<p>The regulatory ecosystem can be cumbersome to navigate for organisations as regulatory requirements typically differ from one country to another. Due to Brexit, UK companies operating in Europe, for example, will now need to acquire a licence in the countries they wish to operate and comply with local regulations. Another example are crypto currency companies with a licence in Europe that wish to onboard customers in Germany. With the implementation of the 5MLD in Germany, now these crypto companies are required to obtain a licence in Germany and comply with BaFin regulations, where a video-based verification is required.</p>
<p>Participants raised fact that the user experience will also be limited by local regulations. &nbsp;This is the case of Germany mentioned above and another example is Mexico, where onboarding can only be performed in person or via live video.</p>
<p>The lack of government digital IDs is also a limiting factor. This varies between countries. Countries like Estonia and Sweden, are well ahead with this. Sweden which uses BankID to onboard customers and Estonia the only country with a full digital identity which enables banks to onboard customers 100% using this. On the other hand, the UK is likely to face different challenges due to the lack of and identity document &nbsp;&nbsp;– James from Ziglu believes this is a leading contributor to the UK’s high level of financial crime.</p>
<p>James also raised the point about outsourcing and bank regulatory responsibility. There is a growing trend where financial services organisations are relying on third parties to perform their KYC processes. This is mainly due to the continuous developments of technologies which makes the processes more robust and reliable. However, it is important to mention that even though this process can be outsourced banks will still be responsible to choose the right partner and be aware on how they fulfil their regulatory responsibilities.</p>
<p>Learn more in our other banking blog article on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ekyc-europe-regulation-customer-experience/">how to balance regulation and customer experience</a>.</p>
 Looking to the future 
<p>It is always helpful with any technology to look at upcoming changes. Participants agreed that in the near future, changes would mostly come through improvement and maturing of current technology and reduction of errors in verification and KYC – rather than new developments.</p>
<p>Using existing tools to better outsmart fraudsters will be a critical area as we move forward and choosing the right partner who continuously innovate is vital in order to stay one step ahead of them. Fraud sophistication is increasing – including in areas that are not seen much yet, such as deep fake technology and quantum computing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is value in getting it right. Rod drew attention to <a href="mailto:https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">data from McKinsey</a> once again, which suggests that if we can solve the challenge of fraud and trust, it could add 3% to GDP in developed countries and up to 13% in developing countries.</p>
<p>There is plenty more to understand about these new regulations and their implementation. For some more insight from the experts, watch the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/webinar-banking-security-user-experience/">full webinar</a>. </p>

 Selective Disclosure: Share Just What You&nbsp;Want <p>What’s a good approach to protecting your online privacy and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">securing your digital data</a> from unauthorized access?</p><p>Undoubtedly, a complex question, right? But the answer can be simpler than you think, and in two words, the solution is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> — a philosophy that empowers users to control the way their data is stored, accessed, and&nbsp;handled.</p><p>One of the driving principles of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> is a concept called Selective disclosure which enables individuals to share just what they want with others. It empowers the owner of a piece of data to disclose parts of a large data set, so the receiving entity knows just what’s&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. Let’s say, you want to attend a musical show in your city, and due to the COVID pandemic regulations, the authorities have mandated complete vaccination as the entry criteria.</p><p>Traditionally, you would carry a physical card or a digital copy of the vaccination certification with you that certifies that you have taken the vaccines. But along with it, the show’s authorities would also get to know your full name, date of birth, the location where you were vaccinated, home address, phone number, and more, which is exposing a lot of information which is&nbsp;private.</p><p>Such additional information puts you at risk for data thefts, gender/racial bias, and loss of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>At the same time, how can you just reveal information about your vaccination by hiding other personal information?</p><p>Selective disclosure removes this conundrum.</p> What is Selective Disclosure? <p>Selective Disclosure is a concept that empowers the owner of a piece of data to disclose parts of a large data set, so the receiving entity knows just what’s&nbsp;needed.</p><p>As a result, an individual has the freedom to choose what is shared and no longer has to choose between an all-or-none approach. Undoubtedly, selective disclosure enhances an individual’s privacy and level of control over his or her personal information, including deciding who gets to see what data and how this data is used by&nbsp;others.</p> How to Implement Selective Disclosure? <p>In the context of SSI, selective disclosure is best implemented through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> where the user has separate credentials for each piece of information such as his/her date of birth, full name, vaccination details, address, passport number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>When required, all that the user has to do is create a verifiable presentation that contains just the data needed for verification. In our above example, the user has to create a verifiable presentation with his full name and his vaccination details and send it to the show’s authorities for verification.</p><p>Here’s how the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">VC</a> for this example can look like.

Rapid Transition Lab flow&nbsp;map<p>In a post-pandemic world, food is not just our biggest challenge, but also our biggest opportunity for sustainable change.</p><p>The ways that food is produced, distributed and consumed have major negative impacts on people and the planet. Food production is the largest human pressure on Earth, causing a mass extinction of species, and accounting for 23% of annual greenhouse emissions. Food is at the core of various social justice challenges such as working conditions, access to affordable good food, cultural diversity and burgeoning food-related health crises of both malnutrition and obesity. This means that many of the broader environmental and social challenges can be addressed if the way that food is produced and managed is transformed. As Johan Rockström, Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in&nbsp;2016:</p><blockquote>If we get it right on food, we get it right for both people and&nbsp;planet.</blockquote><p>Food transformations will require a series of fast and slow transitions over the next decades. The world’s governments have agreed on the UN Global Goals for 2030. Here in Sweden the country plans to have net zero emissions by 2045. However, neither the world nor Sweden are on track to achieve these goals, and with every day that passes, impacts accumulate and the challenges grow.</p><p>Food is essential and a source of great pleasure. A shared meal can be a ritual or celebration, and a simple everyday pleasure. Food is a rich and meaningful expression of our shared cultural diversity, and the way we make, distribute, and enjoy it, speaks loudly as to what we stand for as a society. Food can be a generator of wealth, in numerous forms, and its cultivation can restore ecological functions. Given that food is the strongest connection humanity has with the biosphere, that our food system is productive but unequal, and that food cultures can either be enriching or destructive, transforming our global food system represents both a grand challenge and a grand opportunity. If we are able to make a just transition to food cultures that restore the biosphere rather than degrade it, we will not only improve the lives of the world’s people, and enhance the biosphere, but also learn how to become better stewards of the&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>Sweden and other Nordic countries are well-positioned to lead the way in the global transformation towards a sustainable food system. It shares many of the world’s problems, while beginning to take action to address them. Current diets in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Finland are unhealthy, carbon intensive, and harm terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, both in the Nordics and elsewhere. About half the population in Nordic countries is overweight or obese, food waste is a major problem, and meat consumption is well above amounts recommended for health or sustainability.</p><p>Sweden is also taking action to change its food system. The Nordic region has world-class dietary guidelines, strict agricultural regulations and emerging innovations to food challenges. In Sweden, diverse innovations are taking place in farming, marketing, logistics and retail. Similarly, many cities, municipalities, and national government are working to develop policy to improve the food system, for both health reasons and environmental objectives. Furthermore, there is widespread public discussion, led in particular by chefs, to build on the success of the New Nordic cuisine <a>[PO1]</a> to create a cuisine that is good for both people and the planet, exploring how to reverse these recent trends towards greater meat consumption and increased environmental damage. As Nordic populations diversify, the various cuisines in the region are enriched accordingly. This means Sweden has the potential to lead a global food system transformation.</p><p>The unequal and often unplanned impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted many flaws and fractures in the fabric of everyday life, not least because it moves as a complex system, as opposed to respecting the way Sweden is organised within health, mobility, urbanism, security, governance and other sectors. We believe that the responses to COVID-19 on the Swedish food system may reveal aspects of the resilience measures needed to meaningfully address the risks and opportunities facing Swedish food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While some of the rapid responses of food system actors to COVID-19 might accelerate a ‘just transition’ towards a sustainable and resilient food system, others may impede it. To better navigate towards sustainability, we want to understand how responses to COVID either built or eroded resilience within the Swedish food system resilience, and whether these responses enhances or reduced the transformative capacities of the Swedish food system. Such understanding can help us better align existing and future research and innovation activities, in order to enable a ‘just transition’ of Sweden’s complex food system; a system not defined by its territorial boundaries but the planetary flows that it is interlinked with.</p><p>Transformation requires significant changes in multiple dimensions of society. These changes must take place at different levels in society, from practices and behaviours, to rules and regulations, to values (financial and non-financial), and world-views. Transformation involves changing the relationships among people, but also profoundly changing the relationships between people and nature. History shows us that crises can create openings for transformation. But while positive societal transformations may arise from crises, the consequences of crises are often not positive. The risk is that opportunities created by the crisis are missed and that crisis response — despite good intentions and innovation — fail to address accumulated problems, and restore a slightly improved or a damaged status-quo. Navigating crises requires understanding of capabilities and capacities that are needed and then developing and mobilizing those capabilities and capacities for&nbsp;change.</p><p>Our project aims to learn from the current COVID-19 crisis and support the enabling of capacities for transforming towards a Swedish food system that promotes the health, equity and sustainability of people and the planet. The project will identify and map risks and opportunities emerging in the Swedish food system due to the COVID-19 pandemic through a co-creative process with public, private and civic food system actors. This process will develop understanding and articulate alternative pathways for food system transformation. It will do this through a Rapid Transition Lab.</p> Rapid Transition Lab <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will identify opportunities and pathways for Swedish food system actors to engage in a rapid transition, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. It will assess different strategies within the Swedish food systems, and support the design of more transformative strategies, practices, and institutions. Vinnova, the Swedish government’s innovation agency who fund this work, plans to connect the learning to multiple related stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in&nbsp;Sweden.</p><p>The Rapid Transition lab will consist of a sensemaking and a futuring project and be structured around three overlapping phases: First, the project will build a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of and the responses to Covid-19 in the Swedish food systems. Second, based on these insights, existing food system scenarios, and through workshops engaging multiple stakeholders, the project will build transformative food system scenarios. In the third phase, the project will use these scenarios to identify strategies and pathways and possible portfolios of experiments for actors to contribute to the transformation of the Swedish food system. These will be accomplished by developing a process of collective sense-making.</p>  Learning from the crisis to reframe food systems: By exploring the interconnected cascading risks and opportunities that have emerged from responses to COVID-19 and the 2019 drought in Sweden, in the context of Swedish food system transformation, we will create broader views of food systems and cultures.  Suggesting strategies to support the capacity building for transformation: Building exploratory scenarios, informed by the responses to the COVID-19 crises in the Swedish food system, can reveal capacity-building strategies that might better enable transformation in the Swedish food system. The scenarios, will build on previous and ongoing scenarios, to develop systemic, holistic and multidimensional scenarios that will be used to identify a portfolio of pathways and experiments.  Input into strategic policymaking and innovation practice: Key stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in Sweden, will be engaged to actively contribute and learn from these exploratory processes. The analysis of the crisis, and development of the scenarios should be relevant to these stakeholders.  <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will be linked to other ongoing transdisciplinary food system projects that Vinnova or the Stockholm Resilience Centre lead or are partners in. These include MISTRA Food Futures, Nordic Food Policy Lab, Sustainable Finance Lab, and NorthWestern Paths. The Rapid Transition lab will complement these projects by focusing on the responses to Covid 19 pandemic in the Swedish food system and use these to build scenarios that in turn will be used to develop transformation strategies and identify capacities for&nbsp;change.</p> Further reading <p>More on Nordic food system transformation can be found in four policy briefs from the SRC, <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html">https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html</a></p><p>What can the COVID-19 pandemic teach us about resilient Nordic food systems? <a href="http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf">http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf</a></p> Who we&nbsp;are <p><a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Centre </a>Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) is an international research centre on resilience and sustainability science.

  <p>Many websites have JavaScript functions that make network requests to a server, such as a REST API. The web pages and APIs are often in different domains. This introduces security issues in that any website can request data from an API. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) provides a solution to these issues. It became a W3C recommendation in 2014. It makes it the responsibility of the web browser to prevent unauthorized access to APIs.  All modern web browsers enforce CORS. They prevent JavaScript from obtaining data from a server in a domain different than the domain the website was loaded from, unless the REST API server gives permission.</p>

<p>From a developer’s perspective, CORS is often a cause of much grief when it blocks network requests. CORS provides a number of different mechanisms for limiting JavaScript access to APIs. It is often not obvious which mechanism is blocking the request. We are going to build a simple web application that makes REST calls to a server in a different domain. We will deliberately make requests that the browser will block because of CORS policies and then show how to fix the issues. Let’s get started!</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Go Application 

<p>First things first, if you don’t already have Go installed on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">download and install the Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Now, create a directory where all of our future code will live.</p>

   <code>mkdir cors
cd cors
</code>   

<p>Finally, we will make our directory a Go module and install the Gin package (a Go web framework) to implement a web server.</p>

   <code>go mod init cors
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get github.com/gin-contrib/static
</code>   

<p>A file called <code>go.mod</code> will get created containing the dependencies.</p>

 How to Build a Simple Web Front End 

<p>We are going to build a simple HTML and JavaScript front end and serve it from a web server written using Gin.</p>

<p>First of all, create a directory called <code>frontend</code> and create a file called <code>frontend/index.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Fixing Common Issues with CORS&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Fixing Common Issues with CORS&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;textarea id="messages" name="messages" rows="10" cols="50"&gt;Messages&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
            &lt;form id="form1"&gt;
                &lt;input type="button" value="Get v1" onclick="onGet('v1')"/&gt;
                &lt;input type="button" value="Get v2" onclick="onGet('v2')"/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The web page has a text area to display messages and a simple form with two buttons. When a button is clicked it calls the JavaScript function <code>onGet()</code> passing it a version number. The idea being that <code>v1</code> requests will always fail due to CORS issues, and <code>v2</code> will fix the issue.</p>

<p>Next, create a file called <code>frontend/control.js</code> containing the following JavaScript:</p>

   <code>function onGet(version) {
    const url = "http://localhost:8000/api/" + version + "/messages";
    var headers = {}
    
    fetch(url, {
        method : "GET",
        mode: 'cors',
        headers: headers
    })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.error)
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data =&gt; {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = data.messages;
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = error;
    });
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>onGet()</code> function inserts the version number into the URL and then makes a fetch request to the API server. A successful request will return a list of messages. The messages are displayed in the text area.</p>

<p>Finally, create a file called <code>frontend/.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"github.com/gin-contrib/static"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./frontend", false)))
	r.Run(":8080")
}
</code>   

<p>This code simply serves the contents of the <code>frontend</code> directory on requests on port 8080. Note that JavaScript makes a call to port <code>http://localhost:8000</code> which is a separate service.</p>

<p>Start the server and point a web browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to see the static content.</p>

   <code>go run frontend.go
</code>   
 How to Build a Simple REST API in Go 

<p>Create a directory called <code>rest</code> to contain the code for a basic REST API.</p>

<p>NOTE: A separate directory is required as Go doesn’t allow two program entry points in the same directory.</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>rest/server.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

var messages []string

func GetMessages(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	fmt.Println("Version", version)
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}

func main() {
	messages = append(messages, "Hello CORS!")
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/api/:version/messages", GetMessages)
	r.Run(":8000")
}
</code>   

<p>A list called <code>messages</code> is created to hold message objects.</p>

<p>The function <code>GetMessages()</code> is called whenever a GET request is made to the specified URL. It returns a JSON string containing the messages. The URL contains a path parameter which will be <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>. The server listens on port 8000.</p>

<p>The server can be run using:</p>

   <code>go run rest/server.go
</code>   

 How to Solve a Simple CORS Issue 

<p>We now have two servers—the front-end one on <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and the REST API server on <code>http://localhost:8000</code>. Even though the two servers have the same hostname, the fact that they are listening on different port numbers puts them in different domains from the CORS perspective. The domain of the web content is referred to as the origin. If the JavaScript <code>fetch</code> request specifies <code>cors</code> a request header will be added identifying the origin.</p>

   <code>Origin: http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>Make sure both the frontend and REST servers are running.</p>

<p>Next, point a web browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to display the web page. We are going to get JavaScript errors, so open your browser’s developer console so that we can see what is going on. In Chrome it is *View** &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools.</p>

<p>Next, click on the Send v1 button. You will get a JavaScript error displayed in the console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v1/messages’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request’s mode to ‘no-cors’ to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The message says that the browser has blocked the request because of a CORS policy. It suggests two solutions. The second suggestion is to change the <code>mode</code> from <code>cors</code> to <code>no-cors</code> in the JavaScript fetch request. This is not an option as the browser always deletes the response data when in <code>no-cors</code> mode to prevent data from being read by an unauthorized client.</p>

<p>The solution to the issue is for the server to set a response header that allows the browser to make cross-domain requests to it.</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>This tells the web browser that the cross-origin requests are to be allowed for the specified domain. If the domain specified in the response header matches the domain of the web page, specified in the <code>Origin</code> request header, then the browser will not block the response being received by JavaScript.</p>

<p>We are going to set the header when the URL contains <code>v2</code>. Change the <code>GetMessages()</code> function in <code>cors/server.go</code> to the following:</p>

   <code>func GetMessages(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	fmt.Println("Version", version)
	if version == "v2" {
		c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	}
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}
</code>   

<p>This sets a header to allow cross-origin requests for the <code>v2</code> URI.</p>

<p>Restart the server and go to the web page. If you click on <code>Get v1</code> you will get blocked by CORS. If you click on <code>Get v2</code>, the request will be allowed.</p>

<p>A response can only have at most one <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header. The header can only specify only one domain. If the server needs to allow requests from multiple origin domains, it needs to generate an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> response header with the same value as the <code>Origin</code> request header.</p>

 Allowing Access from Any Origin Domain 

<p>There is an option to prevent CORS from blocking any domain. This is very popular with developers!</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
</code>   

<p>Be careful when using this option. It will get flagged in a security audit. It may also be in violation of an information security policy, which could have serious consequences!</p>

 CORS in Flight 

<p>Although we have fixed the main CORS issue, there are some limitations. One of the limitations is that only the HTTP GET, and OPTIONS methods are allowed. The GET and OPTIONS methods are read-only and are considered safe as they don’t modify existing content. The POST, PUT, and DELETE methods can add or change existing content. These are considered unsafe. Let’s see what happens when we make a PUT request.</p>

<p>First of all, add a new form to <code>client/index.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;form id="form2"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="puttext" name="puttext"/&gt;
    &lt;input type="button" value="Put v1" onclick="onPut('v1')"/&gt;
    &lt;input type="button" value="Put v2" onclick="onPut('v2')"/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>This form has a text input and the two send buttons as before that call a new JavaScript function.</p>

<p>Next, add the JavaScript funtion to <code>client/control.js</code>:</p>

   <code>function onPut(version) {
    const url = "http://localhost:8000/api/" + version + "/messages/0";
    var headers = {}

    fetch(url, {
        method : "PUT",
        mode: 'cors',
        headers: headers,
        body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(document.getElementById("form2"))),
    })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.error)
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data =&gt; {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = data.messages;
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = error;
    });
}
</code>   

<p>This makes a PUT request sending the form parameters in the request body. Note that the URI ends in <code>/0</code>. This means that the request is to create or change the message with the identifier <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Next, define a PUT handler in the <code>main()</code> function of <code>rest/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>r.PUT("/api/:version/messages/:id", PutMessage)
</code>   

<p>The message identifier is extracted as a path parameter.</p>

<p>Finally, add the request handler function to <code>rest/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func PutMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	id, _ := strconv.Atoi(c.Param("id"))
	text := c.PostForm("puttext")
	messages[id] = text
	if version == "v2" {
	    c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	}
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}
</code>   

<p>This updates the message from the form data and sends the new list of messages. The function also always sets the allow origin header, as we know that it is required.</p>

<p>Now, restart the servers and load the web page. Make sure that the developer console is open. Add some text to the text input and hit the <code>Send v1</code> button.</p>

<p>You will see a slightly different CORS error in the console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v1/messages/0’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn’t pass access control check: No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request’s mode to ‘no-cors’ to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is saying that a preflight check was made, and that it didn’t set the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header.</p>

<p>Now, look at the console output from the API server:</p>

 <code>[GIN] 2020/12/01 - 11:10:09 | 404 |  447ns |  ::1 | OPTIONS  "/api/v1/messages/0"
</code> 

<p>So, what is happening here? JavaScript is trying to make a PUT request. This is not allowed by CORS policy. In the GET example, the browser made the request and blocked the response. In this case, the browser refuses to make the PUT request. Instead, it sent an OPTIONS request to the same URI. It will only send the PUT if the OPTIONS request returns the correct CORS header. This is called a preflight request. As the server doesn’t know what method the OPTIONS preflight request is for, it specifies the method in a request header:</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
</code>   

<p>Let’s fix this by adding a handler for the OPTIONS request that sets the allow origin header in <code>cors/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func OptionMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
}

func main() {
	messages = append(messages, "Hello CORS!")
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/api/:version/messages", GetMessages)
	r.PUT("/api/:version/messages/:id", PutMessage)
	r.OPTIONS("/api/v2/messages/:id", OptionMessage)
	r.Run(":8000")
}
</code>   

<p>Notice that the OPTIONS handler is only set for the <code>v2</code> URI as we don’t want to fix <code>v1</code>.</p>

<p>Now, restart the server and send a message using the <code>Put v2</code> button. We get yet another CORS error!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v2/messages/0’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: Method PUT is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods in preflight response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is saying that the preflight check needs another header to stop the PUT request from being blocked.</p>

<p>Add the response header to <code>cors/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func OptionMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, OPTIONS, POST, PUT")
}
</code>   

<p>Restart the server and resend the message. The CORS issues are resolved.</p>

 What Else Does CORS Block? 

<p>CORS has a very restrictive policy regarding which HTTP request headers are allowed. It only allows safe listed request headers. These are <code>Accept</code>, <code>Accept-Language</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>, and <code>Content-Type</code>. They can only contain printable characters and some punctuation characters are not allowed. Header values can’t have more than 128 characters.</p>

<p>There are further restrictions on the <code>Content-Type</code> header. It can only be one of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, <code>multipart/form-data</code>, and <code>text/plain</code>. It is interesting to note that <code>application/json</code> is not allowed.</p>

<p>Let’s see what happens if we send a custom request header. Modify the <code>onPut()</code> function in <code>frontend/control.js</code>to set a header:</p>

   <code>var headers = { "X-Token": "abcd1234" }
</code>   

<p>Now, make sure that the servers are running and load or reload the web page. Type in a message and click the <code>Put v1</code> button. You will see a CORS error in the developer console.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v2/messages/0’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field x-token is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any header which is not CORS safe-listed causes a preflight request. This also contains a request header that specifies the header that needs to be allowed:</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Request-Headers: x-token
</code>   

<p>Note that the header name <code>x-token</code> is specified in lowercase.</p>

<p>The preflight response can allow non-safe-listed headers and can remove restrictions on safe listed headers:</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X_Token, Content-Type
</code>   

<p>Next, change the function in <code>cors/server.go</code> to allow the custom header:</p>

   <code>func OptionMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT")
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-Token")
}
</code>   

<p>Restart the server and resend the message by clicking the <code>Put v2</code> button. The request should now be successful.</p>

 Restrictions on Response Headers 

<p>CORS also places restrictions on response headers. There are seven whitelisted response headers: <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>, <code>Content-Length</code>, <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Expires</code>, <code>Last-Modified</code>, and <code>Pragma</code>. These are the only response headers that can be accessed from JavaScript. Let’s see this in action.</p>

<p>First of all, add a text area to <code>frontend/index.html</code> to display the headers:</p>

   <code>&lt;textarea id="headers" name="headers" rows="10" cols="50"&gt;Headers&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, replace the first <code>then</code> block in the <code>onPut</code>  function in <code>frontend/control.js</code> to display the response headers:</p>

   <code>.then((response) =&gt; {
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(response.error)
    }
    response.headers.forEach(function(val, key) {
        document.getElementById('headers').value += '\n' + key + ': ' + val; 
    });
    return response.json();
})
</code>   

<p>Finally, set a custom header in <code>rest/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func PutMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	id, _ := strconv.Atoi(c.Param("id"))
	text := c.PostForm("puttext")
	messages[id] = text
	if version == "v2" {
	    c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	}
	c.Header("X-Custom", "123456789")
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}
</code>   

<p>Now, restart the server and reload the web page. Type in a message and hit <code>Put v2</code>. You should see some headers displayed, but not the custom header. CORS has blocked it.</p>

<p>This can be fixed by setting another response header to expose the custom header in <code>server/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func PutMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	id, _ := strconv.Atoi(c.Param("id"))
	text := c.PostForm("puttext")
	messages[id] = text
	if version == "v2" {
        c.Header("Access-Control-Expose-Headers", "X-Custom")
	    c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	}
	c.Header("X-Custom", "123456789")
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}
</code>   

<p>Restart the server and reload the web page. Type in a message and hit <code>Put v2</code>. You should see some headers displayed, including the custom header. CORS has now allowed it.</p>

 Credentials Are a Special Case 

<p>There is yet another CORS blocking scenario. JavaScript has a <code>credentials</code> request mode. This determines how user credentials, such as cookies are handled. The options are:</p>
 
   <code>omit</code>: Never send or receive cookies. 
   <code>same-origin</code>: This is the default, that allows user credentials to be sent to the same origin. 
   <code>include</code>: Send user credentials even if cross-origin. 
 

<p>Let’s see what happens.</p>

<p>Modify the fetch call in the <code>onPut()</code> function in <code>frontend/Control.js</code>:</p>

   <code>fetch(url, {
    method : "PUT",
    mode: 'cors',
    credentials: 'include',
    headers: headers,
    body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(document.getElementById("form2"))),
})
</code>   

<p>Now, make sure that the client and server are running and reload the web page. Send a message as before. You will get another CORS error in the developer console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v2/messages/0’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn’t pass access control check: The value of the ‘Access-Control-Allow-Credentials’ header in the response is ‘’ which must be ‘true’ when the request’s credentials mode is ‘include’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fix for this is to add another header to both the <code>OptionMessage()</code>, and <code>PutMessage()</code> functions in <code>cors/server.go</code> as the header needs to be present in both the preflight request and the actual request:</p>

   <code>c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true")
</code>   

<p>The request should now work correctly.</p>

<p>The credentials issue can also be resolved on the client by setting the credentials mode to <code>omit</code> and sending credentials as request parameters, instead of using cookies.</p>

 Control CORS Cache Configuration 

<p>The is one more CORS header that hasn’t yet been discussed. The browser can cache the preflight request results. The <code>Access-Control-Max-Age</code> header specifies the maximum time, in seconds, the results can be cached. It should be added to the preflight response headers as it controls how long the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code> and <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> results can be cached.</p>

 How to Prevent CORS Issues with Okta 

<p>Authentication providers, such as Okta, need to handle cross-domain requests to their authentication servers and API servers. This is done by providing a list of trusted origins. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/enable-cors/overview/">Okta Enable CORS</a> for more information.</p>

 How CORS Prevents Security Issues 

<p>CORS is an important security feature that is designed to prevent JavaScript clients from accessing data from other domains without authorization.</p>

<p>Modern web browsers implement CORS to block cross-domain JavaScript requests by default. The server needs to authorize cross-domain requests by setting the correct response headers.</p>

<p>CORS has several layers. Simply allowing an origin domain only works for a subset of request methods and request headers. Some request methods and headers force a preflight request as a further means of protecting data. The actual request is only allowed if the preflight response headers permit it.</p>

<p>CORS is a major pain point for developers. If a request is blocked, it is not easy to understand why, and how to fix it. An understanding of the nature of the blocked request, and of the CORS mechanisms, can easily overcome such issues.</p>

<p>An Interview with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrielowe/">Katrie Lowe</a> - CEO and Co-founder of <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi&nbsp;Labs</a></p>Real-estate and Verifiiable Credentials<p>The last few years have put the spotlight on online privacy and security, driven in part by frequent data breaches coupled with the users’ growing innate need to own and protect their data and identity.</p><p>In turn, it has led to the development of an approach called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> that addresses the issue of “establishing trust” within interaction by empowering people to own their data and also determine where information is stored and with whom it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Despite being a relatively new philosophy, interest in SSI has been rapid across industries.</p><p>One sector where SSI is expected to have far-reaching implications is the real estate industry, as it has the potential to bring in a lot of transparency and trust among the stakeholders.</p><p>So, how does SSI fit into this traditional real-estate sector?</p><p>We asked Katrie Lowe, the CEO and Co-founder of <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi Labs</a>, a company that specializes in issuing rental passports using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>.</p><p>Here are the excerpts.</p> COVID has created new opportunities and challenges in the real estate industry. Can SSI address&nbsp;them? <p>Absolutely, yes! COVID has enabled flexible work options that can take us to new places around the world. But, finding a place to rent in a new city may not be enjoyable, as you’ll have to navigate through different properties and neighborhoods, understand the prevailing tenancy laws, and maybe even work through the biases of landlords and property managers.</p><p>This is where SSI fits, as it can create trust regarding a tenant’s rental capacity, and in the process, reduce the&nbsp;bias.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. Let’s say, Lisa is an individual who decides to move to Berlin from Chicago to find a job. In the traditional setup, it’s difficult for Lisa to find a place because she can’t give any rental references in Berlin that a potential landlord can verify. She doesn’t have a job, so there’s a question of how she’s going to pay the&nbsp;rent.</p><p>With SSI, she can show her potential landlord that she has not missed even a single rental payment in the past, even though she had lived in a different country. Also, she can show her education credentials and working experience to prove that she is qualified enough to quickly find a job in&nbsp;Berlin.</p><p>This creates a sense of trust in the landlord, thereby helping tenants to find rentals&nbsp;easily.</p> Do you think SSI is a gamechanger in the real-estate industry? If yes,&nbsp;why? <p>Real estate is one of the sectors that has not completely embraced digitalization, and this means, there’s a lot of potential to bring about change in this&nbsp;sector.</p><blockquote>Currently, digital means sending documents such as payslips and past rental agreements in PDF format by email. In this new age of digital identity and verifiable credentials, there’s so much more that can be done such as identifying tenants with confidence based on verified information and being able to make informed decisions about tenant selection.</blockquote><p>And this is where SSI will be a gamechanger.</p><p>Further, landlords can confidently <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">comply with GDPR</a> and lower their exposure to risks associated with <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd?gi=ee3cacaf54a7">data breaches and hacks</a>, because they have adopted a solution where tenants are in control of their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>In fact, using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">verifiable credentials</a> to check a potential tenant’s rental history is the first step. Soon, it can spill on to property management, property buying, and other aspects of real estate as&nbsp;well.</p> How can SSI address some of the urban housing challenges such as liveability? <p>Though sustainability and liveability can mean different things in different cities, there’s no doubt that every city must help its people to thrive day after&nbsp;day.</p><p>Housing is an important part of everyday life because good housing can enhance the quality of life and make living a lot less stressful. It can allow you to focus on other aspects of your life as&nbsp;well.</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> brings about transparency in the housing market and removes frictions in finding a house. More importantly, the tenant’s documents that contain his/her PII can be shared safely and securely.</p><p>Another aspect is that there isn’t a lot of data around housing now. SSI provides the opportunity for rental data to be shared anonymously, so that at a city level better policy decisions can be made, developers can better understand market needs, and citizens can be more informed about, and active in, conversations around&nbsp;housing.</p><p>All these together can enhance the quality of life in a&nbsp;city.</p> How do you envisage the future of SSI in the real estate&nbsp;space? <p>At this point, there is a lot of hesitancy to adopt digitization in the real estate market. But that is changing as <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">COVID</a> has necessitated a push towards digital adoption.</p><p>Further, there is a considerable effort going at the highest national levels to create more awareness about digital identity, and overall, the next 3–5 years are expected to be big for&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>As more people take up flexible working opportunities and travel for new experiences, SSI gives them a secure way to prove their financial capabilities and rental histories across countries.</p><p>Leaders in the financial and government sectors are already testing out <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">SSI</a> and there’s such an opportunity for real estate to be bold, take advantage and be a frontrunner.</p><p>Note: opinions expressed here are the writer’s&nbsp;own.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/impact-of-self-sovereign-identity-in-real-estate-11456c4b1faa">Impact of Self-Sovereign Identity in Real Estate</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

THE PRESENT&nbsp;MOMENT<p>Today, when the line between online and offline is blurred, what would it look like if we were to take a portrait?</p><p>Due to COVID-19 we have increased the proportion of the online world in our lives. Previously, the online world had a strong perception as a virtual world for entertainment such as games, but now the online world has become a reality that can offset the constraints of space and time in real public and private encounters. Participating in meetings through video conference, planning a ‘LAN drinking party’ with acquaintances, setting up a drinking table at their own home, and having a meeting are a daily scene where telecommuting and staying at home are encouraged. The trend of various metaverse worlds that are appearing one after another, provide a variety of options for self-expression. 2D and 3D avatars created according to each person’s taste become another ‘me’. Now, the portrait of ‘I’ living in ‘today’ is filled with the real me within the real landscape and the other half with the 3D avatar and unrealistic virtual world as the background.</p><p>It is not only the protagonist in the portrait that is divided into reality and virtuality. The contemporary online world completes a virtual landscape by absorbing various areas occupied by reality. Now, furniture, interior accessories, works of art, houses, buildings, and even land (real estate) fill the virtual world market, and active transactions are taking place. The emergence of ‘NFT’ in the field raises the value of virtual assets, which are digital files, to the value of real assets. NFT is an abbreviation of Non-Fungible Token, which refers to a ‘non-fungible asset’ registered in the blockchain. In the process of storing digital creations on the blockchain, a unique number such as a serial number is created, which gives rarity and uniqueness to digital creations. Digital files, which previously could be easily owned without quantitative restrictions through copy-paste, now exist as ‘the only original’ protected by a unique number, and the exchange of this technology will increase awareness of the existence of digital files and transaction methods.</p><p>In this exhibition, the NFT technology provided by CCCV was integrated into the exhibition and its various applications were exhibited. [Pick the NFT for CCCV] is designed to introduce new NFT works to the audience and check their reactions through voting. Visitors to the exhibition hall can vote for their favorite 3 out of the 20 NFT video works on display, and if the written work matches the top three final votes, they can win a prize. The total prize money for voting is 2 million won, and both the artist and the audience are given a chance to win. First, the first 1 million won will be shared among the three artists selected for the top-voted works, and the remaining 1 million won will be shared equally among the viewers who got all the top three final-vote matches&nbsp;. Next, in [Make your own NFT], you can experience the purchase and warranty of NFT works at once by requesting a portrait request. First, the visitor selects the artist who wants to create a portrait, and then purchases a portrait from the artist’s NFT page. Next, after discussing the background color and style of the work with the staff, fill a request form and submit it to the artist. The work will be delivered to the customer’s email and CCCV NFT box by the deadline specified in the request&nbsp;form.</p><p>NFT itself can be an inconvertible asset or work, but at the same time, it functions as a means of transaction for digital works and as a guarantee. In this exhibition, we would like to observe the possibilities of the integration of newly emerged NFT technology and art, and discuss the future changes based on this exhibition.</p><p>Written by Seo-Hee&nbsp;Bae</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-present-moment-cccv-first-nft-exhibition-2021-b82cf51bb307">THE PRESENT MOMENT: CCCV First NFT Exhibition 2021</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At Magic, we love to be where developers hang out. As a Developer Advocate, it’s especially fun to connect with devs dreaming up big ideas and hacking them into&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Back in April, the HackOn2.0 team reached out to me to talk about getting Magic involved in their next hackathon. We jumped at the opportunity and were so glad to support the HackOn2.0’s vibrant community.</p><p><a href="https://hackon.tech/">HackOn 2.0</a> is a week-long, global digital hackathon organized by Aditya Oberai, Rishabh Bansal, and team to bring developer’s ideas from inception to reality. This year’s edition focused on fostering innovation and also raised awareness on mental health and diversity.</p><p>A lot of people dedicated time to participate! 8,298 people registered. In total, there were 370 teams of 2–4 members&nbsp;each.</p><p>Participants built their hackathon projects based on these&nbsp;tracks:</p><p>Magic was proud to be a platinum sponsor. In addition, I was personally psyched to also be a mentor during the hackathon. The learning session set up for May 27th helped participants understand what Magic is and how to get started with&nbsp;it.</p><p>For the mentor session, you can catch the full video recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxwf6y7F424">here</a>.</p><p>“Best Hack built with Magic” was one of the categories for participants, in addition to the primary tracks. The participants were allowed to choose more than one sponsored track. We had the following prizes for participants:</p><p>It was exciting to see that 15% of all projects were built with&nbsp;Magic!</p><p>When it came to evaluating projects, selecting the winners was not an easy task. All of the projects were amazing and well-aligned to the primary track. In the end, we landed on the top 3 hacks that were focused on solving real problems and have utilized the best possible tech stack in this short time. A key criteria considered was how appropriately the project has implemented the Magic integration.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the winners — along with the problem they are solving, the technology used, important links, and their team&nbsp;members.</p> Winners  1. WeCare by&nbsp;Eternals  Problem it&nbsp;solves <p>WeCare predicts the health risks to your body based on your daily health. The ongoing pandemic made everyone learn the importance of being healthy and how daily activities and diet play a major role in being healthy. Team Eternals wanted to alert the users of WeCare about any risk associated with a deficiency or unhealthy lifestyle by showing graphs and predictions using machine learning. WeCare has a smart predict feature that helps uncover latent diseases and predict the risk of future ones. Patients will be able to review medical conditions and reach their treatment goals much faster, lowering the risk of serious health complications.</p> Technology used <p>ReactJS, Python, Django, Apollo, GraphQL, Heroku, Firebase, Magic</p> Team Members <p>Harmanjit Singh, Kunal Khullar, Gurleen Kaur, and Paritosh&nbsp;Arora</p> Important Links <p><a href="https://wecare-h.web.app/">Frontend<br></a><a href="https://health-prediction-backend.herokuapp.com/">Backend</a><br><a href="https://youtu.be/u_vP7FN3ieM">Video&nbsp;demo</a></p> 2. ShopZop by Etherbots  Problem it&nbsp;solves <p>The Covid-19 Pandemic has hit the small and medium-size businesses hard as they relied on their in-shop customers and had very little or no digital presence at all. And with the lockdown and movement restrictions, these businesses have suffered a lot. Team Etherbots came together to help connect the shop owners with customers and helping them. A simple solution was to harness the power of an application that almost every Smartphone user uses in India — WHATSAPP!. It will increase their online reach and solve the problem along with some&nbsp;revenue.</p> Technology used <p>ReactJS, NodeJS, GraphCMS, GraphQL, WhatsApp, Magic</p> Team Members <p>Ayush Jain and Bhuvanesh Shathyan</p> Important Links <p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QqZMSzL9Mg">video demo</a> of the&nbsp;product.</p> 3. Debately by&nbsp;tier-4  Problem it&nbsp;solves <p>Team tier-4 believes that debates help us have healthy discussions and solve problems within the society, helping us build a diverse and inclusive society. In the last few years, online and TV debates have been downgraded, and Tier-4 team members paired up to build an AI-based audio chat for the web using react, magic, webRTC, and symbal.ai to conduct and practice healthy debates. Debately enables individuals from all backgrounds, irrespective of race, religion, and region, to come together and debate on controversial or sensitive topics, share their opinions, or simply improve their language and communication skills while maintaining anonymity.</p> Technology used <p>ReactJS, WebRTC, FastAPI, MongoDB, SymblAI, Firebase, Magic</p> Team Members <p>Sanket Shevkar, Pranav Pathare, Aaryan Srivastava, and Gatij Taranekar</p> Important Links <p><a href="https://debately.study">Live demo</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZiDl7pNaOg">Video&nbsp;demo</a></p><p>HackOn2.0 not only let us to see how Magic fit into someone’s project and learn what features are performing well, but it also allowed us to connect with individuals, get to know them, and understand their perspectives related to solving real-world problems across topics like diversity and inclusion, mental health and awareness, Covid impact, and open innovation.</p><p>We were inspired to see participants tackle a specific problem statement, how devs interacted with different technologies, and successfully built a live demo in a few days. All while working remotely, too!</p><p>Overall, it was a very fun three days of meeting with community members. We gathered feedback and better understood the use case for Magic. It was also a great opportunity to collect more insights on improving product documentation for a better developer experience.</p><p>We look forward to participating in upcoming hackathons and further engaging with the developer community.</p><p>If you have any upcoming hackathons/meetups/conferences and want us to be part of your event, reach out to me on our <a href="https://discord.gg/magiclabs">Discord server</a> with the&nbsp;details!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/magic-at-hackon2-0-9187d0e24d86">Magic at HackOn2.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the first interview in this series, Ontology speaks with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">DuMonT</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I first heard about Ontology back in early 2018 when ONT was listed on exchanges. I was looking for promising projects, so I discovered Ontology which I recognized as quite unique, in terms of its vision and consensus mechanism, as well as its focus on decentralized identity and&nbsp;data.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>As I was already impressed by the vision of Ontology, I wanted to engage more with the community so I joined its chat groups on Telegram where I discovered lots of amazing people. I was truly amazed by the quality of administrators who were very supportive. Therefore, I became an active member of those groups, and later, when I learned more, I was able to help the admins. I am convinced that when you believe in a project’s vision, you should support it in every way you&nbsp;can.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>The key role of a Harbinger is definitely to help community members while also spreading the word in order to increase the awareness of the project. Helping others is also my favorite part of being a Harbinger, as it gives me a lot of satisfaction when I know I’ve helped&nbsp;someone.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>To reiterate what I said in answer to the second question, “I am convinced that when you believe in a project’s vision, you should support it in every way you can”. Being an active part of the Ontology community is for me the best way I can personally support the project and help it to achieve its&nbsp;goals.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Along with its main English chats, the Ontology community covers 30+ different language groups, which is quite unique in the blockchain space. By overcoming the language barrier, many more people from all around the world have access to information about the project. The Ontology community is very supportive of new members as Harbingers also serve as role models for&nbsp;others.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>My key channel is definitely Telegram, as I am an active administrator of the English <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">community</a>, <a href="https://t.me/OntologyTradingOfficial">Trading group</a> and local <a href="https://t.me/OntologySlovakCzech">Czech &amp; Slovak groups</a>, while also helping out in groups like ONTO, Wing Finance and more. I also have active <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter</a> and Reddit accounts where I actively interact with Ontology. Ontology also has an active YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">channel</a>, where I see some room for improvement. I would like to see more step-by-step guides and explanatory videos.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I remember someone from the Ontology team gave me the nickname “The Ontology Wikipedia”, ha-ha, that was when I realized I became an important part of the Ontology community, because I was recognized as a person who always had answers. To future Harbingers, I would suggest being patient with members, proactive with interactions and always hungry for information, as only then can you really help the community thrive.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>In only three? That’s tough I would say: dynamic, passionate and supportive.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more or less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Nothing is perfect, there’s always room for some improvement. To expand the community even more, I think it is important to stay in touch with community members. Especially to listen to their feedback and ideas. I would like to see more polls or votes about important things, which signals to people in the community that their voice matters. Community members can help the community grow by sharing Ontology articles, Twitter posts, commenting, etc. Also, actively using Ontology’s core products and recommending them to their own audience or friends to try&nbsp;out.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>During previous years, Ontology already proved it is here to stay and it is ready as never before to disrupt the verification process with their unique DID protocols. What I think will be a great milestone is implementation and active usage of decentralized identity and data by other projects. This is already starting to happen with partners like ROCKI, the NFT music platform. This should signal to the wider crypto space that Ontology is ready to be implemented all over the crypto industry. I always like to bring in the analogy between Chainlink with oracles and Ontology with DID. As Ontology acquires its first pioneer projects who actively and successfully use its technology, I expect a similar exponential boom as happened with oracles. It is time for DID to become a trigger word and the community can help with that. The crypto space is huge, therefore community members can help to bring us under the radar of the projects who could benefit from Ontology’s tech, as well as to raise awareness among crypto influencers.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the second interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Traditional custodians have an important role to play in digital asset custody 
 The key to compliant security token custody is digital identity 
 Digital identities enable token recovery (restitution obligations) 
 Custodians need access to the token smart contracts, not to the investors’ wallets 
 Security Token Custody = Wallets + Smart Contract Management + Digital Identities

					 Les échanges confidentiels et le partage de données sensibles : une problématique majeure en entreprise 
				 
				
			  
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Juliette Mégret 
						
					 
				  
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			  
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Pour échanger des informations entre collaborateurs, pour obtenir les statistiques de fonctionnement d’un serveur, ou bien pour que deux machines connectés d’une même ligne de production se synchronisent, l’échange de données est au cœur du fonctionnement de toute entreprise.</p>
<p>Que l’interaction ait lieu entre humains, entre humains et machines, ou entre machines, la protection des données sensibles est essentielle. Selon les échanges, l’anonymat des interlocuteurs doit autant être protégé que le contenu des échanges. Cela peut-être pour des questions de respect de la vie privée ; par exemple lorsqu’un employé communique avec la médecine du travail ; ou pour des questions de sécurité ; par exemple l’existence d’interactions avec un coffre physique ou numérique est une information qu’une entreprise souhaite généralement garder secrète.</p>
<p>La plateforme de Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) – identités numériques décentralisées entièrement contrôlées par leur propriétaire – développée par Unikname permet de répondre à cette problématique de façon simple et innovante.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les concepts de Unikname  
			   
				
				
				  Le UniknameID, un identifiants basé sur les DID  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Pour manipuler une SSI, il est nécessaire de pouvoir l’identifier. Pour cela, le W3C a établi de nouveaux standards : <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">les DID</a> : Decentralized Identifiers. Les DID sont dérivés de matériel cryptographique, souvent illisible et impossible à mémoriser pour des humains. Afin de répondre correctement aux problématiques des entreprises, Unikname a développé <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">deux méthodes DID</a>, permettant conjointement de définir ses identifiants décentralisés humainement mémorisables :<a href="https://www.unikname.com/identifiant-decentralise-unikname/"> les UniknameID</a>.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://github.com/unik-name/did-method-spec/blob/main/did-uns/UNS-DID-Specification.md">La première méthode DID</a> désigne un crypto-account sur<a href="https://www.unikname.network"> la blockchain Unikname Network</a>. C’est-à-dire que la méthode associe une identité au couple de clés cryptographiques asymétriques authentifiant toutes les transactions émises par le crypto-account.</p>
<p>Pour ce DID, le sujet est également le contrôleur. C’est-à-dire que l’objet qu’il identifie – le crypto-account – se contrôle lui-même. Grâce au matériel cryptographique dont est dérivé ce premier DID, toutes les transactions émises par <a href="https://www.unikname.com/my-unikname-app/">le crypto-account</a> lui seront irrévocablement rattachées.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>En particulier si un crypto-account acquiert un NFT UNIKNAME, le DID qui y est attaché contrôlera totalement ce NFT. Le NFT UNIKNAME est une chaîne de caractères d’aspect aléatoire, à laquelle il est possible de rattacher des propriétés. Les caractères encodent en réalité une forme obscuricie d’un identifiant humainement mémorisable. Nous définissons ici la deuxième méthode DID, dont le sujet est le<a href="https://docs.unikname.network/tokens.html#the-unikname-token"> NFT UNIKNAME</a> et dont le contrôleur est le crypto-account propriétaire.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Un UniknameID est un identifiant explicite, lisible et humainement mémorisable, stocké en dehors de la blockchain. Il est matérialisé sur Unikname Network par un NFT UNIKNAME ayant pour chaine de caractère la forme obscurcie de l’identifiant. Le propriétaire du UniknameID est le seul à pouvoir relier les formes explicite et obscurcie entre elles. La confidentialité d’un tel identifiant est donc totale. La première méthode DID, identifiant un crypto-account au NFT, permet de contrôler l’identité associée au UniknameID et de signer des transactions ou des messages en son nom.</p>
<p>Par la suite nous dirons qu’un UniknameID identifie une entité (Homme ou machine). Cette entité possédera les clés du crypto-account propriétaire du NFT UNIKNAME et sera contrôleur du UniknameID.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les « Verifiable Claim »  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le concept de Verifiable Claim (VC), <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-use-cases/">au sens du W3C</a>, est fortement associé à celui de SSI. Il s’agit de déclarations (claims) faites par une entité sur un sujet, et dont la paternité peut être vérifiée et datée par des mécanismes cryptographiques. Ces claims peuvent être stockées hors chaîne, de façon complètement privée et sous le contrôle des sujets. Les vérifications se font de façon autonome sans tiers de confiance centralisé.</p>
<p>Dans la solution développée par Unikname, les sujets de VC, comme les entités émettrices, sont identifiés par des UniknameID. Grâce à ces identifiants et aux DID de <a href="https://www.unikname.com/plateforme-unikname/">la plateforme de SSI Unikname</a>, la paternité de l’entité et l’authentification du sujet peuvent être établies formellement.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Par exemple, un individu peut souhaiter faire valoir un diplôme pour prouver posséder certaines compétences, sans vouloir l’afficher publiquement. Le sujet est alors l’individu, et l’entité à l’origine de l’assertion est l’université ayant attribué le diplôme. La paternité de l’université est établie grâce au tampon sur le diplôme. L’individu conserve son diplôme chez lui, et le montre uniquement à son employeur au moment de justifier son niveau d’étude. Si l’employeur a confiance dans l’université, à la fois pour attribuer à juste titre un diplôme et pour gérer correctement son tampon, il reconnaîtra le niveau d’étude déclaré par le sujet du diplôme</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Grâce au standard des assertions vérifiables, il est possible de prouver des éléments d’une SSI, sans avoir à lister publiquement tous ses attributs.</p>
<p>Les preuves cryptographiques peuvent être stockées par le sujet, ou inscrites dans les propriétés du NFT UNIKNAME représentant le UniknameID dans la blockchain selon le besoin.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Il est également possible de gérer des autorisations. Une entité capable de gérer des autorisations pourra émettre des VC pour des sujets, ce qui encadrera les opérations qui leurs sont autorisées. Par exemple, le service de sécurité délivrera des droits d’accès à une zone restreinte, ou bien une télécommande sera autorisée à actionner le démarrage d’une voiture… La vérification de ces droits se fait ici encore de façon décentralisée, directement par les intéressés. Il n’y a pas besoin de gestionnaire de droits centralisant toutes les autorisations. Il s’agit ici d’une avancée majeure : une telle entité représente une cible privilégiée pour un attaquant, et sa disponibilité est essentielle.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  La Blockchain Unikname Network  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Dans une entreprise, il peut être intéressant d’associer des UniknameID aux collaborateurs comme aux objets connectés. Le caractère lisible et humainement mémorisable du UniknameID sera un véritable plus pour les administrateurs système (qui sont encore des humains ) quelque soit l’entité qu’il désigne.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>La plateforme de SSI Unikname propose un service de partage confidentiel d’informations entre identifiants. Les mécanismes décrits ci-dessus permettent d’utiliser la blockchain unikname.network comme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure#cite_note-dpki-20">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</a> (DPKI) pour authentifier ces échanges. Cette infrastructure décentralisée garantit un faible coût de maintenance et une haute disponibilité des identifiants. Deux points essentiels dans la gestion d’un système d’information d’une entreprise.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les nombreux cas d’échanges protégés par Unikname  
			   
				
				
				  Un chat fortement sécurisé  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>En distribuant des UniknameID à tous ses collaborateurs, une entreprise s’offre la possibilité d’établir un chat interne fortement sécurisé.</p>
<p>Par des mécanismes de DID et de VC, Unikname garantit l’intégrité des messages échangés ainsi que l’authenticité des expéditeurs. Ainsi, lorsqu’une personne reçoit un message d’un collaborateur, celui-ci est signé par son UniknameID. Le destinataire acquiert alors la certitude que le message n’a pas été falsifié et que l’émetteur déclaré est le véritable auteur du message. Il s’agit d’un point essentiel pour de nombreux échanges, en particulier pour message contenant des consignes de missions sensibles.</p>
<p>Des bots peuvent également être intégrés à la solution de chat, pour faire remonter des alertes par exemple. Un UniknameID étant attribué au serveur du bot, l’entreprise aura toujours la garantie de l’origine des informations.</p>
<p>Tous les messages échangés via la solution Unikname sont chiffrés de bout-en-bout, ce qui garantit une véritable confidentialité des échanges.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les interactions entre objets connectés  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Un objet connecté est conçu pour accomplir une tâche spécifique parfois sensible : ouvrir des portes, déclencher une alarme, désactiver une arrivée d’électricité, etc.</p>
<p>Ces tâches sont déclenchées par la réception de données, ou par l’analyse d’une situation. Il y a un risque important de failles de sécurité lorsque les garanties d’intégrité et d’authenticité sont défaillantes.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>En identifiant ces objets par des UniknameID, on apporte ces garanties. Les échanges entre les objets sont également chiffrés, afin de protéger le contenu des interactions. La sécurité globale du système exploitant ces objets est augmentée de façon significative.&nbsp;Tous les messages échangés via la solution Unikname sont chiffrés de bout-en-bout, ce qui garantit une véritable confidentialité des échanges.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Des échanges de données vérifiables  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Les messages échangés entre entités peuvent être de simples messages mais aussi s’appuyer sur des assertions vérifiables comme nous les avons définies plus haut. Grâce à ce standard, le niveau de confiance accordé à un système où chaque entité est identifiée par un UniknameID est fortement élevée.</p>
<p>Les administrateurs de ce système peuvent aisément définir les entités capables d’émettre des assertions sur des sujets, ou de leur attribuer des autorisations. Ainsi, toute instruction peut être légitimée, et toute information avancée peut être vérifiée.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Unification des systèmes de partage  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>La force de la plateforme SSI Unikname, en plus d’être « privacy by design », réside dans son universalité. Les UniknameID permettent tous les types de partage de données : échange de message, partage de document de documents, synchronisation d’objets connectés, attribution et vérification de droits… Ils ne représenteront pas un n-ème identifiant à gérer, mais bien le seul, géré dans une application simple et dédiée aux besoins de l’entreprise</p>

 Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0 — A Bridge Between the Past and the&nbsp;Future <p>Web 2.0 represents the Internet as we know it today and includes all the blogs, social media sites, shopping, news generation, and&nbsp;more!</p><p>It is marked by user-generated content, interoperability across different services, usability, interactiveness, and high levels of participation. While this may seem like a huge leap from the static pages of web 1.0, in reality, there have been little to no changes to the core definition between the two versions.</p><p>What has really changed is the way we use existing infrastructure, and from this standpoint, it’s safe to say that it’s really the front-end that has seen the bulk of changes in web&nbsp;2.0</p> Salient Features of Web&nbsp;2.0 <p>In Web 2.0, users&nbsp;can</p>  Classify and sort information  Create and develop APIs for interoperability across different software  Create and share dynamic and responsive content with&nbsp;others  Send and receive information from different sources  Access content from mobile devices, multimedia consoles, televisions, and&nbsp;more  <p>From the above features, we can say that the pillars of Web 2.0 are mobile technology, social media, and the&nbsp;cloud.</p><p>Will these pillars continue their dominance in web&nbsp;3.0?</p><p>Unlikely, because these technologies don’t create a sense of trust among the entities participating in an interaction because of a lack of built-in security and authorization mechanisms.</p><p>As users and technologies become more mature, there emerged a greater need for trust, security, privacy, and control. And this need led to the evolution of web&nbsp;3.0.</p> What’s Web&nbsp;3.0? <p>Web 3.0 is truly a big leap from web 2.0 as the backend and the infrastructure are going through a transformation. Also known as the Semantic Web, this generation of the Internet uses an advanced metadata system that structures and arranges all kinds of data in such a way that it’s readable by both machines and&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Probably the biggest advantage of web 3.0 is that the information will be universal and can be found by anyone, which means no more digging through content for hours to find what you&nbsp;want.</p><p>Now, you might wonder how it overcomes the drawbacks of web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Well, the pillars of web 3.0 are artificial intelligence and decentralized networks. The use of artificial intelligence enables machine-to-machine interaction, advanced analytics, and other smart operations that were hitherto impossible on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>As for decentralized networks, it pushes data to the edges and into the hands of the entities that own it. In the process, it empowers entities to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">own their data</a> and determine how it can be shared, thereby giving rise to a philosophy called the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p><p>These networks also give privacy and security to users through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">encryption</a> and the use of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT), thereby overcoming the trust barriers that were present in web&nbsp;2.0.</p> Salient Features of Web&nbsp;3.0 <p>Here’s a quick glance at the features of Web&nbsp;3.0</p>  The Semantic Web can understand the meaning of words, so content can be easily found, shared, and analyzed by both machines and&nbsp;humans  Uses artificial intelligence to provide relevant results quickly and give insights at speeds that are impossible for humans to&nbsp;match  Has the capability to leverage the power of 3D graphics and&nbsp;visuals.  Protects user identity and data through advanced authorization mechanisms such as encryption and&nbsp;DLTs  Delivers high levels of security and&nbsp;privacy  <p>Below is a bird’s eye view of the differences between Web 2.0 and Web&nbsp;3.0.</p> Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0 — A Quick&nbsp;Glance <p>In all, web 3.0 is a huge leap forward as it creates the infrastructure needed for humans and machines to interact, create, find, and share distributed data, make accurate predictions with artificial intelligence, and be empowered to control one’s identity through a web of trust, security, and&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">privacy</a>.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem and to enable the robust growth of Web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>To learn more about what Affinidi does, follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

Elemental Chat Demonstrates new P2P Possibilities<p>We have reached an important point for Holo as we progress towards the release of the hosting platform. The Pre-Release test of Hosted Elemental Chat continues successfully with more than 200 peers chatting across the world. Messages arrive quickly and participants report a real-time chat experience using the app. Elemental Chat is testing the end-to-end infrastructure of a peer-to-peer Holochain application being hosted by the peer-to-peer Holo hosting network. This demonstrates potentially massive new possibilities on the web. Why do we say&nbsp;that?</p>Current stats visible to all users in Elemental Chat<p>What this means is that each user, when they create their credentials, are creating the cryptographic keys for their instance of the application. Holo cannot write chats on their behalf — ever. Holo cannot remove an entry for a user — ever. The only thing Holo can do, as the infrastructure provider that bridges the connection to the centralised Internet, is prevent an application from being hosted on the platform. Applications of course have their own sets of rules and the creators and developers of those applications will design&nbsp;those.</p><p>I’ve asked a few team members to share about what this means — just to give everyone a sense of how important these results really&nbsp;are.</p><p>“When I use elemental chat knowing my friends and all of humanity is hosting the service I’m using, the internet feels human and fresh all over again.” — David&nbsp;Atkinson</p><p>“We’ve proven that the Holo hosting product, which is a complex system of distributed hApps and centralised infrastructure and which underpins the Holo ecosystem and HoloFuel, works.” — Alastair&nbsp;Ong</p><p>“This release is the first release where we’re delivering value to individual web users. Now, ANYONE can participate in Hosted Elemental Chat, you don’t have to be a host.” — Rob&nbsp;Lyon</p><p>“Hosted EC is a seed of digital agency using a browser and a basic internet connection.” — Lisa&nbsp;Jetton</p><p>Each of us on the Holo team have different personal reasons, drives, and perspectives as to what Holochain and Holo enable in the world and why it matters. Arthur has shared much about this in his blog series on <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-4ac6045ac894">unclosable carriers and the future of communication</a>. Many on the team see Holochain as a distributed infrastructure that can digitally support the distributed coordination required to face and overcome the most pressing global and local challenges of governance and collaboration that lie&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Some of us are excited to enable, at a structural level, the choice about how and where data is stored and who has access to it. Others in our team are concerned about the lack of transparency and the coercive tendencies associated with providers of mainstream Internet services, and are delighted that developers can now replace those apps on Holochain.</p><p>We see the positive test results from Hosted Elemental Chat as a beacon of what is to&nbsp;come.</p> So What’s&nbsp;Next   We launched an update to the <a href="https://holo.host">Holo.Host</a> website. Surprise!  We are ready for people to <a href="https://register.holo.host/elemental">pre-register to try Elemental Chat in a web&nbsp;browser</a>.  We are continuing the pre-release test and plan to add even more users in the coming&nbsp;week.  We are releasing a new version of Holochain for developers this&nbsp;week.  We are testing read-only functionality on Holo so that folks who do not want to login to chat can have visibility to the prototype.  We are working to get the HoloPort Alpha Program ready for hosts to register so that we have enough ports online to support the open release of Hosted Elemental Chat and so that they can begin accruing HoloFuel.  We are continuing to work on sharding in Holochain — moving this week to integration testing of this key scalability feature.  We are working on the new HoloFuel&nbsp;hApp.  We are testing Elemental Chess on&nbsp;Holo.  <p>This is a busy summer for Holo and Holochain. More&nbsp;soon.</p><p>– Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/holo-hosted-elemental-chat-in-a-browser-9be7ad4cbe01">Holo Hosted Elemental Chat in a Browser</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Simplifying Multi-Network on Ocean with a Unified Interface   🦑 The New&nbsp;Reality  🧜‍♀️ Multi-Network Market  🐋 Multi-Network Aquarius   🦑 The New&nbsp;Reality <p>When we launched the Ocean Market as part of v3 we had <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">just moved onto ETH Mainnet</a> from our own custom PoA Mainnet, so all focus for the user interface went into working against that one production network. As we deployed the Ocean Protocol contracts to more chains to escape rapidly rising transaction fees, the main interface paradigm, of basing the displayed metadata on the user’s connected network quickly became a pain to use. Hello, Could not retrieve asset.&nbsp;🙃</p><p>So we sat down and figured out the best patterns to solve these main pain points, focusing solely on the end user perspective:</p>  Reduce friction when following links to assets outside of ETH&nbsp;Mainnet  Retain the DID and existing URLs as the unique identifier for an asset, regardless of&nbsp;network  Increase discoverability of assets outside of ETH&nbsp;Mainnet  Increase discoverability of all networks Ocean Protocol is deployed&nbsp;to  Encourage usage of networks beyond just ETH&nbsp;Mainnet  Reduce need to switch wallet networks as much as possible when browsing the&nbsp;market  Any possible solution needs to scale easily as we continue deploying to more&nbsp;networks   🧜‍♀️ Multi-Network Market Leeloo agrees words with “multi” in front are&nbsp;better.<p>Ultimately, we arrived at a solution tackling all this, where the main new paradigm is an interface showing assets mixed from multiple networks. All the time and on every screen where assets are listed. This detaches the metadata and financial data source from the user’s wallet network as it was&nbsp;before.</p><p>The displayed networks are now controlled by the new network selector.</p>The new network selector and revised menubar in the Ocean Market interface.<p>By default, we auto-select all production networks Ocean Protocol is deployed to. As soon as you interact with this new network switcher, your selection takes over and is saved in your browser so it will be the same the next time you come to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Selecting or de-selecting networks then modifies all Elasticsearch queries going to our new Aquarius, resulting in mixed assets on&nbsp;screen.</p>Mixed assets from multiple networks.<p>All assets now indicate which network they belong to, and you are prompted to switch to the asset’s network when we detect your wallet being connected to another&nbsp;network.</p>One remaining place where user wallet switching is still important.<p>And in the case of using MetaMask, we added actions to switch your wallet network directly from the UI, which, as of right now, is pretty much the most streamlined user flow possible to switch networks with MetaMask from a&nbsp;Dapp.</p><p>With all this, wallet network switching is now only needed once you want to interact with an asset, like downloading or adding liquidity to its&nbsp;pool.</p><p>User wallet network also stays important for publishing an asset, so we based the whole publish form on the currently connected network to define onto which network an asset is published.</p>Publish form with network indicator.<p>As for our key market statistics in the footer, we switched it to show consolidated numbers as a sum of all production networks. In its tooltip, you can find the values split up by&nbsp;network.</p>New consolidated market statistics based on each&nbsp;network.<p>More assets on screen and more controls also led to further UI tweaks to get more space available to the actual main content. We completely refactored the main menu layout, added a global search box to it, and moved some warnings around. And, while we were at it, improved the mobile experience for it.&nbsp;✨✨</p>Everything you need from our menu is all there in mobile viewports<p>And finally, we also automatically migrate all your existing bookmarks from all the networks and combine them into one&nbsp;list.</p> Developer Changes <p>For developers, there are new values in app.config.js controlling the networks which are displayed in the network selection popover:</p><p>- chainIdsSupported: List of all supported chainIds. Used to populate the Networks user preferences list.<br>- chainIds: List of chainIds which metadata cache queries will return by default. This preselects the Networks user preferences.</p><p>In the background, the code base changed drastically. We now have only one Aquarius but still multiple providers and especially subgraphs, and we had to also technically detach the wallet network from the data source. E.g. for showing prices and financial data, main refactoring work went into correlating the assets based on ddo.chainId with the respective subgraph and querying multiple subgraphs at the same time as needed. For this, we also simplified our GraphQL setup and switched from <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/">Apollo Client</a> to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql">urql</a>.</p><p>If you’re interested in all the detailed code changes, you can follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/pull/628">main Pull Request</a> which has references and screenshots for all other changes done against it. This is also the best place to start if you run your own fork of the market and want to integrate the latest multi-network changes without looking at just one big change in&nbsp;main.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/pull/628">Multinetwork Interface by kremalicious · Pull Request #628 · oceanprotocol/market</a></p> Check it&nbsp;out! <p>Head to <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">market.oceanprotocol.com</a> and see assets currently mixed from 3 networks by&nbsp;default.</p><p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a></p><p>You can find all the values required to connect your wallet to the networks Ocean Protocol is deployed to in our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supported networks</a> documentation, along with a guide on how to <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/#set-up-custom-network">set up a custom network in MetaMask</a>.</p>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">Supported Networks</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/#set-up-custom-network">Set Up MetaMask Wallet</a>   🐋 Multi-Network Aquarius <p>Aquarius got a complete refactor. Besides numerous optimizations and stabilization, this new Aquarius indexes assets from multiple chains and delivers them all together in its API responses, with a new ddo.chainId value as part of each asset’s metadata.</p><p>In addition to making an interface with mixed assets possible, this also brings a huge maintainability advantage as now only one Aquarius instance has to be deployed and maintained instead of one for each supported network.</p><p>So multiple Aquarius instances are now reduced to one instance, where for every network a specific indexer is started. The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/references/aquarius/">Aquarius API</a> got a new endpoint exposing which chains are indexed under /api/v1/aquarius/chains/list.</p>/chains/list endpoint response exposing indexed chain&nbsp;IDs Migration to Multi-Network Aquarius <p>Aquarius v3.0.0+ is the&nbsp;one.</p><p>If you use our remote Aquarius instances, all you have to do is point your app against the new aquarius.oceanprotocol.com and then in your interface do things based on ddo.chainId, like modifying your Elasticsearch queries to include assets from specific networks.</p><p>We will keep the old dedicated network instances like aquarius.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com running until September 1st, 2021, and we encourage everybody to migrate to aquarius.oceanprotocol.com instead.</p><p>With one Aquarius indexing multiple chains it is rarely useful to return all the assets as most likely you are only interested in production network assets when listing them in an app. So we will also remove the GET /assets/ddo endpoint and suggest to replace it with a specific search query to POST /assets/ddo/query, and include the chainId you want,&nbsp;like:</p> {<br>  page: 1,<br>  offset: 1000,<br>  query: {<br>    query_string: {<br>      query: 'chainId:1 AND -isInPurgatory:true'<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>If you have your own instances deployed we suggest to deploy a new one with v3.0.0+ to have everything reindex, and finally switch your URLs in your app to this new deployment and adapt your app interface accordingly.

Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/">eftpos</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/">FinTech Australia</a>, established the <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/news/eftpos-launches-advisory-committee-to-give-FinTech-a-voice">eftpos FinTech Advisory Committee</a>. The Committee was established as a way of giving Australian FinTechs a direct avenue to discuss how they partner and collaborate to access the eftpos payments network for the betterment of Australia’s digital economy.




 




Over the past five months, ten leading FinTech companies joined the Committee, chaired by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentabell/?originalSubdomain=au">Ben Tabell</a>, eftpos’ Chief Information Officer. Together, the Committee collaborated to help create an initial report on how to best leverage the eftpos digital roadmap, API programs along with a variety of industry topics.




 





<blockquote>Enabling Australian FinTechs a direct avenue to discuss how they partner and collaborate to access the eftpos payments network through the Committee resulted in recommendations that covered a number of central themes, including consultation and engagement, regulation, and technology and solutions<p></p>Ben Tabell, eftpos Chief Information Officer and Committee Chair</blockquote>




<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco </a>is honoured to have been one of the companies invited to join the Committee alongside <a href="https://assemblypayments.com/">Assembly Payments</a>, <a href="https://www.bleuco.com/">Bleu</a>, <a href="https://www.monoova.com/">Monoova</a>, <a href="https://www.sniip.com/">Sniip</a>, <a href="https://verrency.com/">Verrency</a>, <a href="https://www.ezypay.com/">Ezypay</a>, <a href="https://www.azupay.com.au/">Azupay</a>, <a href="https://www.polipayments.com/">POLi</a> and <a href="https://www.paypaplane.com/">Paypa Plane</a>.




 




The aim of the Committee is to advise eftpos on ways the company can build on its efforts to make it easier for FinTechs to access the eftpos network, products and services. The focus is to enable FinTechs to build experiences that can work across a broad range of connected devices in the digital economy.




 




eftpos has now released the report in collaboration with FinTech Australia, delivering ten recommendations on how Australian fintechs can best leverage the eftpos digital roadmap and API programs.




 




Of the recommendations in the report, Meeco is especially interested in the inclusion of data as the new currency, mobile wallets and digital identity. These map directly to the work Meeco has had the privilege to explore and validate together with eftpos over the past year. This includes a <a href="https://hedera.com/blog/eftpos-pioneers-new-ecommerce-micropayments-solution-using-hedera-hashgraph">micropayments Proof-of-Technology</a> using Meeco’s multipurpose wallet decentralised on Hedera and a pilot that is now underway with eftpos’ identity broker solution, <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/payment-solutions/payment-solutions-for-business/connectid">connectID</a>, for credentials verification as part of employee onboarding.<br><br>We’re delighted that this work with eftpos and <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a> has resulted in us being selected as a FinTech Australia <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/meeco-announced-as-finnies-2021-finalist/">Finnies finalist in the “Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger” category</a>. The Finnies event and announcement of winners is now delayed to September, due to the rolling COVID restrictions in Australia.




 




The eftpos FinTech Advisory Committee Report; Innovating on the domestic card rails, is now available to download.




 





 
 <a>Read the report</a> 
 





 




We would like to thank eftpos and FinTech Australia for the opportunity to have contributed to the Committee and the report.  We hope you find it interesting and useful.

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Peter some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the problems of the identity's status quo today?</p>
<p>
Yeah, the identity status quo today. This is a tricky question because what we see these days is we get more and more in this area where we need identity, where you need to authenticate yourself in a more deeply- and highly-connected environment. And since one of our main [areas of] focus or visions for Bosch is the Internet of Things [IoT]. And we see a more and more connected car, connected to the infrastructure, connected to the smart city, [and connected] to anything else, even to the streets and the crossroads now. There you need to have a particular idea where you can say, okay, you need to upload or download data from the car, and then the infrastructure or the car needs exactly to know who does that. Where the car data comes from and who you are.  
</p>
<p>And so today the ID is getting more and more important because without an ID, you have not the chance to do anything when it comes to smart traffic, smart city or anything like that, or anything with dealing with the IoT. So therefore it's [important]. And the problem that I see personally as well is [that] really these days, you only have these federated systems of ID. You get your ID on the internet via Apple, Google, Amazon, or any other proprietary systems. And so, if you have really, really safety critical stuff, I do not really trust these other systems when it comes to highly critical data which needs to be transmitted. And if my ID is really stored somewhere [on someone] else's computer or server or any backend, this could be getting a bigger and bigger problem in the future.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can decentralized identity solve pressing identity issues? Why is this particularly relevant to the mobility industry?</p>
<p>
Yeah, exactly. I think we definitely can shoot at these problems - what I just said, because when we talk about decentralized identity, you do not have these intermediaries in the background again anymore. So, what we have here is decentralized. We have another system of governance. We have another system of control. So, for one particular technical system like self-sovereign identity, for example, you are really self-sovereign of your data. So, you [are] controlling your own ID, your own identity, and you control what kind of data you are giving to the other site when you talk to anyone in the internet or Internet of Things. And so, when you talk about mobility, and you go into your car, not only yourself need to digital identity, the car itself - as a device - needs identity as well.</p>
<p>
And if in the future, if you think about [car] charging, for example, parking or zoning in a smart city, or anything like that, then you always – what I said before - you need to authenticate or authorize yourself to do anything and as well, maybe to buy things or to sell things, data in the car. And then absolutely it's so important that you can control what you are doing exactly with your data. Therefore, decentralized systems are quite important. And my hypothesis here, is it won't go without it in the future. Of course, Amazon, Google, or the likes can tell you, okay, trust us, the data is safe, and we can do it on premise and all that stuff, but on really the safety critical things, I do not trust anyone. I do only trust myself in these cases because when it goes about the life of the driver, for example, the safety of one, then we have to trust the person themselves, and that is possible really only with decentralized systems.     
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When will decentralized identity become a reality? </p>
<p>
If you would have asked me like a year ago, I would have said maybe like five or 10 years. We are very far from it because automated driving, as well, needs a longer time. However, things have changed because we are going now in a phase where the governments are making a lot of pressure to really enforce the industry to use these digital identities. And especially there's one very interesting development at the moment that the German government, for example, they are pressing on using self-sovereign identity. </p>
<p>And so, with that, the time is getting faster and faster, or the development time is getting faster and faster. And I expect now to be able to use these systems, like in one, two years already. And together with this, we are in a huge collaboration mode with Gaia X in Europe at the moment. And so this helps again, because we have all the industry groups, a lot of startups, [and] a lot of universities coming together, working on these problems in a very fast mode. And so this helps us maybe in having [within] two or three years’ time, really scalable and usable systems out there.   
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Could you share some insights on your presentation at EIC 2021? </p>
<p>
Right, I already started it, featured it a little bit. Trust is really the key concept because when you talk about, maybe, automated driving, then you need to trust the infrastructure. You need to trust the data which comes into the car because the car has to take some decisions. Where to drive, how to drive and as well, the driver gives some very trustworthy data to the car and to the infrastructure. And that is in a lot of different use cases. You need that trust relationship, and you need technical systems that help you with that. And so there are some use cases I would really talk about a little bit deeper and try to explain  what is the situation today. How would we solve this today, and how would we solve that problem or challenge with these new technologies we are seeing upcoming.  </p>

<p>The identity industry is evolving. Once a niche field that very few people understood, digital identity is now a strategic piece in every organization's security architecture. Organizations are successfully breaking away from monolithic, legacy systems yet one key challenge that remains is building user-centric security solutions. To build centralized authorization in an increasingly decentralized world, identity data needs to be dynamic and easily adaptable — without changing a single line of code. Join host Cameron D'Ambrosi and Director of Strategic Alliances at Cloudentity David Lee as they pave way for the next realm of "identity 3.0" and break down open data, the adoption of new identity standards, and active governance systems across the organization.</p>

<p>CoinPost: Ardor PoS blockchain technology has been the focus of many projects related to blockchain gaming and NFT. In particular, two research studies where Ignis, Ardor’s main child chain, was used as a demonstration tool conducted by Dr. Alexander Pfeiffer, post-doc fellow at Comparative Media Studies at MIT and Senior Researcher at Donau-Univeristät Krems. The first research is a demonstration experiment in the creative industry, to test whether the issuance of NFTs can be used to support the authenticity of items. The second examination within the media and publishing industry analyses the feasibility to use digital IDs to guarantee the authenticity of the source material.</p>

  <p>How many of you have looked at the SCIM specifications (IETF&nbsp;RFC&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643">7643</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644">7644</a>)&nbsp;and&nbsp;thought&nbsp;“could they be made simpler or clearer”?&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is your chance&nbsp;to make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/agenda/">The IETF’s&nbsp;111th&nbsp;Plenary&nbsp;Meeting</a>&nbsp;is running virtually as we speak, and&nbsp;this Thursday (July 29th)&nbsp;one of the events in the plenary is a “Birds of a Feather”&nbsp;(or&nbsp;BoF)&nbsp;meeting for taking new steps with SCIM&nbsp;(the session identifier is&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/sins/meetings/">sins</a>).&nbsp; We hope to convince the&nbsp;IETF Area Directors and the community that there is further work to be done in this area, and no matter what your opinion is, you should&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/sins/about/">bring that opinion to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BoF&nbsp;meeting</a>&nbsp;and be heard!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don’t have to be a standards person – if you are working with SCIM and just getting stuck, that is important implementer feedback that we want to hear.&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 The Lead Up&nbsp; 
<p>The topic has been discussed in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group">informal bi-weekly meetings</a>&nbsp;for the last two months&nbsp;(we call it the SCIM Interest Group), with strong participation and lots of healthy opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We started by reviewing the many different draft extensions that are out there for SCIM, and a lot of those reviews are available on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe2lm3WNUfehPOxEvZ92ygA">SCIM IG&nbsp;Youtube&nbsp;channel</a>&nbsp;if you are interested.&nbsp; We applied for the&nbsp;BoF&nbsp;meeting to get feedback from a larger audience and to judge whether we have momentum, and now we are going to find out.&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Microsoft View&nbsp; 
<p>When it comes to SCIM,&nbsp;Microsoft is&nbsp;interested in participating for several simple reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operational Clarity&nbsp;</p>
 
 At the time SCIM was born,&nbsp;the&nbsp;cloud was&nbsp;still&nbsp;new&nbsp;and the possibilities were not known.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;very&nbsp;common assumed implementation pattern was&nbsp;a push model from on-premises to cloud, and this led to assumptions about who would be pushing what data where.&nbsp;&nbsp;These days however, the combinations of push and pull, client and server, are much more varied.&nbsp;We think that some simple updates in language and better profiling of common implementation roles could make the specification much more intuitive to adopt – thus&nbsp;helping overall interoperability&nbsp;across the identity community&nbsp;and&nbsp;getting us closer to making SCIM a must-have&nbsp;cross-domain interface.&nbsp; 
 
<p>End to End Automation as a First Order Goal&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Identity world is now&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;powered by automation and&nbsp;AI.&nbsp; Connectivity is no longer just about web single-sign on;&nbsp;the new and growing requirement today is for&nbsp;automated&nbsp;corporate oversight,&nbsp;including&nbsp;governance, provisioning, risk detection and threat intelligence.&nbsp;And we don’t only want to automate the connections, we want to automate the establishment of the connection.&nbsp; We are hoping to research&nbsp;whether there is additional&nbsp;metadata or even schema that could facilitate a more seamless bootstrapping of&nbsp;various protocols in the multi-cloud world, including&nbsp;protocols like&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/">Shared&nbsp;Signals and&nbsp;Events(SSE)/CAEP</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://openid.net/wg/fastfed">Fastfed</a>, with a plan to&nbsp;lay the groundwork for the explosion in multi-cloud automation that&nbsp;growing industry verticals like&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudknox.io/cloud-infrastructure-entitlement-management/">CIEM</a>&nbsp;exemplify.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Security Best Practice&nbsp;&amp; Multi-cloud&nbsp;Updates&nbsp;</p>
 
 In the API Security world, a lot has happened since the first SCIM work began.&nbsp; OAuth 2.0&nbsp;has become&nbsp;the preferred mechanism for protecting APIs and a number of extensions have evolved that increase security during access token presentation.&nbsp; We want the negotiation of industry-best security to be well specified for identity data&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Get Involved&nbsp; 
<p>The most important thing to do is to sign up for the IETF Birds of a Feather meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration is here:&nbsp;<a href="https://registration.ietf.org/111/">https://registration.ietf.org/111/.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no membership requirement, but there is a fee – a day pass costs $125 but there are fee waivers available if that cost is too great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also join our merry band in the SCIM Interest Group – connection data is on our wiki:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group/wiki">Explanation of our goals, how to get involved, and pages on our dedicated work efforts (github.com)</a>&nbsp;. We meet every 2 weeks, in two different times of day to encourage global participation. For updates,&nbsp;the easiest way to stay informed is to subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ietf.org%2Fmailman%2Flistinfo%2Fscim&amp;data=04%7C01%7CPamela.Dingle%40microsoft.com%7C50789b8468294876f9df08d9507d030f%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637629320743730646%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=sGI8BsjgtS2v7idTkSnr4O0QI9BlYBs9M2DGaePjr8U%3D&amp;reserved=0">SCIM Mailing list at IETF</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope your excitement about this standards work is as great as&nbsp;ours&nbsp;and we cannot strongly enough encourage your participation – the best specifications are made from diverse input, and the more breadth we have in implementation experience and point of view, the better we will do.&nbsp; Join us!&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Microsoft last week announced another acquisition, a few days after announcing the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/fisher/microsofts-threat-intelligence-play-is-good-news-for-customers-in-fight-against-ransomware" title="acquisition of RiskIQ">acquisition of RiskIQ</a>. This next acquisition is <a href="http://cloudknox.io" title="CloudKnox Security">CloudKnox Security</a>, a vendor offering unified privileged access and cloud entitlement management. These technologies, sometimes also referred to as CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management), are essential for getting a grip on entitlements and access to cloud resources in multi-cloud and multi-hybrid environments.</p>
 Permission Management for hybrid cloud infrastructures 
<p>The CloudKnox Cloud Permissions Management Platform delivers a range of capabilities for managing privileges and access for cloud resources. This includes discovery and assessment of the state of privileges. It supports managing and optimizing privileges, for enforcing principles such as least privilege and need to know. It supports monitoring, auditing, and reporting, as well as forensics and incident response. Support spans the major clouds, but also virtualization environments such as VMware NSX, and management of server operating systems.</p>
 Extending PAM and hybrid cloud support in Microsoft 365 
<p>With that acquisition, Microsoft strengthens their <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/" title="Azure Active Directory">Azure Active Directory</a> offering, by further extending the reach into multi-cloud and multi-hybrid environments, but also extending the capabilities for managing privileged access entitlements and thus the breadth of its PAM (Privileged Access Management) capabilities. We expect to see integration of these technologies into the existing Microsoft stack of identity and security solutions soon.</p>
<p>Microsoft demonstrates with these acquisitions that identity and security are, for long, not just a by-product anymore, but one of the core pillars of their portfolio. Specifically, Microsoft is consequently extending its scope of solutions beyond the own ecosystem, serving the breadth of today’s heterogeneous IT environments.</p>

<p>At the latest Ethereum Community Conference, Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta gave a presentation on how Mattereum is building the path for Ethereum, and crypto at large, to truly establish itself in the world of global&nbsp;trade.</p><p>The following is an edited transcript of Vinay’s talk at the 2021 Ethereum Community Conference, where he presents Mattereum as a legal-technical infrastructure provider for bridging Ethereum with the physical economy, thus securing blockchain’s role in global trade.

So the idea here is that when you buy the NFT, you get an enforceable, practical, legal right that will allow you to take physical possession of the&nbsp;object.</p><p>And that is a problem that has both legal layer where we have to be able to say that you actually own the thing. It has technical layers in that we have to make sure we don’t wind up, for example, double spending physical objects. So you have two claims on a single, for example, gold bar. And the third thing that we ought to be dealing with is physical custody to make sure that the physical offsites that we’re dealing with are where we think they are when we go and try and collect&nbsp;them.</p><p>So the objective is to kind of build a whole system here where the legals, the technicals and the physical custody all align in a way that allows you to buy an NFT for a physical thing and get the physical thing. So what I’m going to start with is a few slides that just kind of illustrate how we got here and kind of what the idea is and then we can actually take a look at some NFTs for hopefully desirable, physical property that you can buy and sell right&nbsp;now.</p><p>So the company is called Mattereum. A little bit about my background: I’m basically a climate guy. I spent basically off and on 20 years figuring out how to relocate tens or hundreds of millions of people as part of climate change. Went into industry in 2014 after a long time in military think tanks. And in the long run, what I’m very interested in is using this kind of blockchain based resource allocation technology for managing very scarce, physical resources and environments like refugee camps, but also potentially space stations, moon base, Mars&nbsp;space.</p><p>Because this problem of, you know, who’s got the 10 millimeter wrench and can I borrow it so I can get the satellite dish installed in very austere environments using software to manage scarce physical resources makes a ton of sense to me. And at the kind of 10 year, 15 year horizon, that’s the kind of direction that I’m traveling.</p><p>Should also say that I was the release coordinator for the Ethereum chain and my background in crypto goes back into the mid&nbsp;1990s.</p> Bringing Ethereum to the Physical&nbsp;World <p>The bottom line is that we’re trying to get Ethereum into a position where Ethereum can break out of the digital sphere and get right into the physical sphere in the same way that, for example, USDT and USDC gave us access to the dollar economy and allowed us to do price stabilization inside of smart contracts.</p><p>What we want to achieve with Mattereum is the same thing, but for houses, cars, gold bars, collectibles, fine art, clothes, whatever it&nbsp;is.</p><p>One of our critical sort of conceptual breakthroughs we actually got on Twitter from a fellow by the name of “gmoneyNFT” who basically said NFTs start to make a lot more sense once you realize that everything in the world except money is an NFT. And that was kind of where the lights went on. I’m like, yeah okay, this is exactly what we’re doing. We’re just modeling everything that you can’t get to with the ERC-20s you can get to as an ERC-721. So it’s that same extension kind of like USDT, kind of like USDC, but for everything, represented as NFTs rather than represented as currency instruments. Does that kinda make sense? It’s a big conceptual jump but let’s start&nbsp;there.</p><p>The reason for doing this is the world of physical goods is extremely large. I mean the numbers are completely eye watering. And if we can begin to manage this kind of volume using the blockchain at that point, it’s very, very clear what the longterm economic model for something like Ethereum&nbsp;is.</p><p>Right now, we have bit of a problem that we have layers of speculation on speculation on speculation on speculation, so when the Ethereum price wobbles, the entire economy wobbles. That is not where we want the world’s global computing infrastructure to be. We want the computing infrastructure to remain rock solid. So if you’ve got some kind of financial speculation over here, the entire edifice doesn’t rock. And we get there by putting say tens of trillions of dollars of physical assets into the Ethereum ecosystem so that 99% of the value in the Ethereum ecosystem is physical goods which have their property rights controlled with Ethereum rather than virtual goods, which are all denominated in value in&nbsp;Ether.</p><p>To me, that is the point at which we’ve kind of finally broken through. We’re in the real world. We’re deployed in the real world. And things really begin to change socially, culturally, and in tricky areas with regulation like climate change, this is how we get the leverage on those kind of tricky&nbsp;areas.</p><p>So that’s the kind of goal state, right? The goal state is to get out into the physical world, stabilize the economy by using the digital layer of all the smart contracts as a way of controlling value in the physical world rather than having the value only be locked inside of the smart contracts.</p> Crypto: An Economic Engine for Securing Global&nbsp;Trade <p>The economic lever for doing this is counterfeiting.</p><p>So in areas like wine, for example, roughly 8% of all the wine that was imported to Germany is fake. In high-end wine markets like auction markets, that number can be 20 or 30%. And remember wine is $360 billion annually. So when you start talking about 8% of a $360 billion market, if you can use the NFTs to assert the credible provenance to prove the wine is real, then what that gets you is an economic engine which is preventing the fraud, drives the use case for the blockchain.</p><p>And this is a very, very direct powerful economic driver that moves real-world transactions from the kind of website e-commerce paradigm where everything is done with credit cards up into the blockchain space where you do the same transactions for the same wine, but this time you use crypto plus NFTs rather than doing the transactions in the kind of credit card&nbsp;economy.</p><p>And you do that specifically because you can eradicate the fraud. That economic engine applies to a gigantic percentage of the world’s trade. I mean, says here at 3.3%, that’s averaged out against all commodities. It’s very spiky. Some things are massively fraud written. Other things were relatively fraud free, but that’s enough of a margin to pay for the transaction cost to moving onto a secure platform.</p><p>In this respect what we’re looking at here is a kind of an economic gradient between a low trust economy on credit cards and a high trust economy on crypto and NFTs with a kind of 3.3% of global GDP lever between those two economies. So this is how we kind of get world trade to bump off the credit card system up and onto the Ethereum&nbsp;rails.</p><p>I apologize if that’s kind of abstract. We’re very deeply soaked in this stuff. So, you know, it can be a little jargony, I apologize.</p> Trust Communities: Webs of Trust Around Physical&nbsp;Goods <p>So the way that we do this jump is we essentially assemble a thing which is kind of like a miniature DAO and we call this Trust Community.</p><p>So if I take a physical asset, So here we have the infamous Shatner stuff. Our first customer was William Shatner, the actor from star Trek. Here we have some memorabilia that Shatner signed and the verification of these physical assets is driven by a community of trust around each asset. So what you have is multiple different parties who are each staking value guaranteeing that those assets are real. And that multi-party authentication structure allows also for different kinds of&nbsp;truth.</p><p>So for example, if we’re looking at these Shatner toys, maybe one person comes along and says, “I was there when they were signed.” Another person comes along and says, “I’ve got records of when these things were manufactured.” Another person comes along and says, “I’ve done a CO2 calculation for how much energy was consumed in making these toys.” And you’ve got carbon offsets that pay for that,&nbsp;right?</p><p>So that as a model: where we’ve got all of these different individuals who are all staking value around a single asset, but each one is picking up a different facet of the truth. This is very much like a DAO and you can also imagine a syndicate where you might get 20, 30, 40, 50 people that were all simultaneously staking behind the opinion of a single&nbsp;expert.</p><p>And what this allows us to do is spread the trust and spread the risk associated with physical asset purchases across networks: individuals, staking pools, potentially insurance networks. And we are working very closely with UNN.Finance to actually build staking pools that will allow people to participate in providing the warranty infrastructure around the purchase of physical goods on Ethereum.</p><p>So much as I’m historically quite down on DAOs because of issues like joint several liability, if you do it correctly and you’re very careful not to create something which looks like a share, you can still use a lot of the concepts from DAOs but what you’re doing is spreading risk through essentially promissory instruments rather than things which entitle people to share a future&nbsp;profit.</p><p>It’s quite delicate, but it’s important to stay out, for example, securities law.</p> A God’s Eye View of Product Lifecycles <p>So the final point that I want to make here is that this is not a simple closed system. The gold bars that we sell, for example, have an estimate of the amount of CO2 involved in manufacturing the gold bar and the amount of CO2 that was involved in creating the&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>And then we’ve got partner company Nori who has sold us blockchain tokens to cover that gold carbon&nbsp;burden.</p><p>What we have here is an integration of the authenticity data about the gold, the legal transfer right instantiated as an NFT and also tokenized carbon to basically take away the environmental load.</p><p>What we’re really doing is we’re embedding these physical goods inside of their total context and more and more and more of the total context of the goods becomes visible in the blockchain as we do things like importing data from anti-slavery databases or anti slavery researchers to verify that, for example, gold bars were produced without any slave labor being involved.</p><p>And we think that’s fundamentally important because again, you know, if the blockchain really is kind of the world computer, we need to be able to model the externalities of trade in that world computer so that we can accurately price goods. Right? If something comes in contaminated with a whole bunch of, you know, slave centric manufacturing processes, we don’t want to be in a position where that thing is being sold right beside something that was produced artisanally and extremely carefully to make sure no one was exploited. We need to be able to show these distinctions so that we can apply economic or potentially regulatory pressure to get the garbage out the global supply&nbsp;chain.</p> Examples of Live Physical Asset&nbsp;NFTs <p>So here we have an OpenSea page for three physical objects: an etching by Salvador Dali, a half-a-million year old stone hand axe made by an unknown hominid, probably a human, but maybe not, and a Tibetan bronze statue of a god called Acalanatha. These are NFTs on OpenSea. You can go find them if you look for Mattereum. This thing currently has a bitterness for just about $6,850 — sorry,&nbsp;$8,650.</p><p>So these things are being sold right now. The physical handaxe is stored in a vault in London. And when you buy the NFT, you get the right to take the handaxe out of the vault, or you can leave the handaxe in the vault and just hold the NFT. And every year you pay a storage fee and that covers the storage in the vault for another&nbsp;year.</p><p>Now why might you want to do this? Well, maybe you want to own a handaxe. And you don’t want to have it shipped to your house and stick it on a shelf where your kids will decide they’re going to use it for, you know, opening the box of cereal. You want to own the thing because you’re interested in the heritage and the history. You don’t need it physically in your house. More likely. You’re somebody that is interested in doing something like a museum show, and you want to lock in ownership of all of the assets you want to show simultaneously as a&nbsp;batch.</p><p>And then once you’ve got the property rights secure for all of these things, then you could prove the logistics into a play to get all the stuff to one place, to have it on display. And then it can go back into vaulting. Um, But I mean, no denying it’s a stop right? It’s a thing which is there just to show how concrete and tangible these things&nbsp;are.</p> The Value Flows within Trust Communities <p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xd3fdaeac03cd397b37f98375dfac9308c933afa8/6">Lohko PAMP Gold Bar 1 oz (S/N: 74707) - Lohko NFT | OpenSea</a></p><p>Let’s go take a look at a gold bar, which is maybe a little more practical. So here we have one-ounce gold bar currently owned by Singh Capital, sold by a customer of ours, Lohko. So same thing. This bar is in a vault in Singapore. Ownership of the NFT gives you the right to transfer the physical&nbsp;bar.</p><p>Let me talk through the legal magic that makes this possible. So when you buy the NFT, OpenSea takes a 2% payment out of the NFT transfer. So I as the buyer have paid 98% of the money to the seller of the NFT. 2% is being collected by OpenSea and that 2% is then relayed to a set of people in this Trust Community who are authenticating the&nbsp;bar.</p><p>So that Trust Community is mapped in a structure called the Asset Passport. So all of these people here, right? You can see we’ve got data, terms of service, vault, NFT, and carbon. Each one of those five entities is being paid a percentage of this 2% fee by the buyer immediately on purchase of the NFT. So this creates a legal obligation between say the vault warranty provider and the new owner of the NFT. And those legal obligations are represented entirely on&nbsp;chain.</p><p>So, although you can’t directly verify that the bar is physically there on chain. You know, there is the video camera watching the bar where you could go and get feed. And even if there was you couldn’t trust the camera. What we can represent fully on train is a legal liability to say if the bar isn’t where you said it is, then you will pay. And so what we need to do then is assess the liability on each one of those people and their ability to pay. And that serves as a proxy for the physical presence. So on chain, you can make the estimate about whether people actually have the money to pay their debts. And if they do, you can use that by extension to validate the physical&nbsp;goods.</p><p>And that is a very solid contractual relationship between the NFT buyer because if you accepted the money from the NFT buyer to say that you were signing up to provide this data and the data is wrong, you have an extremely clear basis for litigation and Mattereum also handles that litigation.</p><p>Let’s go take a look at the vault claim. A party, in this case Lohko Wallet, who are our customer and our partner that is producing the gold, they say they will take a quarter of a percent of the NFT sale price of the bar. And in return, they will accept a liability which is the gold value of the bar specified by the spot price from the London bullion market association, plus&nbsp;5%.</p><p>So they are on the hook. As soon as you buy the NFT for the full price of bar, plus 5%. Now notice you’re not buying the NFT from them. You’re buying the NFT from Singh Capital, who are the current owner of the NFT. So you pay the money to Singh Capital. You also pay the money to Lohko. For Singh Capital you purchase the NFT. From Lohko, you purchase a warranty on the NFT, and this is also true for the other people in this warranty provider&nbsp;network.</p><p>This is what I mean by Trust Community. The trust structure continues to pay out every time the NFT is transferred and that creates a continuous legal container for the NFT. It’s a very, very durable structure.</p><p>Not say that you have to make a claim. You want to say to Lohko, “Hey, you know, I asked for the bar to be physically shipped to me and it wasn’t physically shipped to me. I’m making a claim. There is a contract. And this is a big, old, scary, legal document. Every time a new asset is added, new contracts are generated. The fields in yellow are being basically pulled out of a data structure on IPFS. So all of the underlying documentation is stored in IPFS. We pull that information out of the IPFS and we use it to prepare these documents, which verify the legal obligation. So everything is very, very tight on the backend. All the documents are stored and identified around their hashes. They can’t be modified. They’re uploaded into IPFS at the same time the NFT is created. The NFT links directly to those documents in&nbsp;IPFS.</p><p>The whole print system is extremely tight and we’re working on making this stuff easier to understand. It’s a bit tricky to document because there’s so much detail. So at the point where the NFT is transferred, this is the contract which is being executed between the NFT buyer and Lohko. And it’s the network of those executed contracts that provide the proof that the asset is&nbsp;there.</p><p>Here’s some Star Trek stuff. These were the first set of NFTs we did. Exactly the same kind of structure. This time for ownership of a collection of Star Trek toys signed by William Shatner. These guys have digital authentication chips on them. We’re still being a little secretive about how that works. There’ll be a big announcement about it probably the next two or three months. But we have the ability to put a key pair in a physical chip directly on the assets in a vault. The whole system is basically as tight as a drum. It’s a very, very clean, clear&nbsp;model.</p> The Role of Decentralized Insurance Networks in the Mattereum Protocol <p>There’s a lot of stuff here which is still to do. I mentioned UNN.finance. So some of these warranties could draw not against an individual’s assets, but they could draw against a pool which is manifested as a smart contract. So that in the event that the goods are not as described, you make a claim on the pool and the pool then pays out. And anybody can put their funds into that pool and collect revenue streams by virtue of the fact that their money is at risk covering these physical goods and it’s covering those transactions.</p><p>Once the system is set up that’s really when the system goes from being slightly manual and a little bit legal-flavored to being dramatically sort of crypto native and digital. And I would expect that we would have gold with that set up attached to it probably within two months. We’re getting pretty close to. It might even be a little sooner. And once that’s done, what you get as a situation where one or more experts states their opinion about why something has value and maybe put some of their own money on the line kind of like a deductible and an insurance contract. And then behind that, a lot of other people can then pile in behind that expert and put their money into a benefit pool, which will then cover anything that isn’t covered by the expert’s own funds inside of this deductible framework.</p><p>So that point, it becomes possible for people who believe these gold bars are genuine to profit from the sale of each bar because they put value at risk backing the fact that this gold is actually there. That structure is basically the lever that we’re going to use to get, you know, enormous volumes of assets into the Mattereum and into the Ethereum world, so that you would finally have things like smart contracts which are doing things like owning gold. Or buying houses. You can imagine something that’s like a property hedge fund where you simply buy NFTs for real estate and the whole thing is secured by a huge pool, which is just taking a percentage of each transaction in return for making sure that if one of the properties is fraudulent, we doubled sold by somebody, that risk isn’t passed onto the hedge fund, but it’s absorbed by the insurance pool.</p><p>And as those models really begin to spin out, I think you’re going to see a very dramatic change in people’s understanding of what blockchain is because the fastest and cheapest, easiest way to buy a house will be to buy an NFT of a house and then walk around to the real estate agent, pick up the keys literally two blocks&nbsp;later.</p><p>I expect us to do the first real estate using the system in Q3 of this year. It’s probably only going to be a parking space in London, but once the principal is established that you can do real estate, after that the fun really begins. And that’s basically it. I’m not going to delve down into the guts of the environmental work that we’ve been doing. There’s also a whole bunch of stuff here about circular economy and carbon management, but I think it’s a topic for another talk, and I’ll leave it&nbsp;there.</p><p>END.</p><p>The Mattereum Protocol is a culmination of decades spent thinking on how to manage scarce resources on the planet such that people’s basic necessities of living are secured, even in the worst of situations.</p><p>Vinay distilled his insights on the technological and social transformation of material culture in the book, The Future of Stuff, where he explores how things came to be and how we can build a better path forward where humanity can live in equilibrium with the&nbsp;planet.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1627267518&amp;sr=8-2">The Future of Stuff</a></p><p>If long-reads aren’t your preferred media, our podcast extends this discussion to other builders and thinkers who are shaping material culture across a range of industries.</p><p><a href="https://podcast.mattereum.com/">The Future of Stuff</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/vinay-gupta-at-ethcc-2021-how-to-use-ethereum-to-save-the-planet-69cedf0eba">Vinay Gupta at EthCC 2021: How to Use Ethereum to Save the Planet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#170 — A “bombshell” in the battle for the future of&nbsp;crypto <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-169-its-all-about-creators-b1e91d5fb6b5">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  What SEC commissioners really think about the Ripple&nbsp;lawsuit  What people are&nbsp;saying  Everything Ripple/SEC  This week in&nbsp;crypto  Chart of the week — ”The 81 countries exploring central bank digital currencies”  This week in antitrust  Stuff happens   1. What SEC commissioners really think about the Ripple&nbsp;lawsuit Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Photo: TechCrunch<p>Crypto’s in a quiet phase at the moment, but there are big rumblings on the regulatory front. One of the key battlegrounds is the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple over the sale of alleged securities in the case of&nbsp;XRP.</p><p>Last week, both Ripple and the two individual defendants in the case, Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse all cited <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-roisman-coinschedule">a recent letter penned by SEC commissioners Hester Pierce (AKA Crypto Mom) and Elad Roisman</a> in relation to the recent settlement with Coinschedule.</p><p>You might call it a bombshell revelation.</p><p>In the letter, Pierce and Roisman pointed out the continued lack of clarity around what’s a security and what isn’t based on existing guidance and regulatory frameworks:</p><blockquote>There is a decided lack of clarity for market participants around the application of the securities laws to digital assets and their trading, as is evidenced by the requests each of us receives for clarity and the consistent outreach to the Commission staff for no-action and other relief. The test laid out in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946), is helpful, but, often, including with respect to many digital assets, the application of the test is not crystal clear. Although the Commission staff has provided some guidance,[1] the large number of factors and absence of weighting cut against the clarity the guidance was intended to&nbsp;offer.”</blockquote><p>And rather than bring clarity, the SEC’s current preference for enforcement as a means of regulation has only further muddied the&nbsp;waters:</p><blockquote>“In this void, litigated and settled Commission enforcement actions have become the go-to source of guidance. People can study the specifics of token offerings that become the subject of enforcement actions and take clues from particular cases; however, applying those clues to the facts of a completely different token offering does not necessarily produce clear answers. Providing guidance piecemeal through enforcement actions is not the best way to move forward; if the Commission intends to continue to do so, then we should at least be clear about which tokens we have identified to have been sold pursuant to securities offerings.</blockquote><p>It’s almost as if the SEC is trying to be as vague as possible! The only thing they’re certain&nbsp;about?</p><blockquote>…the only certainty we see is that people have questions about how to comply with the applicable laws and regulations.</blockquote><p>Indeed, even when presented the opportunity for clarity, the SEC backed away, as Pierce and Roisman highlight:</p><blockquote>We nevertheless are disappointed that the Commission’s settlement with Coinschedule did not explain which digital assets touted by Coinschedule were securities, an omission which is symptomatic of our reluctance to provide additional guidance about how to determine whether a token is being sold as part of a securities offering or which tokens are securities.</blockquote><p>So even if you wanted to be a law abiding citizen in the space, it isn’t clear how. Rather than address that lack of clarity, the current SEC status quo merely creates an environment of fear and uncertainty. (The commissioners also propose a safe harbor rule — essentially a sandbox where crypto startups can play in as a way to promote innovation.)</p><p>Pierce and Roisman conclude:</p><blockquote>Whether we decide that all or a subset of token offerings are securities offerings, providing clear regulatory guideposts and then bringing enforcement actions against people who ignore them is a better approach than the clue-by-enforcement approach that we have embraced to date and that today’s settlement embodies. In short, we know folks have questions and confusion persists in the marketplace; it is important that we start providing clear and timely&nbsp;answers.</blockquote><p>Sounds reasonable.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/07/19/the-secs-fair-notice-farce-starring-william-hinman/?sh=5f0ba8782f4f">Roslyn Layton</a>, who has consistently covered the lawsuit over at&nbsp;Forbes:</p><blockquote>Another portent of doom for the SEC’s legal team is a recent missive on a settlement with crypto exchange Coinschedule from SEC commissioners Peirce and Roisman, two Republicans who likely voted against the Ripple case driven by former Republication SEC Chair Jay Clayton. The Commissioners were essentially whistleblowers from inside the agency’s top leadership, attesting that the SEC fails to provide clear guidance and fair notice on digital&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The Commissioners’ statement probably does not surprise the SEC’s legal team. They likely know that Hinman’s answers to Ripple’s questions could sink their case and their credibility as an agency. It invites a ruling that could bring the SEC’s farce of fair notice to an&nbsp;end.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1417530496360271873">/gregkidd</a>:</p><blockquote>Without the ethical practice of fair notice, the Howey test is displaced by the Tony Soprano test: Jay Clayton’s infamous statement of saying ‘if it’s a security then we’ll regulate it’ and then not doing so or giving fair notice for 7&nbsp;years”.</blockquote><blockquote>Hopefully this will stop SEC racketeering and will motivate them to provide clear rules based regulation rather than operating via shakedown enforcement actions</blockquote> 3.

 Gravity, Tykn advancing interoperability of two decentralized identity solutions for the humanitarian sector <p><a href="https://www.gravity.earth/">Gravity</a> and <a href="https://tykn.tech/">Tykn</a> are pleased to announce our continued collaboration to advance the interoperability of our two distinct decentralized identity solutions for improved identity management in the humanitarian sector. Recently, Gravity and Tykn successfully conducted an interoperability Proof of Concept between Gravity’s digital ID protocol built on Tezos blockchain and Tykn’s Cloud Wallet built on Sovrin blockchain within the context of the <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/gravitys-decentralized-identity-protocol-built-on-tezos-to-power-digid-project-in-kenya-a85069f2a027?source=friends_link&amp;sk=6bbf44ccecc283a580782c9dbfa21da5">Dignified Identities in Cash Programming (DIGID)</a>&nbsp;project.</p> The DIGID Project provides one of the first examples — if not the first! — of attempts at interoperability between two different decentralized identity technologies in the humanitarian context. <p>To date, there have only been a few attempts at demonstrating interoperability within decentralized identity that we are aware of.* With our novel approach, Gravity and Tykn’s collaboration is an exciting first step towards achieving interoperability between different decentralized identity wallets based on two distinct protocols that leverage very different standards and networks.</p><p>To better explain the importance of interoperability of digital identity solutions within the humanitarian context, this article includes the following sections:</p>  <a>What is interoperability?</a>  <a>Why is interoperability important?</a>  <a>What are the benefits of interoperability between decentralized ID solutions in the humanitarian sector?</a>  <a>How are Gravity and Tykn addressing interoperability within the context of the DIGID&nbsp;Project?</a>   What is interoperability? <p>Interoperability refers to the basic ability of different systems (for example, the two decentralized identity protocols from Gravity and Tykn) to readily connect and exchange information with one another. In terms of decentralized identity, interoperability involves a scenario where Alice, who has a decentralized identity wallet based on protocol A can share credentials with Bob, who uses a wallet based on protocol B. With full interoperability, Bob can easily decrypt, read, and verify Alice’s credentials. Interoperability between different protocols is an important argument in favour of decentralized identity.</p> Why is interoperability important? <p>One of the key use cases envisioned for the use of decentralized identity in humanitarian aid is that NGO A can issue credentials to a beneficiary who can then easily share these credentials with NGO B. Interoperability allows NGOs A and B to use different decentralized identity protocols for issuance and verification, while still allowing a beneficiary to easily share credentials between the two organizations to gain access to different services.</p> Interoperability is important because it reduces the risk of vendor lock-in and siloed data management solutions. <p>Using a decentralized identity protocol with a high degree of interoperability may help mitigate risks arising from being dependent on a single vendor, both for humanitarian organizations and for beneficiaries receiving assistance. For example, decentralized identity solution Vendor A could experience a system-wide fault or suddenly cease activity. With siloed data management solutions, beneficiary data would all be lost in this scenario. However, with interoperable decentralized identity solutions, beneficiary data may still be available from decentralized identity solution Vendor&nbsp;B.</p><p>To date, there have only been a few attempts at demonstrating interoperability within decentralized identity. As such, the interoperability test conducted between Gravity and Tykn within the context of the DIGID project is one of the first of its kind that we are aware&nbsp;of.</p> What are the benefits of interoperability between decentralized ID solutions in the humanitarian sector? <p>Interoperability between decentralized ID solutions:</p>  facilitates the implementation of multiple digital ID solutions with no vendor&nbsp;lock-in  removes inefficiencies and barriers present in current siloed beneficiary databases  increases collaboration within and among organizations working to support similar target populations  provides greater opportunities for market innovation within the digital ID space, driving digital ID market&nbsp;growth   How are Gravity and Tykn addressing interoperability within the context of the DIGID&nbsp;Project? <p>Launched by a consortium of some of the largest international NGOs in the world, the DIGID Project aims to address the issue of lack of official or recognized identity for recipients of humanitarian assistance by piloting digital identity solutions in&nbsp;Kenya.</p><p>This project strives to give control and ownership of personal data back to individuals, and at the same time increase collaboration between NGOs and their beneficiaries, with user consent as a&nbsp;key.</p><p>Earlier this year, Gravity’s digital ID solution powered the DIGID Project with the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) to help vulnerable Kenyans without a proof of identity create digital identities on Gravity’s platform and access much-needed KRCS cash assistance. While the DIGID project leverages Gravity’s identity stack built on Tezos blockchain with beneficiaries creating Gravity identity wallets, the aim is to ensure that services that are at the intersection between Gravity’s ID platform and third-parties are also able to issue and read credentials from other decentralized identity protocols.</p> For sustainability purposes, it is critical that any digital ID solutions that are built for the long term are as interoperable as possible. <p>Thus, a key next step in the DIGID Project post-pilot phase following the creation of Gravity digital IDs for KRCS aid beneficiaries was to test interoperability between Gravity’s digital ID solution and another third-party solution (in this case, Tykn’s Cloud Wallet) to show how NGOs using different decentralized identity technologies could increase collaboration between humanitarian aid organizations and their beneficiaries.</p><p>The interoperability proof of concept demonstrated how two NGOs can use different decentralized identity platforms to register and deliver assistance to the same set of beneficiaries. This is made possible by associating a beneficiary’s different Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) with each other. This needs to be done because each DID is specific to the two different decentralized identity platforms being used. Allowing for these DIDs to be associated with one another means that NGOs can use both sets of DIDs and issue credentials to both decentralized identity platforms. This is useful because it allows NGOs to share data with each other and beneficiaries without having to agree on a common identifier (such as a phone number, national ID number or system generated ID number) that is needed to identify a beneficiary between two separate&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Beyond this initial interoperability test within the context of the DIGID Project, Gravity and Tykn look forward to continuing to innovate together to make interoperability in the decentralized identity and humanitarian aid spaces possible for real-world use.</p><p>Gravity and Tykn are grateful to the DIGID consortium of international NGOs for making this interoperability test in the context of the DIGID Project possible.</p><p>To learn more about Gravity, visit our website at <a href="http://www.gravity.earth/">www.gravity.earth</a> or follow us on <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/company/gravity.com">LinkedIn</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth">Twitter</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>*For example, <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">a collaboration between two decentralized identity providers based on the Sovrin network</a> allowed for interoperability between their respective digital identity wallets in the context of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry. Another example is <a href="https://gataca-io.github.io/verifier-apis/">an initiative to build a universal interface</a> that allows for the verification of credentials issued using different decentralized identity protocols.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/gravity-tykn-advance-interoperability-of-two-decentralized-id-solutions-for-the-humanitarian-sector-899847099d0e">Gravity, Tykn advance interoperability of two decentralized ID solutions for the humanitarian…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth">Gravity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Some Overviews 

<p>Blockchain Commons is getting big, so we produced some overviews of our work!</p>

<p>Video Overview. Over the last few years, Blockchain Commons has produced a number of specifications, including our fundamental work on Uniform Resources (URs), our other innovations such as Lifehashes and Object Identity Blocks, and our updates of sharding technology with SSKR. If you’re trying to get a handle on the technologies we’re using and the specifications that we’re creating with our Airgapped community, we invite you to take a look at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a>, which runs through our core conceptual and specification work one element at a time.</p>



  
<p><br></p>

<p>The Gordian Principles. We’ve also begun publishing some descriptions of what the Gordian architecture means to us. It’s focused on four principals that we believe are crucial to digital-asset management: independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. They’re all about ensuring that you’re the controller of your digital assets. Besides writing a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">short overview</a>, we’ve also begun adding descriptions to each of our reference apps, discussing how they embody those principles.</p>

<p>And, those reference apps were our biggest news for the quarter …</p>

 Reference App Work 

<p>Our reference apps show off how Blockchain Commons’ Gordian Principles work in real life. We made great progress on them this quarter.</p>

<p>Gordian Releases. Where we had three reference apps available for beta testing in Q1, in Q2 we advanced to having two available for release from Apple.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool is the app previously known as Gordian Guardian.
It allows for the management of your cryptographic seeds in a way that’s secure and resilient. You store your seeds in Seed Tool, ensuring that the data is encrypted and that it’s redundantly backed up to iCloud, and then you derive and export keys as they’re needed. As with all of the Gordian reference apps, this one demonstrates the usage of a number of Blockchain Common’s specifications, including SSKRs, UR, and even our new <code>request/response</code> airgap methodology that we just <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">debuted</a> this February.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
Gordian QR Tool is a simpler tool that similarly allows for the storage of QR codes in a secure and resilient way. Thus, if you had a largely unused seed or key, you could export it as a QR and store it here. QR Tool can also be used to store other private information such as 2FA seeds or the brand-new Smart Health Cards. QR Tool recognizes many categories of QR codes, including the UR types that Blockchain Commons has defined, allowing easy categorization and sorting of your cryptographic data. Our QR Tool was slightly held back by inadequacies we found in Apple’s QR creation functions, which can produce overly large QRs. We’ve already begun work <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/QRCodeGenerator">translating a better QR library into Swift</a> and expect to integrate that into v1.1 of QR Tool in the future.</p>

<p>QR Tool and Seed Tool also offer the first demonstration of the interactions possible in a Gordian architecture. One of the most powerful examples involves Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">SSKR specification</a>. Seed Tools allows a user to not only shard a seed using SSKR, but also to encode those shares as QR codes. The encoded shares can then be given to friends and family who have QR Tool, ensuring the safe storage of all the shares required to restore your seed!</p>

<p>We have more reference app releases planned for the future. Gordian Cosigner remains available as a Testflight beta release, and is our reference app for demonstrating how to conduct airgapped signing. We are also beginning work on the Gordian Recovery app, which we announced last quarter; it’ll demonstrate methodologies for recovering assets held by third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Sweeptool Debut. Recovering funds held in a third-party HD wallet can be tricky since you don’t always know which addresses were actually used. We’ve also been attacking that problem with a command-line tool called <code>sweeptool</code>, which sweeps funds  anywhere in the hierarchy defined by a descriptor. Sweeptool is the work of one of our intern graduates, and is already available as an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/sweeptool-cli">alpha release</a>.</p>

<p>Timelock Experiments. Our current architecture for #SmartCustody depends on multisigs to allow for the partitioning of keys and the creation of resilience. However, we’re already thinking about the next generation of #SmartCustody, which will allow the use of timelocks to recover funds in the case of the incapacitation of a principal. We did some deeper investigation into miniscript this quarter, which allows for easier integration of timelocks into Bitcoin addresses, and also mapped out some new architectures for progressively sweeping funds forward to keep ahead of timelocks. However, we discovered that at this point miniscript isn’t yet integrated with the descriptor-wallets that are another of the core elements of the Gordian architecture. This prevents integration with our Gordian apps.</p>

<p>We’ve published a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">preliminary paper</a> on the usage of Timelocks, but it isn’t finalized yet because of these issues. Meanwhile, one of our interns has begun work on a Rust-based Timelock project called <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli</a>. This work is all meant to ensure we’re ready when miniscript is added to Bitcoin Core, or when timelocks are integrated into descriptors in some other manner.</p>

 Coding Processes 

<p>Releasing apps is just one step of a larger coding process, which requires careful consideration of what languages (and libraries) to use and careful reviewing of their security.</p>

<p>Rust Focus. Sweeptool is written in Rust, which is an increasing focus at Blockchain Commons. We’ve also been using it for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign-cli work</a> and some of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap">torgap work</a> and have touched upon it in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/18_5_Accessing_Bitcoind_with_Rust.md">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a>. We think that Rust is an important language for the future of Bitcoin development in large part because of its safety guarantee, including <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/">memory safety properties, which can resolve 70% of security problems</a>. Our main barrier for wider use of Rust has been the fact that C and C++ are the main languages used by Bitcoin Core, iOS, and Android, but we’ve already seen the start of changes there, and hope to be able to integrate Rust even more fully in the future. The fact that the Rust-based <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/">Bitcoin Dev Kit</a> is actually in advance of Bitcoin Core in some features is very encouraging.</p>

<p>Security Review. Bitmark, one of our Sustaining Sponsors, has hired <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> to conduct a security review of our SSKR libraries, <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a>. This is crucial element in making Blockchain Commons’ specification work widely available, since it would be improper for us to review our own security code. As our first partners planning to use one of our libraries in a shipping project, as opposed to just our specifications, Bitmark is stepping up to the plate to fund the review of our core SSKR libraries. We expect this pattern to repeat with future partners and libraries in the future. It shows the power of our open libraries: future companies will be able to depend on our SSKR libraries thanks to Bitmark’s contribution, and then they’ll be able to make contributions of their own that will be much less than if they’d had to security review an entire suite of  themselves.</p>

 New Docs 

<p>The blockchain infrastructure is empowered by users and developers who know how to use it properly. Teaching them is the goal of our documentation projects.</p>

<p>UR &amp; SSKR Docs. The ultimate purpose of our reference applications is to demonstrate how our new specifications can be used in actual applications. Hand-in-hand with that, we’re also producing documentation that lays out in more detail how those specifications work. We’ve begun collecting many of those docs in the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/tree/master/Docs">documents area of our crypto-commons repo</a>. This quarter we added to our docs repo with several documents about our Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction system, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-users.md">SSKR for Users</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-developers.md">SSKR for Developers</a>. We also released a series of articles on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources (URs)</a> intended to show developers how they’re constructed and used.</p>

<p>We are also planning further support for our interoperable specifications such as UR and SSKR at a virtual interoperable wallet specification workshop. We’re currently working on locking down a date.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our best-known tutorial at Blockchain Commons, is our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a>, which we pushed to v2.0 last year and which has 1,700 stars and 100 watchers on Github. We’re thrilled that translations are now ongoing into both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a> thanks to a half-dozen core volunteers. Some of Blockchain Commons’ own programmers and interns entered the blockchain industry thanks to this course, so we’re looking forward to these translations opening the doors even wider.</p>

 Other Priorities 

<p>Finally, we have a lot of more varied projects that all saw some progress.</p>

<p>Our Summer Interns Have Begun Work. Thanks to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/human-rights-foundation-grants-bitcoin-defi-education-activism">a grant from the Human Rights Foundation</a>, we have a class of a dozen interns this summer. We’re engaging them with weekly calls to introduce them to crucial use cases and to let them talk with Bitcoin and Lightning experts from the industry and human-rights experts, most recently including John Callas from the EFF and Alex Gladstein from HRF.</p>

<p>Some of our human-rights-focused intern projects include a self-sovereign donation app, scripts to automate the setup of privacy and/or bitcoin services, documents on managing pseudonymity, and tracking of blockchain-based legislation.</p>

<p>Some of our more general intern projects include deployment of a full Esplora node for Blockchain Commons, the creation of scripts to make it easier for others to do so, documentation on bitcoin fee-estimation use cases, improvements to our Spotbit server including expansion of the Spotbit API and client app, and the aformentioned work on Mori and on Learning Bitcoin translations.</p>

<p>Our first completed intern ‘21 work is a short <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/15_0_Using_i2p.md">i2p chapter</a> for Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line, talking about an alternative (or supplement) to traditional Tor privacy.</p>

<p>Wyoming Testimony. Christopher’s testimony has continued in Wyoming, talking about DAO and identity, to improve and extend both laws. The most recent testimony <a href="https://youtu.be/ayQ086BVDXE?t=4060">on May 28</a> continued to work through the ramifications of the definitions of principal authority for self-sovereign identity.</p>




<p><br></p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity. Speaking of which, it was the fifth anniversary of the concept of self-sovereign identity, which first suggested that we should control our identities on the internet, not be beholden to centralized agencies. Christopher <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">wrote an article</a> for Coindesk celebrating that anniversary, talking about how far we’ve come and reflecting on how things could be improved.</p>

<p>BTCR. Finally, we’ve also been talking about another of our blockchain projects that originated in <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>: BTCR, a self-sovereign decentralized identifier that uses the Bitcoin blockchain. Recently Christopher and the other creators of BTCR talked with <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids">The Rubric</a> about the past and future of the DID.</p>

<p>As you can see, we’ve got lots of ongoing work that continue to expand the ideas of responsible key management and self-determination on the internet. If you’d like to support our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can continue to design new specifications, architectures, reference applications, and reference libraries to be used by the whole community, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a>. You can alternatively make a <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">one-time bitcoin donation</a> at our BTCPay.</p>

<p>WeChat: The article covers the new collaboration between NFTMagic, the first NFT trading platform on Ardor blockchain, and the talented Spanish artist Bea Sarrias. It highlights Sarrias’ style of painting interior parts and architectural spaces to capture the sense of time and emotion that she creates through the dramatic use of lights and shadows. Her appreciated artwork is currently on sale on the&nbsp;NFTMagic&nbsp;platform.</p>

<p>Privacy, as we know, is a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">complex topic</a>. When it converges with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">technology</a>, it becomes more complicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One aspect of this complexity is where privacy fits in with&nbsp;disinformation—false or misleading information spread&nbsp;intentionally&nbsp;to confuse or manipulate people. Disinformation is also called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/search/disinformation">bad information</a>, “weaponized information” and “fake news”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Disinformation is different from&nbsp;misinformation—false or misleading information spread&nbsp;unwittingly—but the two together have eroded trust in information to the point we’re in an “information crisis”. (The WHO characterizes the spread of mis and disinformation and the mistrust in information about COVID-19 as an “<a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1">infodemic</a>”.)</p>



<p>Since our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">remit</a>&nbsp;is protecting&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/about/what-is-privacy/">information&nbsp;privacy</a>,&nbsp;we were interested to&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1D9yw8R7kp4tnxFLAZz5MT">hear</a>&nbsp;how&nbsp;<a href="https://juliaangwin.com/books/">Julia Angwin</a>, award-winning investigative journalist, editor-in-chief of&nbsp;<a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a>&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<a href="https://juliaangwin.com/books/">Dragnet Nation</a>,&nbsp;linked privacy to disinformation in a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1D9yw8R7kp4tnxFLAZz5MT">podcast</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/aspendigital/">Aspen Digital</a>‘s Executive Director&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/our-people/vivian-schiller/">Vivian Schiller</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1D9yw8R7kp4tnxFLAZz5MT">episode</a>&nbsp;is part of the Aspen Institute’s&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3v1Nr6lWp4uDsSrJavC1vA">Aspen Digital’s Disinfo Discussions</a>, an initiative of the Institute’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/commission-on-information-disorder/">Commissioner of Information Disorder&nbsp;</a>exploring disinformation and misinformation in the information crisis.</p>



 Angwin links privacy to disinformation in two ways 



<p></p>



 1. Lack of privacy generates disinformation 



<p></p>



<p>Angwin says&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">relentless data surveillance</a>&nbsp;has forced individuals to protect their privacy by engaging in some degree of information obfuscation: “You can’t avoid being seen, so you change how you’re being seen. This is disinformation.”</p>



<p>When Angwin wrote her landmark book,&nbsp;<a href="https://bookshop.org/books/dragnet-nation-a-quest-for-privacy-security-and-freedom-in-a-world-of-relentless-surveillance/9781250060860">Dragnet Nation</a>, she tried all the ways she could to escape what she calls “dragnet surveillance”. She says: “I wasn’t trying to evade the FBI; I was just trying to get out of indiscriminate tracking that is everywhere. I did all sorts of things like getting a burner phone and fake identities and different types of accounts, and what I found was that I was really engaging in quite a bit of disinformation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The world of relentless surveillance has actually forced individuals to try to protect their privacy through misdirection and obfuscation. This is literally a coping technique for a world of relentless surveillance … the world of surveillance creates a need and a requirement for everyone to engage in a bit of disinformation,” she said.</p>



<p>Angwin says this has set the standard for a level of disinformation we haven’t seen before.</p>



 2. Lack of privacy subjects people to disinformation<br> 



<p></p>



<p>Angwin says digital technology has allowed the creation of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/propaganda">propaganda</a>&nbsp;(a form of disinformation) on a mass scale. Where once the purview of governments, she says propaganda has become an industry and vulnerable communities are most at risk from the disinformation it spreads.</p>



<p>“The industry needs to know who to distribute propaganda to—and that’s where the data exploitation market comes in. You can find vulnerable people because you can buy lists of them. When people used to send junk mail, these lists were called ‘sucker lists.’ These were people who are going to fall for your scam. Now, of course, you can buy any kind of sucker list on Facebook or Instagram.” And “any kind” is right. These lists can now be granularly targeted by various factors including a person’s political and religious leanings, household income, age, location and more.</p>



<p>Angwin believes propaganda weaponizes disinformation and lies “because they can be sent directly to the people who are most vulnerable to receive them. News is being filtered and tailored to people.”</p>



<p>She points out that Facebook sells “sucker lists” via its ads, for example.&nbsp;Users can buy ads targeted to certain people, based behavioural data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are served information that they believe might be attractive to us. There are millions of people who might be susceptible to dis and misinformation,” Angwin says.</p>



 What’s the fix? 



<p></p>



<p>Asked whether it’s possible to individually control this tracking and data exploitation, Angwin says no. “Honestly as an individual you have very little control because we need to use these technologies to participate in daily life. Ultimately your ability to decline participation in the data exploitation market is pretty minimal. Most you can do is minimize around the margin but not opt out entirely.” (We’d recommend you use&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySu</a><a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">d</a><a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">o</a>.)</p>



<p>Angwin says most platforms are only offering “an illusion of control” over our personal data. “You go into some sort of privacy menu, and you can turn all these knobs and dials. The studies have shown that the more knobs and dials there are, the more you feel you’re in control and the more willing you are to accept privacy violations.&nbsp;So they offer you these very confusing settings, and you move them around and you think,&nbsp;‘Oh, I’ve really solved this.’ The truth is, not really, you haven’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She concedes some platforms are getting more aggressive at turning off tracking, and cites&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">Apple</a>&nbsp;in this, but says often platforms are simply swapping one form of tracking for&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">another</a>.</p>



<p>As such, Angwin believes there aren’t remedies, so much as considerations. She implores people to think about “whether the benefits of microtargeting really outweigh the risks”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The idea of categorizing all human behavior and then allowing commercial interests to use those to target individuals: Are the risks to society higher than the benefits to advertisers?” she asks.</p>

Endorsed by the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/assets/pdf/Roadmap_for_Digital_Cooperation_EN.pdf">UN Secretary General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a>, the Digital Public Goods Alliance defines digital public goods as “<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/about/">open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs</a>).” DPGs are a growing part of discussions about how to ensure that digital transformation delivers on development outcomes and&nbsp;goals.</p><p>Caribou Digital convened a group of senior policymakers, donors, and practitioners to build on the important work being done to shape the concept of digital public goods, and how they can be advanced to meet the challenges presented by increasingly pervasive and rapid digital transformation. What follows is a collated and editorialised account of the major points discussed during the conversation in the form of four key takeaways and two concrete&nbsp;actions.</p> Digital transformation is neither good, nor bad, but never&nbsp;neutral. <p>Digitalisation is transforming the world faster than ever imagined, thus there is value in discussing the concept of DPGs. In the words of one participant, ‘we need to shape it in a way that is more acceptable to us, that serves the world, rather than a few corporations’. Focusing on DPGs is a response to that — and to the recognition that the private sector is not always equipped to deliver public sector outcomes and that the interests of the public and private sector are not always aligned. For example, at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the <a href="https://id4africa.com/">ID4Africa Movement</a>, a poll of the delegates identified vendor lock-in as their main concern. This emphasis on challenges of public procurement of digital infrastructure has led to a focus on open source platforms for the public sector and public sector service delivery. This is reflected in the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">United Nations’ Secretary General’s Roadmap towards Digital Cooperation, </a>the <a href="https://solutions.dial.community/products">Digital Impact Alliance’s work on DPGs,</a>and the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance&nbsp;(DPGA)</a>.</p> Beyond DPGs as open-source platforms. <p>Discussion around DPGs is dominated by the use of open source platforms to address challenges such as vendor lock-in identified by those African governments from the survey. These solutions take the form of tools such as the open-source ID platform <a href="https://www.mosip.io/">MOSIP</a> or the interoperable financial infrastructure <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">Mojaloop</a>;the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">DPGA’s database currently lists nearly 600 platforms</a> that qualify as DPGs. However, critically, it’s not the platforms that define DPGs but rather the standards that determine whether a platform is a public goods,such as data security, privacy, and legal compliance. But DPGs need to be viewed beyond open-source models. As participants in the discussion flagged, open-source technologies do not inherently serve the public good, as they are frequently used by the private sector to serve private interests rather than the public good, such as mobile operator MTN using the open-source financial service platform Mojaloop in Malawi. Ensuring that digital infrastructure serves the public good goes beyond questions around hardware and software to include questions of governance, security, and the relationship between the public and private sector. These issues of digital governance are critical: defining digital goals, standards, codes, and accountability mechanisms. The development sector has few shared policies, standards, and codes;the DPGs conversation should drive consistency in governance as much as in systems and platforms.</p> Context eats technology for breakfast. <p>While technologies — open source and otherwise — can help address critical issues and progress towards the SDGs, the particularities of context demand flexibility and responsiveness. Thus, an approach to DPGs that emphasises standards and governance is critical to ensuring that we can build frameworks that can help influence processes of digital transformation towards the public good. This approach must stress protection to mitigate the harms that we increasingly recognise can be amplified through digital transformation of public&nbsp;goods.</p> Expand beyond government to&nbsp;society. <p>The development community needs to expand its’ conception of public goods beyond the current focus on their role in government and state infrastructure, such as digital identity and financial rails. The understanding of public goods needs to be expanded to meet critical challenges faced by people in both the Global South and North: the challenges of work, such as disintermediating employment platforms (see our <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods/home">Platform Livelihoods work</a> and others such as the <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork Foundation</a>), and the erosion of a public sphere through collapsing media models (see <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/unbundling-the-imaginary-community-adf1eb7e5ea8">our work on alternatives to ad-based business model</a>s and work such as the <a href="https://publicmediastack.com/">Public Media Stack</a>). The DPGA’s work on content, such as the <a href="https://digitallibrary.io/">Global Digital Library</a>, is also helpful&nbsp;here.</p> Concrete steps to advance the role of Digital Public Goods in development  Define our problems. <p>DPGs are a theme of our time, but they are clearly an evolving conversation. It’s critical that the development community starts from a definition of the core problems it seeks to address and articulates what they are trying to solve for, in order to provide guidance for how to best solve them. For example, we need to be precise about where the market failure is across the delivery value chain. Because if we don’t define our problem, we’ll waste effort and resources building things that are not as effective as they need to&nbsp;be.</p> Define standards for public&nbsp;goods. <p>To move beyond systems to focus on standards, governance, and regulations that can support the public good, we need to bring stakeholders together to agree on shared vision, values, and goals that can be supported by appropriate standards. For example, there is growing concern around the protection aspects of technologies used in cash transfers and digital identity, yet there are no shared standards across the development and humanitarian sector to guide approaches to these critical technologies. If we want to start talking about things like Open Banking, protection must be right at the core of the conversation.</p><p>This conversation on public goods brought together policy makers and practitioners from across a wide variety of contexts who spoke frankly and freely about their approach to and work on DPGs. These conversations, like the ones we remember from post- conference and seminar coffee, drinks, and dinner, are the conversations that our series of diagnostic discussions facilitates.</p> Participants: <p>Chris Locke&nbsp;: Caribou&nbsp;Digital</p><p>Jonathan Wong&nbsp;:&nbsp;UNESCAP</p><p>Anand Varghese&nbsp;:&nbsp;DAI</p><p>Chris Burns&nbsp;:&nbsp;USAID</p><p>Emily Middleton&nbsp;: Public&nbsp;Digital</p><p>CV Madhukar&nbsp;:&nbsp;Omidyar</p><p>Ben Ramalingam&nbsp;: Humanitarian Innovation Hub</p><p>Greta Bull&nbsp;:&nbsp;CGAP</p><p>Kari Jacobsen&nbsp;:&nbsp;NORAD</p><p>Tomicah Tilleman&nbsp;: New America Foundation</p><p>Jason Munyan&nbsp;: UN Office of Special Envoy for&nbsp;Tech</p><p>Emrys Schoemaker&nbsp;: Caribou&nbsp;Digital</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-public-goods-for-development-a1266a72c67a">Digital Public Goods for Development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep. 4: Ending Modern Slavery with Technology &amp; Social Movements, with Helen&nbsp;Burrows <p>How can we effectively combat slavery in global trade when policy and governments fall short? Human rights lawyer and activist Helen Burrows joins the show to discuss how corporations and consumers can bring an end to slavery and labor abuses through better technology and social awareness.</p> Episode Notes: <p>On this episode, I’m joined by Helen Burrows. A human rights lawyer turned activist, in recent years she’s focused on combatting slavery in the supply chains which give us the clothes on our backs, the phones in our pockets, and so much&nbsp;more.</p><p>We discuss the scale of this dark facet of material culture, how it flourished with trade globalization, how governments have failed to do anything about it, and how a combination of technological innovation and social action between corporations and consumers can create a better path forward. There were some technical difficulties during recording, so please forgive the audio quality. Nevertheless, I hope this conversation illuminates your understanding of the real costs of our stuff and how we can make it better, for everyone.</p><p>All music courtesy of Zoe Keating. Track: “Optimist”</p> Episode Outline   Introduction [00:01:09]  Our Slavery Footprint [00:02:41]  Corporate versus Social Action | Satyagraha and Holding Firmly to Truth [00:04:13]  Breaking Open Corporate Silos with Blockchain [00:08:45]  Removing the Veil of Ignorance [00:12:05]  Hacking the Profit Mindset for Social Good [00:19:44]  Mattereum: Satyagraha-as-a-Service [00:21:42]  Understanding as a Prelude to Change [00:23:29]  Automated Morality [00:28:25]  The Flaws of Trade Globalization [00:33:05]  On Helen’s Work with Mattereum [00:35:45]   Introduction [00:01:09] <p>Garrison: All right. Let’s just get into it. Cool. Would you like to introduce yourself to the listeners?</p><p>Helen: My name is Helen Burroughs. I am a lawyer by training, but for the past 20 years, I’ve worked in legal and judicial reform with around 50 countries around the world. On anything from access to justice, to anti-corruption, human rights, to human trafficking.</p><p>In the last five or so years, I deepened my interest and work in the anti-slavery field. Considering the work I’ve done on that and related areas for a lot of years in lots of countries, I’ve seen how completely ineffective governments have been doing anything to eliminate this, currently impacting around 40 million people around the world and realize that it’s companies and consumers that are the answer to this issue, I think, and that we can see more traction in less time by focusing in that direction, rather than on relying on governments to get the law and its enforcement right.</p><p>So, my interest has been in, how do we increase the capacity or decrease rather the capacity of supply chains and make them more transparent, so we know where our stuff comes from, how it’s made and what harm or not it may have done along the way to our doorstep.</p> Our Slavery Footprint [00:02:41] <p>Garrison: Anti-slavery work, on the supply chain front is something I’ve been aware of for a few years now. And you hear a bunch of stories. You hear a bunch of pilot programs from basically every supply chain company under the sun, but you never really see any sort of a huge fundamental shift in how people do&nbsp;things.</p><p>Before we get into the weeds, I want to relay something and something I would suggest listeners do is there’s a website called slavery footprint dot org. And it has, you know, information on the subject in terms of the scope of it. And it also has a survey that you can take. It’ll ask you about your diet and the overall kind of composition of your household. How many cars do you have? How many bedrooms or home office, your wardrobe composition like whether or not you have leather shoes&nbsp;, electronics, and it gives you a projection of roughly the number of slaves that are working for you to secure your lifestyle.</p><p>When I took the survey, it projected 26. Instantly in my head, I imagined what about like my neighbors and then everyone else in the town and then in the state, in the country. And then I just imagine that number just like just rocketing up. It is quite striking.</p> Corporate versus Social Action | Satyagraha and Holding Firmly to Truth [00:04:13] <p>Garrison: Something I planned on talking about like later in the conversation. But I liked that you mentioned it right off the bat, which was that you lost hope, unfortunately, that government would enact the necessary policy to get more transparency out of the corporate supply chain, have it be a mandated thing, an industrial standard, and that you think it’s gonna come down to consumers and awareness and like social movement from the consumer side. I think that kind of difference between corporate action and the action of people as a whole is a really interesting thing cause it’s very different. And it’s very difficult.</p><p>There are instances of this happening in the past very effectively.</p><p>There’s a concept I like called Satyagraha, which was Gandhi’s driving philosophy in terms of how he conducted his social movements. And it was a direct influence on the civil rights movement with Martin Luther King and also with Nelson Mandela, fighting apartheid in South&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>And what Satyagraha means is “holding firmly to truth,” or it’s an insistence on truth. You show that institutions of power, like what they’re actually doing to people, and then it’s on them. You know this without a doubt. It’s irrefutable. What are you going to do? And it could be remarkably effective. So I wonder, do you think that would be possible now, like that kind of very thorough systemic&nbsp;change?</p><p>Helen: I think we’re sitting on the cusp of it. And I dunno whether that’s a kind of wince answer but I don’t think we’re there yet. I think that the movements that you’ve mentioned, this is a little bit different because it’s often been the oppressed rising up and not taking any shit anymore. Whereas slavery by its nature is hidden. Slaves cannot get out in the streets and voice their concern about the status quo and demand emancipation. That’s not how the mechanics of this industry functions. So we’re not looking at the same type of movement, but the same type of energy is absolutely required.</p><p>The same type of commitment is required because obviously it wasn’t just Martin Luther King and his people. The movement was massive and included people from everywhere of every color. And so it’s not just that, but the nucleus of those movements is different to the nucleus of this movement. And I don’t think consumers, society, are there enough in enough numbers yet to produce any kind of tipping point to transformation. So I think it’s also gonna take the convergence of industry saying, “We don’t want to do any harm. We’re trying our best not to, but we actually don’t know the harm that we’re doing and we don’t know a better way of doing business.”</p><p>Holding onto the truth, holding firm to the truth, is what we want to do is provide that truth because at the moment that the truth is, you know, a little bit colored in here and there, but there’s plenty of gaps that we don’t know. So it’s the democratization of truth, actually, to be able to see it on a broader&nbsp;scale.</p><p>So companies can say, “We’re not done with that. We want to be sustainable environmentally and as regards to social labor standards. And we’re not okay with this. So we’re going to change how we operate.” But being upfront about that and consumers saying, “Now I know where my product comes from and how it’s made at every point along the way, I can now make an informed choice about whether or not I want to buy that&nbsp;thing.”</p><p>So I think the movement is coming, but we have to preempt the movement by providing the foundations for this democratization of knowledge and therefore truth to put more fuel underneath the energy that exists. But I mean, we have seen different movements. The vegan movement for example is fundamentally different to civil rights movement, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>That’s one that’s done great things. So it’s not like it’s the only type of movement that can succeed absolutely, but it depends a lot on the commitment and the energy of the people at the nucleus. So yeah, I think that we’re not there yet. We’re on the cusp of&nbsp;it</p> Breaking Open Corporate Silos with Blockchain [00:08:45] <p>Garrison: On this aspect of kind of putting it on the otus of industry to adopt these standards into like really put an effort into doing this. You’re interested in blockchain technology in the application of this. Would you care to go into that in more&nbsp;detail?</p><p>Helen: Ah, so I think the benefits of blockchain technology offer themselves in a couple of different realms in this space. One is I think, philosophically again, the sort of democratization of information, access to it, and the concept of the disintermediation of information and the breaking down of silos because that’s been a huge problem across the board. But, you know, as it relates to slavery, the company will keep its information about its supply chain and what it makes might have found in terms of labor abuses. They’ll keep that really secret, of course. And then this government department keeps its information secret and the NGOs don’t have outlets to communicate what they know and workers themselves don’t have outlets to communicate. So by breaking down all of those kinds of barriers, and I’m not talking about blockchain technology itself, but the philosophy behind removing silos is something that is uniquely innovative about the approach. And in terms of the technology itself: the immutability of information. So obviously, if you put junk in, you get junk out, like we always and so it’s a case of ensuring that we have adequately robust sources of triangulated, checked, verifiable data that goes in. And as long as that process can be assured, then what then ends up on the blockchain can not be changed obviously. And that’s a radical departure from what we’ve ever been able to do before in terms of the collection and presentation of information about this side of how things&nbsp;work.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. In some sense it’s yeah. A clever hack for truth or I guess consensus is a better word. It’s not capital T truth in this sense. But one thing that I’ve noticed, being active in this space for about four years now is there’s been so many supply chain blockchain projects. So many of them. Entire consortiums have been formed and they do these track and trace pilot programs, but they don’t go anywhere.</p><p>Helen: No, they don’t because track and trace is so two-dimensional. It just tells you that this flask that I’m holding, that nobody can see: where it originated and then it was tagged and then we can trace it as it travels all over the world. And so it ends up being recycled I thought. It doesn’t tell me anything about the labor conditions of the people who manufactured the aluminium. It doesn’t tell me where the paint was made and who painted it and how noxious it may be. It doesn’t tell me where the plastic came from. It doesn’t tell us anything that we need to know about this product in order to make ethical choices about whether I want to buy&nbsp;it.</p> Removing the Veil of Ignorance [00:12:05] <p>Garrison: In some of the writing I’ve been doing for Mattereum, I describe it as a zero history problem. This concept of zero history in our stuff is really problematic. Cause like you said, we don’t really know where it comes from. We don’t know about the labor conditions that brought it into the world. And it’s just kind of part of this larger systemic problem of managing production and consumption in society. Like that cycle is so bloated. It’s just a ever-hungry machine that keeps churning.</p><p>Helen: Exactly, it wasn’t that long ago that there were four seasons in the fashion year. Now there’s 52. So, you know, just the exponential increase of what we’re told we have to buy. And I’m just using fashion as one example of how it is across the board. We have to have this schedule and we have to have that, this will make our lives easier, quicker, faster, whatever. And we get caught up in it certainly.</p><p>It’s really in our faces. It’s a gluttonous consumer and level of consumerism that we don’t even realize that’s what we’re a party to fueling. We ripped off too. There’s lots of products out there that will have lovely green labels on them and tell us that um their cotton is organic, but it doesn’t tell us whether that cotton was picked by child slaves in Kazahkstan. The cotton’s organic so that’s all right. Or, it, it might say that this tuna was caught without a net or these prawns were sustainably farmed, but it doesn’t tell you that the guys on the boat doing the fishing have been on vessels for the last 25 years, passed on the high sea from boat to boat, completely enslaved, and their only chance of escape is to get sick and die and be thrown over the board. It doesn’t tell you anything like that. So as consumers, we don’t even know what we need to know. Because we’re not being told, we’re being told the cotton’s organic, there were no nets involved in his fishing and we think done deal, that’s&nbsp;it.</p><p>And we’ve been greenwashed and whitewashed. And we don’t look underneath the curtain. We’re not interested in looking underneath the hood enough to know more, to find out more, but I don’t really put the faults of that at the feet of consumers necessarily because we do rely on authority, including governments to do the right&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Even in the UK where arguably they’ve got one of the strongest pieces of anti-slavery legislation in the world, the level of dilution that was required in order to get that piece of law over the line meant that all companies have to do is pop the hood and have a quick look to see if anything looks out of place. And if it is then that’s fine. There’s no obligation to delve right down to the top or up to the top of your supply chain and tell us exactly what’s going on in micro detail. There’s nothing like that. So, you know, we rely on government to tell us what the standard is and what the requirements ought to be and what we need to know, but they’re not doing that job because of the various divergent pressures on them that pull them in a different direction. Then we get this sort of green, white-washing layered on top of that inside this sort of grotesquely, huge consumerist society that we are. And it’s just a recipe for continued disaster.</p><p>Garrison: And the culpability here is multi-dimensional. Like at a fundamental level, there’s also a part of it where our desire, like our capacity for desire, what we desire. Our desire as a function is being kind of manipulated. But there’s a self awareness on corporations that have multimillion dollar marketing budgets to sell us things or using algorithms to get us to market things to ourselves in the weird feedback loop. But the idea that, oh, people want things that are green. They want things that are sustainably sourced. Uh, Let’s give it to them. Even though there’s been plenty of cases where that was actually completely false. It’s a fancy packaging that looks organic and earthy, but there’s still in fact horrible stuff happening.</p><p>Helen: Often they don’t know. I remember having a conversation with the person who was at the time the head of sustainability at McDonald’s and of 80,000 supply chains that they had to keep an eye on. They said that their their due diligence was really comprehensive and robust. And in the last 12 months they had found one case of labor exploitation among 80,000 supply chains across multiple countries. You know, If you only find one case of exploitation in that many supply chains and loads of countries, your system doesn’t work. That’s the only explanation.</p><p>So companies often don’t know. And companies don’t have access at the moment to the capabilities that they need to get right down there in supply chains. If you think a mobile phone, how many components are in a mobile phone, trying to trace all of those diffuse supply chains around to their source, and then you get to the cobalt. And you’re like, we got as far as the smelter and then we were screwed. We didn’t know where it came from. There’s lots of really logistical, legitimate, as well as illegitimate reasons why companies don’t actually know, but instead of facing up to that and saying we’ve got gaps here in our knowledge, they just stick a label on and say, “Our cotton’s organic.”</p><p>And we go, oh, great. Organic cotton. I can sleep at night now I bought that organic cotton and I didn’t buy that rubbish pesticide laden one. Or 10% of the profits from this company goes to help women rescued from trafficking and prostitution in India. Great. I can sleep well. We rely on that one box tick, whatever their marketing people choose that box to&nbsp;be.</p><p>I think it’s the whole story. But again, we don’t know what we don’t know. And it’s getting out there, what we do need to know about these products. And in the environmental space, that’s incredibly complicated because it vastly depends on the product and its processes. Consumables in the anti-slavery space are a little easier in some respects, given the standards sort of universal of how you should treat people who work for&nbsp;you.</p><p>And you know what international law says about all of that. But not easy in terms of accessing the information, because this is a. $200 billion class a year industry. There’s a lot invested in the status quo and they will take a lot to deconstruct all of that. So there’s a lot invested in making sure that people don’t know what actually happens in various parts of various supply chains, because it is terrible.</p><p>So it’s not an easy thing to try and deal with. We need to start and lots of project, as you said, with the track and trace work is there’s just lots of anti-slavery and environmental protection work going on globally. As of course, we all know, but what’s missing is that straight line truth. That complete knowledge, or where there isn’t complete knowledge, the courage to say these are gaps and who can fill them for us. We’d like to know, and then whatever the result is, we’ll work with it and we’ll do what we can to make it better. And, you know, with that level of commitment and consumers behind them, then that’s what could produce this&nbsp;change.</p> Hacking the Profit Mindset for Social Good [00:19:44] <p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. I also wonder. Corporations operate under certain incentives. Profits are what they optimize for. So I wonder if there’s a way to almost like Trojan horse this insistence on truth at the systemic level by saying like, “ You’ll have all these incredible efficiency gains that it’ll actually be more valuable for you to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Helen: Yeah. Yeah. There’s a number of ways that this is financially at a level of value attractive to companies. Obviously we’re not going to go and start by trying to twist the arms of companies. You’d start with the companies that are really making, have made great inroads and demonstrated great levels of investment and commitment. You’d start there cause they’re the ones that want to do the right thing, but yet there’s massive efficiencies to be&nbsp;gained.</p><p>Look at all of the money that’s wasted in supply chains because time wastage, lags. So much goes wrong in the supply chain that could be massively tightened up to create huge time and cost efficiencies as well as anything else. And also, the other side of it, the flip side of it is that, what is it about 98% of a company’s value is its reputation. And when companies like like Zara get called out because the machinists have sewn notes into the hems of coats saying, pockets of coats saying, “Please help us. We haven’t been paid.” That wipes a lot off the slate in terms of that company’s value. And a lot of companies get called out. Obviously there’s a risk analysis to be done about whether you allow that risk to be on the table. That has the capacity to wipe a lot of value off of companies.</p><p>So for companies wanting to manage that risk, manage their risk, and also increase cost and time efficiencies in how they do business, then absolutely having a comprehensive line of sight down their supply chain is a very smart thing to&nbsp;do.</p> Mattereum: Satyagraha-as-a-Service [00:21:42] <p>Garrison: Absolutely. This podcast is presented by Mattereum. So listeners who may not be aware of Mattereum, but will probably be curious as to how we approach this kind of challenge.</p><p>So one of the kind of core inventions within the project is the Asset Passport. So just as you know, people have passports in order to travel freely internationally and cross borders, it’s a digital identity for an object instead. So this identity, this passport has very detailed information about the object, where it came from, what it is, weight. Is it vaulted somewhere? Any other kind of manufacturing or production data that’s necessary to have a very firm grasp Identifying this item. And also legal guarantees baked in so that there’s access to recourse if there’s like a commercial fallout. There’s arbitration and dispute resolution and stuff like that, all baked into an object that’s attached to this global marketplace by&nbsp;default.</p><p>We could have these digital identities created with supply chains at the point of production. So as soon as something is built before it’s, before it goes into the vast machinery of commerce, a provenance making sure that there’s no zero history there, like from the raw material to the finished product there’s this history that you can&nbsp;follow.</p><p>So in, in a way Vinay described it recently in a way that I like. He described as Satyagraha as a service: you’re seeing the truth of the objects that you produce as a company or that you consume or buy as a consumer.</p> Understanding as a Prelude to Change [00:23:29] <p>Garrison: There was a book that I I didn’t, I wasn’t able to read the whole thing before the call, called Blood and Earth (by Kevin&nbsp;Bales.)</p><p>He gives a really kind of clear description of him kind of seeing this thing. Actually going to the source of like where they’re mining minerals that ended up going into cell phones and seeing it in person. And it’s just there. And these operations are just simply operating. And just parts of the world as if there’s no, without a care in the world. But one thing he said that I think is the key to this is that once you know this, once you’re aware of this, you can’t forget it. You can’t ignore it. Or at least you can daydream all you want but once the facts are presented to you, you have to do something. And I think that idea that if people knew without a doubt, that that there were literally millions of slaves existing in the world today. We think of slavery as a bygone era like this dark past but it’s happening in either similar or in different ways. It’s kind of obscured, you know, in the giant machinery of&nbsp;trade.</p><p>I think one of the challenges with kind of driving awareness of this and trying to get a traction on the social front is you know, with social media and the way like the media landscape is nowadays we’re just constantly bombarded with information. Everything is happening all at once. Being connected as we are: it is both a beautiful and terrifying thing, depending on how that manifests. So do you think there’s a concern of effectively reaching the necessary number of people? Social awareness to the extent that actual change could be implemented.</p><p>Helen: I don’t think access with people will be the problem. It will be the approach that needs to be different from any approach that’s been used before. Because the approach that we often see is the picture of poverty, the physical child, woman, in a distressing situation. And that’s meant to tug on our heart strings adequately for us to take&nbsp;action.</p><p>All it does is make us feel bad and disconnects us because we don’t know that person is one of 40 million. Which is too big for us to contemplate in terms of how can I make a difference to 40 million people. We have to connect it, human to human, and have it resonate between your life and their life. My life and their life. We have to make the connection. Also, most people don’t know that 80% of the stuff they buy has been touched somewhere along the line by a slave, at least one. They don’t know that, but even if they did know that they would, we would still say maybe this one was the 20% that wasn’t touched by a slave and I can still sleep at&nbsp;night.</p><p>So we’re so disconnected from the reality, but it happens to someone, somewhere else, that I can’t influence because it’s too far, too disconnected from my reality. And just too big. We get overwhelmed and we disconnect. So the approach must be different in order to engage people. Because I think we now have the platforms where we can reach people with the right&nbsp;message.</p><p>We can do it very quickly and I think more effectively than&nbsp;before.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. It’ll certainly be a challenge. You’re dealing with complexity on the business front, the technology side of things, the social dynamics. It’s a genuine mission. And it has to be compelled by a desire to see things become better for people and just reducing suffering in the world. That has to be the north star that people&nbsp;—</p><p>Helen: It&nbsp;does.</p><p>And I think that the vast majority of people are not bad. They don’t want to do harm. And I believe that many businesses that do harm didn’t mean. The exegencies of businesses and the logistics of operation forced them down a road. Maybe, obviously they agreed to it, but maybe they didn’t set out — I don’t believe that people set out to do harm. So I do believe that there’s enough of us, both as consumers and businesses that do want to do the right thing and with the right tools in our hands and the right information in our hands, we can and now we have the capacity to be able to provide that, but I don’t pretend that it’s a quick&nbsp;fix.</p><p>This is generational attitudinal change that is required. But I do believe that we’re very close to having enough people on board as consumers and businesses, to be able to start making a&nbsp;dent.</p> Automated Morality [00:28:25] <p>Garrison: And I think showing people what’s possible is really important. Even as design artifacts. Being able to show people like here’s what this would be like in practice. It’s really difficult for people to change how they do things, how they operate in their daily lives. But one example that Vinay gives: the concept of automated morality. What if you could configure through some mobile app — you have it integrated with your payments or your payment card or whatever it is — make it to where it’s able to detect if there’s lack of transparency or even just actual documented evidence of bad labor conditions or slavery. And it tells you, it notifies you before you make the purchase.</p><p>Helen: Yeah, exactly. We have the capacity now to predict when slavery may be more likely to occur. Imagine, for example: As a few years ago happened with the conflict in Syria, mass migration into certain parts of Turkey. That was very auditable. We already knew, for example, that there was some dodgy factories close to the border in Turkey. You’ve got desperate people fleeing across the border need to earn money:&nbsp;bang.</p><p>I know that’s a very simplistic example, but still the fact remains that you can use the knowledge we have to predict when things are going to go south, when things are going to go wrong. And when things could result in human or environmental harm. And we can begin to do that so people could be warned like you say, when something actually happens or when the sort of geopolitical socioeconomic indicators start showing us red flags. But we can also automate morality by building in buttons into our Amazon whatever search is saying, do you want slave free tech? Do you want an environmental harm-free tech? And then you get your products filtered by those things as well. So there’s definitely ways of making it super easy for us as consumers to make the right choices. But obviously then what sits beneath that needs to be robust and comprehensive. It can’t be that the picked cotton was organic, but we know nothing about the 99% other parts of that&nbsp;product.</p><p>So we have to be really on point about everything that sits underneath the water of that&nbsp;iceberg.</p><p>Garrison: And that integration has a very clever side effect. If you did this and it prevented people, like people’s willingness to purchase from them because of the obscurity or whatnot at that point. It’s like, okay, well then prove it and then you’ll be one of the most, you know, a more popular&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Helen: Exactly. And I think a lot of the approaches that have been taken today to been finger pointing at company is going your bad. Like Zara, when it all came out about notes sewn into coat pockets. You’re bad. You’re a terrible company. And so companies felt backed into a corner, not wanting to be forthcoming with information that they have about their supply chains, because they’re scared of being ridiculed. And, you know, I totally understand that. Whereas if we come from the perspective of we don’t know exactly what’s going on, but we want to find out and when we do find out we want to deal with it. So we’re going to just be upfront and open. And that’s real transformation of culture that is required in order for businesses to feel confident to do that, to air their dirty&nbsp;laundry.</p><p>Garrison: There’s like a consumer literacy there like just knowing and understanding things. Everything is so complex these days. Like no one understands how the global financial system works. It’s incredibly important. It drives how resources are allocated around the planet, but not even the top top professionals in global finance could tell you how exactly does it work because there’s so much automation. There’s so many automated tooling from like high-frequency trading systems and such where like it’s all these processes that are just happening often autonomously and that’s happening further. So the thing we need to do is to automate this insistence on truth and sustainability so that these kind of darker aspects of supply chains that exist now isn’t just automated and further kind of optimized to the flow of goods, as it&nbsp;is.</p> The Flaws of Trade Globalization [00:33:05] <p>Helen: Yeah. Yeah. I think that underneath all of this is a fundamental restructure of global business actually, and ceasing of our current approach, which is let’s just go and find that from a country where we can get cheaper labor. That whole approach that is adopted pretty much universally. We have to shift that culture. We have to alter that culture, that approach because otherwise we are going to go and seek out and exploit the most vulnerable and with already existing socioeconomic pressure, you know, in whatever context those people live in. If you’ve got added to the international commercial pressure on that, it becomes unavoidable.</p><p>It’s the culture of how we do business internationally, that also needs to be considered. That’s the bigger&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Garrison: And there’s definitely a connection between resilience, economic resilience and scale of commerce. Like globalization a few decades, like rapidly scaled commerce around the world. But because of that, because it had to fracture and spread into this complicated matrix of distributors and manufacturers. It became less centralized within a certain region or like a state in the United States, for example, it became this global machine and it’s very easy for things to slip through the&nbsp;cracks.</p><p>Helen: Exactly. And that’s the problem is the complexity is just in so many cases, seemingly impossible to uncover. Global trade liberalization was marketed to us as a really great thing for countries to make friends and be closer. You know, we never were told about well, this is the flip side of that, that we’re going to go to China where we can get labor for X or India, or this country in Africa where labor’s less so we’re going to make them work really hard for not very much money so we can bring in cheap stuff. We were given the good news story about global trade deals or international trade deals and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. So even if you’ve got one corruptible feeling dodgy state involved, that is the only opportunity that is required for you to sour and taint that whole supply chain. And with the number of countries that we go to and use for the production cycle of various consumables, every single least developed country in the world is being&nbsp;flogged.</p> On Helen’s Work with Mattereum [00:35:45] <p>Garrison: I think we’ve covered quite a bit. Is there anything in particular that you’d want to cover? Oh would you like to inform listeners what you’re working&nbsp;now?</p><p>Helen: With Mattereum?</p><p>Garrison: Yeah.</p><p>Helen: So I am working with Mattereum to develop the approach that we will take to this because what we want to do is add rails of data onto Asset Passports to complement the information that’s currently provided in it to inform people about the environmental and social provenance of particular products or particular articles. So we’re developing the standards, the approach, how we will screen claims and test claims so we’re not going to be part of the greenwashing movement, so we can certainly distinguish ourselves from that and offer something that really is different and much better than has been before. What we need the technology to do for us in order to operationalize that.</p><p>Garrison: This is definitely one of the uh, better undertakings that I think anyone can be doing now. It’s a difficult subject to talk about, but I’m optimistic about the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Helen: Good. So I think we have to be otherwise reality becomes a bit&nbsp;—</p><p>yeah. Yeah. It’s good to be optimistic. I think we have reason to be optimistic.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-future-of-stuff-podcast-ep-4e62b79b6833">The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Economic experts believe that the EURO 2020 boosted the economy of participating countries and other European countries alike in ways including the expected bookmakers – but also food delivery services, small businesses, and pubs saw a surge in order intakes during this month.</p>
<p>As an ID verification platform provider, our angle on the EURO 2020 and its economic impact laid primarily on the gaming sector and its tremendous spike in player verification throughout the tournament.</p>
<p>Especially in the UK, the EURO 2020 enjoyed high viewing figures while bets been placed were skyrocketing:</p>
 
 ITV (UK TV Channel) pulled in 27.6m viewers during England’s 2-1 extra-time win on Wednesday 11th of July, making it the most-watched football match ever shown on one channel in England. 
 There were reported 30 million pounds worth of gamblers across some of the biggest gambling operators in the UK. 
 Entain, who also owns brands such as Ladbrokes, and coral reported that this was the biggest sports event with estimates of 250 million pounds worth of bets! 
 Some operators in the industry reported having seen more players betting on the England and Italy final than any other sports event during the tournament. 
 
<p>While keeping a lookout, especially for our gaming customers in Germany and the United Kingdom, we watched closely when exactly the numbers of player verification spiked and how to respond to it adequately concerning ID verification.</p>
 Encouraging players to verify themselves even before the EURO 2020 
<p>Operators predicted that they would see up to 80% of players signing up between June 10th -Jun 17th, for example, if 50,000 customers signed up, only a few of them will hit the deposit limit, then operators would reach out to players in the first week of July to verify following background checks.</p>
<p>A lot of time before the kick-off to the tournament, many operators and businesses found themselves advertising and creating campaigns to have players verify themselves before the EURO 2020 kicked off to help increase user experience.</p>
<p>Although Euros kicked off officially on the 11th of June, we started seeing spikes in player verification from the first week of June. Driven by the events themselves, certain promotions were targeted at the beginning of Euros for a better and seamless customer experience.</p>
 Leveraging AutoIdent to enable a quick and user-friendly onboarding 
<p>The overall conversion rate for the end-users was improved by the efforts made by gambling operators by giving players both AutoIdent and VideoIdent options. This was taking into consideration background checks that take place before the ID Verification and what browsers and devices might be used by the players to meet customer demand. However, for many of our operators, IDnow’s automated solution Autoident was the recommended route for players to have themselves verified as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>When Germany was no longer part of the tournament (29th of June), we observed the player going through the withdrawal stage sooner than expected. Now what we observe is one-off bettors’ volumes did spike during the period when the German game was on however, this volume has dropped.</p>
 Cutting down the ‘30-day grace period’ because of Germany’s new gaming regulation 
<p>There were other curveballs for gambling operators waiting as of the 01st of July, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/german-online-gambling-regulations/">a new State Treaty on Gambling 2021 (Glücksspielstaatsvertrag, GlüStV) was introduced and activated in Germany</a> with the undeniable impact on the user experience.</p>
<p>Usually, gambling operators share a grace period of allowing players to go through identity verification with ID documents within 30 days of registration. However, some operators had to reduce the 30-day grace period for a short while to 3 days to help remain and regulate the new regulations that came into place.</p>
<p>What I observed in my work managing gambling clients at IDnow was the new players casually spending low amounts during the Euro’s allowed many operators to have a soft KYC check so they can allow players to enjoy remote gambling and have fun responsibly. Within mind that deeper KYC Verification needs to be done with a 3-30 days grace period. Operators were right to predict that the spikes in player verification were higher in July after the 01st of July regulations went live.</p>
 Fighting criminal activities and underage gambling with ID verification 
<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nfc-gaming-operator/">IDnow was prepped for the EURO 2020 volume</a> and the increase in player verification spiked up by 114% compared to the previous month. This was expected behavior for many operators however, what we also found was an increased attempt from organised crime groups.</p>
<p>Organised crimes groups usually use gambling platforms to launder money. There are many steps that IDnow had to think about to fight against these activities and protect our clients and operators from these groups.</p>
<p>There are some severe consequences to how far the money earned and used through gambling operators can go, such as embezzlement to trafficking. We are also observing an all-time increase in gambling addiction in underage gamblers.</p>
<p>Studies have shown and shared via several UK-issued newspapers that in the past two years, 50,000 + children are being addicted to online gambling and the nation’s Gambling Commission showed 450,000 children aged 11 to 16 gamble regularly. This is why it was very important to understand what we work with and wanted to achieve was beyond enabling great customer experience but also protect minors and comply with set regulations in these strict markets.</p>
<p>Identity verification has not always been mandatory. In the past 10 years, we have seen markets like the UK, Australia, and now in the last couple of years the USA becoming more mindful and rethinking how the remote gambling business is impacting youth and adults.</p>
<p>When IDnow was picking up a higher number of fraudulent activities across several clients during the EURO 2020 tournament, IDnow fraud agents found patterns of what could be organised crime attacking specific organisations such as Money mules (recruited by criminals to receive money into their bank).</p>
<p>In these cases, it was highly challenging to allow just machine learning and reply solely on automated solutions to see fraudulent ID’s being processed. At IDnow we have a hybrid model of process ID’s. it has helped increase the confidence of verifying players and end-users and by using humans to look over the automated decision to be closest to getting the verification methods right as possible.</p>
 Player Verifications behaviours 
<p>Some players also had been verified previously during the grand national as a one-off fun activity however, these players are not sports bettors who use the online platform to bet regularly. This is the same behaviour we expected at IDnow with players who participated in EURO 2020 will not continue to use these online platforms at the end of the tournament.</p>
<p>Even though there was a spike during the euros, and we observe a drop in verifications and back to a normal level of betting, we are currently likely to see the player verification increase in August due to the domestic leagues starting again.</p>

However, we have taken precautions to minimize the impact of switching to a new chain on our users, by preserving the existing chain’s state in the new Proof of Stake network’s genesis block, as well as working with <a href="https://www.subscan.io/">Subscan</a>, our explorer provider, to make the historical data from the Proof of Authority chain available for our users. Today we are pleased to announce that these historical data can now be viewed at <a href="https://dock-poa.subscan.io/">https://dock-poa.subscan.io/</a>.

These dynamics at play resemble a teetering Jenga tower about to collapse.</p><p>We are ensnared in a cybertrust paradox: relying on both a handful of mega-corporations and relative geopolitical stability for access to vital online services — sometimes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651344/wwdc-2019-apple-force-ios-developers-sign-in-third-party">forcefully</a> so.</p><p>These corporations may:</p>  Go out of business and <a href="https://stormpath.com/">stop providing services</a>  Get hacked and cause <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password">massive damage</a> to businesses and&nbsp;users  <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-starts-blocking-developers-in-countries-facing-us-trade-sanctions/">Restrict critical access</a> due to geopolitical motivations  Exploit user privacy and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ex-app-store-review-chief-discusses-apple-competing-with-developers-2019-5">compete with businesses</a> built on their own platform due to misaligned incentives  Ignore compatibility with modern tech stacks like Jamstack, blockchain, and other forms of decentralized infrastructure  <p>Big tech companies become centralized custodians, amassing troves of user identity data, creating single-points-of-failure with “too big to fail” level risks. With motivations to expand and maintain growth at all costs, they acquire more companies and absorb even more user identities. Close to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/acquired-identity-management-companies">80% of all recorded acquisitions</a> happened in the last 8 years&nbsp;alone.</p><p>This problem compounds itself. One password leak makes other compromises easier, and the rate of lost or stolen passwords is only accelerating, as more companies are moving online due to the pandemic. Facebook’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">most recent data breach</a> compromised phone numbers and personal data, making it easier for hackers to impersonate users and scam them into handing over login credentials. In this instance, over 500 million users’ data were&nbsp;leaked.</p><p>To hedge against these risks, companies are under more pressure to keep data safe and act swiftly and transparently in a cyberattack. So they turn to their developers to implement authentication in-house. This often ends up being extremely expensive, involving building large teams to continuously address a multitude of security, compliance, infrastructure, reliability, and scale challenges. Despite these resources, 66% of breaches took months or even years to discover in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>Data breaches and lost/stolen passwords are a looming challenge of our times. Traditional forms of authentication haven’t changed much in decades and passwords are already obsolete.</p><p>Now more than ever, we need digital identity infrastructure that’s secure and sustainable — that scales with modern internet ecosystems.</p> The future <p>At Magic, we believe the solution starts with developers.</p><p>Instead of deferring responsibilities to end-users to improve their own security hygiene with things like password managers, Magic makes it plug and play for developers to add secure, passwordless login, like magic links and WebAuthn, to their applications. Users are no longer exposed to password-related risks from the very&nbsp;start.</p><p>So, what makes Magic authentication unique? Instead of usernames and passwords, Magic uses public and private keys to authenticate users under the hood. A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier</a> is signed by the private key to generate a valid authentication token that can be used to verify user identity.</p><p>Traditionally, usernames are publicly recognizable identifiers that help pinpoint a user, whereas passwords are secrets that were created by the user and are supposed to be something only they&nbsp;know.</p><p>You can think of public and private keys as materially improved versions of usernames and passwords. The public key is the identifier and the private key is the secret. Instead of being created by users and prone to human error (e.g. weak/reused passwords), the key pair is generated via elliptic curve cryptography that has proven itself as the algorithm used to secure immense value sitting on mainstream blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>Using blockchain key pairs for authentication gives Magic native compatibility with blockchain, supporting over a dozen blockchains. This enables blockchain developers to use Magic SDK to provide user-friendly onboarding experiences to mainstream users and tap into the potential of the rapidly expanding blockchain industry that is growing <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/04/27/2217572/0/en/Blockchain-Market-to-Expand-at-56-1-CAGR-and-Reach-USD-69-04-Billion-by-2027.html">56.1% year over year</a> and projected to reach $69.04 billion by&nbsp;2027.</p><p>The key pairs are also privacy-preserving (no personally identifiable information) and exportable. This allows user identity to be portable and owned by users themselves (self-sovereignty). The world is already moving towards this direction with novel solutions from companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/workday-says-it-has-a-blockchain-solution-thats-key-to-finding-a-job.html">Workday</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access-management/decentralized-identity-blockchain">Microsoft</a>.</p><p>We’re first committed to enabling a passwordless future, by providing developers with the easiest way to integrate passwordless login methods into their applications, paving the way to eventually encourage worldwide adoption of decentralized identity.</p> We’re hiring! <p>To accelerate our momentum, we are growing our team!

At <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>, Dr. Angelika Steinacker and Dr. Barbara Mandl will hold a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4590%20title="> pre-conference workshop</a> on Monday, September 13 starting at 9:00 am.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Angelika and Barbara some questions about their planned workshop.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Which audience do you hope to attract for your joint workshop on Women in Identity?</p>
<p>
We are hoping for a very diverse audience. We are addressing everyone who is currently working or planning to work in the space of Identity and Access Management and or Security. Our Agenda is put together in such a way, that it is meant for a very diverse audience. The workshop itself is meant to be inclusive, regardless of position, gender, or nationality.  It should be interesting for everyone. For managers in Identity and Access   Management, technical specialists, sales persons and students. As it is a workshop, we would love to have people who join the entire workshop from the beginning to the end, and people who really like to participate and like lively discussions and are very open-minded.  
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the goals of Women in Identity?</p>
<p>
Women in Identity is a registered non-proﬁt membership organization. Everyone at every level within Women in Identity is working on a voluntary basis and our teams are located across the globe. We want to inspire, elevate, and support a more diverse workforce in the digital identity industry. I am the Women in Identity ambassador for the DACH region (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland). We are now a group in DACH of more than 25 women in this network who want to make identity inclusive, exchange ideas and discuss further steps to encourage women to get involved in STEM.  
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What will the agenda look like?</p>
<p>
The agenda will be very interesting. We will have short presentations and a fireside chat with discussions with all attendees. The agenda will also include breakout sessions to discuss various topics in depth, for example technical IAM achievements, the future of Identity and Access Management, agile methods in IAM programs, and we will present the results of each of the breakout sessions to the entire audience.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What would you like the takeaways to be? </p>
<p>
Mainly, we would like our participants to be excited about the new ideas and the thoughts which were presented in the workshop, and which they discussed in the breakout sessions. Ideas and thoughts, nurturing a new impulse to contribute, and also  knowing how to contribute, to create inclusiveness in the Identity and Access Management and Security workplace.</p>
<p>We would like people to have a refreshed motivation and a new sense of curiosity for Identity and Access Management and Security through new ideas and thoughts, which will be discussed and presented at the workshop. </p>

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Doc some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why does decentralized identity matter to companies today?</p>
<p>
You as an individual have sovereignty and agency when you put your shoes on in the morning, when you drive your car, when you ride your bicycle. [But] we don't have that much [agency] yet on the internet. We don't have our own bicycle. We don't have our own car. We have a different one for every website that we go to. We have no more privacy than what websites and services provide separately. We don't have any scale across all of them. We're always agreeing to terms that other parties are proffering to us and giving us very few choices about how we answer and no records of that. And that's because we're always thinking that whatever we have as an individual is up to a company. And there are so many companies that we're dealing with as individuals that we don't have scale. We don't have full agency. We have no more agency than what the company provide for us.  
</p>
<p>That's too much responsibility for companies, and it's not responsibility that they necessarily want. It's too much. Why should you have to keep records of all these preferences, all these different things. It doesn't make any sense. You should be able as an individual - because you have agency - to change your address, to change your last name, to have a shopping cart you could take from site to site for the good of the companies that you're dealing with. You know, that's something that works for people and it works for companies as well. And that's why we need agency. We haven't had it yet online. We created the online environment more or less on the old industrial model where we had to have scale. </p>
<p>Every company separately needed all the scale they could get across all the customers that they wanted, and to hold that scale exclusively, so customers had no way to move from company to company or site to site with their own tools where they could deal at scale. They have a browser, but the browser is all they got really. After that, it's up to the company to remember who was that? That's a cookie I put in your browser. The customer should have more independence than that, and that independence should pay off for the companies. And we don't have it yet. That's a big “to do”.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is the business value of decentralized identity?</p>
<p>
The business value of decentralized identity, which I think of as distributed identity, by the way, is independence for the customer. It's independence for the individual. It's that everybody has the capacity to obey all of Kim Cameron's original seven laws of identity: Minimum disclosure for a constrained use, justifiable parties, plurality of operators [and technologies etc].  
</p>
<p>Those things are all really good for business, and we don't have them yet. And we don't have the tools on our side. We need wallets of our own, or something is like a wallet, that is our instrument for making verifiable claims and presenting verifiable credentials that can be verified easily and minimally disclose. There's a lot of thought and a lot of development that's going into, how do we make this work on the corporate side? I haven't seen enough on my side, on the individual side, that I just have to have that wallet. That's a great wallet. I have that. What can I put in that wallet? Have I seen his company before? What's my relationship with them? Where did I get these credentials? What are those? I shouldn't have to think about any of that.   </p>
<p>I think in the abstract, it all works, but we need to make it work in the concrete and it’s never going to work unless we have something that is an app on the front page of our phones; something that's a body function for us like our wallets are in our back pockets and our purses. And like apps are on our phones. We need those. There are some in the world now. There are some SSI wallets, but we need ones that are what I call “inventions” that mother necessity. You have to have them - take one look at it and say, I got to have that. I gotta have that. That's going to save me all kinds of trouble.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can organizations do to kickstart decentralized initiatives?</p>
<p>
I would suggest that companies go to their employees and say, don't think of yourself as an employee, think of yourselves as a customer or a user if you don't have customers, you just have consumers, they don't pay anything, but you have them. What would you want that works not only for this company, but for every company you deal with? What gives you scale? What can we do in cooperation with every other company out there, that's going to give you scale as a person, not just as an employee, but as a person? And especially think of how do we not trap customers? How do we not put them into a walled garden or into a silo? How do we liberate them so they can deal in a more efficient and useful way with all the companies they deal with? And look at what the fundamentals of SSI are, and how they would work with that.</p>
<p>But how do we put that to use in the world, for you as an individual, and get all of the input you possibly can, because I guarantee that the employees of your company know more about what they would want, as individuals operating in the world, than the company could begin to guess at.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the risks at play if organizations don't work on decentralized initiatives soon?  </p>
<p>
The main risk is getting left behind on something that will be universal, eventually. It's like 1991, and we don't have the browser yet, but the internet is already here. We are all going to be using the internet. Something like the browser is going to show up. Everybody's going to have one. Are you just going to put a brochure on the web, and say I'm going to hand it off to the marketing department? Or are you going to base the whole world – your entire company - on what the internet is going to do for you, that everybody can see through their browser? </p>
<p>
That's the future we're going to have with SSI. We're going to have self-sovereign customers. They are going to present verifiable credentials to your company and other companies. And you're going to participate in that. How do you get involved with that? We don't have the browser yet. And I don't think we do. We don't have the equivalent of the browser for SSI. We're going to have the equivalent of a browser, probably a number of things that might be like a browser, but it'll play the role of a browser in the sense that it's something. I have a better example, of maybe an email client. You know, we all had - if you were fluent in basic computerese – Mutt and Pine, and things that worked in the command line. And then later say Eudora, that you could use as an email client. This is long before Google sort of normalized it with Gmail, but you could still take your mail off Gmail and put it on your own server.   </p>
<p>
And people are going to have their own instruments for expressing their self-sovereign identities and really identifiers. Again, I have verifiable credentials that I'm going to present. I go to the concert and all you need to know is I have a ticket. I just flash something on my phone. You've got a ticket, you get in. We have some of that right now with QR codes. I went to a game the other day and showed a QR code, got in no problem. That starts to get there. That’s a form of SSI, but that's one company's way of presenting. That’s one B2B solution that happens to work in a B2C way.  </p>
<p>
We need the C2B solutions. Browsers are C2B. They're not B2C. We don't have a different browser for every company we deal with. We have one browser we deal with, with every company, one email account we deal with, with every company. We have one SMS client that we use to deal with every company. We have one phone number that we give when a phone number is required as an identifier. Those are examples of scale. We should have many, many other kinds of scale, but you can't begin to see that if you're only looking at it at an individualized B2C way. You're going to have to imagine a future where every one of us has, self-sovereign ways to present verifiable credentials that work across the whole world in a normalized way. And where does your company play in that? And I think right now, the way to play in it, is jump in with a whole lot of other companies that are doing are doing base level work on common protocols, the standards, and ways to make this new industry scaffold itself up. Get together with other companies on that base level stuff. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The title of your keynote is 'Where stands the Sovereign Self?' What do you hope to achieve with your keynote at EIC 2021? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to achieve, as I've tried to do I think with every keynote I've given there going back to the beginning, full respect for what can only be solved from the individual side. There are so many business problems that can only be solved from the customer side. And, I think with SSI especially, we finally have a lot of activity around that. But I'm still not seeing enough that starts with the individual, that says how do we get this person’s scale? How do we make this work across entire markets and across the entire world? How can we start equipping them - individuals – with ways to manage their lives? [We] have barely thought that out. Google and Apple provide calendars and contacts. And so does Microsoft, but they're not exactly compatible. They're very siloed.  </p>
<p>That's our personal data. We're always talking about personal data [and things like] harvesting personal data. The personal data that matters are: my health, my finances, what I own, my contacts, my calendar - nobody has solved these yet. And [there are] standards laying around in a world. Phil Windley is here [at EIC]. He'll tell you about picos and other things. I suggest you talk to him. If I was 25 years old right now, I would start with picos. I would start with things that people own. How do we make owning things a lot easier? How do we make communicating with companies easier about what we own outside of companies’ separate siloes? That plays into SSI. That plays into I go to the store and I say, yeah, I'm a member of this. I already have this. I already bought this one. You know, I go, did I buy this? Did I buy this keyboard?  I have a box over there that has three Apple keyboards. I didn't even know I had these. If I had known, my life would [have been] simpler. I wouldn't have bought another one the other day. But I don't know those things because I don't have record of that. When I get the receipt, I should put it through something that remembers it. Nobody's thinking about these things, or if they are, they're not gaining any scale. Give people scale around controlling their lives. We have the internet now. We have digital technology now. We're all digital beings. Give us ways that we can manage our lives. Fire marketing, get them out of the room, because they're only thinking still like: how do we find out all about what the customer wants? For one company, a piece. Get rid of that. Just think about what the customer needs. You're a customer. Everybody here is a customer. Think about what you could use in your life that you don't have right now, that gives you scale across every company you deal with in ways that are useful to those companies, where going to appreciate getting just a verifiable credential that says: I bought this before. I belong to this. I have a warranty. Lots of things like that, but in a standard way across all the companies you're dealing with. That is the frontier. </p>

<p>The company will be acquired by InfoCert and will join the Digital Trust Division. The consideration for 60% of the capital is equal to Euro 43.8 million.</p>



<p>Rome, 21 July 2021. Tinexta S.p.A., leading company in Digital Trust, Cybersecurity, Credit Information &amp; Management and Innovation &amp; Marketing services, through its subsidiary InfoCert S.p.A., has finalised today a Binding Offer, in the form of a Put Option Agreement, to the French company Oodrive S.A.S. for the acquisition of 60% of CertEurope S.A.S.’ capital. Oodrive is backed by Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group since 2017.</p>



<p>CertEurope, headquartered in Paris, is one of the three largest Certification Authorities in France with a well-known brand and a market share of around 40% in the eIDAS certificate sector. The company has the authorisations and accreditations to issue all types of certificates required by the French market, in compliance with the technical requirements established by the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI).</p>



<p>Through the acquisition, Tinexta will enter the French market, the second largest in the European Community, and InfoCert, the largest Certification Authority in Europe, will be enabled to sell its solutions on the territory. CertEurope’s well-established business relationships with some important trade associations (lawyers among the others) and with the major national retailers (resellers of digital services) represent a potential accelerator for the penetration of InfoCert’s solutions into the French market.</p>



<p>The agreement provides for the purchase of 60% of CertEurope’s capital for a total consideration of Euro 43.8 million (which includes an earn-out of Euro 3.8 million depending on the 2021 and 2022 result performances), assuming zero net financial debt at closing.</p>



<p>The option right inherent in the minority interests in the company’s capital may be exercised in 2023, on the basis of specific Put/Call1 agreements. The discounted value of the Put/Call option of the minority interest is estimated at approximately Euro 28.4 million.</p>



<p>The investment for 100% of the capital is estimated at Euro 72.2 million, composed as follows:</p>



€ millionInitial Cash-Out40.0Earn-out Debt*3.8Put Options Debt*28.4Total Investment72.2<br>*Discounted value, non-interest bearing.



<p>The acquisition of CertEurope will be financed with the existing liquid assets. The Enterprise Value of the company is equal to Euro 66.7 million, at a multiple of between 12x and 13x the 2020 EBITDA proforma for the acquisition of the majority stake and at a multiple of between 12x and 13x the expected 2022 EBITDA for the exercise of the option right on the remaining shares in 2023.</p>



<p>In the 2020 fiscal year, CertEurope recorded Revenues of Euro 14.1 million, up 6.9% compared to the previous year, a proforma2 EBITDA of Euro 5.2 million, with an operating EBITDA Margin equal to 37% on the revenues.</p>



<p>In accordance with the French legal system, the conclusion of a final agreement would occur after the seller has conducted the information-consultation process of the works council. Closing is expected by the fourth quarter of 2021. This operation is subject to the completion of the foreign investment control procedure in France.</p>



<p>The total value of the Digital Trust market in France is estimated3 at approximately Euro 150 million, with a growth forecast equal to 23% per year over the next few years, reaching Euro 500 million in 2025. The competitive environment is made up of a few major brands (including CertEurope, with around 10% market share, the third largest player) and a large number of smaller competitors.</p>



<p>Enrico Salza, Chairman of Tinexta S.p.A., said: “The Group continues growing, taking a further step towards international development and progressively consolidating its position abroad, confirming its vocation as a European player in digital identity”.</p>



<p>Pier Andrea Chevallard, CEO of Tinexta S.p.A., commented: “Through CertEurope, Tinexta group will be able to operate in France, a large market with great potential, also in regulated activities, and will have a high standing local platform and a brand of undoubted recognition to boost the international expansion.</p>



<p>We embarked on this process with determination because we are confident that this is a highly strategic operation, which can be a steppingstone to expand our presence in Europe. The high degree of complementarity with InfoCert’s expertise and services will enable us to achieve much value from this operation”.</p>



<p>“This agreement opens up significant opportunities – added Danilo Cattaneo, CEO of InfoCert – in CertEurope we found a group of skilled and motivated people that is already working with us in tailoring top selling InfoCert solutions for the specific needs of French companies and professionals, that will have available all the solutions of the Group with a local expert presence.</p>



<p>We shared the vision as a group to further invest resources in R&amp;D to provide expertise and valuable solutions for the digital transformation that will be a leading trend in Europe for the years to come.</p>



<p>In the acquisition of CertEurope Tinexta was assisted by Roland Berger for the support to the preparation of the business plan, by PWC for the financial and tax due diligence activities and by DLA for the legal due diligence and the support to the negotiation of the contractual texts.</p>

<p>La società verrà acquisita da InfoCert ed entrerà nella Divisione Digital Trust. Il corrispettivo per il 60% del capitale è pari a Euro 43,8 milioni.</p>



<p>Roma, 21 luglio 2021. Tinexta S.p.A., società leader nei servizi Digital Trust, Cybersecurity, Credit Information &amp; Management e Innovation &amp; Marketing, attraverso la sua controllata InfoCert S.p.A., ha finalizzato oggi una Binding Offer, sotto forma di Put Option Agreement, alla società francese Oodrive S.A.S per l’acquisizione del 60% del capitale di CertEurope S.A.S.. Oodrive è detenuta dal 2017 da Tikehau Capital, gruppo globale di gestione patrimoniale alternativa.</p>



<p>CertEurope, con sede a Parigi, è una delle tre più grandi Certification Authority in Francia con un brand molto conosciuto, una market share pari a circa il 40% nel comparto dei certificati eIDAS. La società possiede le autorizzazioni e gli accreditamenti per l’emissione di tutte le tipologie di certificati richiesti dal mercato francese in conformità ai requisiti tecnici stabiliti dall’Agenzia nazionale per la sicurezza dei sistemi informatici (ANSSI).</p>



<p>Attraverso l’acquisizione, Tinexta entrerà nel mercato francese, il secondo per dimensione nella Comunità Europea e InfoCert, la più grande Certification Authority in Europa, sarà abilitata alla vendita delle proprie soluzioni sul territorio. I consolidati rapporti commerciali che CertEurope intrattiene con alcune importanti associazioni di categoria (tra le altre, avvocati) e con i grandi rivenditori nazionali (reseller di servizi digitali) rappresentano un potenziale rilevante acceleratore per la penetrazione nel mercato francese delle soluzioni di InfoCert.</p>



<p>L’accordo prevede l’acquisto del 60% del capitale di CertEurope a fronte di un corrispettivo complessivo pari a Euro 43,8 milioni (che include un Earn-out pari a Euro 3,8 milioni in funzione delle performance di risultato 2021 e 2022), ipotizzando un indebitamento finanziario netto pari a zero al closing.</p>



<p>Il diritto di opzione inerente alle quote di minoranza del capitale della società potrà essere esercitato nel 2023, sulla base di specifici accordi di Put/Call1. Il valore attualizzato dell’opzione Put/Call della quota di minoranza è stimato in circa Euro 28,4 milioni.</p>



<p>L’investimento per il 100% del capitale è stimato pari a Euro 72,2 milioni, così composto:</p>



€mCash-Out iniziale40,0Debito per Earn-out*3,8Debito Put Options*28,4Investimento totale72,2*Valore attualizzato, infruttifero.



<p>L’acquisizione di CertEurope sarà finanziata con la liquidità esistente. L’Enterprise Value della società è pari 66,7 milioni di euro, ad un multiplo compreso tra 12x e 13x l’EBITDA 2020 proforma per l’acquisizione della quota di maggioranza e un multiplo compreso tra 12x e 13x l’EBITDA 2022 atteso per l’esercizio del diritto di opzione sulle restanti quote nel 2023.</p>



<p>Nell’esercizio 2020, CertEurope ha registrato Ricavi per Euro 14,1 milioni, in crescita del 6,9% rispetto all’anno precedente, e un Ebitda proforma2 di Euro 5,2 milioni, con un Ebitda Margin pari al 37%.</p>



<p>In conformità con l’ordinamento giuridico francese, la formalizzazione dell’accordo definitivo avverrà dopo che la parte venditrice avrà condotto il processo di informazione-consultazione del comitato aziendale. Il closing è previsto entro il quarto trimestre del 2021. L’operazione è soggetta al completamento della procedura di controllo degli investimenti esteri in Francia.</p>



<p>In conformità con il regime legale francese, il signing è previsto nel mese di settembre, al termine del processo di Hamon Law che coinvolge le Risorse Umane della società acquisita e che viene avviato oggi. Il closing è previsto entro il quarto trimestre 2021. L’operazione è sottoposta al completamento delle procedure di Antitrust e Golden Rule in Francia.</p>



<p>Il valore totale del mercato del Digital Trust in Francia è stimato3 in circa 150 milioni di euro, con previsioni di crescita pari al 23% all’anno nei prossimi anni, fino a raggiungere i 500 milioni di euro nel 2025. Il contesto competitivo è composto da alcuni brand rilevanti (tra cui CertEurope, con circa il 10% della quota di mercato, terzo player) e da un elevato numero di competitor di piccole dimensioni.</p>



<p>“Il Gruppo – ha dichiarato il Presidente di Tinexta S.p.A., Enrico Salza – continua a crescere compiendo un ulteriore passo di sviluppo internazionale e consolidando progressivamente la propria posizione anche all’estero, confermando la vocazione di player europeo per l’identità digitale”.</p>



<p>“Attraverso CertEurope – commenta Pier Andrea Chevallard, Amministratore Delegato di Tinexta</p>



<p>S.p.A. – il gruppo Tinexta potrà operare in Francia, un mercato vasto e dalle grandi potenzialità, anche nelle attività regolamentate, e disporrà di una piattaforma locale di elevato standing e di un brand di indubbia riconoscibilità per accelerare l’espansione internazionale.</p>



<p>Abbiamo avviato il percorso con determinazione poiché siamo convinti che si tratti di un’operazione di elevato contenuto strategico, in grado di rappresentare un trampolino di lancio per l’ampliamento della nostra presenza in Europa. L’elevata complementarità con le competenze e i servizi di InfoCert ci consentirà di estrarre molto valore da questa operazione”.</p>



<p>“L’accordo annunciato oggi apre opportunità significative – aggiunge Danilo Cattaneo CEO di InfoCert – in CertEurope abbiamo trovato un gruppo di persone competenti e motivate che già sta lavorando fianco a fianco con noi per fornire ad aziende e professionisti francesi le soluzioni InfoCert integrate con i prodotti CertEurope e adattate alle specifiche esigenze e normative locali.</p>



<p>Abbiamo condiviso la visione come gruppo di investire ulteriormente in ricerca e sviluppo per essere in grado di fornire tutta la competenza e le soluzioni necessarie alla trasformazione digitale che sarà realizzata in Europa nei prossimi anni”.</p>



<p>Tinexta è stata assistita nell’operazione di acquisizione di CertEurope da Roland Berger per il supporto alla predisposizione del piano industriale, da PWC per le attività di due diligence finanziaria e fiscale e da DLA per la due diligence legale ed il supporto alla negoziazione dei testi contrattuali.</p>



 



  Tale diritto di opzione, anche se classificato come indebitamento secondo gli IFRS/IAS, non comporta nessun onere finanziario prima del suo esercizio, che potrà verificarsi solo nel 2023.  Il perimetro dell’operazione fa riferimento alla legal entity CertEurope S.A.S. successivamente ad un processo di carve out e carve in che verrà completato prima del closing. In particolare, con il carve out verranno trasferiti alcuni asset e 13 Risorse Umane, mentre a seguito del carve in entreranno in CertEurope 24 Risorse Umane.

<p>As all of you who are reading this article already know, a blockchain has a very difficult system architecture to manipulate or to discard data once recorded in the network. In addition, due to this feature, assets of users created and stored in the blockchain network are guaranteed more securely than any other system. BananaClips is an online marketplace that utilizes these features and gets the leverage through them. The AERGO blockchain is mainly used as a platform to create value/assets for customer uploaded videos and to improve trust in transactions. Today, I would like to explain to you how BananaClips uses AERGO and why it makes AERGO and BananaClips more valuable systems and services.</p> Uploading Videos on BananaClips <p>BananaClips is also a platform where anyone could upload their created and valuable videos in public. When users upload a video to BananaClips, the following process is performed internally.</p>  Saving the original video file to a secure archiving location  Automatic video&nbsp;analysis  Extracting copyright information  Extracting search information  Detecting unsafe&nbsp;contents  Monetizing contents  <p>During this process, the blockchain is utilized in steps 2, 3, and&nbsp;6.</p> Video Analysis and Extracting Copyright Information <p>When a video file is analyzed, various pieces of information called metadata are extracted such as the size of the video screen (i.e. resolution), geographic location information, whether the video is horizontal or vertical, and so on. It is very important to keep this information safe as it can be easily edited or deleted. It can be said that this is the first step to secure copyright.</p><p>BananaClips keeps this extracted metadata on the AERGO blockchain network to prevent modification or deletion of customers’ video contents. In addition, by providing metadata for free through the AERGO network, we are step by step in preparation for standardization for copyright protection and revitalization of the community.</p> Digital Watermark <p>Even simply extracting metadata and storing it on the blockchain network would be useless if it could not be utilized. For this reason, Banana Clips uses its own digital watermark technology to store invisible encrypted information, i.e. steganography, in the video content itself. This steganography data becomes a compass from which you can check the metadata extracted from above and stored securely on the AERGO network. In other words, no matter how the video content is altered or misused, if users/systems can check the metadata and related licenses, users/systems can further protect the copyright.</p> Smart Contract <p>The extracted metadata would be added through a smart contract deployed on the AERGO network created by BananaClips, and anyone could view and check the metadata via the AERGO network. However, if anonymous users/systems want to add or modify metadata, it can cause confusion due to incorrect data and misguided behaviors. Therefore, only BananaClips can save and edit the metadata in the smart contract for the present. In the future, we plan to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) so that various members and partners can participate in this smart contract, and we will develop to standardize it.</p> Monetizing contents <p>BananaClips issues NFT with new value on the AERGO network for an uploaded video content that has been prepared through the above processes. However, in order to improve the user experience, new tokens would be issued and provided to users in a different way from other NFT services.</p><p>It is not an easy task for customers who want to upload and monetize contents to understand and prepare their personal wallets and coins for issuing. If you, who are reading this article, think about when you tried to understand about a blockchain and coins at first, I assure you will fully understand that this process is not easy. Making this process simple and easy is also one of the biggest challenges and differentiation factors BananaClips has prepared for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Fewer steps and simplifications do not compromise security at all. Rather, a roll called “confirmer”, which is not present in the existing ARC2, is added to prevent incorrect transactions that may occur by attacking a smart contract by any change. This role and step to guarantee by our system has been included to achieve a higher level of security.</p><p>Additionally, BananaClips users can withdraw their NFT assets at any time through AERGO or Ethereum (we plan to support more blockchain networks) and can obtain video contents again at any time after withdrawal via our service. Since our marketplace can be used again through re-deposit their NFT assets, it will provide usability at a more advanced level than other services in terms of scalability to support various platforms.</p><p>The NFT smart contract was developed according to the ARC2 standard. Here, the additional APIs provided after research and development by our engineering team will not lack in providing a higher level of service to BananaClips customers. Soon, the AERGO community will be able to meet the advanced NFT open marketplace.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bananaclips-on-aergo-e06d3a537a9c">BananaClips on AERGO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A Tale of Two Approaches to Decentralized Data Integrity <p>Holochain is quite different from blockchain, but because they are designed to solve some of the same problems – and because people try to understand Holochain in terms of blockchain all the time – we figured it would be a good idea to frame at least one key aspect of Holochain in comparison to blockchain.</p><p>A complete primer on Holochain and blockchain would need a good deal of detail about what blockchain really is and how it works, and we’d probably be addressing a lot of common technical misconceptions about blockchain in the process. This is not that article.</p><p>Instead, this piece focuses on the approach each technology takes to solving an important challenge, which is really the fundamental challenge of decentralized computing: how to ensure that data is accurate and tamper-proof in a way that is efficient enough to scale.</p><p>We’ll look at blockchain’s approach, then Holochain’s.</p> Blockchain and Global Consensus <p>Blockchain is a cryptographically secured, decentralized ledger of data. You can think of a blockchain as a record of events: the things people said, who agreed to what, who sent money to whom, and so on. Up until blockchain was invented, these sorts of records were pretty much always stored in centralized databases, such as those held by government entities or private companies. Blockchain was created as a way for people to interact and transact without needing to trust such intermediaries.</p><p>What makes blockchain secure and trustable – in other words, what ensures its data integrity – is that the data is not just cryptographically protected but also replicated to many different computers (called nodes) controlled by different people or organizations. Only when a piece of data is adopted by the multitude of nodes is it considered factual, at which point it’s committed to the record. For someone to alter the record, they would have to not only break cryptographic barriers but also change most of the copies that are floating out there – a pretty much impossible task.</p><p>The way that nodes reach ‘consensus’ on what data to commit to the record varies from blockchain to blockchain, but it typically involves some type of competition among the nodes to write the next chunk of entries, or ‘block’, to the chain. Ultimately the selection of the winning node is random, so it’s not exactly consensus in the way that people mean the term in the real world. But the important takeaway is that, one way or another, the blockchain nodes come to terms on a global state of data, where all nodes hold a replica of all the same data.</p><p>And so here we come to the scalability problem: it requires tremendous computing work for all the nodes to write and hold the same data. This makes blockchains notoriously slow processors: the Bitcoin network processes just a few transactions per second, while the Ethereum network currently processes dozens. Users are accustomed to waiting minutes, sometimes up to an hour, for a single transaction to be confirmed.</p><p>The problem gets worse as you try to make blockchain do more things, which has been its aspiration, more or less, since Ethereum positioned itself as a decentralized world computer when it launched in 2014. That’s the point at which blockchains began to be able to store not just transaction records but all kinds of files and even executable application code that performs functions when accessed, resulting in new data that also gets written to the blockchain. It’s been an attractive idea to imagine that much of what we do on the web today could be hosted on blockchain networks as decentralized applications (dApps). In reality, though, apps like social networks, communication platforms, travel-booking systems, ride-sharing systems, calendar systems, and so on need much faster throughput, by many orders of magnitude, than blockchain can provide. Can you imagine waiting several minutes (and paying a gas fee!) to get a message through on a chat platform? Or for an edit to show up on a collaborative editing tool like Google Docs? Can you imagine how much computation and storage would be required to accommodate on a blockchain all of the photos and videos on social media, with all nodes needing to write all of that data and keep it forever? It doesn’t work. Facebook receives <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/facebook-statistics/">over 4 million likes every minute</a> and currently stores <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/facebook-statistics/">over 250 billion photos</a>.</p><p>Efficiency is such a challenge in blockchain that there are entire companies, including some of the most talked-about crypto projects today, dedicated to figuring out how to make blockchain scale better. Some of them focus on ‘layer-1’ solutions, which attempt to increase the throughput of blockchain protocols themselves, while others are ‘layer-2’, which perform computations or store data off-chain and then periodically merge records into the blockchain. Most of these solutions, though, seem to be setting their sights on low-throughput applications such as financial transacting as opposed to live collaboration apps, social networks, media platforms, and so on. And the few that do seem capable of handling a broader set of applications make compromises on decentralization, concentrating hosting and consensus mechanisms among centrally authorized nodes.</p><p>Still, the accomplishment of blockchain is not to be taken lightly. It’s more resilient to corruption than any ledgering or value-storage system than has ever existed before, and it is changing global finance as a result, with lots of room for growth still. But what’s probably even more important is the awareness it has sparked of what’s possible. Its aspirations have infected broad communities of people with a sense that we could communicate and transact without centralized intermediaries. Blockchain’s scalability challenges may ultimately limit its utility, but it has already revolutionized how humans think about interacting.</p> Holochain and Embodied Local States <p>The architects of Holochain began with a basic question: what if everyone could actually just hold their own data and share it with the network as needed? If everyone could just host themselves rather than relying on mining nodes to do it? We could avoid all this massive replication, which would obviously be much more efficient. We would just need to do it in a way that still ensures data integrity. We would have to be completely confident that, as everyone represents their own data to the network, there is no way for people to misrepresent their data.</p><p>That is fundamentally what Holochain does. Holochain is a framework for ensuring data integrity within a decentralized application without relying on anyone other than the users themselves. </p> A Natural Solution <p>At this point in the conversation, people familiar with blockchain are often skeptical. What’s to prevent people from lying about their state? From, say, spending the same money in two different places? (Holochain supports applications far more diverse than just currencies, but it’s often useful to use currencies as an illustration.)</p><p>We’ll get to some of the mechanics that make this possible in a moment. First, let’s look at the principles behind the mechanics, by way of analogy to nature… starting with some of its smallest objects.</p><p>Consider the covalent bonding of a chlorine atom and a hydrogen atom to create a molecule of hydrogen chloride. This requires the hydrogen atom to have a free electron available, i.e. not shared with any other atom. How does the chlorine atom ‘know’ whether the hydrogen atom has an electron available? It’s simply apparent. The hydrogen atom embodies whether a free electron exists in its state. It’s not able to misrepresent whether there’s a free electron, and it’s not able to ‘double-spend’ its electron, because the availability of an electron is evident to other relevant atoms upon inspection. There is global visibility, on demand, of local state.</p><p>It would be ridiculous to believe that, in order to know whether an atom has a free electron, there should be a global, synchronized ledger of the whereabouts of all electrons in the universe. Or – to use a natural example with somewhat larger objects – that the status of the trillions of cells in our bodies should be registered on a global body tracking system. The cells already embody the changes: the levels of oxygen in the blood cells, for example, determine whether they offer oxygen to organ tissue cells in exchange for carbon dioxide. Then the reverse happens once the blood cells reach the lungs, where they exchange carbon dioxide for fresh oxygen. These interactions are determined on a cell-to-cell basis, without reference to any body-wide ledger of blood cell oxygen levels.</p><p>Holochain’s premise is that it’s equally unnecessary for all nodes in a decentralized application to hold a record of everyone’s state, as happens in blockchain, or for nodes to reach consensus before a user commits a state change to their own record. The local embodiment of state can act as its own authority, as long as the structure of data is tamper-proof. Also, only information necessary for larger-scale coordination needs to be widely shared, with all shared data strongly tied to where it came from. In this way, Holochain is an agent-centric system for decentralized computing: the users (agents) themselves are the definitive source of information in the system.</p><p>Okay, with those principles established, let’s look briefly at some of the architecture that makes Holochain’s data structure tamper-proof and scalable. After a cartoon break, that is.</p> Holochain’s Core Components <p>Source Chain. Each user hosts their own data on a source chain, which is a cryptographically signed record of everything you’ve ever done or said within Holochain applications, stored locally on your machine. Source chains, like blockchains, are hash chains, which associate a cryptographic fingerprint (or ‘hash’) with every record (or ‘entry’). Hashes are unique to the particular data they represent: changing just one comma to a period in a thousand-page book would result in a completely different hash.</p><p>DHT. Data that needs to be shared with the network is published to a shared environment called a distributed hash table, or DHT. Your tweets and comments in a Twitter-like app, your ride requests in an Uber-like app, your edits in a collaborative document editor… all of these are on the DHT. (Data that doesn’t need to be shared can remain private to your source chain.) Each user running a Holochain app stores a tiny slice of the app’s DHT, in addition to hosting their own data.</p><p>DNA. Each application’s rules for sharing data are written into the application code itself, known as DNA. The DNA is what says that this is an application for tweeting (which involves sharing data with a certain structure) versus calling rides or co-editing documents (which involve sharing different data with different structures). It also defines who can join the app’s network: can anyone join, do you need an invitation code or to pay, or is there some other criteria? A copy of the DNA is hosted by every application user, which means that any user is able to validate whether data being shared to their slice of the DHT conforms to the application’s rules.</p> But What Makes It Tamper-Proof? <p>Okay, cool structure maybe, but why can’t someone simply alter their source chain and misrepresent their data to others? </p><p>You can think of a source chain like a diary: each page contains a header, which identifies the fact that something happened and when it happened, and an entry, which contains the content of what happened (such as “I sent 100 units of currency to so-and-so”). Some of these entries might have been published to the DHT and others might not have, but in all cases the headers, which contain the hashes of the entries, are shared to the DHT. In other words, I may or may not have published the contents of a given diary page, but everyone is able to see that I wrote something on the page, and they are able to see the unique fingerprint that corresponds the contents of the page (which would completely change if I were to ever modify the contents even slightly).</p><p>Let’s say you and I are doing some transaction such that I need to send you 250 units. The app’s rules (encoded in the DNA) will say that in order for this transaction to go through, you need to verify my account balance, which means that I need to show you enough information from my diary in order for you to do so. (Remember, there is global visibility of local state, to whatever degree is necessary for a given action to be validated.) Your computer can very quickly add up all the pluses and minuses on the pages in my transaction diary, my source chain. You know that I’m not hiding any pages because you can check the DHT and see exactly how many pages have writing on them. And there’s no way I could have altered a previous page without making it obvious I’ve done so, because every action I take is a new timestamped event with a new header and new unique hash that also gets shared to the DHT. Plus a system of header monitoring by ‘neighbors’ ensures that I’m unable to fork or roll back my source chain without getting flagged. If anything doesn’t add up, or if it seems like something has been obscured, the transaction simply fails the validation rules and does not take place.</p> But What Makes It Scalable? <p>Most of blockchain’s challenges with scalability are really challenges of managing global consensus. Since Holochain maintains data integrity without the need for consensus, it doesn’t run into the same limitations.</p><p>There is no need for universal agreement. Keeping with our currency example for a moment: how many computers need to confirm our transaction in order for it to be executed? If this were blockchain, all nodes would need to come to terms with one another and keep a record of our transaction forever. In Holochain, the transaction is complete when just two computers have written it: yours and mine. Then, afterward, we publish the data to the DHT, and randomized groups of nodes store it so that others can confirm for themselves, later as the need arises, that we’re representing our states accurately. Data validation is party-to-party, just like for all the cells in our body, just like for all the atoms in the universe. This feature alone eliminates all of the computing required to reach global consensus.</p><p>There is no need for universal state. It’s true that many types of data do need to be published to the network – tweets and comments, ride requests, document edits, and so on, to keep with our earlier examples. It’s also true that an app sometimes needs system-wide tracking to monitor aspects of overall activity, just as the body has ways of monitoring and responding to changes in blood oxygen levels overall; this is another reason that the DHT often needs to store some amount of shared data. Unlike on a blockchain, though, each piece of data on the DHT is replicated only enough times to make sure the needed data is always available, including when the author might be offline. We’re talking about maybe dozens of replications in Holochain rather than potentially thousands or more in blockchain. And this limited replication is strategically distributed across all the users participating in the app, which means that each user performs just a little bit of extra work to hold a very small portion of the DHT.</p><p>Each DHT contains data for only one application. A blockchain contains all the data from all the applications running on that chain: every Ethereum node, for example, contains all the historical data for all the dApps running on Ethereum. In Holochain, each app has its own shared storage space in the form of its DHT. As Holochain architect Arthur Brock <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/limits-to-blockchain-scalability-vs-holochain-19685dcb89f9">put it recently</a>, “If I just want to run a Twitter-like app, why should I also have to run your crypto exchange, gambling app or collectible cartoon animals? On Holochain, users only run the apps they actually use.”</p><p>Each new user to an application adds storage and computing capacity. In blockchain applications, where miners and stakers write and store data, the network capacity is constant no matter how many nodes are added, so increased user activity increases the strain on computing resources. Holochain applications are entirely hosted by the users themselves, so as the demand for the app grows, so does the computing power to run it.</p> A Truly Peer-to-Peer Network <p>Let’s use one more example, a social networking application similar to Facebook or Instagram, to summarize the different approaches to data integrity taken by Holochain and blockchain. Let’s also add in the approach that today’s centralized social networks take, as a point of additional comparison. In this social network, you do all the things you’re accustomed to: posting text and images and videos, commenting on other people’s posts, and chatting privately with friends.</p>  In the centralized scenarios common today, all of the data – including your photos and comments and messages – are held by the company who owns the platform. The social network is supposedly secure and scalable by virtue of its being centralized: the company takes responsibility for maintaining the network, and they are paid to do so in one or more ways. As we have seen, though, our data is often not as secure as these companies might like us to believe: data breaches are extremely common (since data stored in one centralized place makes a honeypot for hackers), plus our data is routinely sold to advertisers or leaked to other third parties (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> was but one extreme example).   A blockchain version of a social network would theoretically be hosted by the miners or stakers running the blockchain nodes. Integrity would be ensured by virtue of your data being written to the blockchain only after a consensus of nodes determines the data to be legitimate, then being replicated across all nodes and stored by them forever. But the data load would be extremely high in this scenario, creating a major scalability problem. Many blockchains and blockchain apps try to solve this problem by reducing the number of nodes that need to reach consensus, or by doing much of the computing or hosting work off-chain on centrally authorized servers. These approaches all compromise on decentralization and point us back, in one way or another, toward scenario #1.<br><br>(In point of fact, even a truly on-chain social network would be only nominally decentralized, since the miners and stakers, who need to be paid to do their job just like a centralized company does, effectively become a new kind of intermediary. But this is the subject of <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-4ac6045ac894">another article</a>.)<br>  In a Holochain version, the entire network – all of the data and even the application code – is hosted by the users themselves. It’s truly peer-to-peer. Data integrity is ensured through global visibility of local state, established on an as-needed basis. You share your photos, comments, and messages to the network through a shared table called a distributed hash table (DHT), but you remain the primary authority on everything you’ve published. The network is scalable by the fact that no global consensus is necessary, by the fact that the DHT involves only as much data and replication as necessary, and by the fact that every user shares a small piece of the load. The more users join the network, the more capacity it has for scale. And there are no intermediaries at all – no one who needs to be paid or trusted to write and store your data on your behalf.  <p>If a peer-to-peer approach is that much better, why hasn’t everyone been doing it this way all along? One factor is probably the technical complexity involved, but another is probably that it’s difficult for people to imagine that everyone could host their own data and not be able to misrepresent themselves. Even though Holochain has been around in some form for several years, its approach to data integrity is enough of a departure from blockchain’s that developers and users are only just beginning to understand its potential, similar to how it took several years for Ethereum’s capabilities to be widely understood.</p><p>That does seem to be changing, however, especially since Holochain’s <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/?%20https://blog.holochain.org/announcing-and-unpacking-the-new-holochain/">refactored state model went live</a> and is proving to be many times more performant than previous versions – and also since so many new applications are preparing to launch on Holochain. And we can expect greater and greater awareness of Holochain as more applications go live in the coming months.</p><p>At a time when blockchain still has so much potential for growth, it may seem odd to be already talking about a post-blockchain application space. But given the scalability challenges blockchain faces and Holochain’s readiness to leapfrog these issues, it might be time to begin thinking outside the blocks.</p> <p>One way to stay tuned about Holochain and Holo is to <a href="https://holo.host/newsletter-signup">sign up for the occasional newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>Full Transcript: Beyond Bitcoin – DeFi with Algorand, Algomint, and MeldVentures</p>



<p>Leyla: Hello everyone and welcome to Beyond Bitcoin, a new monthly series where we break down the latest trends in cutting edge technology, blockchain, and beyond- And why it matters to you!</p>



<p>My name is Leyla and I’m co-hosting on behalf of BSN Global. And joining me is ShareRing’s Communications Manager Timothy Kingery.</p>



<p>Timothy: Thank you Leyla!&nbsp;</p>



<p>and with us today for our series premiere we’d like to welcome our industry experts:<br><br>Summer Miao, Head of Community&nbsp;Asia Pacific for Algorand Foundation<br><br>and Michael Cotton,&nbsp;Founder of MeldGold&nbsp;and Co-Founder of MeldVentures and Algomint,&nbsp;here to share their insights and answers to the real questions that matter about DeFi, thank you both for taking time out of your busy schedules to join us!</p>



<p><br>Summer: Thank you<br><br>Michael: Thanks for having us</p>



<p><br>Timothy: Starting off, can you tell us a little about yourselves and how you came to work for one of the top blockchain companies in the world?<br></p>



<p>Michael: Thanks Timo,&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;I started the Gold industry straight out of highschool, so with the money I’d saved up working through highschool I started building my own gold business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That business went on to be one of the largest gold companies here in Australia,&nbsp; so now currently employs 60 staff and is spread across the country including one the highest-rated security vaults for precious metals in Australia.</p>



<p>And then around 5 years ago I started looking at blockchain tech and really loved the concept and loved the idea. For me I saw the true innovation and I saw the future and what really held, and then we started building out this concept of bringing gold to blockchain and really creating a gold currency once more.<br><br>Since then we’ve gone on to partner with companies such as MKS PAMP, the largest gold trader in the world, based in Switzerland, Heraeus out of Asia, and Perth Mint here in Australia.</p>



<p>And then I head up MeldVentures- an Australian-based technology investment company. And MeldGold is really moving it’s way through to become the digital gold standard for gold across the world.</p>



<p>Leyla: Wow, that is incredibly impressive, Michael</p>



<p>Your passion for gold and innovation have clearly paid off, so thank you so much for sharing your experience with us today.<br><br>Michael: Thank you<br></p>



<p>Leyla: Summer, how about you? What brought you here?</p>



<p>Summer:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay so actually, it’s an interesting story with a series of happy coincidences-</p>



<p>So I joined the blockchain space in early 2018 – back then I was still working in the traditional education industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there happened to be a blockchain startup looking for a senior marketing fellow. That’s the first time I heard about the word “blockchain” and I did some research out of pure curiosity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You see, 2018 was the year when Bitcoin turned 10, however, many were still skeptical towards Bitcoin and the technology behind it. And after vast research, I was able to have a better understanding of the blockchain and I was amazed by the beauty of the idea and the great potential behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I thought to myself, okay, “This might be the next generation of the “Internet”, and look how the internet has changed our lives and become something that you cannot live without. This might be something.” So with these expectations, I decided to change the direction of my career and I took a leap into the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, one year after, another happy coincidence happened; Algorand Foundation started seeking a team member in Asia for local community building. That’s when I seized my moment and luckily I became part of this great team.</p>



<p>Timothy: Excellent story, I really resonate with that view of it being like the new internet! Thank you for sharing that with us.<br><br>And judging by their popularity and lead in this industry, it’s easy to say joining Algorand was a wise choice!<br><br>Your team has climbed to the top of the charts in terms of market cap and has established itself as an industry-leading DeFi platform of choice by many new DeFi blockchain companies, with Algomint here being just one of many promising projects.<br><br>But for those of us in the industry two years ago, DeFi wasn’t really in the headlines at all. What stuck out to you about Algorand, of all blockchain companies?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Summer: Okay so without a doubt, Algorand is a world-renowned project which has attracted global attention with everything it’s launched, and as you might know there is intense competition in the public chain sector.</p>



<p>So to me, Algorand stood out from the rest for a few big reasons:<br><br>Firstly, and maybe most importantly, is the Algorand team and it’s leadership:</p>



<p>Our Founder, Silvio Micali, is also a Turing award winner. He is the co-inventor of many widely-used blockchain protocols, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Verifiable Random Functions, and the Probabilistic Encryption.</p>



<p>Many of which have also served as the foundation of modern cryptography and under his leadership we’ve got some of the greatest minds in the industry leading us. That alone gives me confidence that Algorand would succeed.</p>



<p>Then the technical aspects:</p>



<p>Algorand has managed to find an approach that solves the blockchain trilemma without any compromise.</p>



<p>So, a little background here, the blockchain trilemma is one of the main challenges that blockchains have faced throughout the decade in which the three key objectives:</p>



<p>Security</p>



<p>Scalability</p>



<p>And Decentralization</p>



<a href="https://www.seba.swiss/research/the-blockchain-trilemma">Source</a>: SEBA BANK AG



<p><a href="https://www.seba.swiss/research/the-blockchain-trilemma"></a></p>



<p>Summer: Couldn’t be fully achieved without sacrificing at least one of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So Algorand, by employing a novel pure Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm solved the trilemma and created a truly secure, fast, and scalable blockchain platform.</p>



<p>One fun fact: the name Algorand is a combination of two words: Algorithm and Random – So we call our approach Algorand, because we crucially rely on algorithmic randomness for it’s efficiency</p>



<p>And it’s also worth mentioning that Algorand has a fast-growing ecosystem, and many use cases are from traditional industries. So, a number of companies, actually so far seven hundred have chosen to build on Algorand. So all of these reasons certainly helped my decision to apply, yeah.</p>



<p>Timothy: That’s a fantastic explanation, and with that in mind I can see how it was an easy choice!<br><br>And that’s really impressive regarding your Founder too, Silvio, I didn’t know he played such a big role in developing those protocols!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Verifiable Randomness, that kind of stuff is used by so many different blockchains, that is really fundamental to this industry, that’s amazing.</p>



<p>We’ll include a link in the description below if you’d like to learn a little more about these after the show. But before we get too far, we’d like to break down in the simplest terms possible what exactly IS DeFi?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what impact will this have in people’s lives?<br></p>



<p>Summer: Okay, I’ll take this question-</p>



<p>DeFi is short for “decentralized finance,” it’s a term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain to disrupt financial intermediaries.</p>



<p>To put it more specifically, DeFi stands for financial services with no central authority. So DeFi takes out traditional elements of the financial system, such as exchanges, or banks; and it replaces the middleman with a blockchain smart contract.</p>



<p>Okay, so you may ask: So no intermediaries to steal a part of my cake, what other advantages does DeFi have compared to traditional finance? And what impact will it have for the world?</p>



<p>So, First of all, DeFi will make financial services more accessible and everyone will have a fair chance in the financial system. All information which are required when creating a bank or a brokerage account, such as the government-issued ID, Social Security number, or proof of address are not necessary to use DeFi. So this is especially helpful for those who are unbanked in Africa and Southeast Asia who have no access to basic financial services.</p>



<p>Second, no central party or authority can reverse transactions or turn off the services. So you can control your assets independently, all transactions are publicly traceable, and you know exactly where your money is all the time.</p>



<p>And last but not least, transactions are enforced and governed by the “smart contract.” Basically, money is programmable according to predefined computer code, which is publicly available for anyone to audit. With these, DeFi can be applied in real-life services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take insurance as an example – just think of regular insurance – except that the rules of insurance events are encoded and the claims are paid out automatically – how convenient is that!?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael: And to add to what Summer is saying as well, I think the other piece of this is not just allowing users to access these services, but it’s really giving some of the brightest minds in the world the freedom to build out these products.</p>



<p>And the barriers to entry for financial products is extremely high, where as in the DeFi space and the blockchain space, you know, those with the best ideas and the strongest capability can actually deliver valuable products with a lot more ease.<br></p>



<p>Leyla: Well, that is truly fascinating, thank you for breaking that down for us</p>



<p>So, you explained DeFi includes a number of financial products and services,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Could you tell us about some of the most popular and how they compare to their counterparts in traditional finance?<br></p>



<p>Summer: Okay so, imagine trying to invest a single dollar in a way that would have any tangible return as an asset without being high risk? It’s virtually impossible. Even with financial inclusion, price point accessibility is not enough.</p>



<p>Through DeFi solutions, the users will be given the chance to take part in trading global tech stocks through a digital tokenization model that divides one share of a traditional equity into an individual 1/10,000 micro-equity token of representative value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will advance microfinance by moving beyond micro-loans into micro-equity that can create wealth regardless of socioeconomic standing. So, this is actually the work of focus of MESE, one of our ecosystem partners, they are providing accessible wealth creation tools to the underbanked. MESE is a micro-equity stock exchange powered by the Algorand blockchain they aim at letting users invest very small amounts in selected stocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is made possible as the negligible transaction fees on Algorand allow MESE to provide micro-equity token shares that would not be viable at a chain with substantive transaction fees.</p>



<p>So you will be able to hold one crypto-based micro-equity token of big companies like Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Twitter, Amazon, or Google, which is to hold a cryptocurrency that represents 1/10,000th share in a real stock.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael: And to add to that as well and I think Summer touched on it briefly is in terms of micro-loans, the other really interesting part this opens up then is the ability to then take micro-shares or take assets in companies like Google or Apple and actually access loans against those assets.</p>



<p>In the traditional space that’s an incredibly difficult task and in most cases non-existent. But, within DeFi, the ability to do that in a trustless way, in under a minute, and access a loan at really competitive interest rates is a really fascinating piece of the puzzle.</p>



<p>Because, number one, it allows people to access opportunities they might have before them that they may not want to sell their current holdings in other platforms, yet they want to take advantage of this opportunity –</p>



<p>Or, alternatively, they might just need a short-term loan, they might be short on funds, or have an emergency, you know, it happens to the best of us.</p>



<p>So the ability to access those funds quickly, easily, and at a much better rate is really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tim: Very Cool!<br><br>Some of those stocks are prohibitively expensive, the last I checked you can’t buy a share of Google for under $2,000.</p>



<p>So will this be as easy as buying stocks with any other app? Or will it still require some cryptocurrency knowledge?<br><br>Summer:&nbsp;</p>



<p>MESE aims to make the investment as easy as possible, so the experience will be no different than using the other app.</p>



<p>I believe the key to mainstream adoption is to make blockchain invisible for users. While the user is using the service based on blockchain technology, they won’t need to understand or even realize it’s blockchain related.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like nowadays, we are using all the services enabled by the internet, but for most of the users, they don’t quite care what technology is behind this.</p>



<p>Tim: Well said,</p>



<p>Yeah, I think a lot of us would agree with you there, most don’t really care how the TV works on the inside, we just want the entertainment that it provides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think as more blockchain products become more user-friendly focused like ordinary apps, we’ll see a huge increase in adoption.</p>



<p>So these DeFi loans seem like a no-brainer, you know, if you do the math comparatively with their traditional finance counterparts, but if you’re already savvy in Bitcoin you’re probably not too excited at the prospect of low double-digit returns on the year.</p>



<p><br>But for the millions, or billions of people who don’t necessarily enjoy the thrill or inherent risks of investing, when do you think DeFi loans would be in the hands of ordinary users, like my neighbor Bill?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is anyone working on making this like, really mainstream?<br><br>Summer: Yes, that’s what we are heading to, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the key question behind this is “when will blockchain technology obtain mainstream adoption?” or “Is blockchain technology business ready?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So while the benefits of blockchain are clear, for blockchain use cases, such as DeFi, if it wants to be welcomed into mainstream adoption and become an alternative for real-world use cases it has to solve issues like high execution cost, scalability &amp; speed, and the security issues.</p>



<p>To advance ahead, the industry needs a next-generation, open-source, permissionless blockchain being decentralized, scalable, and secure with a built-in transactional speed and low fees to power real-world use-cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe Algorand is one of the ideal platforms to push blockchain into mainstream adoption. And hopefully your neighbor Bill and my friend Jane will soon enjoy the blockchain services with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be honest, it will take some time but it will be worth the effort.</p>



<p>Michael: I think too, as Summer said, blockchain really does need to be invisible for broader adoption,</p>



<p>I think it also creates opportunities for people like Bill to understand the technology and really come to terms with the idea that it’s secure, and it’s an incredible tech, but it’s also not that scary.</p>



<p>Another benefit of DeFi is that those usual roadblocks that I said earlier for entrepreneurs and developers to create interesting products are dramatically reduced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there is definitely a great variety of products both live and coming, and as we do start to see new generations of Blockchain technology coming to market like Algorand, we are seeing more secure options arise, which inherently means broader adoption is coming.</p>



<p>For example, at Meld Gold we are working with several new projects launching on Algorand blockchain to create yield with Gold, something that’s almost unheard of in the traditional sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the brilliance of Algorand and several of the products building on top of this incredible technology is they are making it easier and easier for people like Bob to access these kinds of opportunities.</p>



<p>Timothy: Gold Yielding!?</p>



<p>If I’m following you correctly, that’s a way to earn an Annual Percentage Yield from gold you own that you would otherwise be just sitting on?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you tell us a little more about this?</p>



<p>Michael: Yeah, of course, traditionally assets like physical gold have been cumbersome to deal with, store, and move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with Blockchain technology, once that gold is digitized, you can now own that gold. It can be vaulted and stored, trustlessly accounted for, and have a digital representation of that gold on blockchain, which opens up a whole new world of opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, it’s essentially unlocking the value within gold that traditionally would not be accessible. Now with your gold represented digitally you can utilize DeFi via platforms, like some of the lending platforms coming to Algorand to earn yield on that gold like you would in dollars or other currency.<br></p>



<p>Timothy: Wow, yeah that’s the first I’m hearing of anything like this, that’s brilliant!<br><br>So aside from the consumer products and benefits we’ve discussed, are there any DeFi products or services that you think would be useful for businesses?</p>



<p><br>Michael: Most definitely, all the advantages Blockchain brings to consumers play out for businesses as well. As you can imagine they are just larger transactors and larger equity holders, so the value is just multiplied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taken by the same token, the ease of use for businesses is also key, it needs to be invisible for businesses just like it is for consumers. And with all the advantages Blockchain brings and how incredibly powerful the tech is, imagine if it was as user-friendly as the apps we are using today.</p>



<p>Summer: Yes, It’s a wonderful thing to see the convergence between the DeFi products and the traditional business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would like to share a good example:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opulous, it’s one of the DeFi use cases building on Algorand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a decentralized peer-to-peer DeFi loan platform that provides artists with a more direct and accessible way to secure funding. Also, it offers everyone a fair chance to invest in one of the world’s fastest-growing and most lucrative industries: music.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opulous loans are backed by future music royalty earnings and copyrights. Unlike cryptocurrency, these assets have predictable future values and carry no risk.</p>



<p>The platform will analyze a borrower’s music data and copyright assets to ascertain how much money they are eligible to borrow. It will then establish a custom loan repayment plan based on their predicted future earnings.</p>



<p>Musicians currently earning a steady royalty income will be eligible to receive up-front loans equal to the value of revenue they generate over 12 months, paying as little as 4% in interest rates.<br></p>



<p>Michael: And beyond just Bob we’re also now seeing institutions and startups and corporations looking at what DeFi can offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, on the start-up front, a tech startup raises $5,000,000 to develop / expand on their project, and rather than sit earning bank interest they can utilize DeFi to generate stronger, meaningful returns to add to their development fund, really increasing their runway and increasing their likelihood of success.</p>



<p>And I agree with Summer about Opulous, you know, as one of the more interesting use cases, allowing artists to digitize future music royalties on blockchain and reducing that friction in market entry while delivering value both to creators, investors and fans is really interesting.</p>



<p>And I think this really opens up what we’ll see in some of this next generation, which is the kind of concept where, for example, farmers could take their future crop yields, digitize them, and gain loans at better interest rates with less friction.</p>



<p>Leyla: So fascinating, well, you both touched on a lot there, but I’m intrigued about the applications to music.</p>



<p>Is this something that would combat the piracy problem causing musicians to lose revenue since file-sharing and torrents became so popular?</p>



<p>Michael: Great question, Blockchain technology via NFTs does help solve this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a fairly new area with a lot of development happening as we speak, but even right now, a song can be loaded into an NFT via hash code and played through a decipher; which means only an original can be played.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, the brilliance of that is if you get sick of a song, you can actually trade and sell it on the secondary market.</p>



<p>And then what we see happening is royalties can then be attached to those NFTs and the actual original creating artist can still receive royalties on-chain, completely trustlessly, over time.</p>



<p>And with Algorand this can all happen at lightning-fast speed, at incredibly low cost, and with each component in a trustless manner.</p>



<p>Timothy: Wow, that is a fantastic concept, I think a lot of musicians would be thrilled to learn about this, but I think we’ll have to save a deep dive into NFTs for another episode!</p>



<p>Moving forward though, with this new array of DeFi financial products on the way, do you see this causing more banks to downsize or close?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are banking jobs or loan officer jobs being eliminated?</p>



<p>Michael: Look, I think it needs to be looked at from a different lens, and I think that’s the innovation lens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If DeFi becomes truly a challenger to traditional finance, which I think it is well on it’s way to being, we won’t see the banking industry die out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we’ll see them be forced to change– adapt, innovate themselves, the difference is normally the changes aren’t this drastic. This is one of the rare occurrences where we see huge leaps forward and the market trying to catch up while being wary of what it holds.</p>



<p>Summer: Yeah, I agree with Michael, so for central banks, cryptocurrencies are now considered a potential threat. However, we can see that when facing the threat, banks are making positive changes to adapt to a new technology trend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one would say, If you can’t beat them, join them!</p>



<p>Banking and governments hold the most power in the world, it may be naive to think that they will stand by as crypto and blockchain replace them.</p>



<p>At this point, nearly all world powers have considered releasing a digital version of their currency from their central bank — the main reason is to head off Bitcoin and crypto from gaining too much momentum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new reality tends to look like centralized authorities will be adopting blockchain solutions to avoid the risk of being extinct.</p>



<p>Leyla: I think a lot of us would be happy to see financial services across the board improve, even if they’re simply forced to, to remain competitive!</p>



<p>How do you see DeFi maturing over the next 5 years?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what sort of products do you think will go mainstream and how will that affect the current players in the industry?</p>



<p>Michael: I think we’ll see a lot of the current players adapting to meet the market, so we’ll see a lot more adoption from the financial sector and the traditional sector coming to blockchain.</p>



<p>With these additional funds and power coming into the marketplace, we’ll see further accessibility and broader acceptance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, you know, additional competition always brings additional innovation, you know, the more competitive the marketplace is, the harder those within the marketplace work to remain an edge and be competitive and also meet the market in terms of what the demands are.</p>



<p>In terms of interesting new products and concepts coming into the marketplace, there’s a huge spectrum of great things coming, but one of the ones that I like most is trustless funds management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is kind of a new concept, and the idea is:</p>



<p>Rather than giving your money to an institution where you deposit and you wait to see what the sort of interest levels are and really trusting a third party to hold those funds and deliver that return–</p>



<p>It’s actually done via smart-contracts, which is a trustless vehicle that allows you to:</p>



<p>One, see all the investments that are being made, but also allows you then earn a return via that vehicle without having to trust that third-party, really removing that element of counter-party risk, where someone might disappear with the money isn’t actually possible in a vehicle like this.</p>



<p>So it really is a new level of transparency for investments.</p>



<p>Timothy: Wow, yeah that’s really interesting, so just to clarify for our audience, you said there is no institution to deposit my money with, so this is a non-custodial solution?<br><br>So the money is in my possession and in my control the whole time rather than with the fund manager, but still being traded?</p>



<p>Michael: Yeah so, Tim it’s actually non-custodial in the sense that it’s not actually controlled by anyone else,</p>



<p>It’s actually controlled by the smart contracts, so what it means is the only one who can actually access and withdraw the funds is you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the other piece to add to that which I think is really interesting as well is with this new generation of automated or autonomous funds management any investment can be made,&nbsp;</p>



<p>it’s not a matter of investing a million dollars, you could invest as little as $10 in a project like this. Which is another interesting element that really changes how we’ll see the new financial structures.</p>



<p>Leyla: I’m always wary of trusting anyone with my money, and I think a lot more people would be receptive to the idea of managed investing if they could maintain control of their funds at all times.</p>



<p>While we’ve been talking about more of the basic level of use cases, what interests you the most about the DeFi space?<br><br>And is there any sort of milestone or advancement you’re really excited about?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Summer: Okay, I’d like to share with you the recent updates regarding Algorand:</p>



<p>We will continue to grow our ecosystem in various aspects including DeFi and NFT, and especially the stablecoin ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there have been a lot of stablecoins issued on the Algorand blockchain such as USDT, USDC, Euro (Monerium), Candian dollar (QCAD), Brazilian Real (BRZ), Turkish Lira (BiLira).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also collaborating with our partners on the digital version of the local currency, such as Mexican Peso, Indonesian Rupiah and also, Japanese Yen.</p>



<p>As a project we are investing a lot of our resources and partnerships into working on various stablecoins that are beyond US dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This way, it will enable more DeFi use cases, with massive social impact. And we expect to unleash the potential of stablecoins and accelerate the convergence between decentralized and the traditional finance.</p>



<p>Timothy: &nbsp;Very cool!&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those of our audience who may not know what stablecoins are, these are digital tokens backed and redeemable 1-for-1 with their paper counterparts.<br><br>The primary purpose of this is to make them easily tradable across all cryptocurrency exchanges and DeFi platforms.</p>



<p>While there are some tokenized forms already available for most common fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar with USDT,&nbsp; USDC– Algorand is forging ahead to add many more, so that’s definitely something to keep an eye on!<br><br>And Michael, what are you most excited about coming up?<br></p>



<p>Michael: We have a really strong focus on what the future of DeFi looks like, what does the next 10 years look like for this next generation of finance?</p>



<p>Working really closely with a lot of the Algorand building community I get first-hand view of what’s coming and what’s being developed.</p>



<p>So for me, you know, talking with all these other projects, for us where the focus is on creating the most collaborative and powerful ecosystem we can that fills in all the pieces of what a traditional ecosystem or financial ecosystem requires. And ensuring that in that development we’re also making sure it’s a really inclusive environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is something where the entire world can adopt and participate, and doesn’t exclude any particular party, which I think is a really important part of where we’re heading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leyla: That sounds very exciting, Can you expand on the ecosystem you envision?<br><br>And what sort of other DeFi financial products do you see becoming commonplace in the next 10 years?</p>



<p>Michael:&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the key thing to keep in mind is we shouldn’t force technology like blockchain where it doesn’t belong. Likewise, where it is more valuable over the alternative option it should 100% be adopted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In broad terms, at its core, anything that removes the need to hand over control of your assets, such as dollars, or some of the new generation of assets, such as your personal information or medical history, is something where blockchain fits really perfectly.</p>



<p>The other side of this is removing friction, cost, adding speed, or creating certainty in a transaction. This is another really valuable set of components that bring real value within the blockchain space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ecosystem could expand into things like controlling your own personal identity. This would allow data to be delivered to you as you like it, but also control who actually gets to see your data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, getting paid to see ads for products you are actually interested in, versus advertising companies getting paid for that same information.</p>



<p>Taking the money you earned then onto a loan platform to generate great yield while verifying your identity on that platform via a KYC token in your wallet – But you’re not actually giving up your personalized data, is a really good sort of stepping process as to what we can see coming from this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then finally taking that yield you’ve just earned and via an atomic transaction, which is like a trustless swap with a third party that you can verify is a good actor through their KYC token, on the same transaction is something really useful and something you could not do before…</p>



<p>and this is just the beginning!</p>



<p><br>Leyla: Incredible!</p>



<p>Well guys, honestly, I have many more questions but we are out of time!</p>



<p>For myself and those viewing who would be interested in learning more about DeFi and the types of products we’ve talked about, where would you recommend we start?</p>



<p>Michael: Thanks guys very much for having me, both Tim, Leyla, and <a href="https://bsnbase.io/g/main/index">BSN Global</a>, really appreciate it – and for making this possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And we have a whole series of other articles coming out, so we have regular content coming to market.</p>



<p>Summer: And thanks for having me in this very first session of Beyond Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really like the idea of putting the blockchain in a way that is easy and fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While being in the industry for around 3 years – not long but enough to witness the rapid and amazing development happening every day. I am also glad to see the shift in people’s opinion towards blockchain and a growing interest comes from the traditional industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d like to take this chance and ask everyone to join the journey to witness the development of this groundbreaking technology. Maybe you missed the early stage of the internet boom, but you can still catch the trend of blockchain!</p>

  <p>In his talk, Martin Kuppinger will deconstruct the term Access Management and look at the various elements and concepts behind. Access Management is multi-facted and includes many concepts. On the other hand, many of the areas we should find being supported in Access Management are still missing in most implementations. So: What does it need for a modern, comprehensive Access Management? How will this look differently from now? Will we get rid of the burden of annoying authentication procedures or reviewing static entitlements we don’t understand? Which roles should policies play? Could we move forward to just-in-time entitlements? And will we finally get rid of passwords.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger will cover trends that are already visible, options you can take today, but also evolutions that are just visible at the horizon and innovations vendors should focus on today.</p>
<p>He will deliver you a high-level playbook for tactical and strategic steps for evolving what you have in Access Management towards a broader, future-proof solution.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/access-management-playbook-2021-07-21-kuppinger"></a>

   How do you protect secret information from sabotage? You should consider two possible scenarios when answering this question: Sabotage can be caused from the outside as well as from the inside.

  <p>How do you protect secret information from sabotage? You should consider two possible scenarios when answering this question: Sabotage can be caused from the outside as well as from the inside. In principle, a potential threat can also come from people within your own company.<br>An essential step is therefore to make sensitive documents and directories accessible only to employees who really need them for their work: Following the need-to-know principle.<br>In the case of facilities that are vital to life or defense, these employees must also be instructed in how to protect themselves against sabotage.<br>Consistent checks to ensure that protection instructions have been given are therefore part of the administrator's duties, which in turn requires additional time and organizational capacities.<br>In this practical presentation, you will learn how automated permission management can relieve IT administrators and at the same time reduce errors caused by manual processes while ensuring compliance with special requirements for the assignment of rights, e.g. through separate data protection instructions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/access-management-playbook-2021-07-21-tilly"></a>

<p>Recent acting chair of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/biographies/rebecca-kelly-slaughter">Rebecca Slaughter</a>&nbsp;wants&nbsp;<a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/recent-ftc-chair-signals-push-for-rules-on-data-collection-and-dark-patterns-that-sidestep-congress/">new rules</a>&nbsp;to shift the burden for avoiding data abuse away from consumers and firmly onto businesses.</p>



<p>Slaughter argues&nbsp;that the current model of giving users choice and control over their personal data, while important, isn’t working to stop data privacy and market competition abuse. Instead she wants businesses to stop excessively collecting and abusing consumer data in the first place, including through the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">dark patterns</a>. And she points out the FTC doesn’t have to wait for Congress to act on this matter.</p>



<p>Speaking at the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)’s “Privacy and Antitrust: Integration Not Just Intersection”&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">panel discussion</a>&nbsp;in June, Slaughter said:</p>



<p>“I want to sound a note of caution around approaches that are centered around user control. I think transparency and control are important. I think it is really problematic to put the burden on consumers to work through the markets and the use of data, figure out who has their data, how it’s being used, make decisions … I think you end up with notice fatigue; I think you end up with decision fatigue; you get very abusive manipulation of dark patterns to push people into decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So I really worry about a framework that is built at all around the idea of control as the central tenant or the way we solve the problem. I’ll keep coming back to the notion of what instead we need to be focusing on is where is the burden on the firms to limit their collection in the first instance, prohibit their sharing, prohibit abusive use of data and I think that that’s where we need to be focused from a policy perspective.”</p>



<p>New FTC chair,&nbsp;Lina Khan, was sworn in on June 15, 2021, so we’ll watch this space.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we point to our complete privacy toolkit&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;as a way for businesses to be proactive about limiting the amount of customer data they collect and manage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudo Platform is a powerful collection of identity protection capabilities delivered as a vast toolkit of easy-to-use APIs and SDKs that make it simple to:</p>



  quickly integrate identity protection and privacy capabilities into a brand’s new and existing products and services&nbsp;  give users control over their personal data and identity  offer next generation privacy tools for communications, browsing, payments and more  deliver your customers unprecedented privacy, security, and trust.&nbsp;

   Global supply chains are hugely complex as they span across companies and countries.

As a result, there’s also a high chance of forgeries, inefficiencies due to multiple authentications, and delays that can, in turn, have a compounding effect on other companies’ operations and even a nation’s economy as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>The good news is that a lot of these issues can be resolved with <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p> Digitizing Credentials <p>The paper credentials that are being used now in the supply chain industry are slow as they require physical verification, and are easily forgeable as&nbsp;well..</p><p>Since VCs are machine-verifiable and tamper-proof, they can be used to securely manage paper credentials and to track the movement of goods across international borders. Check out this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/transportation-hub-lorry-receipt-issuer">PoC </a>to better understand how you can digitize credentials for the supply chain using Affinidi’s stack.</p> Tapping into a Verifiable Global Marketplace <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">Verifiable credentials</a> can be used to establish a trustworthy trade connection with another entity on the global marketplace to buy and sell goods across countries and to handle payments, shipping, and the logistics that come with&nbsp;it.</p><p>The advantage with VCs is that they are built on JSON-LD and hence, can be used to verify the credentials of buyers and sellers between different systems and data models. This interoperability of JSON-LDs opens up enormous opportunities for everyone involved.</p><p><a href="https://www.trustana.com/">Trustana</a> is a B2B trade platform built on Affinidi’s SDKs, and it connects buyers and sellers in the F&amp;B&nbsp;space.</p> Building Reputation <p>Another key benefit of verifiable credentials is that it helps to build an organization’s reputation over time. For example, if a potential supplier can look at the prompt payments and associations of a buyer, it may be inclined to partner with that company. In this sense, verifiable credentials create trust among companies as the underlying data is accurate, authentic, and verifiable.</p><p>In turn, this can iron out the inconsistencies and uncertainties that may come up in the global supply and demand market such as pandemics, weather-related events, political instabilities, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>As a buyer, it also opens up more opportunities and lesser dependence on just a handful of suppliers.</p><p>From a supplier’s standpoint, it has the option to dynamically redirect its goods, products, and services to new areas or areas of high demand as its credentials can be established easily.</p><p>Here is a <a href="https://devpost.com/software/the-power-of-vcs-in-a-pandemic-stricken-world">PoC</a> built on Affinidi’s stack that uses VCs to enhance the reputation of a company and its products.</p> Reducing Forgery <p>Transforming documents into verifiable credentials addresses this basic concern of forgery and hence has no further need of physical verification time and&nbsp;again.</p><p>This is because forging products and documents is impossible with VCs, as every entity in the supply chain has a unique <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> that is immutable and secured with <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">public-key encryption</a>.</p><p>These credentials are compliant with the W3C standards as&nbsp;well.</p><p>In all, VCs help to create a transparent supply chain, where you can track the movement of goods, ensure compliance, know the reputation of companies you’re dealing with, and reach out to more players in a trusted&nbsp;way.</p><p>To learn more about you can leverage Affinidi’s stack to build a transparent supply chain network, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> or email&nbsp;us.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>In early June 2021 Cisco announced its vision for the Future Cloud. This vision comprises two distinct elements – <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en_uk/solutions/data-center-virtualization/data-center-events/un-box-webinar.html?ccid=cc002457&amp;oid=wbrcsm026191" title="UCS a unified hyperscale computing infrastructure">UCS, a unified hyperscale computing infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://video.cisco.com/video/6249019154001" title="tools to provide end to end observability of hybrid cloud services">tools to provide end to end observability of hybrid cloud services</a>.</p>
 Hybrid Management Challenge 
<p>As organizations adopt a hybrid IT delivery approach this increases the challenges of managing and securing the different elements.&nbsp; Some of which are delivered as cloud services and some in other ways.&nbsp; Usually, these different elements need different management and security tools and, where hundreds of applications are being delivered, this imposes a significant management burden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, some cloud vendors have started to offer tools that extend beyond their own cloud.&nbsp; A more widely adopted approach is the use of VMware; this is supported by a wide range of clouds and provides common tools that can be used wherever it is deployed.</p>
 Cisco Infrastructure for Hybrid IT 
<p>Cisco’s approach to this challenge is UCS.&nbsp; According to Cisco – this is a programmable self-aware, self-integrating system based on the concept that infrastructure is code. Servers are designed to be stateless, with their identity, configuration, and connectivity extracted into variables that can be set through software. This enables management tools to help guarantee consistent, error-free, policy-based alignment of server personalities with workloads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UCS is supported by Cisco Intersight which is an SaaS management tool that provides a single control point for the complete hybrid USC.&nbsp;&nbsp; On paper this provides a solution to a real problem however, it depends upon the customer choosing Cisco products to get all the benefits.</p>
 The Network for the Hybrid Cloud 
<p>The network is the key enabler of the hybrid cloud.&nbsp; The availability of wide area high performance networks is what has made practical the remote delivery of business-critical services.&nbsp; Indeed, the large CSPs (cloud Service Providers) have all invested heavily in their own private networks as a critical part of their service infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the new 5G mobile networks are widening the availability of high-performance connectivity into new use cases including manufacturing, logistics, and travel.</p>
<p>The app on the end user device is just the tip of the iceberg – the app depends upon the work done by the distributed services that provide the functionality.&nbsp; Therefore, the end user experience is becoming dominated by the performance of the networks that connect these services.&nbsp; While the performance of CPU, RAM and storage are still important for the individual services, the end user experience is determined by the end-to-end performance of the networks.</p>
 Governing the Hybrid Cloud Network 
<p>While the performance of hybrid IT services is dependent upon the network much of the network involved will be outside of the direct control of the business.&nbsp; This makes it important to take a governance-based approach with clear service level agreements supported by measurement of delivered performance.</p>
<p>The end-to-end network traversed by a transaction delivered from a hybrid deployment may involve a mobile network (radio and backhaul), the public internet, the in-cloud network, the connection to the organization’s data centre as well as within it.&nbsp; Identifying where unacceptable delays, that are outside of the agreed service levels, are occurring is not a simple task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This challenge is increased by modernised applications which exploit multiple distributed containerised services.&nbsp; What used to be a subroutine call on a server is now a service request, and the performance of this this depends upon the network.&nbsp; One business transaction now involves a web of service interactions.&nbsp; This architecture also increases the attack surface since, these services themselves are points of vulnerability if not properly protected.</p>
 Cisco ThousandEyes 
<p>Cisco’s response to these challenges is their ThousandEyes Platform. According to Cisco this combines a variety of active and passive monitoring techniques to provide insight into the end users’ experience across the applications and services. As well as monitoring enterprise network performance though locally installed agents it also exploits pre-deployed software vantage points across the globe to provide real-time internet outage detection.&nbsp; The platform enables enterprises to monitor and measure the end-to-end network performance to identify bottlenecks.&nbsp; It can also help to detect abnormal traffic patterns that could indicate security compromises.</p>
 What about SASE? 
<p>There are various vendor definition of SASE (Secure Access Service Edge).&nbsp; Cisco defines it as “Secure access service edge combines networking and security functions in the cloud to deliver seamless, secure access to applications, anywhere users work.” Although Cisco did not focus on SASE in these announcements the distributed nature of a service based architecture means that the service edge, if it exists at all, is highly complex and hence will be increasingly difficult to manage and secure.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>Cisco has correctly identified some of the key challenges from the hybrid IT delivery model that is now commonplace in organizations.&nbsp; A common approach to managing and securing the heterogeneous components of this infrastructure is a major headache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, UCS adds yet another flavour to an already crowded field and Cisco Intersight depends upon the use of UCS.&nbsp; Organizations need to consider UCS in the context of the wider market including vendors such as VMware, popular open-source solutions such as OpenStack, other hyperconverged infrastructure products, as well as emerging hybrid IT management tools from the major cloud vendors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast Cisco have correctly identified the network is a critical element of hybrid deployments and that it has the potential to become the major performance and security concern for modernised application architectures.&nbsp; In this context their ThousandEyes platform is very relevant to the governance of networks in a service-oriented hybrid architecture.</p>

 Mission Holding at DM: The Case of Nature-based Solutions <p>This is the fifth in a series of DM notes, in which we write about insights from our work on the ground, following internal learning sessions called DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>DM Note #5 is a reflection on how we build and organize missions internally, taking Nature-based Solutions as a case&nbsp;study.</p> Mission Oriented Innovation: An Introduction <p>One of the most interesting aspects about the mission to send a human to the moon and back launched by President John F. Kennedy was the design of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency — commonly known as DARPA. Its relationship to the government bureaucracy, connection to Department of Defence procurement, and organizational structure all enabled it to work towards the breakthrough innovations that made the mission a success. Inspired by that we ask: how do we build, shape and hold the missions to address the kind of complex systemic challenges we have to face collectively today that are beyond the realm of technology alone?</p><p>Mission-oriented innovation is itself an emergent practice. Building on a theoretical background grounded in the industrial strategy and innovation systems literature, to date it has primarily been used by local and national governments seeking to address the grand challenges they face by taking a more proactive role in economies.</p><p>DML has been working to put a mission-oriented innovation approach front and centre in its work around various domains: Nature-based Solutions, Spatial Justice, Mental Wealth and other emerging ones. These missions fit within the broader mission of DML as an organisation, which we currently define as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs focuses on accelerating societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and positive interdependence. Our aim is to discover, design and develop the institutional ‘dark matter’ that supports a more democratic, distributed and sustainable future. Our daily work ranges from policy and regulation to finance and data, from governance and democratic participation to organisational culture and identity. To keep that transparent, we undertake open work in collaborative partnerships to discover and provoke alternative visions of the future, designing how they might look in practice, and experimenting in context to reveal how they could work and enable the necessary change.</blockquote><p>Mission-oriented innovation implies a few shifts,&nbsp;moving:</p><blockquote>○ from market ﬁxing to market shaping (rationale)<br>○ from incremental to transformational change (ambition)<br>○ from analysis to experimentation (approach)<br>○ from sectors to challenges (domain)<br>○ from independent to collaborative work (relationships)</blockquote><p>Innovation is central — but not necessarily technological innovation. It could be financial, legal, regulatory, institutional, democratic or cultural, which increases the importance of broad participation.</p><p>According to IIPP’s Missions: A Beginner’s Guide, here’s how to set good missions:</p><blockquote>1. Be bold and inspirational, with a clear narrative, high engagement and wide societal relevance.</blockquote><blockquote>2. Set a direction with clear, concrete targets that are measurable and time&nbsp;bound.</blockquote><blockquote>3. Be highly ambitious, requiring research and innovation, but with a credible chance of&nbsp;success.</blockquote><blockquote>4. Be cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral.</blockquote><blockquote>5. Drive multiple, bottom up solutions.</blockquote><p>However, there are big differences in between a government driving a mission that is technological, such as landing a human on the moon, VS when an organisation like DML works to drive a mission internally and with its collaborators. See below an emergent typology of missions; DM’s approach being closer to the last one described.</p>Source of the visual: <a href="https://twitter.com/RowanEConway">Rowan&nbsp;Conway</a><p>We recognize that a mission only deserves to be called as such when it has a clear directionality. As such, we have focused on our most advanced internal mission, which we are developing across and beyond each singular commission, contrat or grant, to make more legible how we are currently doing this work, what we are learning in the process, and how best we can move&nbsp;forward.</p> Our Nature-based Solutions Mission <p>Now, more than ever, we need to learn to collaborate in symbiosis with nature. Institutions are recognizing the urgency to advance this ambition, setting net-zero targets and announcing ambitious tree-planting and other nature restoration ambitions. But we are struggling to reach implementation. This is a multi-faceted problem and, amongst others, can be linked to the lack of funding, the disconnect between data and mapping or the complexity of turning policy into reality when confronted with land competition.</p> Mission framing <p>DML’s Natural Assets mission focuses on providing the infrastructure components for radical collective action to regenerate, enhance and scale natural or modified ecosystems for human and non-human thriving.</p>Urban landscapes — NbS<p>We are working collaboratively to identify strategic risks within the status quo and how to address them across landscapes (e.g. peatlands, urban nature, watersheds, rivers) through financial instruments and mechanisms; regulatory and outcomes frameworks; inclusive governance; asset management tools; and smart contracts.</p>Deep Code Innovations — NbS<p>We are now developing various proofs of possibilities with partners; amongst others, in Québec/ Canada, Scotland/ UK, Madrid/ Spain, Milan, Italy, and Sejong/ South Korea. For each project, various shared deep code innovations are being developed; we therefore work across verticals (mission, initiatives, etc.) as well as across horizontals (finance, regulation, etc.).</p>Proofs of possibilities being deployed across the NBS mission and deep code innovations. On the left, you find the categories of the deep code innovations (described in the previous visual), as well as which project is working to develop each of&nbsp;them.<p>This year, we will focus on building the technological data platforms and investment vehicles to start assembling the infrastructures for a thriving planet. This work will be advanced thanks to the considerable support we have received recently for Trees As Infrastructure (<a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">TreesAI</a>) from Morgan Stanley, Google.org, Climate-KIC and the World Economic&nbsp;Forum.</p>TreesAI Website<p>TreesAI is currently developing a transparent, verifiable financial platform to grow Nature-based Solutions for resilient cities. Through novel accounting and contracting models we value trees as assets, reorienting administrative procedures and attention toward the diverse environmental benefits and behaviours of urban&nbsp;forests.</p><p>The components of the TreesAI platform that will be tested could then also be adapted and applied either in support or another initiative in the same NbS mission, or to support another mission in a different context or&nbsp;region.</p><p>To read more about why municipalities are struggling to reach tree-planting targets, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">click here</a>.

Each of these stages has different types of activities involved in moving it forward. We are currently working to define them in more&nbsp;detail.  Community of practice — It requires a certain critical mass of projects and resources for a mission to sustain a community of practice. With enough experiments on the ground, it allows for the mission constituents to better benefit from peer-to-peer learning, mutual accountability, collective credibility, and shared capabilities that go beyond the impact of any single project. At the early stage of mission building, these multiple interactions can be burdensome. However, regular sharing around theory and framework can still be valuable.  Shared deep code innovations — Some of the deep code innovations that are being developed (across regulation, finance, contracts, etc.) can be adapted, bundled and implemented across various initiatives and missions, which raises the question of how our entire portfolio is linked and how we create lines of overlap and compound learning across the organization (see a very preliminary sketch of that&nbsp;below).  Preliminary framework partially representing DML’s cross-mission portfolio dashboard  Mission pollinators— We need people to translate and pollinate content across projects that sit together within a mission and/ or across other domains. Learning and adaptation across initiatives (for instance between our NbS mission projects Trees As Infrastructure and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/reconciliation-with-nature-starts-in-our-yards-7f7b71f7630c">Nouveaux voisins</a>)—at the level of strategic risks, co-benefits and other key questions —cannot be done without people actively working in both projects and with the necessary brain space to spot patterns.  Deep code pollinators— We also need people who are more specialized in one deep code innovation (e.g. finance and capital innovation, or risk &amp; contracting innovation) to work across various missions. They are able to spread and compound relevant learning across different domains that share similar deep code challenges.  Place-based anchors — Place-based cultural sensitivity, knowledge and networks are essential for a mission to be adapted and implemented in a new region. Working internationally requires us to find a balance between having some of our team members working across geographies, some anchored in local contexts, and also partnering with solid and complementary local stakeholders.  Mission wide funding — To actively craft a mission — creating spaces for sharing, compounded learning, and actively making the system visible — requires resource for a few people to take on the pollination, facilitation and sense-making activities. Since funding is normally provided at a project level, funding this cross-project connectivity is a challenge that we need to be proactive in addressing.  Towards civic-led missions — Organizationally and institutionally, we’re as deeply problematized by the monopoly power of state as we are by the monopoly of the private sector, which raises the question of how we can move to a mission that is fundamentally civic-led, beyond state and market actors, in a way that is legitimate and drives public&nbsp;good.  Emergent order — The framework and practices of how to organise in a mission-led approach depends on the actors involved and the resources available, and emerges over time. The current mission framework at DM, for instance, has been an emergent one that is still being defined organically as we go, driven by principles rather than by fixed structures.  Evolving roles — As with any emergent systems organising, as a mission grows the people building it shed roles and take on new ones to adapt to the emerging&nbsp;needs.

				  Machine-readable governance is the key to making decentralized identity accountable, effective, and trustworthy.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Much is talked, much is written about governance in decentralized identity. “Trust frameworks,” “trust marks,” “transitive trust” all form part of a lexicon that can be confusing to those looking to enter the field, develop a product or service, or find a simple solution to a problem. In part, this is because the word “governance” is used to cover a lot of ground, from corporate structure and network policy, to responsibilities, values, policies, and legal agreements. Corporate and technical governance can overlap to the point where it’s easy to end up thinking that governance is a problem that needs to be solved before we can use the technology.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why this isn’t true. From a design perspective, it’s impossible to lay out all the rules of an information ecosystem in advance, and unwise to try and do so, given that an ecosystem must be able to grow organically to become an ecosystem. The architecture of decentralized identity has clear and simple constants defining its essence: privacy by design, security by design, permanent and portable identity for everyone and everything. The key to sustainable innovation is to combine these constants with flexible parameters. This allows a simple set of rules to generate an infinite number of variations. If all these varieties are interoperable, we end up with a network of networks.</p>
<p>All of this is not to understate the value of paperwork—and the need for common agreement around issues like interoperability. Mars will need a constitution—and a great one. But we must get there first.</p>
<p>Machine-readable governance enabled by Agents<br>
The thing is, we have a way to enable clear, flexible, governance right now through Agents and machine-readable governance. Agents are the software that allow data to be shared and authenticated by consent between parties, and this makes them the most important governance entities in decentralized identity. That’s because they are programmable with governance rules that define how digital information can be accepted, exchanged, verified, updated, and revoked. They enable people and organizations to trust an exchanged credential.</p>
<p>When Indicio deployed its decentralized ecosystem for a pilot on digital COVID credentials in Aruba (the ecosystem is now called <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a> and is a project of Linux Foundation Public Health), Agents containing machine readable governance made the whole system work:</p>
 
 Tourists downloaded a “digital wallet” agent to accept a COVID test credential 
 The COVID testing lab used an agent to issue a test credential 
 The government used an agent to verify the test credential and then issue a proof-of-test credential to the tourist. 
 Hospitality businesses across the island used downloadable verifier agents to scan and verify the government issued credential when the tourists showed up 
 
<p>Machine-readable governance allowed the government to implement its COVID test policies quickly within an architecture for privacy-preserving technology. People knew what was needed. People knew that changes could be quickly dialed into the governance if information changed. And above all, people knew who to trust. Instead of starting with top-down rules, the combination of Agents and machine-readable governance enabled bottom up governance to get the job done.</p>
<p>Start local, scale global<br>
This is a critically important point. While decentralized identity is a new and unfamiliar concept to many people, most have an intuitive grasp of decentralized governance. In politics, it is synonymous with the view that local knowledge will drive better governance for the governed than a decision taken far away; in the European Union, this is the principle of subsidiarity: Power should be exercised as close to the citizen as possible.</p>
<p>When it comes to decentralized identity, this is why figuring out what works at the local or hyperlocal level becomes a powerful source of trust. Because specific, local knowledge is essential to building transparent, competent, and reliable solutions—the three distinguishing features of trustworthiness, according to philosopher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PNX6M_dVsk">Onora O’Neill</a>—the technology is more likely to be trusted and adopted when it can incorporate specific, local knowledge.</p>
<p>When we have learned what works to solve a myriad of local problems, we can then scale up to governance at a global level. The governance frameworks created as we deploy these solutions are not going to be mutually exclusive; but the search for one framework to rule them all now is likely to be fruitless at best and a hindrance at worst.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to focus on maximal privacy through minimal rules, and let the interplay of agents and machine-readable governance handle all the pre-existing, national, international, sector-specific, and institutional governance frameworks that will need to be accommodated as decentralized identity expands across the globe.</p>

Darkwah</a> &amp; <a href="http://anyidoho.me/profile">Nana Akua Anyidoho</a>, <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">University of&nbsp;Ghana</a></p>Ads for Glovo (food delivery) and Bolt (ride-hailing) services in Accra. Photo-credit: Nana Akua Anyidoho &amp; Akosua K.&nbsp;Darkwah)<p>Over the course of 2021, the University of Ghana and Caribou Digital, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, will undertake a study to understand the impact of COVID-19 on young women’s experiences working and selling through online platforms in&nbsp;Ghana.</p><p>Women in Ghana have a long history of participation in the economy as workers and owners of enterprises. Therefore, the nature of Ghanaian women’s work, including the extent to which it is empowering, has long been of interest to researchers. With the increasing digitization of work, more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, questions about the content and impact of women’s work have gained more urgency. This background informs our study of women’s platform livelihoods in Ghana, using a female empowerment approach. The study also builds on previous work on platform livelihoods by both Caribou Digital and researchers at the University of&nbsp;Ghana.</p> An Overview of Ghana’s Digital&nbsp;Economy <p>Ghana’s mobile phone and internet penetration rates are 140% and 66.8% respectively, and its social media rate is 23%. On the African continent, Ghana ranks third in private sector digital platforms after Nigeria and South Africa; it has a total of 72 platforms, 42% of which are local in origin. Ghana’s ranking on the UN’s E-Government Index (EGDI) score is also impressive. The EGDI is a weighted average of normalized scores of three dimensions of e-government, specifically the scope and quality of online services, the extent of development of telecommunication infrastructure and the inherent human capital. In a 2018 survey, Ghana was the only African country to transition from a middle-level to a high-level EGDI.</p><p>Ghana’s achievement on these indices can be partly attributed to a range of government policies aimed at improving the e-print of the country over the last decade and a half. Among these <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/govt-launches-digital-platforms-for-business-transactions.html">policy initiatives</a> is the National ICT for Accelerated Development Policy designed to promote the participation of young people in Ghana in the global digital economy. The government has also rolled out training programs to provide young people with skills to participate in the gig economy. One such initiative, the <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/gov-t-recruits-3-000-persons-under-digital-marketing-and-entrepreneurship-programme.html">Digital Marketing and Entrepreneurship Program</a>, offered a three-month training course for 3000 young people who were then to be absorbed by Ecobank, a Pan-African financial company. In the <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/ghana-news-migration-to-digital-economy-still-on-course-veep.html">digital transformation of public services</a>, such as in the renewal of national health insurance, the government itself offers a source of employment for young people with digital&nbsp;skills.</p><p>There are also non-state actors that support young people interested in digital technology. A pioneer in this respect is <a href="http://www.meltwater.org/">Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST)</a>, which was set up in 2008 to provide training, mentoring and financial support to potential tech entrepreneurs. More recent examples include <a href="http://www.ispacegh.com/">iSpace Ghana</a> which received an award from Google in recognition of its diversity and inclusion programming. Many of these training organizations are, however, located in Accra, <a href="https://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/412821598381054828/Ghana-DE4A-LOW-Res.pdf">limiting opportunities</a> for individuals living outside the capital. The city is also the site of the <a href="https://www.moc.gov.gh/accra-digital-centre">Accra Digital Centre</a>, a technology park, and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/14/africa/google-ai-center-accra-intl/index.html">Google’s first AI centre</a> on the continent.</p><p>While a <a href="https://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/412821598381054828/Ghana-DE4A-LOW-Res.pdf">2019 World Bank Group report</a> describes Ghana as an average performer in terms of global entrepreneurship and innovation, some of its digital companies have gained global recognition, including mPedigree, mPharma, Logicel, Rancard Solutions and SoftTribe, the last of which is owned by Herman Chinery-Hesse, a man who has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/26/new-africa-ghana-software-chinery-hesse">called Africa’s Bill Gates.</a> Currently, there are 96 active digital commerce platforms in Ghana, <a href="http://access.i2ifacility.org/Digital_platforms/">about half (53) of which are of African origin</a>. The <a href="http://access.i2ifacility.org/Digital_platforms/">most common</a> of these are freelancing platforms and rental platforms such as Airbnb. Indigenous platforms that have made an imprint on the landscape include <a href="http://www.esoko.com/">Esoko</a> which started as a service to provide content support to farmers. There are also a range of E-commerce shops, some of which are businesses designed entirely with digital platforms in mind, such as <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/innovative-business-models-in-covid-19-era.html">Wear Ghana</a>, and others as <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/melcom-launches-online-shop.html">additions to traditional stores</a>. Since the pandemic, some businesses are organizing webinars that allow them to operate in a safe manner andalso harness skills and knowledge worldwide. An example is the <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/ghana-s-agribusiness-industry-to-benefit-from-macfrut-s-virtual-trade-fair.html">virtual trade fair</a>,organized for the fruits and vegetable industry.</p><p>The country has a fairly robust electronic payment infrastructure to support online commerce. By 2017 estimates, mobile money transactions are used primarily for remittances (43%), payment of utility bills (8%) and wages (7%). Nonetheless, close to 99% of transactions still involve cash, although the pandemic led to an increase in cashless financial transactions, with a <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/covid-19-spurs-growth-in-mobile-money.html">50% growth</a> in the amount of money sitting on mobile accounts between June 2019 and June 2020. The availability of mobile money transactions has encouraged the development of other services such as <a href="http://www.peoplepensiontrust.com/">micro-insurance</a> for low-income earners in the informal&nbsp;economy.</p> Who is engaged in platform livelihoods in&nbsp;Ghana? <p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">Platform livelihoods</a> are “active human efforts, sometimes combined with tools or assets, deployed to create value outside of the constructs of a stable employer-employee relationship, mediated by the infrastructure and accompanying logic of digital platforms”. Platform livelihoods are made up of platform work (e.g. Glovo food delivery or working on Upwork.com) and platform&nbsp;sales.</p><p><a href="https://researchictafrica.net/%20after-access_the-state-of-microwork-in-africa/">A study</a> by Research ICT Africa in Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa suggests that, in general, people with university education are not attracted to platform livelihoods because of lower earnings relative to other work opportunities available to them. However, this depends on labour market conditions in individual countries. Even in Ghana where platforms are dominated by workers and sellers with secondary education, it may be seen as a viable livelihood opportunity even by university graduates. <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/68716/">One study</a> describes a young Ghanaian graduate who quit his job to work fulltime for Upwork.com, a freelancing platform. While he earned a higher income than he might have in non-platform employment, he reported working 48 hours without sleep to complete a task on time, mindful that client endorsements could greatly undermine his future work&nbsp;options.</p><p>Although the number of individuals involved in platform work in Ghana is fairly low, women are well-represented in this form of employment. We do not have sex-segregated data across the different forms of platform livelihoods in Ghana, but there are some statistics that give us some indication from studies of specific forms of platform livelihoods. The<a href="https://researchictafrica.net/%20after-access_the-state-of-microwork-in-africa/"> survey by Research ICT Africa</a> in seven countries in Africa estimates that 2% of Ghana’s population is involved in platform work and, further, that slightly more women (2.1%) are involved than men (1.9%). However, men and women tend to be engaged in different forms of platform livelihoods. Uber is a good example of this phenomenon. The company<a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/accra-becomes-city-467-next-smart-african-city-to-offer-uber.html"> set up shop in Accra in June 2016 </a>and <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/uber-extends-services-to-kumasi.html">extended its operation</a> in 2017 to Kumasi, the second largest city. By 2018, it had registered <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/uber-partner-drivers-in-accra-hits-over-3-000.html">over 3,000 driver partners</a> on its platform. Although the company publicly declared its commitment to <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/uber-to-engage-1-million-female-drivers.html">recruiting female driver partners, </a>its driver partners remain almost exclusively male.</p><p>The few existing research on platform livelihoods in Africa indicate it is a sector dominated by young people. We do not have the statistics to confirm this for Ghana, young people are often the target of various initiatives by the state, business owners and development partners to improve young people’s access to platform work. With funding from the Mastercard Foundation and Solidaridad, the Springboard Road Show Foundation is running a <a href="https://core.com.gh/">Coronavirus Recovery and Resilience Program (CoRE</a>). This program offers young people a guide to sustainable livelihoods in a post-pandemic world. Others have gone a step further to support women to set up online businesses. For instance, The Mastercard Foundation, through its Young Africa Works program, has partnered with the Ghana Enterprise Agency and Lokko House to set up an <a href="https://www.businessghana.com/site/news/Business/235441/Ghanaian-women-owned-enterprises-to-benefit-from-Retail-and-Online-marketplace">online retail shop</a> that will enable women-owned and -led enterprises to promote their products and connect with customers internationally.</p> Researching Gender and/in Platform Livelihoods <p>Despite their participation in the sector, Ghanaian young women’s experiences of platform livelihoods and its implications for their lives is an underexplored subject. Our study will examine the extent to which participation in platform livelihoods empower Ghanaian women. It will also explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women’s participation in platform work and sales. The focus will be on young women aged between 18 and 35 years living in urban communities where the digital infrastructure is fairly well developed. What are women’s experiences of working on platforms? How has this changed in the wake of the global pandemic? Above all, what are the enabling and constraining factors for meaningful and dignified work for female platform workers and sellers in Ghana? Specifically, how successful are policy and programmatic initiatives in boosting young women’s participation in this sector and also ensuring that their experiences are empowering.</p><p>In order to ask these questions, we will use a mixed methods approach. In addition to content analysis of online newspapers, we will employ a range of qualitative methods including expert interviews, in depth interviews, and focus group discussions with young female platform workers and sellers. We will also survey young women performing platform work across different segments.</p><p>We will adopt participatory video storytelling as part of the research methods, to allow us to dig deeper into the lived experiences of select female workers. We will provide them with the tools (a phone, video training and mentoring) to tell their story in their own words. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">See our previous participatory video storytelling work&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>We are looking forward to this research and would welcome any feedback at anyidoho@ug.edu.gh and adarkwah@ug.edu.gh.

<p>You need to move money, but with that comes risk. How do you know a customer has enough funds available in their account? The answer: balance checks. With balance checks, you can guarantee that a customer has sufficient funds to facilitate confident money movement. And with live balance checks, you can get the most accurate, most up-to-date account information. Let’s dig deeper into how that works.</p>
 What Are Balance Checks? 
<p>Many payment solutions rely on balance checks to ensure that an account has the funds necessary to make a payment. For card payments, this comes in the form of a network authorization. For ACH transfers, balance checks help mitigate financial risks like payment failures, overdraft fees, and NSF fees, all of which can happen if an account holder tries to move money they don’t have.&nbsp;</p>
 Why Implement Balance Checks? 
<p>Balance checks deliver visibility into a customer’s bank account balance so payment facilitators can move money confidently and mitigate risk. Implementing balance checks into your workflow can produce benefits like:<br>
</p>
 
 Streamlined payment experiences 
 Reduced <a href="https://www.finicity.com/what-is-ach-6-fundamentals-to-get-you-started/">ACH payment</a> errors 
 Higher rate of payment success 
 Mitigate money lost due to payment failures 
 Better decision-making thanks to more accurate, up-to-date data 
 Improved consumer experience with fewer fees and more successful payments<br>
 
 
<p>Altogether, balance checks help payment facilitators build better experiences for consumers that in turn yield better business outcomes.</p>
 How Finicity Enables Live Balance Checks for Streamlined, Lower-risk Account Funding 
<p>As part of our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">Finicity Pay</a> solution set, we offer several balance check options so that payment facilitators can enhance the payment experience and move money confidently. Some balance checks are cached, meaning that you receive lightning fast account balance data with timestamps. For the greatest accuracy, live balance checks deliver real-time, instant balance information at the moment of the request. This might be ideal for higher value or riskier payments.</p>
<p>Our live balance call delivers real-time balance information (both cleared balance and available balance) complete with time stamps directly from a consumer’s financial institution. And thanks to the speed of our high-quality data connections, you can get that important balance information in seconds.</p>
<p>For use cases that may not require a live balance check, we also offer balance checks that occur throughout the day at regular intervals so you can retrieve lightning fast results.</p>
<p>These balance check solutions rely on our open banking platform, which is founded on secure data connections that ensure a seamless, low-friction experience, and consumers permissioning their data for their use. At Finicity, we empower the consumer to benefit from their financial data. That means they remain in control of their data and get a trustworthy experience.</p>

 GiD Report#169 — It’s all about&nbsp;creators <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-168-the-plan-to-boost-american-competition-f898ba11f818">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  It’s all about&nbsp;creators  Facebook gets it, but they’re playing&nbsp;catchup  What’s up with&nbsp;Discord?  Chart of the&nbsp;week  More Facebook&nbsp;clones  Stuff happens   1. It’s all about&nbsp;creators Tech YouTuber Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips, Photo: Linus Media&nbsp;Group<p>And when it comes to the creator economy, it’s about tools, not the actual influencers.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/technology/content-creators-venture-capital.html">the&nbsp;NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>The creator economy, which provides digital tools to influencers and helps them run their businesses, is a huge, largely unexplored market. The venture capital firm SignalFire estimates that 50 million people around the world consider themselves content creators, while the technology news site The Information estimates that venture capital firms have invested $2 billion into 50 creator-focused start-ups so far this&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Subscription services like OnlyFans and Patreon, where fans pay creators for access to premium content, also helped investors realize there was a strong business case for building tools for creators. Now the word “creator” has become a buzzword, appended to all types of businesses to attract investors. So much so that Alexander Finden, a tech entrepreneur, coined the term “creator washing.”</blockquote><blockquote>“There are more creator economy start-ups than creators,” Turner Novak, founder of Banana Capital, which invests in early-stage tech start-ups, joked on Twitter in&nbsp;April.</blockquote><p>It’s never been easier to be a creator — from content creation to discovery and distribution to monetization. The next big phase though will be all about giving creators better and direct access to their trusted communities and giving them ultimate control of their creations.</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/technology/content-creators-venture-capital.html">Hello, Content Creators. Silicon Valley’s Investors Want to Meet&nbsp;You.</a>   2. Facebook gets it, but they’re playing&nbsp;catchup <p><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22577734/facebook-1-billion-youtube-creators-zuckerberg-mr-beast">Here’s Vox</a> on Facebook’s concerted effort to attract (and pay) creators:</p><blockquote>Facebook has nearly 2.9 billion users, so lots of people use Facebook to reach that giant audience. But Facebook wants even more people posting more stuff on its platforms, so it’s going to pay out $1 billion by the end of 2022 to encourage creators — people who make internet content for fun and profit but generally aren’t running full-fledged media companies — to make stuff for Facebook and Instagram. The impetus here is clear: Facebook wants more engaging stuff on its apps, and it’s also trying to compete with the likes of TikTok, Snapchat, and&nbsp;YouTube.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>But it’s worth noting that there’s a meaningful difference between Facebook’s newest gambit and the one that Google’s YouTube has been using to great success: Facebook, for now, is giving creators a lot less&nbsp;money.</blockquote><blockquote>When you make stuff for YouTube, you get a chance to make money the same way YouTube makes money — from ads that run next to the videos you upload to YouTube. At Facebook, though, there are two different pools of money: One is generated by ads connected to the videos and photos you post on Facebook, and the other is generated by ads everywhere else on Facebook. The first pool is the one that Facebook’s creators can access. The other one is really, really, big. And that’s the one Facebook is keeping all for&nbsp;itself.</blockquote><blockquote>This is one of those that’s a little easier to understand with visual aids. So: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtFrxDUV6c">Here’s a YouTube video by Mr. Beast</a>, the site’s most popular creator. YouTube gets paid for the ads that run before and during the clip, and Jimmy Donaldson, the 23-year-old behind Mr. Beast, gets 55 percent of the revenue those ads generate.</blockquote><blockquote>YouTube can also make money other ways, like selling banner ads on its homepage. But the vast majority of its money comes from ads attached directly to the videos it shows to more than 2 billion people every month. So YouTube is directly aligned with the people who generate the stuff that powers&nbsp;YouTube.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Which means there’s a real money gap for creators who thrive on Facebook versus those on YouTube; it’s why top YouTube creators like Donaldson stick with YouTube instead of trying to branch out onto other platforms. And it’s why YouTube says it paid out $30 billion to its content partners over the last three&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p>So while Facebook has users and communities, that lack of alignment will continue to hurt its ability to attract top creators to its platform.</p>  <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22577734/facebook-1-billion-youtube-creators-zuckerberg-mr-beast">Facebook wants creators, but YouTube is paying creators much, much&nbsp;more</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html">Inside Facebook’s Data&nbsp;Wars</a>   3. What’s up with&nbsp;Discord? <p>It’s not all about advertising though — a line Discord has stuck&nbsp;with.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401">Here’s the&nbsp;WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>Discord nearly tripled its revenue last year solely by selling subscription access to exclusive perks for users. By contrast, the companies behind other free online hangouts — including Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Snap Inc. — primarily sell targeted ads built around sharing users’ personal information.</blockquote><blockquote>In an interview, Discord co-founder and CEO Jason Citron, 36 years old, said the company has balked at the advertising model favored by its peers because ads would be too intrusive. People use Discord to hold conversations in real time, he said, as opposed to passively reading, making or commenting on posts. He also said he thinks that consumers in general dislike ads and don’t want their data shared with&nbsp;brands.</blockquote><blockquote>“We really believe we can build products that make Discord more fun and that people will pay for them. It keeps our incentives aligned,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Again with the aligned incentives.</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401">What Is Everybody Doing on&nbsp;Discord?</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/discord-buys-sentropy/">Discord buys Sentropy, which makes AI software that fights online harassment — TechCrunch</a>   4.

Gerald Horst, PwC’s Digital Identity team leader in EMEA, is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4602" title="Modernizing the Customer Journey">Modernizing the Customer Journey</a> at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Gerald some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>Why is there an increasing interest in digital transformation and how has the pandemic impacted digital transformation projects?</p>
<p>
Well, every year, PWC surveys CEOs across the globe about their strategic priorities in this “new normal”. This year, actually more than 5,000 CEOs, which is more than ever before, responded, and by the way, half of them were our CEOs from Europe. And first of all, we found out, most of them are very positive about the economy and the business outlook for their respective firms. And almost half of them are investing with double digit numbers in digital transformation, especially since most of these companies started their transformation efforts due to the pandemic. By the way, digital transformation, we defined it as any large-scale change to the way a company operates their business, and that is supported by the development of an enabling technology. So, why are companies investing in digital transformation? </p>
<p>We learned from the investigation that -and many of them are already on a transformation journey - that they are hoping to realize different benefits in two years from now, including cost savings, revenue growth, product innovation, product enhancement, gathering data and improving their decision-making. But what is apparent is that the organizations want to transform to make the best of technology advantages. There is lot changing: AI, 5G, and they want to use digital to enhance the customer experience, provide a more competitive set of products and services to their customers, generate data and improve, their offering by creating customer insights and really acting upon the information they have at hand.  
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are companies doing right when transforming successfully?</p>
<p>
It's interesting because we also wanted to know by surveying companies and understanding their digital transformation who actually the winner are. And winning means growing in a disruptive market, achieving the objectives that they set out for themselves at the beginning of the transformation, and we asked them specifically about what the success factors are. And we got over 500 responses from CEOs, and there were five key things: First and foremost, is that the winning companies actually put [the] customer at the center of the transformation. They really, really relentlessly focus on the customer experience. They know their customers very well and they understand the customer needs and behaviors. </p>
<p>Secondly, they also understand that trust is a key market differentiator. So a winning companies have a clear purpose in life, and they keep the promises to their customers and to their employees.  </p>
<p>Thirdly, the winning companies are the ones that are investing in enterprise-wide process and data capabilities. They connect from front-end with back-end. They secure their critical infrastructure and enable all that through key technology implementations. And this is probably one of the most difficult tasks because doing company-wide activities [and] going after a company wide objective, requires companies to really break down the silos. Both functional and political. So that's all about stakeholder management. </p>
<p>Fourthly it's about leadership. I mean, CEOs who sponsor digital transformations, they need to play an active role in the transformation and they should not delegate. And then last but not least, of course, the role of technology. We must acknowledge that as much as technology is supporting the vision, it is also the ability to differentiate themselves by using that technology well. Like I said, much focus is on AI and 5G, yet winning companies have more focus on technologies that enable the digital experience for both their customers and their employees than to focus on technologies that drive efficiencies and savings.  
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Given that there is increased investment in driving online business, why is Consumer Identity &amp; Access Management a critical success factor in any digital transformation?</p>
<p>
So, like I said, companies that are going through a digital transformation and who actually are the “winning” companies, they put the customer in the center. Relentless focus on customer behavior [and] on customer needs. If you're in an industry, you know what customer identity and Customer Identity and Access Management is all about. Companies that are successful in transforming, are clearly looking for a common set of factors when they select technologies: ease of use and faster processes are considered the most important attributes to encourage adoption of technologies by customers, and [that] makes them the most essential features to get really right upfront. And implementing Customer Identity and Access Management is providing exactly that, and moreover, it optimizes security and privacy capabilities, which is adding to the trust factor. Like I said before, trust is a competitive factor, and this brings us to the topic of Zero Trust.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is the relevance/value of a Zero Trust approach to security in this context?</p>
<p>
Well, identity really is the new parameter. If you look at it from a customer's perspective, I was doing business online, but also it's the new parameter from an organization's perspective that is securing its business. It has been investigated that by 2023, I believe 75% of security failures will result from inadequate management of identity. So access and privileges. This is growing. I mean, we can see a staggering amount of hacks, attacks etc. happening every day. We are learning fast from many breaches that cyber-crime has actually become an industry, and the breaches are mostly the direct result of weak or compromised access and identity management processes. So I've discussed the topic of Zero Trust over the past year quite a few times in webinars. It's what actually stands for “trust nobody”[or trust] nothing [that] comes from both internal and external networks. So from this, identity is the new parameter. We need to verify the identity of the requester before granting access – [that] is clear. And we need to make sure that any access provided is compliant with rules regulations.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How should organizations go about balancing user experience, cost, and security requirements?</p>
<p>
Right, now we know from experience, that our clients need to find the correct balance between customer experience, security, and costs when they are transforming the front end and when they're introducing consumer identity and access management solutions. This needs to involve a lot of stakeholders, ranging from financial, to IT, to marketing, to compliance and security. And as such, you need to really break down those silos in organizations. Functional [and] political silos, to get them all aligned, and to enable their company-wide transformation. And this means that you have to work on having a common vocabulary and have the stakeholders understand each other. For that purpose, we at PWC, we really looked at this at this challenge and we developed over the past two years a customer identity game, which is a form of a gamification that is very innovative and accelerates the start and the facilitation of the identity programs that we are doing with our clients and the technology implementation that come from it. And by playing games with our stakeholders, they do actually come to this common vocabulary, and they really understand each other. They understand the role of digital identity and the strategy they have to automate related [to] onboarding as an example, much faster than before. And the design and implementation of solutions is also much done, much more effectively and playing games is fun.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What types or organizations are leading successful projects in terms of integrating marketing, CRM, and CIAM?</p>
<p>
Well, I mean, my answer would say that all business to consumer companies are adapting to changing customer and market conditions. So, they are really implementing consumer identity and access management programs. They're integrating it - well, they're implementing CRM solutions, whether they're integrating or not, that's I think a little bit further down the road. But of course, you've seen that in financial services, and also in retail, but especially in financial services, banks, insurance companies, they have been implementing Consumer Identity and Access Management way before others due to competitive pressures, but also [due] to [the] compliance needs they have.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you see CIAM becoming increasingly important in future for online business models?</p>
<p>
Well, absolutely. I think, you know, like I said before, what you see is that companies are going through digital transformations for a number of reasons, that the companies that are actually doing that successfully, need to put the customer in the center of that transformation.  </p>
<p>They need to understand what their customer actually needs. It's all about ease of use, it's about building trust. It's about automating processes and making it agile and speeding up those processes. So yes, CIAM is going to be increasingly important for that, because basically that's what CIAM is offering. It's, it's offering ease of use, it's offering faster processes, it's offering trust by means of security and privacy capabilities. Yes, so I do believe that CIAM is increasingly gaining importance. It actually is a critical success factor for any digital transformation that is going to be successful.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you think this will be influenced by that fact that platforms like Salesforce and ServiceNow are increasingly taking over Identity &amp; Access processes?</p>
<p>
Yes, of course. Clearly, platforms like Salesforce and ServiceNow that you mentioned are increasingly supporting clients to transform their businesses into online business models, which is why these providers themselves also are offering wider and deeper IAM and CIAM capabilities than ever before. And as PWC, we have both, you know, both these platform teams and skills, and we have these identity teams and skills in house. We get more questions from clients that are utilizing Salesforce platforms, for example. And they ask us to investigate whether a CIAM from Salesforce can actually deliver the ROI that they are looking for.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can attendees of EIC expect in your presentation?</p>
<p>
I look very much forward to being a Munich. I hope that it will be a physical event and I really hope to present [on site] and I look forward to that. I will, in my presentation, make clear that implementing powerful Customer Identity and Access Management and integrating marketing and Customer Relationship Management functions with Customer Identity and Access Management, if done well, of course, is [a] critical success factor for any digital transformation. And it will help business owners achieve the ROI that they're looking for. I will also share how to get there in terms of an effective way to implement CIAM and integrate a CRM. And especially I will focus on how to break down those silos, those functional and political silos - bring stakeholders together, manage their expectations, keep them aligned. And thirdly, I will discuss a very interesting client case, basically to clarify my messages, all that in 20 minutes, making identity matter, together with PWC. I look forward to it. Thank you. </p>
