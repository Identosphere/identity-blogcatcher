  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p>Identity and Access Governance as a core part of IGA is one of the key technologies within IAM for any organization. This is due to the massive impact of security and governance risks arising due to issues in managing access controls such as over-entitlements and gaps in enforcing the least privilege principle, Segregation of Duties (SoD) violations, and access governance controls. There are several access-related security risks in today’s organizations that have a direct impact on business, including but not limited to, intellectual property theft, business fraud in ERP systems including SOD conflicts and other policy violations, reputational damage due to the loss of customer information and privacy-related data, and many more. Thus, an adequate access governance framework is essential for organizations dealing with continually changing paradigms of security and risk management.

  Thales adopts the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles

Wed, 01/15/2025 - 09:00


            <p>Thales reaffirms its commitment to gender equality and diversity by signing up to the 7 “<a href="https://www.weps.org/">Women’s Empowerment Principles</a>” established by the United Nations Global Compact and UN Women, to promote women’s roles in the business world and ensure gender equality.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We must continue to encourage more women to pursue careers in science and mathematics – starting at an early age – to provide them with the same career opportunities as men and enable them to thrive in a safe and inclusive working environment. Thales has made encouraging progress, but we need to accelerate our efforts to achieve gender equality at all levels,” said Patrice Caine, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer of Thales.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since 2017, Thales has implemented a Gender Diversity Action Plan to accelerate the recruitment of women across all its professions, support their development through dedicated mentoring programmes, and enhance their promotion to the highest levels of responsibility while increasing their representation on Management Committees.</p>
<p>By the end of 2023, women held 20.4% of leadership positions at Thales, compared to 16.5% in 2018. In parallel, 86.8% of the company’s Management Committees included at least three women, up from 49% in 2018.</p>
<p>The company’s target for 2026 is to have 22.5% of leadership roles filled by women and at least 75% of Management Committees comprising at least four women. For more information on Thales's initiatives supporting gender equality and diversity, please consult <a href="https://www2.thalesgroup.com/2024/rapport-integre/index-en.html">the 2023-2024 Integrated Report.</a></p>

  <p>The Identity Fabric paradigm has established as the guiding principle for building modern Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) infrastructures. Since the introduction by KuppingerCole Analysts more than five years ago, many organizations have adopted this concept to streamline their IAM architecture, portfolio, and investments. With the newest release of the Identity Fabric, KuppingerCole Analysts provides an updated framework that not only reflects the evolution of IAM with respect to supported identity types and technologies, but also provides additional perspectives and layers to help organizations shape their own Identity Fabric for human and non-human identities. The Reference Architecture as second major framework of KuppingerCole Analysts adds more detail to the Identity fabric by going more into detail on IAM.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look back at the evolution of the Identity Fabric and provide insights into the guiding principles of the Identity Fabric, serving both as a fabric producing identity services and a mesh connecting different elements within the IAM infrastructure of organizations.</p>
<p>Dr. Phillip Messerschmidt, Lead Advisor at KuppingerCole Analysts, will dive deeper into the most recent versions of the Identity Fabric and the Reference Architecture, providing insights into what is new, why we’ve added and changed certain elements, and how this helps organizations on their IAM journey. He also will elaborate on why and how the Identity Fabric and the Reference Architecture help future-proofing your Identity Security environment.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-proofing-your-iam"></a>

				  One of the key benefits of Verifiable Credentials is the time savings from reduction in repetitive, manual data entry. Here we will examine just how much time can be saved by using decentralized identity to automatically fill in information for us.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Tim Spring</p>
<p>The time cost of forms</p>
<p>How many hours a year do you spend filling out forms? While it might seem like an annoyance that comes up every now and then, the <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/">US Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center</a> released a report in 2022 that found that the government has <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Government-Digitization-Transforming-Government-to-Better-Serve-Americans.pdf">9,881 unique forms</a>, which took an estimated 10.3 billion hours to complete.</p>
<p>And these numbers are only increasing, if you use the tool provided by the <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAReport?operation=11">Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs</a> and apply it to 2024 numbers, you can see that we are up to almost 12.3 billion hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are five stand out departments with the most forms and impact. 2022 numbers provided by the <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/">US Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center</a> report:</p>
<p>Department of the Treasury: 1,838 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services 1,242 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Agriculture 553 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Commerce 437 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Federal Communications Commission 436 forms</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why there is so much paperwork to see a doctor? Or why you need to fill it in every time? It could have something to do with the 1,242 federal forms that the hospital or clinic will need to fill out to comply with the department of Health and Human services, not to mention updating your own charts and patient data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accuracy and user experience improvement</p>
<p>What we could all benefit from is a way to create authenticated data once and reuse it often —&nbsp; instantly, conveniently, with the touch of a button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is where Verifiable Credentials come to the rescue, the thing that will make you say “why haven’t we been doing this before?” Verifiable credentials can store any authenticated data (and especially personal data) in a tamper-proof way and allow the user to share it without the need for the verifier to check in with the source. Think of your web browser’s autofill function that remembers your name, email address, phone number, etc, but for the real world. These credentials can store any information that could be on that doctor’s form, such as height, eye color, name, address, or medical history, and share it accurately, instantly. Which is particularly handy because if you need a doctor, you’re probably not in the mood to do paperwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The usefulness grows exponentially when you take a look at what this technology can do for organizations. An <a href="https://www.aha.org/">American Hospital Association</a> survey found that there are 6,120 hospitals in the United States, and between them had admitted <a href="https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals">33,679,935 patients</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud reduction</p>
<p>Aside from the time saved from not having to manually enter all this patient data, businesses can benefit in the form of eliminating human error and reducing fraud. If you have almost 33.7 million forms to fill out annually, there are going to be some errors or fraudulent information, which often take time and money to correct. By sharing pre-authenticated data digitally (which is what is inside a Verifiable Credential) you can instantly trust the data and use it however you need, such as verifying a patient’s identity and medical history to begin treatment. This technology also enables biometric patient check-in, which reduces fraud (getting treated under someone else’s name) or giving the incorrect medications due to not reliably identifying the patient as they leave the waiting room for treatment.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials have already seen traction in several industries for their ability to fast-track processes. An excellent example of this is in airports and travel, where their authenticated data can be used for pre-authorization for each traveler and leads to significantly faster international border and border crossing. To learn more about this use case you can read a <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/">recent article from Indicio.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one enjoys paperwork, it is a necessary part of life, but it doesn’t need to be such a big part.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Osman Celik</a></p>Organizations of all sizes, from small businesses to large enterprises and government agencies, are responsible for managing complex networks. These networks often include a combination of on-premises infrastructure, cloud services, and hybrid environments, which can make them more challenging to monitor and secure. For these organizations, ensuring network performance is critical for maintaining business operations and for detecting and responding to potential security threats. Failing to monitor and analyze network traffic can lead to undetected performance issues, bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities. The growing use of encryption at the network layer, while necessary for protecting sensitive data, presents additional challenges for network visibility and security. This is particularly concerning as emerging cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and zero-day exploits, continue to evolve and target network infrastructures. Additionally, organizations must navigate a stringent regulatory environment, where compliance with data privacy and security standards is mandatory. Failure to comply with these regulations not only increases the risk of penalties but also exposes the organization to reputational damage. Today, the majority of organizations rely on firewalls, security information and event management (SIEM), and endpoint protection detection and response (EPDR) tools to prevent threats from accessing the network. However, in many cases, these solutions are inadequate in one or more of the following areas.

<p>La información verificable está transformando rápidamente el panorama de la tecnología Web3.  En <a href="https://extrimian.io/es/contactenos/" title="Extrimian">Extrimian</a> creemos que 2025 será un año clave para potenciar ecosistemas digitales seguros, eficientes e interoperables. Aquí te compartimos 5 tendencias clave para este año:</p>



 1. Ecosistemas integrados con identidades verificables 



<p>Imagina a un estudiante universitario que utiliza su credencial digital emitida por su institución para acceder a una cuenta fintech, contratar un seguro médico, alquilar una vivienda de confianza, resolver situaciones académicas y disfrutar de beneficios exclusivos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Esta interoperabilidad ya es una realidad gracias a soluciones basadas en SSI, como IDConnect de Extrimian, que resuelven problemas de identidad y verificación al conectar múltiples verticales en un solo ecosistema. Durante este año, veremos más adopción, más atracción y mayor sinergia entre actores e industrias.</p>







 2. IA como motor para la eficiencia 



<p>En 2025 los frameworks con inteligencia artificial revolucionarán la gestión de la identidad digital.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Not with a bang but a whimper&nbsp; 
<p>The department said it was alerted to the <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/remote-support-saas-service-security-investigation">incident</a> on December 8th by BeyondTrust, an identity security services provider that offers remote technical support to Treasury employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that the breach originated within BeyondTrust's systems, where attackers infiltrated some of the company's Remote Support SaaS instances by making use of a compromised Remote Support SaaS API key. As a result, the attackers were able to bypass the service's security and access employee workstations and unclassified documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 6th, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-update-treasury-breach">announced</a> that there was no indication that the cyberattack had affected other federal agencies. However, this is one of the latest examples of cybersecurity breaches attributed to Chinese state-sponsored groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 "Dripping water penetrates the stone, not by force but by persistence." – Chinese proverb&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Last year, agencies from the United States (CISA, NSA, FBI), Australia (ACSC), Canada (CCCS), and New Zealand (NCSC-NZ) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure">warned</a> that Chinese hackers were targeting global telecommunications providers. According to Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger revealed, the federal government launched an investigation into a major incident, revealing that the Chinese campaign targeted the networks of AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and other telecoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/director-wrays-remarks-for-the-fbi-all-employee-town-hall-address">described</a> the telecom breach as China’s “most significant cyber espionage campaign in history.” Officials believe that a large number of Americans (mostly from the Washington-Virginia area) may have had their metadata compromised, including users' calls, text messages, date and time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, and phone numbers. The Chinese government has denied the allegations, and its Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Beijing condemns all forms of hacking and foreign interference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Globally, the incident serves as a wake-up call for public and private organizations that manage sensitive or critical data. The increasing frequency of state-sponsored attacks demonstrates the need to adopt advanced cybersecurity architectures, such as Zero Trust, combined with real-time threat intelligence sharing and cross-border incident response capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 The pragmatic approach&nbsp; 
<p>To improve cybersecurity in key industries, organizations need to be prepared for an increased level of malicious activities. When an incident occurs, business <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/business-continuity-cloud">continuity</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/business-resilience/business-resilience-guide">resilience</a> are essential. The former is about preventing or minimizing the impact of adversity on the normal state of operations, while the latter is about addressing challenges and adapting to changing conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As analysts, our goal is to provide practical advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Network Segmentation: Use network segmentation to limit an attacker's lateral movement. Keep sensitive data and systems isolated.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Implement Zero Trust Architecture: This <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80826/zero-trust-network-access">model</a> treats every user, application, or resource as untrusted and enforces strict security, access control, and comprehensive auditing to ensure visibility and accountability of all user activities.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Leverage ITDR: ITDR is a crucial component of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, as identities have become the primary targets of attackers looking to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and information. For more on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80828/identity-threat-detection-and-response-itdr-iam-meets-the-soc#heading5">ITDR</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Prioritize Monitoring and Threat Detection: Organizations can use advanced monitoring tools such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81117/endpoint-protection-detection-response-epdr">EPDR</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80923/extended-detection-and-response-xdr">XDR</a> to detect unusual activity and respond to emerging risks proactively.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Supply Chain Security: Verify that vendors and partners meet stringent cybersecurity requirements. Find more on SSCS <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81221/software-supply-chain-security">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Mobile Network Security Frameworks: If you're a telecom, adopt industry-recognized security frameworks and collaborate on shared standards with global <a href="https://www.gsma.com/about-us/">organizations</a>.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Engage in Public-Private Partnerships: Work closely with government agencies to access resources and expertise.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Since we all face the same threats, the private sector must embrace transparency and mutual support. As discussed in this previous KuppingerCole <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/neuenschwander/reflections-on-the-okta-breaches">blog</a> post, the culture of silence must be left behind - we must share insights, exchange knowledge and work together to strengthen our collective defenses. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. No single organization can predict where the next threat will emerge or how far it will spread. As Horace, the Roman poet, wisely said, "It is your business when your neighbor's wall is on fire."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's interconnected world, to protect one is to protect all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Non-Human Identities (NHIs) are finally making friends and influencing people—or at least they seem to be, given how much people are talking about them! This is great. People need to have a better sense of this brave new world of workloads, bots, and services. But this also means people need to have a better sense of what NHIs are not.</p>



<p>Whether you’re navigating workloads, APIs, or automated systems, the buzz around NHIs reflects their growing significance in everything from cloud computing to academic research. But as with any hot topic, there’s some confusion and waaaaaay too much marketing hype. I’ve written about NHIs <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/04/05/the-evolving-landscape-of-non-human-identity/">before</a>; today’s focus is on some of the main areas NHIs are different from human identities. The distinctions matter. </p>



 What NHIs Are Not 



<p>NHIs aren’t just API keys or OAuth tokens. Treating them as such would be like calling a password or a passkey a person’s digital identity—it oversimplifies their function and importance. Tokens, keys, and even credentials like X.509 certificates might help manage access, but they’re tools in the more extensive toolkit of workload identity management. (<a href="https://www.natoma.id/">Natoma</a> has published an interesting <a href="https://www.natoma.id/library/machine-to-machine-identity-maturity">white paper</a> on machine-to-machine authentication if you’re interested in more detail.)</p>



<p>NHIs represent software entities like batch processes, machine learning training models, or microservices operating independently of human identities. They operate at different speeds and have different selective disclosure requirements (yes, NHI <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-prorock-spice-use-cases/">use cases</a> may include the need for selective disclosure). Proving who they are to access other systems or resources goes beyond simple authentication. Unlike human authentication, which often revolves around confirming a single user’s identity via passwords, passkeys, or biometrics, NHIs must establish trust and authorization in highly dynamic, machine-driven environments.</p>



 Comparing NHIs and Human Identities 



<p>Part of what makes understanding that NHIs are different is that, if you tilt your head just right, their requirements sound very familiar. They need to demonstrate their identity and the purpose and scope of their request. They benefit from cryptographic proofs, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or X.509 certificates, to securely bind their identity to a specific action. They have a lifecycle that must be managed. And let’s not forget they may need to cross trust boundaries in a federated workflow.</p>



<p>I’ll go into more detail next, but here’s the summary for those who want to get straight to the good stuff.</p>



LayerHuman IdentitiesNon-Human Identities (NHIs)Contextual ValidationRole-based access; occasional risk checksTask-specific; continuous granular checksCryptographic AssurancePasswords, passkeys, MFAJWTs, OAuth tokens, mTLS, certificatesDynamic/Ephemeral IdentitiesPersistent, lifecycle-drivenTransient, task-drivenCross-Boundary TrustSSO, federation (SAML, OIDC)Federated workload identities, SPIFFE



 Contextual Validation 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Humans typically authenticate using static credentials like passwords, passkeys, or biometric scans. 



 Access is often role-based, with permissions tied to organizational hierarchies or specific job functions (e.g., an employee accessing their email). 



 Context, like geolocation or time of access, may be used for risk-based decisions (e.g., blocking a login attempt from an unusual location). 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs rely on detailed, task-specific validation. For example, a microservice might only <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/">access</a> a database during specific operational windows and for specific query types. 



 Permissions are highly granular and tied to the NHI’s role in a larger process, such as allowing read-only access to one API endpoint while granting full control over another. 



 Unlike humans, NHIs may operate across various environments, requiring continuous validation at scale. 
 



 Cryptographic Assurance 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Credentials often include usernames, passwords, or passkeys, validated via a central authentication server. 



 Additional layers like multi-factor authentication (MFA) involve OTPs or hardware tokens, but the process remains human-centric. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs use cryptographic credentials, such as JWTs, OAuth tokens, or X.509 certificates, to prove their identity and integrity. 



 These credentials are <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-arch/">typically</a> short-lived and dynamically issued, ensuring they can’t be reused if intercepted. 



 Cryptographic proofs (e.g., mutual TLS) are used to establish secure, trust-bound connections between services. Unlike humans, NHIs don’t rely on password-based authentication, making credential management more complex and secure when implemented correctly. 
 



 Dynamic and Ephemeral Identities 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Human identities are persistent and change only during significant lifecycle events, such as onboarding, promotions, or terminations. 



 Joiner/mover/leaver workflows handle these transitions in directories like Active Directory or IAM systems. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs are transient and may exist for just seconds or minutes, such as a containerized workload in Kubernetes that spins up to handle a specific task. 



 Unlike human-centric workflows, they require dynamic provisioning and de-provisioning of identities without manual intervention. (It would be nice if human-centric flows did this, too, but that’s not common. Yet.) 



 The absence of a natural lifecycle like “hiring” or “firing” makes traditional directory models ineffective for NHIs. 
 



 Cross-Boundary Trust 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Trust boundaries for humans are typically managed within a single organization or via federated identity systems like SAML or OpenID Connect. 



 Federated access is often used to enable single sign-on (SSO) across organizational or application boundaries. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs frequently operate in multi-cloud or hybrid environments, where they must authenticate across disparate trust domains. 



 Identity federation for NHIs requires advanced mechanisms, such as SPIFFE or OAuth token exchanges, to securely share identity and permissions between services in different ecosystems. 



 Unlike humans, NHIs may not have a single source of truth (like an HR system), necessitating more robust and decentralized trust models. 
 



 A Better Way to Think About NHIs 



<p>If you’re still thinking that NHIs belong in your human identity systems, I’m just not sure what to tell you. I would say we can agree to disagree, but getting this wrong has implications for how everyone interacts online, so I will continue to make a stand on this hill. NHIs require a different approach to identity management, including:</p>



<p>• Workload Identity Federation: To seamlessly authenticate across cloud providers.</p>



<p>• Dynamic Secrets and Token-Based Authentication: To enhance security and minimize exposure risks.</p>



<p>• Standards Efforts Like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/wimse/about/">WIMSE</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">SPICE</a>: To ensure consistent, secure service interactions.</p>



 Final Thoughts 



<p>Embracing NHIs means rethinking your identity systems and recognizing that traditional identity paradigms need to evolve. I know it’s hard work and requires even more resources for your IAM programs, but NHIs are not magic. They cannot bring security and efficiency to your organization without investment. There are vendors out there (I am not one of them) who can guide you through designing or redesigning your systems to account for NHIs. You’ve got this.</p>



<p>If you or your organization <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/07/07/introducing-digital-identity-standards-development-service-for-executives/">need support</a> with standards development, let me know. With my experience across various SDOs, I’m here to help guide you through the complexities of Internet standards development.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Oh, how time flies! Can you believe that we’ve been living with ransomware for over a decade already? Sure, a pedantic historian could explain that the first occurrences of malware encrypting files and asking for a ransom to restore access were recorded all the way back in 1989. Yet, it took another couple of decades for IT infrastructures and cryptocurrencies to evolve to a stage when ransomware truly became profitable and turned into a major risk with global impact.</p>
<p>The public probably experienced it for the first time in 2013, when the CryptoLocker ransomware was able to infect over 250,000 systems and netted its creators over $3 million in ransom payments. By 2017, strains like WannaCry and NotPetya became notorious for causing billions in damage around the world, with the latter showing the true weaponization potential of ransomware. In fact, NotPetya’s creators were not even interested in collecting ransom, they just wanted to cause long-lasting damage to their victims.</p>
<p>And ever since, the entire world has been living under the constant fear of a ransomware attack. For many organizations, it has become the existential threat number one, surpassing all other known cybersecurity risks. It’s the combination of immediacy, unpredictability, and the severe consequences of even a single attack that makes it so scary, amplified even further by the lack of a single comprehensive solution to reliably prevent them in the future.</p>
<p>A proper strategy for ransomware prevention must include a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80939/considerations-for-reducing-the-risk-of-ransomware">broad range of measures</a>, proactive and reactive, technology- and process-based, covering a multitude of attack vectors. These include everything from e-mail and web monitoring to endpoint detection and response to network security and identity governance. And yet, for most victims, the most viable scenario of surviving a ransomware attack is not to prevent it, but to contain the damage, restore their disrupted processes, and recover business-critical data as quickly and painlessly as possible…</p>
<p>With this realization, now is the right time to stop thinking about ransomware as malware that just encrypts or steals your files. In fact, it does much more direct and indirect damage than that – and to start thinking of new tools to augment your existing anti-ransomware toolkit. This is especially relevant for backup and disaster recovery. For example, a lot has been written recently about immutable backups as a crucial factor for ransomware resilience. It is a well-known fact that modern ransomware specifically targets backup locations to make the recovery more difficult, but are you sure that you are even doing your backups properly in the first place?</p>
<p>Recently, I attended a presentation of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/zero-data-loss-recovery-appliance/">Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance</a>, Oracle’s specialized solution for backing up mission-critical databases. While I was familiar with the product already, I was somewhat surprised that the company now positions it as a premier solution for ransomware protection. Wait, what? Do ransomware groups even consider relational databases a viable target? And isn’t Oracle’s own <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev70964/oracle-autonomous-database">Autonomous Database</a> with all its built-in security control supposed to be 100% resilient against these attacks anyway? However, the more I was thinking about it, the more sense it all started to make.</p>
<p>First, not even the most hardcore Oracle customers have all their data stored in the Autonomous Database, which is, after all, a managed cloud service. For many industries and applications, sensitive data has to stay on premises at all times. Second, even when the database itself is managed by a service provider, their responsibility does not extend to protecting the integrity of the customer’s data. And finally, ransomware attacks specifically targeting databases (relational and NoSQL) <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/postgresql-database-ransomware-analysis/">are not</a> <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/turkish-cyber-threat-targets-mssql-servers-mimic-ransomware">unheard</a> of, especially when targeting specific high-profile victims! In the end, having a secure, reliable, and high-performant solution for backing up business-critical data from enterprise databases does make a lot of sense, since it can substantially speed up recovering from a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance) is an engineered system for comprehensive data protection of Oracle databases, ensuring backup immutability, continuous validation, and rapid recovery without data loss, even in the event of a ransomware attack. It integrates natively with Oracle databases to consistently validate backup data, detect anomalies, and enforce retention policies, offering recovery up to the last sub-second before a data loss incident. The appliance supports flexible deployment architectures, including air-gapped Cyber Vaults, to enhance data protection and resilience. By consolidating incremental backups into space-efficient virtual full backups, Recovery Appliance minimizes recovery time while maintaining the highest data integrity and security standards.</p>
<p>Since the appliance is built on Oracle Exadata engineered system that customers leverage today for running the most critical enterprise Oracle databases, it inherits the underlying platform’s performance, scalability, and availability characteristics. And since it natively supports all the internal data structures and protocols of an Oracle Database, it offers unique capabilities that no third-party, especially file-based, backup tool can provide. It can operate in “incremental forever” mode, only capturing small data changes in real time during backup but will reassemble (“materialize”) them into a consistent full copy on the fly when needed for restoration.</p>
<p>Of course, all the backup copies stored by the appliance are immutable, but in addition to that, they are continuously validated for recovery integrity, down to the transaction level. Whenever you need to restore data, you can have peace of mind knowing that it will be free from any tampering or anomalies, whether caused by ransomware or other data compromise, encryption, or corruption scenarios.</p>
<p>To boost the level of security and compliance even further, while still meeting the RTO/RPO requirements, it is possible to deploy the appliance in an “<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/infrastructure/post/zdlra-logical-airgap">air gap</a>” configuration, further separating backup copies from production data. Whenever a full physical isolation is impossible or impractical, the combination of ZDLRA’s security features (immutable backups, end-to-end encryption, strict access controls, integrity checks) with network segmentation provides a strong level of “logical air-gapping” consistent with NIST best practices.</p>
<p>Recently, Oracle announced Zero Data Loss Autonomous Recovery Service, a cloud-native, Oracle managed counterpart of the on-premises appliance. It offers the same capabilities but in the cloud; in fact, the service is available in all clouds currently partnered with Oracle: Azure, GCP, and AWS. Cloud backups also have a significant advantage of being natively distributed across multiple availability zones, so they remain available even if a zone goes offline. It is even possible to quickly restore a backup to a different region or tenant to deal with catastrophic failures – not just ransomware but natural disasters, like earthquakes or tornadoes.</p>
<p>The company is now working on integrating these two offerings to support hybrid deployments in the future. But even now, according to Oracle, the Recovery Service is projected to become their largest cloud service by total storage volume.</p>
<p>So, will it really protect your organization from ransomware attacks? I’m afraid that asking this kind of question is misleading and even somewhat dangerous. There is simply no single tool or technology that can provide complete protection, given the broad range of vulnerabilities and threat vectors that can be exploited by malicious actors. What it can offer though is a turn-key solution for a specific kind of risk – a risk of losing access or compromising your critical sensitive data.</p>
<p>In a world where ransomware evolves faster than defenses, solutions like Oracle's Recovery Appliance are not just useful tools – they’re lifelines, turning catastrophes into recoverable incidents and keeping your business resilient when it matters most.</p>

				  Verifiable credentials are transforming how organizations verify, share, and manage data in new and powerful ways. Discover the top industries where verifiable credentials are reshaping digital interactions and unlocking new possibilities for individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Ken Ebert</p>
<p>In the rapidly evolving digital identity landscape, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are becoming more than just an emerging technology — they are establishing themselves as essential tools for secure, privacy-respecting identity verification. Organizations around the world are deploying this technology to simplify processes, enhance security, and give users control over their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog looks at five of the top use cases for Verifiable Credentials that we see for 2025, providing insight into how this technology is driving efficiency, transparency, and trust. Each example highlights how industries are using VCs to meet the increasing demand for secure, interoperable, and user-centric identity solutions. From improving how we manage biometric data to enabling seamless travel and streamlining compliance in finance, VCs are proving their versatility and value.</p>
<p>International Travel</p>
<p>Using digital identities for domestic proof of identity and travel has already seen some adoption, see our recent article on <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-you-need-to-know-about-mobile-drivers-licenses/">Mobile Driver’s Licenses.</a> But the next step is being able to travel internationally faster and more conveniently. Michael Zureik of SITA recently presented the findings of a proof of concept for <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/">flying internationally using a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) and the IATA One ID</a> in collaboration with Indicio, the Government of Aruba, and Delta Airlines. Aruba plans to have their solution operational to all travelers to the island in 2025, but keep an eye out for a quick adoption by other countries and airports.</p>
<p>Biometric Authentication</p>
<p>Biometric authentication solves the problem of passwords and logins for many organizations and users; unfortunately, it still relies on the underlying problem that passwords face: reliance on a centralized database. The solution to removing this reliance on a database is what we call “Bring Your Own Biometrics.” Once a biometric is authenticated, it is issued as a Verifiable Credential. When a person presents for a liveness check, they also present their biometric VC and the relying party compares the liveness check with the biometric in the VC. This solution keeps all of the benefits of biometric authentication, while removing the risk of data breach and reducing liability for the organization. Indicio Deputy CTO Sam Curren recently held an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AgdjIhVw24">in-depth discussion</a> on this topic with real world examples and implementations if you would like to learn more. As data breaches continue to rise and more systems switch to biometric authentication to combat fraud, we see this use case for eliminating databases for sensitive personal information being critical.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Schools of all levels are currently generating a mountain of paperwork per student per year. They need records of each student’s grades, transcripts, awards won, participation in sports or activities, and the list goes on. The current process to verify a student’s accomplishments requires the student to go back to the school and get the documents, and present them to the verifying party, either an employer or a higher education institution, and then for that part to also check in with the school to ensure they are authentic, resulting in a time consuming, manual process. The use of Verifiable Credentials and Open badges 3.0 will allow everyone to skip the wait and be able to immediately verify the student’s accomplishments without the need to check in with the school or a third party system. Students and faculty would also be able to use Verifiable Credentials for identity and access management, allowing users to access their accounts and documents in a faster, more secure, passwordless way. Indicio is already working on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7aOEfmX_BE">implementing this solution for the United School Administrators of Kansas,</a> but this issue applies to everyone in education, and we see the entire industry being quick to adopt once they see the time and cost savings to be had.</p>
<p>Agriculture&nbsp;</p>
<p>Farmers have a lot of data to share. From organic growing practices to emissions data or water usage, they have a lot to keep track of and share with a variety of stakeholders, including regulators, governments, suppliers, and consumers. Historically they have relied on third-party identity providers and centralized databases, which have proven complex to integrate and slow to operate, and can share the farmer’s data without their knowledge or permission. With a decentralized identity approach their information can be shared directly, and can also create a more transparent supply chain and prove provenance. Recently, the Trust Alliance New Zealand in partnership with Indicio and Anonyme Labs has showed that all of this information can be securely held locally in a digital wallet and shared in a decentralized way, offering a faster, simpler approach to data management that saves time and money for everyone that relies on farming data. This solution won the Constellation Research <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-co-developed-digital-farm-wallet-wins-constellation-research-supernova-award/">2024 SuperNova Award</a> for “Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity.” Agriculture and farming is a data intensive activity and we see growing interest and applications for digital farm wallets in 2025.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>No one is targeted more by fraudsters than financial institutions. In fact, it’s likely that your bank receives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/voice-deepfakes-bank-scams.html">thousands of deepfake scam phone calls per year</a> trying to gain access to customer accounts. Decentralized identity can stop this problem at its source by providing mutual authentication through DIDComm to both banks and the customers they service before every interaction or transaction, removing the ability for any party to be impersonated. Historically banks have had to identify customers through passwords and MFA, while customers had no way to truly identify their bank without extra due diligence on their part. Fraud prevention and faster customer interactions will be a driving force for finance being a big adopter of Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity in 2025.</p>

<p>Thales in the UK, in collaboration with the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), hosted multiple international partners to display the Lightweight Multi-role Missile (LMM) and its capabilities in an air defence and surface attack role.</p>
<p>The demonstration, which took place at Manorbier, successfully delivered a consecutive firing by Thales UK of LMMs at both an air and a sea target. This firing was a first of its kind and demonstrates Thales’ expertise in the air defence and surface attack domain, with LMM pioneering the way in short range defence, providing a seamless back-to-back engagement of incoming threats, proving once again the true versatility and multi-role applications of the missile.</p>
<p>Both the air target (Banshee UAV) and sea target (fast inshore attack craft - FIAC) were successfully destroyed in the engagement which saw two missiles fired within less than 60 seconds, one for each specific target, demonstrating the lethality, agility and technical achievements of the missile. LMM was fired from a vehicle-mounted, lightweight fire control and launching system, produced by Thales in the UK.</p>
<p>The demonstration day was supported by the British Army and Royal Navy, including displays of static equipment such as shoulder and tripod launchers, as well as a Wildcat helicopter that can carry 20 LMM at a time, known as Martlet in the naval domain.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs has the most advanced&nbsp;decentralized identity&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;on the market—and the newly released version 3.0 is packed with features that customers can apply to their own products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new features in the latest version of our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK represent the bleeding edge of decentralized identity (DI), align with European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) regulations, and maintain the modularity, reliability, and security of <a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ products.</p>



<p>Our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK currently allows customers to easily integrate DI and verifiable credential (VC, or reusable credential) solutions into their applications and now, with version 3.0, these capabilities go even further. The DI Mobile Edge Agent SDKis a native SDK for both iOS and Android, and does not rely on any third party frameworks such as Javascript frameworks.</p>



<p>In nutshell:</p>



 
 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 adds support for OpenID4VC (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>), expanding its suite of protocols for receiving and presenting credentials, in addition to the already supported Aries protocols. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 builds on its collection of supported credential formats (Anoncreds and W3C) with the addition of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a>, increasing interoperability and supporting new privacy-preserving use cases. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 updates its supported Aries protocols, maintaining interoperability with the latest Aries agents in the ecosystem. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK continues to exist in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s DI offerings, such as in the Anonyome Labs Cloud Agent Service and the Anonyome Labs Decentralized Identity Relay. 



 Having accomplished what was on the roadmap we set out in our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">previous article</a>, we’ve outlined our new enhanced roadmap, including continued investment into OpenID4VC capabilities, and expansion for new DID Methods (such as <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method">Cheqd</a>). 
 



<p>Let’s break these down:</p>



 Adds support for OpenID4VC protocols 



<p>With our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK already having support for Aries protocols for receiving and presenting VCs (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2/README.md">Issue Credential</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/401acf391b1470fd0b7bc58b94c1b05588b811b7/features/0454-present-proof-v2/README.md#L4">Present Proof</a>), version 3.0 ventures into the new OpenID4VC protocol suite (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>).</p>



<p>This move allows for wider interoperability with the DI ecosystem, including within the EUDI ecosystem where these protocols are being used in technical specifications (such as the <a href="https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/arf/">Architecture Reference Framework</a>) and pilot deployments.</p>



<p>These new protocols also help achieve new use cases and wallet UX flows alongside the existing Aries protocol’s use cases. A few of the notable differences are:</p>



 
 Being rooted in industry-standard OAuth 2.0 flows, OpenID4VC allows standard OAuth authorization flows to be used in credential issuance flows. 



 Multiple credentials can be offered in the same flow, where the Edge Agent SDK consumer can browse and request the desired credential. 



 The issuer now conveys support for UI display data in the credential exchange, including issuer and credential colors, text, and logos. 



 There’s no prerequisite to establish an existing DIDComm connection. Credential and presentation exchange flows can begin immediately from an initial QR code scan or deep link click. 
 



<p>The possibilities and protocol variations in OpenID4VC are vast. To home in on the variations the Edge Agent SDK will support in this release, we’ve targeted interoperability with the OpenID4VC verifier and issuer capabilities of the popular open-source projects <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts/tree/main/packages/openid4vc">credo-ts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy-plugins/tree/main/oid4vc">ACA-Py</a>.</p>



 Builds on supported VCs formats, with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a> 



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT VC</a>s is the latest credential format to enter our Edge Agent’s suite of supported formats, alongside <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCs</a> and <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Anoncreds</a>.</p>



<p>Like the new OpenID4VC features, this new credential format enables new use cases and wider interoperability with the DI ecosystem, since SD-JWT VC is a preferred format in the EUDI ecosystem.</p>



<p>SD-JWT VCs are designed with selective disclosure in mind, allowing for the building of user-centric privacy-preserving use cases. Using SD-JWT VC, the holder can selectively choose to hide certain attributes of their credential (if the issuer permits it), so that when they present their credential in some use cases, they present only the bare minimum to satisfy that use case. By default, our Edge Agent SDK will always disclose as little as possible when presenting SD-JWT VCs, protecting the privacy of our consumers.</p>



<p>Our Edge Agent SDK could already support some of these use cases via Anoncreds and the BBS-variant of W3C VCs, but SD-JWT VCs differ from these formats in that they use <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/140-2/upd2/final/docs/fips1402annexa.pdf">NIST FIPS</a>-compliant cryptography—an attractive feat for EUDI regulation.</p>



 Updates supported Aries protocols 



<p>In addition to our major venture into the new OpenID4VC protocol suite, we continue to maintain and expand our Aries protocol suite. Since <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">2.0</a>, the Edge Agent SDK has added support for the latest Aries connection protocol, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">DID Exchange</a>.</p>



<p>This new protocol has new UX optimizations for Edge Agent SDK consumers where DIDComm connections can be re-used if a duplicate connection is detected when receiving a DIDComm invitation. But, just as importantly, this feature ensures the Edge Agent SDK remains aligned with the latest Aries Interoperability Profile (AIP).</p>



 Exists in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s DI offerings 



<p>As a market leader in innovative&nbsp;decentralized identity (DI)&nbsp;technology offerings, Anonyome Labs continues to advance its&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">DI solutions</a>, supporting a wide range of use cases. Our Edge Agent SDK continues to seamlessly integrate with our highly scalable DI message relay solution, the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo DI Relay SDK</a>, allowing the edge agent to reliably receive messages from the DIDComm peers it connects with. What’s more, we continue to thoroughly test our Edge Agent against our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Cloud Agent Service</a>&nbsp;offering (in addition to a suite of open source DI agents) to make sure all our features remain interoperable in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Rich roadmap ahead 



<p>With this extensive third release, Anonyome’s DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK has once again exceeded its roadmap, going beyond the plan laid out since the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">previous release announcement</a>. But we are not slowing down: we plan to keep adding features to every new release of the SDK so our customers’ applications can stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the DI ecosystem.</p>



<p>Going forward for the SDK, we plan to continue updating our OpenID4VC protocol suite. Despite being deployed in many EUDI pilots, OpenID4VC protocols are still in draft status. We plan to stay up to date with these protocols as they approach their official 1.0 release, aligning with the EUDI. We also plan to:</p>



 
 Enhance our OpenID4VC protocol implementations with new capabilities, such as OpenID4VCI’s “Authorization code flow”, enabling use cases where users must perform a standard OAuth login to access a credential 



 Add support for OpenID’s <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-self-issued-v2-1_0.html">SIOPv2</a> protocol, allowing for new “login with decentralized identifier” use cases 



 Continue expanding the set of DID methods we support, such as did:cheqd, did:tdw, and did:jwk, again increasing the level of interoperability with more DI agents. 
 



<p><a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ business solution&nbsp;combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of enterprise-ready APIs and SDKs, so you can quickly build and deploy next-generation privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity apps to help your customers communicate privately, navigate online safely, and transact securely in an increasingly connected world.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Luxembourg, 8 January 2025 – <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>, a leading provider of onchain finance solutions, has partnered with <a href="https://ditobanx.com/">Ditobanx</a>, a licensed Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) in El Salvador, to help the country build a standardized framework for tokenized regulated assets and position the nation as a leader in the tokenization era.</p>
<p>By leveraging Tokeny’s proven technology, Ditobanx has successfully overcome the challenges of launching a robust platform to issue, manage, and distribute tokenized assets in a seamless and compliant way, without recreating operational silos. The company plans to issue $300 million in tokenized assets in 2025, with a pipeline of 22 clients ready to onboard.</p>
<p>Ditobanx’s mission goes beyond simplifying investment access through tokenization. The team is committed to building an ecosystem that extends the reach of El Salvador’s securities and enhances liquidity in private markets. This ecosystem vision hinges on collaboration and standardization, ensuring that participants across the financial landscape can connect and operate seamlessly.</p>
<p>Ditobanx, Tokeny, and over 90 industry players are collaborating through the non-profit ERC3643 Association to ensure the adoption of the market standard ERC-3643 (“T-REX”) for compliant tokenization. This standard defines how compliance, permissions, data, and onchain workflows are managed, enabling participants to interact effortlessly within a standardized framework.</p>
<p>However, the lifecycle management of tokenized securities remains complex, involving the integration of both on-chain and off-chain processes and data. Developing an orchestrated platform from scratch is both time-intensive and costly, often taking years to complete. To overcome these challenges, Ditobanx chose Tokeny’s onchain operating system, which enabled them to launch their platform within weeks. This swift deployment allows Ditobanx to focus on their core business while benefiting from a proven and scalable solution.</p>
<p>To ensure that other licensed providers in El Salvador can overcome similar challenges and adopt the market standard, Ditobanx will offer tailored guidance and access to its expertise and tools. By supporting these providers in implementing the ERC-3643 T-REX standard, Ditobanx aims to create a more streamlined and standardized ecosystem across the country, eliminating silos and unlocking the full potential of tokenization through seamless interoperability and open distribution.</p>

		 
	 
    Launching tokenized assets is a complex process, but it is essential for the future of our industry. We believe in making this journey easier for others by sharing what we’ve learned and providing access to proven solutions. Standardization is critical for creating a more connected, liquid, and innovative market, and we are committed to making this vision a reality for El Salvador and beyond.  Guillermo ContrerasCEO of Ditobanx       El Salvador has been a trailblazer in adopting and regulating digital assets, demonstrating an active and forward-thinking approach to innovation. The country is uniquely positioned to take full advantage of the opportunities that tokenization offers. With a visionary partner like Ditobanx, making significant strides toward nationwide standardization, we are proud to support their efforts. By providing the right tools and expertise tailored to local jurisdictions and specific needs, we are enabling institutions across El Salvador to confidently and efficiently embrace tokenization.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>With Tokeny and Ditobanx working together, El Salvador is taking another major step toward making tokenized assets a core part of its economy. This partnership not only creates a clear path for licensed providers to succeed but also builds the foundation for a stronger, more efficient tokenization market that benefits issuers, investors, distributors, and the nation as a whole.</p>

		 
	 
   
	 
		 
			 About Ditobanx 
<p>Ditobanx is a digital financial solutions company dedicated to transforming the way individuals and businesses interact with their finances. With a strong presence in Latin America and plans for expansion, Ditobanx continues to innovate to provide the best financial tools on the market.</p>

These challenges don’t exist individually; each impacts and complicates the others. For example, regulatory obligations and rising fraud add requirements to an onboarding experience that customers already have strong opinions about. Balancing the growing threat of fraud with the high customer demand for seamless, secure digital experiences creates a challenging environment for institutions trying to evolve their digital services.

				  The economic benefits from streamlining cross-border transactions are massive — and decentralized identity provides the digitally transformative infrastructure to do so.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth and Tim Spring</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European central bank,</a> global cross-border payments are expected to increase from <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2023/html/ecb.blog231031~85a4bcdee0.en.html">190 trillion USD in 2023 to 290 trillion USD</a> by 2030 as global commerce becomes more digitally integrated.</p>
<p>Yet in practice, cross border payments are complex and difficult for businesses to execute and often punishing for individuals. Currency conversion rates, fees, and regulatory compliance all conspire to slow down and increase the cost of payments in real time; and for remittances —&nbsp;people sending money from one country to another (typically a foreign worker sending money to relatives) — these fees are brutal. According to the World Bank, the <a href="https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q224.pdf">average cost</a> of sending a remittance is 6.65% of the amount sent,&nbsp;rising to 8.37% for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>As a recent World Bank report <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/migration/brief/remittances-knomad">notes</a>, “In more than 60 countries, remittances account for 3 percent or more of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and small/fragile states are more heavily dependent on remittances. As such, it is critical that both remittance senders and receivers have access to a multitude of payment methods and channels in order to deliver and receive remittances in an affordable and fast manner.”</p>
<p>Even a modest 1 percentage point reduction in fees, <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2023/html/ecb.blog231031~85a4bcdee0.en.html">says</a> the European Central Bank’s Fabio Panetta, “would leave those most in need with USD 6 billion in their pockets every year.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s looking for better solutions, with the goal of making cross border payments cheaper, faster, more flexible, and more secure. Here’s how we believe Decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials can deliver those solutions, fast.</p>
 
  Validating account ownership and status 
 
<p>Identity fraud is the specter haunting all financial transactions. The key benefit of a Verifiable Credential solution is cryptographic trust: If you trust the source of a Verifiable Credential, you can trust the contents, and immediately act on the data.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials enable people or organizations to hold data about themselves, such as the financial account data required to meet “know your customer” and AML requirements. Verifiable Credentials enable people to share and reuse that data in a way that doesn’t require checking in with the original issuer of the information or storing the same data in order to cross check it.</p>
<p>Authentication is seamless because the origin of the credential is instantly verifiable through cryptography. The information in a credential is digitally signed so that any alteration will be instantly detected. And the credential is bound to the person and their device and their digital wallet both by cryptography and biometrics so you can know that it is the rightful owner is presenting their information. The credential can also be programmed to expire or it can be revoked depending on whether its terms of use have been violated.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are capable of delivering “government-grade” digital identities that can be bound to biometrics (see 4 below) and verified using simple software anywhere and at any time.</p>
 
  Know Your Customer’s Biometrics (KYCB).&nbsp; 
 
<p>Biometrics are increasingly being incorporated into payments so that you can “pay with your face.” But the rapid rise of generative AI-driven biometric fraud threatens to derail confidence in conventional biometric authentication. Biometric theft represents a much higher existential risk to people than account or password theft. Similarly, the need to store personal biometric data in order to verify it represents a much higher privacy and security risk to all parties involved.</p>
<p>This is where Verifiable Credential technology comes to the rescue. By submitting an authenticated biometric template from a trusted credential provider while performing a liveness check, a relying party has a simple, reliable way to cross check that the person really is the face in front the camera —&nbsp;and without the relying party having to store any biometric data or change their biometric infrastructure.</p>
<p>This “bring your own validated biometrics” approach is driving seamless digital travel, enabling people to seamlessly cross borders. This kind of “government-grade” digital identity is ideal for payments, domestic and international.</p>
 
  Cross-border technical interoperability 
 
<p>Decentralized identity both simplifies the architecture and workflows for sharing data. The first is accomplished by eliminating the need for direct integrations. If you trust the issuer of a credential (Bank A), you can trust the information in the credential, and connect the verifying software to internal systems through an API. This makes data portable and immediately actionable.</p>
<p>Second, it is easy to establish governance rules for how information in a credential is processed. This is because a) there’s a global specification for these governance rules, and b) the rules are encoded in machine-readable files propagated to issuers, holders, and verifiers alike.</p>
<p>In other words, a governance authority can publish a list of trusted credential issuers in a file and send it to every organization with verifying software. A merchant in a village with a mobile verifier on their phone is able to immediately authenticate whether a credential presented has come from a trusted organization. The file can be rapidly updated and, as it is cached, it can be configured to handle offline verification.</p>
<p>While the technical complexities of cross border transactions are not to be underestimated, decentralized identity&nbsp;—&nbsp;and specifically, decentralized ecosystem governance — can radically simplify workflows needed to deliver efficient, cost-effective real-time payments.</p>
 
  Seamless, connected experiences 
 
<p>When you combine Verifiable Credentials with a powerful communications protocol such as DIDComm (Decentralized Identifier Communications), you get even more flexibility. DIDComm enables two powerful features.</p>
<p>First, it is the engine that enables parties to mutually authenticate each other before exchanging any data.</p>
<p>The second is that it allows a mobile device to operate as if it had a very powerful API for data exchange, one that is much more secure than any conventional API. This is groundbreaking, as the inability (for a variety of technical reasons) of mobile phones to use APIs has limited their functionality.</p>
<p>When these two features combine, we have a very powerful way to integrate services in a seamless, secure way. For example, a fintech AI could be permissioned to access and analyze account data in real time.</p>
<p>But the point is that it makes it easy to permission and process any kind of complex workflow between parties; it turns digital wallets and their owners into verifiable data platforms.</p>
 
  Platformless infrastructural transformation 
 
<p>Verifiable Credentials are not a platform. They are not stand-alone systems that replace existing infrastructure; they are, rather, a set of tools you drop into existing systems. Just as a catalytic converter renders harmful emissions less harmful, Verifiable Credentials make the digital data you already have verifiable, portable, private, and secure —&nbsp;and they do so without this data being stored or controlled by the tech developer.</p>
<p>This is critical for data privacy compliance, transparency, and trust. It is the key to why decentralized identity can scale to, and interoperate as, cost-effective global digital infrastructure accessible to all.</p>
<p>The challenge</p>
<p>The travel sector is rapidly transitioning to decentralized identity and “government-grade” digital identities in order to deliver streamlined and more secure customer experiences as global air passenger numbers are set to double in the near future. Airlines and airports get it.</p>
<p>For finance, the challenge is first, to understand how powerful this technology is and how easily it can be deployed to manage the complex tangle of regulatory and technical challenges across multiple stakeholders; second, to then make the policy decisions to allow implementation.</p>
<p>In this, the technology is, in many ways, the easy bit; it’s the talking and coordinating that’s hard.</p>
<p>But there is an incentive for everyone to align around: reducing the cost of cross border remittances are a Sustainable Development Goal (<a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/remittances-day/SDGs#:~:text=SDG%2010,additional%20US%2420%20billion%20annually.">SDG10</a>) —&nbsp;and the clock is ticking on 2030. The savings are considerable; the impact of these savings, life transforming. The time to implement Verifiable Credentials has never been better.</p>

</blockquote>



 



 Revisiting Our 2024 Predictions 



<p>Our 2024 predictions, which drew on the collective expertise of the Liminal team, anticipated many of these developments. Here’s how they aligned with the year’s major trends:</p>



 
 Age Assurance as a Core Pillar for Trust &amp; Safety 



 Convergence of Identity and Cybersecurity 



 Market Consolidation 



 Regulatory Shifts 



 Continued Struggle for Reusable Identity Adoption 
 



 



 1. Age Assurance as a Core Pillar for Trust &amp; Safety 



<p>Our prediction that major social media platforms would initiate voluntary age verification has proven mostly correct, as platforms like Meta and Snapchat have taken significant steps to enhance age assurance measures, including testing tools such as biometric-based age estimation and document verification to comply with growing regulatory pressures. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-age-assurance-report-access">According to Liminal’s 2024 B2B survey of age assurance practitioners</a>, in regulated sectors, age verification coverage is expected to grow from 60% to 66%, while unregulated industries are moving faster, with adoption rising from 64% to 73% in the next year. This shift reflects the growing recognition of age assurance as essential for Trust &amp; Safety, even outside traditionally regulated areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we anticipated a blow to state-level regulations in the U.S., the outcome has been mixed. We use<a href="https://link.liminal.co/market-monitor?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-market-monitor-access"> Link’s Market Monitor </a>to anticipate actionable impacts of proposed legislation, and although the Supreme Court has yet to rule on this issue decisively, recent developments—such as <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/3/?Tab=BillText">Florida’s new HB 3 bill </a>mandating parental consent for minors under 14 to access social media —demonstrate states’ continued attempts to impose online protections. Internationally, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-passes-social-media-ban-children-under-16-2024-11-28/">Australia introduced the world-first legislation</a> in its Online Safety Act, which bans children younger than 16 from platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Age Assurance has emerged as a core focus of our coverage and research this year, driven by its critical role in Trust &amp; Safety initiatives across digital platforms. Throughout the year, we’ve closely tracked <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-age-assurance-report-access">market sentiment through buyer surveys</a>, which highlight the growing demand for solutions that balance regulatory compliance, user experience, and platform integrity. The gap between understanding and effectively implementing age assurance regulations presents a significant challenge for businesses, with confusion around the scope of specific regulations being a major issue. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-age-assurance-report-access">46% of practitioners</a> incorrectly identify the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) – which primarily applies to schools and libraries – as one of the top regulations impacting businesses. Our <a href="https://link.liminal.co/use-cases?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-use-case-explorer-access">Link Use Case Explorer</a> includes an analysis of product capabilities and technical features, including a detailed view of how solutions are evolving to meet the stringent requirements of this use case, such as biometric age estimation, data enrichment, and parental consent tools. At the same time, we’ve identified key technology gaps—particularly in accuracy and user experience—that remain opportunities for innovation. By mapping the capabilities of emerging technologies to real-world buyer needs, we’ve gained a clear view of how the market is maturing to address the complexities of age assurance, setting the stage for future advancements that ensure safer digital environments for all users.</p>



 



 2. Convergence of Identity and Cybersecurity 



<p>Our predictions regarding the convergence of digital identity and cybersecurity were largely correct, with developments across deepfake mitigation, bot detection, and authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deepfakes are more prevalent today than ever before due to a combination of technological advancements and increased accessibility to AI-powered tools. The proliferation of generative AI models, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and large language models, has enabled the creation of hyper-realistic audio, video, and image content with minimal expertise or resources. The rapid spread of misinformation on social platforms and the rise of identity-based attacks, such as impersonation fraud and synthetic identities, have made deepfakes an increasingly potent tool for bad actors targeting individuals, organizations, and even nation-states. Solutions that integrate identity verification tools—such as biometric authentication, liveness detection, and digital watermarking—combined with cybersecurity techniques like content provenance, anomaly detection, and cryptographic hashing are essential to detect and authenticate the origin and integrity of digital media. Based on survey data conducted in <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/67336e5f0402b57725ca0900?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-ians-report-access">Liminal’s 2024 Seminar Research Report: The Market for Identity Authorization Networks</a>, 88% of financial services institutions expect GenAI fraud and deepfakes to grow substantially over the next two years. New frameworks and consortiums have emerged to combat deepfakes, and in the Solution Segment for <a href="https://link.liminal.co/solution-segments/5fc17fe2f82a3e5e2cabd3b2?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-ss-user-generated-content-moderation-access">User-Generated Content Moderation</a> within our <a href="https://link.liminal.co/solution-segments?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-liminal-landscape-access">Liminal Landscape</a>, we are tracking the <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">Content Authenticity Initiative</a> and <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)</a>, which have made progress in establishing technical standards for identifying manipulated media.</p>



 


 
 


<p>Midjourney Image Generations Over Time – Liminal’s 2024 Seminar Research Report: The Market for Identity Authorization Networks</p>



 



<p>Our prediction that Chrome’s third-party cookie deprecation would drive demand for bot detection was incorrect, as <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/07/google-abandons-plan-to-phase-out-third.html">Google has decided not to phase out third-party cookies</a>. However, as companies shift toward first-party ad strategies, there remains a heightened requirement to ensure that all website impressions are legitimate. The growing reliance on first-party data amplifies the need for identity-centric approaches to cybersecurity, particularly in bot detection. Automated threats like ad fraud, fake traffic, and click bots can severely undermine the accuracy and value of first-party strategies, impacting advertising ROI and business performance. Organizations are adopting advanced solutions such as behavioral analytics, device fingerprinting, and real-time anomaly detection to differentiate between genuine users and malicious bots to combat this. By ensuring the legitimacy of website impressions, businesses protect their advertising investments and reinforce trust and data integrity in an increasingly privacy-driven digital landscape.</p>



<p>Finally, while passkeys have gained traction, particularly with big tech players like Google and Apple, our prediction remains correct that they remain largely secondary authentication methods rather than primary solutions, as adoption faces challenges in user behavior and enterprise readiness. Passkeys are a form of passwordless authentication that leverages public key cryptography to verify a user’s identity without requiring a traditional password. According to <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6718c9b9d7f0e77856e7e1b5?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-wp-cybersecurity-passkeys">Liminal’s 2024 B2B surveys of authentication practitioners</a>, despite nearly 100% of businesses that have yet to adopt passkeys expressing a willingness to transition to them, only about a third are expecting to do so in the next two years. Our ongoing research on a passwordless future highlights the critical role that CISOs and IT leaders can play in promoting the internal adoption of passkeys within the workforce. We hypothesize that workforce adoption can catalyze widespread customer deployments by proving their effectiveness, ease of use, and security benefits in real-world environments. This workforce-first approach enhances identity-centric cybersecurity by removing the vulnerabilities associated with passwords and helps organizations build trust and familiarity with passkey solutions.</p>

 3. Market Consolidation 



<p>Our predictions around market consolidation were partially correct, with significant activity but slightly different dynamics than anticipated. While at least two publicly traded identity companies did choose to go private—such as <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/61b12a7401c4b637779827d6/overview">Proofpoint</a>’s acquisition by Thoma Bravo and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/61c12b7dc890a08ec3f64f08/overview">ZeroFox</a>’s buyout by Haveli Investments—the broader trend focused on strategic acquisitions.</p>



<p>Key deals like Visa’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/61c12b7dc890a08ec3f64f08/overview">Featurespace</a> and Experian’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/62cc485c7718967730d7cf37">NeuroID</a> and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/6408eedbe2225e7d5f5cc836">ClearSale</a> highlight how financial giants integrate advanced fraud prevention and behavioral analytics capabilities into their platforms. Mastercard’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/6408eedbe2225e7d5f5cc836/overview">Recorded Future</a> also points to a growing appetite for cybersecurity and identity intelligence convergence. We also saw <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f3179dc94908bf4be1/overview">Entrust</a>’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f3179dc94908bf4be1/overview">Onfido</a> for up to $600M, despite prior speculation to IPO over $1B.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, our expectation that <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f7179dc94908bf4c21">Okta</a> and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f7179dc94908bf4c26">Ping</a> would aggressively expand into identity verification and fraud prevention—particularly at account opening—was only partially realized. While both expanded capabilities, their focus remained on core IAM/CIAM, leaving traditional identity verification players like <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fc1d9b2f26e0d7cd04afeb6">Socure</a>, <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/6101c7f64645a82ed0abf46b">Prove</a>, and others to capture significant market share in fraud prevention and onboarding solutions. The acquisitions and private equity activity seen this year reaffirm that the market is consolidating, but the momentum is being driven by adjacent entrants and strategic investors looking to integrate identity and fraud solutions into larger ecosystems rather than large-scale mergers within the digital identity space.</p>

 4. Regulatory Shifts 



<p>Our predictions regarding regulatory shifts were only somewhat correct, particularly in relation to generative AI and its impact on privacy and data advantage. As generative AI adoption surged, organizations faced increasing privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny. For instance, the <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">EU’s AI Act</a> introduced strict guidelines around data usage, transparency, and accountability in generative AI systems, while jurisdictions like <a href="https://www.bakerdonelson.com/californias-new-generative-ai-law-what-your-organization-needs-to-know">California pushed forward tech regulations</a> to safeguard personal data from misuse in AI training models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simultaneously, companies struggling to articulate their unique data advantage in the generative AI space encountered notable market criticism. This was particularly evident with firms unable to differentiate their AI solutions from competitors or justify the quality of their proprietary datasets, leading to investor skepticism and concerns about overinflated claims. These developments reaffirm that regulatory shifts are driving organizations to strike a balance between AI-driven innovation, privacy protections, and transparency, with a clear data advantage increasingly serving as a competitive differentiator.</p>



 



 5. Continued Struggle for Reusable Identity Adoption 



<p>Unfortunately, our prediction that reusable identity networks would not gain consumer adoption in 2024 was correct, as significant hurdles around scalability, trust, and consumer behavior persisted. Notably, Mastercard has lost momentum with its ID Network, reflecting the challenges even well-funded, globally recognized players face in driving the adoption of reusable digital identities. <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>, a pioneer in self-sovereign identity, is preparing to <a href="https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=b2c2f50b93f0ad7684f55ccde&amp;id=97dcc86838">deprecate its MainNet ledger </a>by April of this year, signaling technological hurdles and a marked reduction in transaction activity. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f9179dc94908bf4c42">Trinsic</a>, a startup that sought to enable decentralized identity solutions, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-decentralized-identity-assets-acquired-by-dentity-to-accelerate-digital-id-adoption/">shifted its focus away from its original vision</a>, citing slow market readiness and unclear demand. These developments underscore the difficulty of achieving network effects, interoperability, and end-user trust required for reusable identity solutions to thrive. While reusable identity networks continue to show promise, particularly in niche ecosystems or regulated environments, the broader market remains hesitant, and adoption struggles have reinforced the need for clearer value propositions, regulatory support, and incentives to drive consumer engagement.</p>

 Learn more about IDnow’s latest collaborative project, ACHILLES, which sets out to revolutionize the development and use of AI throughout Europe. 



<p>In a world where artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the importance of having access to transparent, robust and sustainable AI increases.</p>



<p>Inspired by the legend of the mythological warrior, the ACHILLES project aims to tackle the traditional limitations and weaknesses of AI, which are typically considered to be efficiency and trust.</p>



<p>With funding of over €8 million from Horizon Europe, and collaboration between 16 partners including IDnow, ACHILLES will run for a four year period (2024-2028) and focus on four areas:</p>



<p>People: Promoting ethical, transparent and explainable AI.</p>



<p>Data: Reducing the use of real data through the use of synthetic alternatives.</p>



<p>AI models: Optimizing efficiency and guaranteeing fairness.</p>



<p>Deployment: Ensuring sustainable, regulatory-compliant implementation.</p>



<blockquote><p>With ACHILLES, we want to put people at the heart of AI innovation. Our aim is to ensure that every technology not only performs well, but is also transparent and ethical, to inspire trust in the long term.</p>André Carreiro, Project Coordinator and Researcher at Fraunhofer AICOS (Portugal).</blockquote>



 The 6 objectives of the ACHILLES project. 



  Identify ethical and legal frameworks in order to design AI systems that are based on human values.  



  Create frameworks to guarantee high quality, diverse and representative data for AI use.  



  Protect consumer privacy when using data and models in machine learning.  



  Optimize AI model training and deployment processes to reduce energy and IT costs.  



  Enable the development of robust and transparent algorithms.  



  Offer researchers and developers an integrated development environment based on machine learning to facilitate efficient, regulatory-compliant and trustworthy AI.  



 What sectors is ACHILLES focused on? 



<p>The ACHILLES project will focus on creating multiple use cases across various industries, including healthcare by optimizing models to provide faster and more reliable diagnostics, and identity verification by developing more secure, privacy-friendly solutions. By ensuring compliance with regulations, ACHILLES will also offer use cases as far and wide as content creation and pharmaceutical development.</p>



<p>Plus, by aligning with the ethical standards of the European Union, ACHILLES demonstrates that innovation and responsibility can, in fact, coexist to create trusted AI.&nbsp;The ACHILLES project is split into three major milestones.</p>



<p>Year 1 (2024-2025): Define use cases and specifications, start of technical developments.</p>



<p>Year 2 (2025-2026): Continue technical developments, assessment of project use cases.</p>



<p>Years 3 and 4 (2026-2028): Implement and evaluate the efficacy of ACHILLES solutions on project use cases.</p>



 IDnow’s role in the ACHILLES project. 



<p>As a leader in the European identity verification market, IDnow’s chief role in the project is to&nbsp;provide identity verification expertise and work to maximize the efficiency of datasets that comply with privacy standards, including GDPR. This includes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Creating synthetic data that is representative of real data.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Optimizing data annotation to minimize human resources and guarantee reliable results.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Renewing datasets without affecting model performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Throughout the project IDnow will be evaluating ACHILLES innovations on real-life use cases linked to identity verification. These tests will enable us to improve the robustness of our algorithms and propose more reliable, secure and privacy-friendly solutions.</p>



<blockquote><p>Thanks to the ACHILLES project, we hope not only to improve the quality and robustness of our algorithms, but also to reduce dependence on real data. This represents a major step toward more sustainable and regulatory-compliant AI.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>The ACHILLES project marks a decisive step in the development of sustainable, human-centered AI. With its multidisciplinary approach and rigorous framework, it promises to lay the foundations for a more transparent and safer artificial intelligence that meets the needs of tomorrow. Stay tuned: the first results will be available in 2026!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re all accustomed to using SMS (short message service) verification when we sign on to our mobile apps and services. This method is used to prove that you possess the device during an MFA (multi-factor authentication) experience. When you attempt to access an app, it texts you a code and asks you to provide that code to prove that you are who you claim to be. After providing the code, you immediately gain access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SMS verification is extremely popular because most people are accustomed to it and know what to expect. However, this verification method can be vulnerable to SMS fraud, which could result in costly losses for your organization if you do not take the appropriate precautions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As cyberattacks on the healthcare industry reach unprecedented levels, healthcare data security has become a critical focus for providers, payers, and regulators. Recent developments, such as New York's Healthcare Cybersecurity Mandate and proposed federal legislation, highlight the urgency to bolster defenses against cyber threats and digital security risks with the digitization of patient records and personal data. At the heart of this transformation is digital identity, which serves as a foundational pillar of modern healthcare data protection.</p>

  <p>You have an app with SSO capabilities. What else can you do with Okta to transform it into an enterprise-ready powerhouse?</p>

<p>Today’s enterprises face critical identity management challenges that directly impact their operations; this includes:</p>

 
   Rapid business growth outpacing their current user management capabilities 
   Scattered user accounts creating administrative chaos 
   User management that doesn’t scale with company growth (access free-for-all to resources) 
   Bottlenecks in user provisioning slowing down productivity (i.e., manual provisioning) 
 

<p>and more critically,</p>

 
   Security vulnerabilities from inconsistent user deprovisioning 
 

<p>This is where you come in as a partner. By integrating with Okta through SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), a standard for managing users, you can offer enterprise customers a solution that addresses these pain points.</p>

 Why System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is your gateway to enterprise success 

<p>It facilitates:</p>
 
   Real-time user synchronization, which keeps customer organizations agile with instant updates as employees join, leave, or move within the company 
   Automated lifecycle management, which eliminates manual processes with streamlined provisioning, updates, and de-provisioning 
   Enhanced security controls, which give enterprises precise control over user access and permissions 
   Standards-based integration, which leverages open Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols for reliable, interoperable, and consistent implementation 
   Reduced operational complexity, which helps customers save on their identity management costs and overhead 
 

 Accelerate your growth by joining the Okta Integration Network (OIN) 
<p>And once you have a SCIM-compliant integration with Okta, we invite you to <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/">Okta’s Integration Network (OIN)</a>. Here, you can unlock potential growth by tapping into Okta’s massive customer base of 18,000+ organizations, including leading companies and government institutions that rely on Okta as their identity security foundation. Furthermore, fast-track enterprise deals with your pre-built integration and reduces sales friction with verified enterprise-ready status. More importantly, you’ll be able to differentiate your offering with premium security features.</p>

 How to submit your SCIM integration to the Okta Integration Network (OIN) 
<p>Here is a video walkthrough on creating your SCIM provisioning instance for OIN testing and submission.</p>

 
            
         

<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer Account</a> 
   Runscope test links (2): <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/scim/main/#runscope-crud-tests">CRUD</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/scim-provisioning-integration-prepare/main/#test-your-scim-api">SPEC</a> tests 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/submit-oin-app/scim/main/#manual-okta-scim-integration-tests">Manual Okta SCIM integration tests</a> 
   Provisioning-enabled instance and confirmation 
 

<p>Lastly, you must have a publicly accessible SCIM server for Okta to send requests to. I used the SCIM server from this <a>Enterprise Workshop on SCIM</a> to demo the submission process.</p>

<p>It’s been a big year for Bluesky! As 2024 draws to a close, I’m excited to take a look back at everything that’s happened in the past year.</p>
<p>Alongside users, creators, and the AT Protocol developer community, Bluesky has grown from an invite-only app with only 3 million people to a public app of over 25.9 million people. In the last month and a half, Bluesky has grown by over 13M people, with organizations reporting a 2-10x increase in the amount of <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/11-29-2024-engagement">engagement</a> they receive.</p>
<p>Here’s a look back at some key milestones of this past year:</p>
 Opening Our Doors 
<p>Bluesky officially launched in just February of this year. When we opened the app to the public, we removed invites, which were a tool to help us grow the app sustainably and safely.</p>
<p>At launch, Bluesky had an early community of 3M people. One week later, over a million new users had signed up.</p>
 Implementing Federation 
<p>Just weeks after our public launch, we achieved a long-standing goal by implementing <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">federation</a>. This milestone represents our commitment to creating an open, interconnected social network that respects user choice. Users can now run their own personal data servers, and thousands have opted to use their own servers instead of Bluesky’s infrastructure.</p>
 Stackable Moderation 
<p>In March, we launched <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">labelers</a>, the first piece of our stackable moderation system that empowers users to take control of their experience. Additionally, we open-sourced Ozone, a collaborative moderation tool that enables independent organizations and people to more easily run their own moderation service.</p>
 More Big Features 
<p>In 2024, we also launched:</p>
 
 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3kmjbfqrrbu2t">Hashtags</a>: We added hashtags to make finding content easier. 
 <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/05-22-2024-direct-messages">Direct Messages</a>: In May, we launched DMs, creating new avenues for connection. 
 <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs">Starter packs</a>: In June, we launched starter packs, helping communities onboard to Bluesky more easily. 
 <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-11-2024-video">Video Sharing:</a> In September, we launched videos. 
 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3le6bze3nus2c">Trending topics</a>: In December, right around Christmas, we launched trending topics. 
 
 Many Small Features 
<p>We also launched:</p>
 
 Account deactivation (June), 
 Priority notifications (July), 
 Self-moderation tools like detach quotes and hide reply (August), 
 Pinned posts (October), and 
 The thread composer (November). 
 
 Looking forward to 2025 
<p>Building on this year's achievements, we're excited to introduce more features and improvements. Your feedback continues to shape Bluesky’s evolution, and we deeply appreciate the trust you've placed in Bluesky this year.</p>

           RNMB Apollo launches from SD Northern River

<p>The Royal Navy has reached a key milestone in autonomous mine-hunting with its first trial of an uncrewed boat from a commercial vessel, showcasing Thales technology.</p>
<p>A recent trial at the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, marked a significant milestone for the Royal Navy’s Mine &amp; Threat Exploration Group. The Royal Navy Motor Boat (RNMB) Apollo, a small uncrewed vessel designed to detect and neutralize mine threats, was successfully launched from SD Northern River, a commercial ship serving as a ‘platform of opportunity.’ This trial showcased the rapid deployment capability of autonomous mine-hunting technology in real-world conditions.</p>
<p>Apollo managed to detect exercise mines, even in notoriously challenging locations, demonstrating its advanced detection capabilities. Conducted in difficult water depths and coastal currents, the trial underscored the potential for Maritime Mine Counter-Measure (MMCM) technology to be swiftly integrated into operational fleets.</p>
 A Groundbreaking Collaboration 
<p>Andy Lapsley, DE&amp;S Mine-Hunting Capability (MHC) Team Leader, emphasized the importance of the trial:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the result of years of hard work and collaboration by the MHC team, and it demonstrates our commitment to advancing mine counter-measure technology. We’re not just testing equipment; we’re building an innovative, flexible capability that will play a key role in safeguarding the UK’s maritime interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Apollo was manufactured under a contract with Thales, and following the successful trial, it will undergo retrofit and upgrades before being delivered to the Royal Navy in late 2025. The MMCM programme, valued at €430 million, has already created over 200 jobs across the UK, underscoring its impact on both defence and the economy.</p>
 A New Era in Naval Operations 
<p>This trial represented the first successful integration of MMCM technology onto a commercial vessel, a crucial step that demonstrates the potential of using such platforms as ‘floating bases’ for certain operations. Its success paves the way for future deployments, with Thales playing a key role in evolving maritime operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Maritime Mine Counter-Measure (MMCM) programme has advanced significantly, bringing advanced autonomous mine-hunting equipment closer to operational readiness for the Royal Navy and French Marine Nationale. Managed by the Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR), this programme aims to enhance the naval mine warfare capabilities of both nations using cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commander Daniel Herridge, Commanding Officer of the Royal Navy’s Mine &amp; Threat Exploration Group, commented:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>This milestone reinforces our commitment to modernizing mine counter-measure technology and integrating it into our operations. The Mine &amp; Threat Exploitation Group is proud to continue supporting the enterprise and driving forward these trials, which are critical to advancing our capabilities and safeguarding the UK’s interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Philippe Commarmond, Director of Thales’ International Mine Warfare Sector, added:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The MMCM programme is the result of an ambitious vision set by the UK and France back in 2015 to transform naval mine warfare. We are proud to be part of this journey, which is now positioning both nations at the forefront of autonomous maritime systems.</p>
</blockquote>
 What’s Next? 
<p>This trial marks a significant leap forward in the Royal Navy’s mission to enhance mine counter-measure technology and operational flexibility. As the programme progresses, the integration of these innovative systems will continue to shape the future of naval mine warfare, ensuring the UK remains at the cutting edge of maritime security.</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, the MMCM team will continue refining autonomous capabilities, ensuring they are ready for operational deployment in the coming years. With the next phase of trials and retrofitting of Apollo already underway, this breakthrough represents just the beginning of what promises to be a new era in autonomous maritime operations.<br>

We have actively worked with <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/erc-3643-achieves-widespread-adoption-with-mas-recognition-and-support-from-92-members">92 industry leaders in the ERC3643 Association</a> to advance the standard by contributing to concrete projects.</p>
<p>Moreover, ERC-3643 has gained significant traction from large organizations, being used or referenced in industry reports by ABN AMRO, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, ESMA, BCG, KPMG, and Deloitte. Recently, it was recognized by the Singapore regulator MAS for enforcing compliance for tokenized funds and debt in the Project Guardian.</p>

<p>Enabling DeFi via onchain data management and shared liquidity catalog</p>
<p>Assets issued with ERC-3643 automatically receive an AssetID smart contract. This built-in onchain asset identity enables data enrichment like NAV, ESG proofs, and ratings. ERC-3643 tokens are accessible through a shared onchain catalog with a unified data set, allowing seamless DeFi interaction while adhering to built-in compliance rules.</p>
<p>Step by step, we have started creating a unified Catalog of tokenized assets that includes token data, asset data, stakeholder data, and offering data. This catalog will enable distributors (regulated exchanges, OTC platforms, dApps, neobrokers, etc.) to easily select assets for distribution to their respective audiences.</p>
<p>To maximize transactions and interoperability between distributors, we have also created DINO, a shared liquidity protocol on the blockchain. DINO is a decentralized network enabling the distribution of compliant tokenized assets. The system leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the publishing and settlement of digital assets, transforming how issuers, their distributors, and&nbsp; investors conduct transactions.</p>
<p>At its core, the system enables parties to post and browse trading intentions, known as Offers, via token-specific distribution smart contracts. This innovation ensures that all offers are transparent and accessible on the blockchain, creating a continuous live feed of available trading intentions for all participants to see. It is now ready for prime time. 2025 will be epic!</p>
<p>The Foundation is Built: What’s Next for Tokenization?</p>
<p>This year, we’ve built a solid foundation for onchain finance with all the essential building blocks. 2025 will be a year of accelerating institutional adoption as the buy-side begins to fully&nbsp; benefit from the tokenization format. We will see more and more applications leveraging compliant tokenized assets, and Tokeny is ready to lead this transformation. Thank you for being with us on this journey.</p>
<p>We wish you a great holiday season and a happy new year!</p>

<p>Back in November 2024, my article “<a href="https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.108">Token Lifetimes and Security in OAuth 2.0: Best Practices and Emerging Trends</a>” was published in the <a href="https://idpro.org/body-of-knowledge/">IDPro® Body of Knowledge</a>, and wow—over 1,600 people have already checked it out! If you’re one of those people who clicked on the article but didn’t quite have time to read it (or bookmarked it for “later” but haven’t circled back yet), this post is for you.</p>



<p>I love to read—and I’m lucky enough to have the time to do it when I need to. Not everyone gets that chance, and let’s be honest, some people just aren’t ready, willing, or able to dive into a long article. And that’s okay! You do you, boo; it takes all kinds to make this crazy world come together. </p>



 OAuth 2.0 Tokens – the sound version 



<p>Because I enjoy messing around with technology, I decided to see if Google’s <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com">NotebookLM</a> might produce something that would help people who want a differently-consumable format of the Tokens article. While I personally like the written version better (did I mention I like to read?) this didn’t turn out too badly.</p>







<p>If you’re looking for something in between—like a quick outline to decide if you want to spend 20 minutes listening to the AI-generated podcast or however long it takes to read a 15-page article—here’s a brief summary to help you figure out what works best for you.</p>



 Tokens in Summary 



<p>The summary was also generated out of the NotebookLM interface. I’d love to hear what you think about making my content come through this way! Enjoy!</p>



 Executive Summary 



<p>This document analyzes the security implications of short-lived and long-lived tokens within the OAuth 2.0 framework. It highlights the benefits of using short-lived, narrowly scoped tokens to mitigate security risks such as token replay attacks, while acknowledging specific scenarios where long-lived tokens might be considered. The document also explores emerging trends like Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP), risk-based token lifetimes, and sender-constrained tokens, which aim to enhance security without compromising usability. Overall, the document emphasizes that while there are situations where long lived tokens may make sense, short-lived tokens are generally best practice.</p>



 Introduction to Tokens in OAuth 2.0 



 
 Tokens as Identity Representation: Tokens are digital objects representing claims or attributes of an entity (user, device, or process) used in authentication and authorization protocols. They enable secure communication without requiring constant re-validation. 



 Quote: “A token is a digital object that can represent a set of claims or attributes about an entity, such as a user, device, or process, typically used in authentication and authorization protocols.” 



 Stateless vs. Stateful Tokens: Tokens can be stateless (containing all necessary information) or stateful (requiring the server to maintain session information). 



 Bearer vs. Client-Bound Tokens: Tokens can be bearer tokens (usable by anyone holding them) or client-bound (tied to a specific client). 



 Quote: “Tokens can be classified as bearer tokens, which are usable by anyone in possession of them, or client-bound tokens (sometimes called sender-constrained tokens…)…” 



 Scope and Minimization: Limiting the scope of a token (permissions for only specific resources or actions) is critical for reducing security risks. The principle of “least privilege” should be applied. 



 Quote: “One of the most effective strategies when issuing tokens is to narrowly scope their permissions. A narrowly scoped token is designed to grant access to only a specific resource or a limited set of actions rather than offering broad, unrestricted access.” 



 Tokens vs Credentials: Tokens and credentials are not the same thing. Credentials are used for authentication, tokens are used for authorization. 
 



 Short-Lived Tokens: The Security Standard 



 
 Definition: Short-lived tokens expire quickly (minutes or hours) limiting the window of opportunity for attackers. 



 Quote: “Short-lived tokens are designed to expire after a brief period—usually minutes or hours—thereby minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit them if they are intercepted or compromised.” 



 Reduced Attack Surface: Short token lifetimes significantly reduce the impact of token compromise. Even if a token is intercepted, it quickly becomes invalid. 



 Quote: “One of the big benefits of short-lived tokens is the reduction of the attack window (i.e., the length of time that an attacker could exploit endpoints).” 



 Enhanced Security through Rotation: Frequent token rotation enforces the need for persistent attackers to repeatedly intercept new tokens, increasing the chance of detection. 



 Quote: “Short-lived tokens play a crucial role in reducing the impact of token compromise by enforcing frequent token rotation.” 



 Stateless Architectures: Short lived tokens fit well in stateless architectures, eliminating the need to maintain session state on the server. 



 Integration with Security Mechanisms: Short-lived tokens should be used with other security practices like token binding and revocation. 



 Quote: “The standards also encourage the combination of short-lived tokens with other security mechanisms, such as client-bound tokens or token binding, which ensures that tokens can only be used by specific clients…” 
 



 The Role of Refresh Tokens 



 
 Purpose: Refresh tokens are long-lived credentials used to obtain new access tokens without requiring re-authentication. 



 Security Considerations: Compromised refresh tokens can grant extended access, so they need protection. 



 Security Measures:Refresh Token Rotation: Reissue refresh tokens upon every use 



 Client Binding: Cryptographically bind refresh tokens to specific clients or devices. 



 Reauthentication: Require periodic reauthentication before issuing new refresh tokens. 



 Token Revocation: Revoke both refresh and access tokens upon suspicious activity. 



 Secure Storage: Refresh tokens should be stored securely by the client. 
 



 Risks of Long-Lived Tokens 



 
 Definition: Long-lived tokens remain valid for extended periods. API keys and session tokens used in mobile apps are common examples. 



 Prolonged Unauthorized Access: If compromised, attackers gain persistent access, especially if revocation mechanisms are weak or not real time. 



 Quote: “If these long-lived tokens are compromised, attackers can use them to gain persistent unauthorized access to systems or resources without being detected for an extended period.” 



 Token Replay Vulnerabilities: Long-lived tokens are vulnerable to replay attacks where an intercepted token is reused by an attacker. 



 Quote: “In a token replay attack, an attacker intercepts a token…and reuses it to impersonate a legitimate user.” 



 Difficulties with Revocation: Manual revocation or waiting for expiration creates a window for continued exploitation. 



 Increased Attack Surface: Longer validity allows attackers more time to explore and exploit vulnerabilities. 



 Difficulty in Enforcing Least Privilege: Long-lived tokens often grant broader permissions than necessary, making any compromise have greater impact. 
 



 When Long-Lived Tokens May Be Appropriate 



 
 Reduced Overhead in Token Renewal: Less frequent requests to the authentication server. 



 Use case: Batch processing or long-running data analytics. 



 Improved Performance in Stateless Systems: Reduces need for constant issuance of new tokens. 



 Use case: High request APIs 



 Service-to-Service Communication: Efficient communication within a highly trusted environment. 



 Use case: Microservice architectures within secure internal networks. 
 



 Emerging Trends and Future Directions 



 
 Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP): Real-time assessment and adjustment of permissions, enabling longer token lifespans with dynamic revocation. 



 Quote: “CAEP enables access tokens to have longer lifespans without compromising security. This is achieved by combining periodic risk assessments with real-time revocation capabilities.” 



 Risk-Based Token Lifetimes: Dynamic adjustment of token expiration times based on real-time risk analysis. 



 Proof of Possession (PoP) and Sender-Constrained Tokens: Cryptographic proof of token ownership. Standards like DPoP and Mutual TLS reduce token replay risks. 



 Enhanced Revocation Mechanisms: Efforts to develop real-time token revocation standards. 
 



 Conclusion 



 
 Short-Lived Tokens as Best Practice: Short-lived, narrowly scoped tokens combined with client binding and strong cryptographic standards are the best practice for mitigating security risks. 



 Zero Trust: If your organization uses Zero Trust principles, then there is no concept of a trusted environment. 



 Balancing Security and Usability: Aim for a balance between security, usability, and performance. 



 Evolving Landscape: Token management frameworks are evolving, with emerging standards allowing for longer lived tokens under strict monitoring and policy enforcement 



 Organization Risk Posture: An organization’s risk posture should guide the definition of “short” and “long”. However, regardless of the definition, strict scoping, token binding, and robust revocation must be in place. 
 



 Actionable Items 



 
 Review and Update Token Lifetimes: Evaluate current token expiration policies and transition to shorter lifetimes where possible. 



 Implement Client-Bound Tokens: Employ client-bound or sender-constrained tokens where appropriate. 



 Implement Refresh Token Rotation: Ensure that refresh tokens are rotated on every use. 



 Enhance Revocation Mechanisms: Implement robust revocation processes and monitor token usage. 



 Stay Informed: Follow emerging standards like CAEP and adapt strategies based on advancements. 
 



<p>This briefing document provides a detailed overview of token management within the OAuth 2.0 framework, emphasizing the importance of short-lived tokens and the need for a comprehensive security approach. By adopting the recommendations provided, your organization can significantly improve its security posture and protect against various token-based attacks.</p>

Thu, 12/19/2024 - 14:00


             
 Within the framework of the European Defence Fund (EDF), Thales is leading the SEACURE project to achieve a sovereign European capability in future Anti-Submarine and Seabed Warfare. 
 The SEACURE programme began in November 2024 for a duration of 45 months, and involves 35 European partners from 13 EU member states. 
 Building on the successful completion of the EDIDP (European Defence Industrial Development Programme) SEANICE project at the end of 2023, the aim of SEACURE is to achieve a sovereign European capability in future autonomous Anti-Submarine and Seabed Warfare.

<p>The world is facing rising tensions in many regions, with asymmetric threats and the resurgence of high-intensity operations, particularly at sea. It is the case near the borders of the European Union, in the Middle East, and the Far East. This highlights how critical it is for nations to control safety at sea and to protect their maritime infrastructures. Moreover, the exploitation of marine resources, including offshore wind farms, demands continuous monitoring to prevent malicious actions by state and non-state adversaries.</p>
<p>Recent events are accelerating plans throughout NATO and European countries to protect maritime infrastructure of national interest. Such plans embrace new operational theatres, and require new capabilities and new methods of operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main objective of SEACURE is to develop and demonstrate at sea, by 2028, an integrated system of systems aimed at successfully performing autonomous joint Anti-Submarine Warfare and Seabed Warfare operations and protecting critical maritime infrastructure. It focuses on the detection, classification, identification and tracking of underwater threats in challenging conditions, using air, surface and underwater drones. SEACURE will offer a versatile defence system for such operations, increasing the level of autonomy, based on open, agile, modular and scalable system-of-systems architecture. In addition, it will be interoperable and ready for collaborative combat. </p>
<p>SEACURE not only strengthens maritime security today, but also lays the groundwork for a more resilient and cooperative global maritime future.</p>
<p>About SEACURE</p>
<p>SEACURE is proposed as a continuation of the EDIDP SEANICE research project that ended in November 2023. It offers a new way of protecting our critical maritime infrastructures, and guarantees the freedom to operate in our own waters, detecting and protecting against any external threats.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://datarella.com/confidential-computing-for-industry-4-0/">first part</a> of this <a href="https://datarella.com/datarella-takes-part-in-new-industry-4-0-research-project-cosmic-x/">Cosmic-X</a> blogpost series, we evaluated various blockchain platforms for their suitability in Industry 4.0 and explained why we chose the <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> with its confidential computing capabilities. Today, we’ll explore how we use the Secret Network to secure machine data integrity from its origin to its consumption.</p>
<p></p>
 Need for Data Integrity 
<p>Securing data integrity in Industry 4.0 is crucial because systems and devices rely on accurate data to function effectively. Tampered or incorrect data can lead to poor decisions, operational failures, and vulnerabilities in key sectors like manufacturing and logistics. With IoT and AI driving Industry 4.0, maintaining data accuracy ensures reliable operations, protects sensitive information, and prevents cyber threats that disrupt businesses and critical infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ispirer.com/blog/data-integrity-during-migration-5-best-practices"></a></p>
<p>Anchoring data close to its source is essential for securing integrity across the entire data processing chain, which often involves multiple distributed systems. For machines, this means securing the data before it leaves the device. At the same time, the system must protect the anchored data from tampering after export. Blockchain’s immutable nature aligns perfectly with this paradigm. That’s why we built a Wallet Service on top of the Secret Network. This service integrates seamlessly into any machine to secure its data integrity in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner.</p>
 Wallet Service 
<p>The Wallet Service acts as a gateway for communication with the Secret Network. It deploys onto any machine infrastructure that supports <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. By using the Wallet Service, machines interact directly with the blockchain and its smart contracts. The service assigns each machine a unique identity through a public-private key pair. With its private key, the machine signs and broadcasts transactions to anchor its data on the Secret Network. The blockchain’s encryption ensures that no unauthorized third party can access the data. For details on how the network reaches consensus despite encryption, refer to our previous <a href="https://datarella.com/confidential-computing-for-industry-4-0/">post</a>.</p>
 Integration 
<p>To simplify integration, the Wallet Service offers a straightforward REST API with two endpoints. The ingress endpoint accepts a batch of data in a defined structure for anchoring. After receiving the data, the Wallet Service hashes it and stores the resulting hash in the service’s smart contract through a transaction on the Secret Network. This process creates an immutable fingerprint, allowing anyone to verify the integrity of a data batch through the Wallet Service’s verification endpoint. Since data verification typically occurs in systems other than the one that supplied the data, the Wallet Service supports deployment anywhere. In distributed data processing scenarios like Cosmic-X, entities that consume data instantiate a Wallet Service to verify data integrity before making decisions. For example, an AI service provider might deploy a Wallet Service in its cloud environment to verify data before using it for training or inference.</p>
 Requirements 
<p>Two conditions must be met for this workflow to function: first, the verifying Wallet Service must have the appropriate viewing key from the machine that supplied the data. Otherwise, it cannot decrypt and query the fingerprints stored in the smart contract. Second, the format and schema of the data batch must remain standardized across the processing chain. To achieve this, we developed a Data Integrity Protocol as the foundation of the Wallet Service.</p>
 Data Integrity Protocol 
<p>To anchor and verify data batches reliably, the Wallet Service requires a standardized protocol. Both the data anchoring and verification processes must adhere to a common data format, schema, and canonicalization standard. For Cosmic-X, we chose JSON as the data format and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8785">RFC 8785</a> as the canonicalization algorithm. Canonicalization ensures reliable cryptographic operations on JSON data by defining methods for handling whitespace, data types, and objects.</p>
 Batch Structure 
<p>Considering use case requirements and the limitations of edge and cloud environments in Cosmic-X, we define a data batch as one hour’s worth of sensor data collected from a machine. The figure below shows an extract of a data batch collected from one of the use cases. The batch includes a metadata object used only for the Wallet Service’s business logic. This metadata contains key-value pairs such as the batchId and placeholders for the payload hash and the transaction hash on the Secret Network blockchain. The payload, which the system hashes during anchoring, consists of discrete sensor measurements. Each measurement uses a composite key created by concatenating the variable name with the Unix timestamp of its recording. The measurements include key-value pairs for variable name, timestamp, absolute value, and data type.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The batchId is the most critical part of a data batch. Since the Wallet Service uses it to anchor and later locate the data batch for verification, the batchId must be unique. In this setup, the batchId combines a machine ID with a Unix timestamp representing the time range of measurements in the batch, rounded to the nearest hour. For example, if machine <code>2080839</code> collects measurements from <code>11:01:23</code>&nbsp;to <code>11:59:43</code> on May 16, 2024, the batchId becomes <code>2080839_1715853600</code>.</p>
<p>In the next post, we’ll showcase how we integrated the Wallet Service with three live machines and an AI service to enable secure and accurate anomaly detection in machine components.</p>

  Thales to enhance vehicle access with reliable and secure contactless solutions
prezly

Thu, 12/19/2024 - 09:00


             
 Car industry players can rely on Thales to provide digital and physical solutions that improve car access experiences, while ensuring data security.  
 Thales’s offer encompasses a digital car key solution, whose implementation follows the Car Connectivity Consortium1 (CCC) standard. It is now completed by a brand-new contactless card, the Thales NFC CARd Key. The solutions enable car drivers to lock/unlock and start their vehicles using their smartphone or their card. 
 Drawing on its 15+ years of experience in the automotive industry, Thales delivers proven on-board car solutions leveraging its connectivity and cybersecurity expertise. 
 
<p>Thales, a global leader in advanced technologies, provides car manufacturers with safe and hassle-free solutions to expand their customers’ vehicle access experiences. The offer leverages the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/industries/automotive/use-cases/virtual-car-key">digital car key</a> solution and the smart <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/industries/automotive/nfc-card-key">NFC CARd Key</a>, a new cutting-edge and customisable solution. Designed to complement the digital key, this innovative NFC-based card offers a reliable alternative in the event of disruptions on users’ smartphones, and allows drivers to unlock and start their cars with a simple ‘tap’. ​ </p>
<p>The automotive industry is rapidly shifting from traditional to digital solutions, and the digital car key market is expected to grow at an impressive annual rate of over 21% from 2023 to 20312. Thales is addressing this growing demand, leveraging the CCC digital key functionality, demonstrating strong <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/industries/automotive/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> expertise into digital car key solution and securely creating and storing credentials in a vehicle, in a mobile device and/or in a contactless card.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>After digitally enrolling drivers’ credentials upon the purchase of a car, Thales’s digital car key system securely allows drivers to enter and start the vehicle using their smartphone, while the mobile device is still in the pocket or in the bag. Such flexible solutions enable a wide range of automotive use cases, making car access and sharing significantly easier. Private car owners can digitally share their access with family members or friends, while car rental firms can do the same with customers, physically removing the need to pick up car keys at a rental desk. Meanwhile, the introduction of Thales’s NFC CARd Key perfectly supports scenarios when a smartphone might not be available.</p>
<p>Functioning like a contactless payment card, the NFC CARd Key establishes secure, encrypted communication with the vehicle, allowing instant access and engine start, just like the mobile app. With over 10 years of durability in the field, and a strong resistance to high temperatures, it ensures robust protection, while enabling a smooth and simple ‘tap-enter-and-go’ experience. Beyond its technical features, the NFC CARd Key presents a valuable branding opportunity for automotive manufacturers, as its design can be customised, creating a unique and singular card thanks to Thales's wide range of printing options (3D effect, tactile varnish, etc.).</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thales brings over 15 years of experience in delivering connectivity and cybersecurity solutions to the automotive industry, with a deep understanding of customer requirements, from daily usage conditions to compliance with stringent standards. This extends to data security expertise in vehicles and mobile devices, providing peace of mind through a robust and resilient approach to cybersecurity,” stated Christine Caviglioli, VP Automotive at Thales. “With the launch of the NFC CARd Key, Thales complements its vehicle access offer with a singular innovation. Our ambition is to empower automakers and drivers alike with a flexible approach to secure mobility.”</p></blockquote>
<p>1 The Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC), an organisation that promotes seamless smartphone-to-car connectivity, has set the standard for digital car keys, enabling drivers to unlock and start their vehicles using smartphones or smartwatches. ​ </p>

 The Need for Advanced Security in Healthcare 



<p>In the wake of substantial data breaches, such as the significant <a href="http://Meta%20Description:%20Discover%20how%20Extrimian's%20decentralized%20identity%20solutions%20like%20ID%20Connect%20and%20SSI%20API%20enhance%20data%20security%20in%20healthcare,%20ensuring%20privacy%20and%20compliance." title="">ransomware attack in Costa Rica’s healthcare system</a>, the need for fortified data security has never been more apparent. Extrimian’s cutting-edge solutions, including ID Connect and SSI API, leverage the power of decentralized identity to safeguard sensitive health data against emerging cyber threats.</p>

<p></p>



 Decentralized Identity: A Shield Against Data Breaches 



<p>Decentralized identity technology serves as the cornerstone of Extrimian’s approach, employing DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials) to create a robust framework resistant to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>



 Streamlining Healthcare Processes 



<p>Extrimian’s technology not only enhances security but also streamlines administrative procedures, reducing costs and saving time. This efficiency is crucial for healthcare providers aiming to improve service delivery and patient care quality.</p>



 Improving Patient Experience with Self-Sovereign Identity 



<p>By integrating self-sovereign identity models, Extrimian places control directly in the hands of patients, allowing for a transparent and user-friendly way to manage personal health data. This shift enhances patient trust and satisfaction by providing a more personalized healthcare experience.</p>



 Privacy and Compliance: Securing Patient Data 



<p>Extrimian’s use of the<a href="https://quarkid.org" title=""> QuarkID protocol </a>ensures that all data transactions meet global standards for data protection, such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). This protocol is essential for maintaining privacy and securing sensitive information within the health sector.</p>



 Now what? A Proactive Approach to Secure Healthcare 



<p>Extrimian’s decentralized identity solutions represent a proactive approach to secure healthcare data management. By adopting these technologies, healthcare providers can protect sensitive information, comply with stringent regulations, and improve overall patient care.</p>

  DBS Taiwan Partners Thales to bring bio-sourced payment cards to Asia

Wed, 12/18/2024 - 10:39


             
 Thales will reissue over two million cards to DBS Taiwan to support the bank’s largest credit card renewal operation following its merger with Citibank.&nbsp; 
 Out of these, more than one million sustainable credit and debit cards are made from Polylactic Acid (PLA), a bio-sourced, more eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic, making DBS Taiwan the largest issuer of PLA cards in Asia. 
 
<p>In 2020, supported by Thales, DBS Taiwan issued Asia’s first bio-sourced credit card in their aim to promote customer awareness and use of environmentally friendly payment products. Fast forward to 2024, and Thales is now helping DBS Taiwan become the largest issuer of sustainable payment cards in Asia.</p>
<p></p> 
 
  
   
 
<p>Through this project, Thales is helping DBS Taiwan revamp its Eco Card as well as supporting the re-issuance of over 2 million cards following DBS Taiwan’s acquisition of Citi’s consumer banking business in Taiwan. &nbsp;Working within a tight timeline set by Taiwan’s financial authorities, Thales is helping produce up to 30 card body artworks to support DBS Taiwan’s ambition to become the largest and most environmentally friendly international commercial bank in Taiwan. More than a million of these cards are crafted from bio-sourced Polylactic Acid (PLA), aligning with DBS' ambitions to prioritise more eco-friendly products. The remaining selection showcases DBS commitment to innovation with Thales' range of premium metal cards and LED Artlight cards.</p>
<p>Derived from renewable resources such as non-edible corn, the Thales Bio-sourced PLA card is one of the most <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/banking-payment/cards/eco-friendly-credit-card">eco-friendly products</a> in the market. The card is the world’s first UL Environmental Claim Validation (ECV)* certified eco-friendly payment card, and its bio-based component has been lab tested and accredited by worldwide science safety leader UL. Thales is a worldwide leader in modern and responsible payment solutions; the PLA cards are part of a comprehensive eco-friendly product portfolio, with over 50 million PLA cards already delivered globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, there is a forecast of 235 tons of carbon offset from the cooperation with Thales Carbon-Neutral Program. DBS Taiwan has also embedded the concept of green consumption into card value proposition such as rebate in low-carbon transportation, and cooperated with DBS Foundation to encourage cardholders to enjoy a more sustainable life with the goods and services through championing social entrepreneurship.</p>
 &nbsp;“Thales is honoured to collaborate with DBS Taiwan in their initiatives to offer environmentally and socially impactful solutions to its customers and to be Asia’s sustainable payment solutions leader. As a global pioneer in advanced technology, Thales is also at the forefront of modern card issuance, with an extensive range of solutions that includes cards produced from bio-sourced PLA, ocean-recycled plastic, recycled PVC, and even sustainable wood. We look forward to deepening our partnership with DBS as we build towards a safer, greener and more inclusive future for all.”

  <p>In the post-COVID era, higher education institutions face unprecedented challenges in managing student matriculation and access governance. With IT departments stretched thin and an influx of in-person students, the risk of over-provisioning and compliance violations has skyrocketed. Balancing efficiency with data security and privacy concerns with FERPA, HIPAA, and other regulations has become a critical issue for HigherEd CIOs and IT professionals.</p>
<p>Modern technology offers a solution through automation of student enrollment processes and access reviews. By implementing "touchless" matriculation systems and streamlined user access controls, institutions can significantly reduce the burden on IT resources while enhancing security and compliance. This approach allows for efficient management of student identities across multiple systems, from initial enrollment to graduation or departure.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will discuss why student identity management presents an "IAM on steroids" challenge. He will explore how the high turnover of student identities surpasses typical workforce IAM issues, and explain why integrating IAM, GRC, and Line of Business systems is crucial for addressing these unique challenges in higher education.</p>
<p>Greg Wendt, Executive Director Security Solutions at Pathlock, will present practical strategies for achieving automated student matriculation and streamlined access reviews.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Non-Human Identity Management: Tailoring IAM for AI Agents 
<p>The rise of AI agents as active participants in organizational workflows introduces unique identity and access management (IAM) challenges.&nbsp;Unlike human identities, AI agents often operate autonomously and may refer to sensitive data or interact with secure systems in order to achieve their assigned goals. Managing their access effectively requires a paradigm shift, as human-oriented IAM methods can leave AI agents over-provisioned and create security risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The paradigm shift we’re talking about is AIdentity: the crossover of IAM with AI. AI needs identities and built-to-purpose identity management. IAM also can massively benefit from AI for automation, predictive analysis, and decision-making for governance and risk assessment. To learn more about KuppingerCole’s take on AIdentity, listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/aidentity-crucial-link-between-ai-identity">this podcast</a>. This post’s focus is on IAM for AI agents, and the complex identity relationships that emerge when using AI bots.&nbsp;</p>
 What is an AI Agent?&nbsp; 
<p>AI agents are software entities designed to autonomously carry out tasks in pursuit of specific goals set by humans. Backed by large language models (LLMs) and connected to tools via APIs, these agents break down high-level objectives into actionable tasks. For example, an AI agent deployed in customer support might independently analyze user queries, craft responses, and escalate complex cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the AI agents market projected to grow from $5.1 billion in 2024 to $47.1 billion by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate of 44.8%, their adoption is set to redefine operational workflows. <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/6007585/ai-agents-market-agent-role-productivity-and">Research and Markets</a> forecasts this rapid expansion, driven by tailored AI solutions addressing specialized industry needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While AI agents bring transformative potential, their autonomous nature demands robust security frameworks to safeguard actions and ensure accountability.&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges in IAM for AI Agents&nbsp; 
<p>AI agents have complex identity relationships by default. Imagine the scenario where an AI agent replaces an executive assistant, which among other tasks works on behalf of an employee to make travel bookings or arrange meetings. The decisions and actions taken by that AI agent must be transparently documented as completed by the agent, not the employee. The agent must have access to the necessary data to make useful decisions (such as access to the employee’s calendar), but only for the strict time that the agent is performing its task. To have the appropriate level auditability and explainability the AI agent must have a distinct identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of many scenarios, and a basic one at that. An AI agent that directly fills a human role that is typically well defined is easier to understand and anticipate than the cross-cutting, interdepartmental roles that AI agents can fill. Treating AI agents like human users in IAM systems leads to significant risks. Traditional identity frameworks may provision roles and permissions based on static attributes and far over-provision the agents causing risk of lateral movement in the case of a security breach. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a place to start, consider these four concepts about AIdentity of AI agents:&nbsp;</p>
 
 AI Agents Handle Dynamic Contexts&nbsp; 
 
<p>Tasks often span across departments. For example, an AI agent may access classified files for one task and send sensitive emails for another. Individually, these actions are permissible, but together, they could violate organizational policies.&nbsp;</p>
 
 AI Agents Must Have Just Enough Access, not Persistent Access&nbsp; 
 
<p>More so than humans, AI agents must not have persistent access to resources because it creates vulnerabilities and increases the attack surface. However, human IAM solutions appropriated for AI Agents may use hardcoded credentials, service accounts, or API keys, which can provide continuous access to underlying resources and unnecessarily increase risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather, AI Agents should have just-in-time (JIT) and just-enough-access (JEA) provisioning. Each access request should be dynamically evaluated against policy frameworks, with ephemeral tokens replacing static credentials.&nbsp;</p>
 
 AI Agents Must Have a Different Take on Authentication&nbsp; 
 
<p>Multifactor authentication (MFA) may give AI agents more access than they need, since MFA can include non-static credentials. For AI agents, authentication and authorization should be non-persistent and contextual. Authentication for AI agents ideally uses ephemeral credentials to secure communications between agents, APIs, and tools. &nbsp;</p>
 
 AI Agents Require Governance and Auditability:&nbsp; 
 
<p>Beyond access control, organizations must establish clear policies for AI agent actions, ensuring they align with business rules, legal requirements, and ethical guidelines. Audit trails must document every decision for accountability and compliance.&nbsp;</p>
 Identity Fabric for AI Agents&nbsp; 
<p>The KuppingerCole Identity Fabric provides a flexible and modular approach to identity management, making it well-suited to address non-human IAM needs. By integrating capabilities like dynamic access management, policy-based authorization, and governance, Identity Fabrics enable organizations to build secure, scalable, and adaptable IAM systems for AI agents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about how the Identity Fabric enables robust IAM for both human and non-human entities in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81426/identity-fabrics">Identity Fabrics Leadership Compass</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 Building a Secure Future&nbsp; 
<p>Managing AI agent identities effectively is a cornerstone of ensuring trust, accountability, and security in a rapidly digitizing world. Non-human IAM must prioritize dynamic, policy-driven approaches tailored to the unique needs of AI agents. By integrating solutions such as non-human authentication, authorization, and audit capabilities, organizations can securely harness the potential of AI agents while minimizing risks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This provocation is part of an ongoing conversation between Martin Lorenz and Emily Harris, centred on the role of design (and specifically Designers) in the context of an extractive economic system. A system that we are all complicit in yet which is systematically incompatible with life. These topics are not easy. In fact they are deeply uncomfortable. Why then do we, or might you, wish to engage with them? Perhaps because continuing to bury these inconvenient thoughts with busyness and self-justification is starting to feel slippery and insubstantial. A sickness we can’t quite identify but yearn to recover&nbsp;from.</p><p>Just because something is trending, it isn’t&nbsp;better</p><p>If you are a designer in your 20's or 30's you probably grew up with the term Branding. Growing up with something makes it hard to question it. It seems to be the normality you have to accept and adjust to. But the term Branding, as inoffensive as it seems, deserves a hard second&nbsp;look.</p><p>I (Martin Lorenz) am not in my 20’s or 30’s, I am in my late 40’s. When I studied design, Branding was called Corporate Design or Visual Identity Design or Corporate Visual Identity Design. Then came digital design (and the internet) and with a little delay, a wave of new terms popped up to respond to this new reality. Design studios known for being innovative invented a myriad of new terms to describe the new kind of Visual Identity Design: Liquid Identities, Fluid Identities, Evolving Identities, Generative Identities, Living Identities and Dynamic Identities.</p><p>When the new comes with force, and you are young, it is exciting. You feel born into a movement that will change the world. There are comprehensible arguments why the old must go and the new has to be fought for. I am no exception. Focusing on a more flexible and systemic approach to design corresponded to a feeling of that time. I knew very little about the new design terms, but as they came from my design heroes and sounded intriguing I did not question them. Authority and the promise of the new was sufficient to make me a devoted follower, until it was&nbsp;not.</p><p>I went back to University and started researching the flexible, systemic approach to design. Surprise, systems were always a part of design. Yes, it became more flexible through digital design, the internet and the devices we use, but what has been hyped as a completely new kind of design, has been, in its essence, around for centuries.</p><p>Selling something old by making it apparently new, is an old marketing trick. Invent a new term, and you are the only expert in this new market. Make it plausible, and you will find young followers to help you in your fight for your unique selling position (USP). Using an old term, that makes more sense, but makes you look outdated is bad for business.</p><p>While this reasoning is completely plausible in the economic environment that design currently serves, it does not mean it is a healthy way to think, act and relate to others. It shifts design’s focus away from a profession in service of society and towards an economic tool that firmly places profits before people, ego before ecosystem. As designers we have a choice: do we want design to be a culture or an industry?¹</p>Inspired by Mason, Walter George, Slave-Branding, 1853, Engraving<p>Why Branding is not just a&nbsp;term</p><p>You could argue that we are just talking about words and words are just words. They do no harm. In contrast, our work at Dark Matter Labs frequently highlights that words both constitute and express worldviews and that worldviews define how we see (or not see) and act (or not act). Words are not neutral; they can and often DO&nbsp;harm.</p><p>The Branding worldview comes from a gruesome etymology. The term has its origins in the branding of livestock or slaves. A logo was branded on the skin of animals² and humans³ to claim their ownership. The intrinsic value of these living beings was reduced to the singular value that could be extracted for private&nbsp;gain.</p><p>I (Emily Harris) would argue that the ability to collapse diverse values into singular measures of utility is the beating heart of our extractive economy. If we take a moment to think about this, it was an extraordinary shift in human philosophy and behaviour. Something only made possible by an emotional dissociation from all forms of life (including other humans). This separation, sometimes described as Othering⁴ is paradoxically the foundational rock of our modern&nbsp;economy.</p><blockquote>‘Enclosure and colonisation were necessary preconditions for the rise of European capitalism…..Something else was needed — something far subtler but nonetheless equally violent. Early capitalists not only had to find ways to compel people to work for them, they also had to change people’s beliefs. They had to change how people regarded the living world. Ultimately, capitalism required a new story about nature’. — Jason&nbsp;Hickel⁵</blockquote><p>Capitalism still needs that story for its own survival — my question to designers is whether this is a story that they are proud to&nbsp;uplift?</p><p>In accounting for economic activity we actively exclude aspects of the living world from our measures of success. There is even a term for it: externalities⁶, which basically means ‘something out there that we don’t need to deal with’. Following this logic, we do not have to deal with the value of life beyond its immediate (financial) value to us. An animal is food or clothing. A tree is lumbar. A human is useful labour. Nature is fodder for the foaming crucible of shareholder returns. Even culture and tradition delicately woven over centuries ends up being extracted. Property owners benefit from the culture of a neighbourhood, even though they did not contribute in any&nbsp;way.</p>Inspired by the book “What is post-branding? How to Counter Fundamentalist Marketplace Semiotics” by Oliver Vodeb, Jason Grant ​​<a href="https://www.setmargins.press/books/what-is-post-branding/">https://www.setmargins.press/books/what-is-post-branding/</a><p>Branding has consequences</p><p>Branding is superficial, but has deep consequences. Designers tend to focus on this thin layer between company and consumer, declaring it our entire world. A beautiful little world which revolves around aesthetics and craft. We (including I — Martin Lorenz) do not want to see the first or second order effects of our doing and the doing of the ones we support with our talent. Maybe it is time to measure the success of our work differently? Maybe we should focus on outcome and not output? Maybe the judges shouldn’t be our fellow designers, but all stakeholders involved in the before and after? Perhaps we should proactively ask those who currently have no&nbsp;voice?</p><p>Branding has colonized all aspects of life. We are supposed to love brands and define ourselves through them. It has become easier for us to remember and distinguish brands than animals or plants. We live in a colonized world of consumption. In the book Post-Branding Jason Grant and Oliver Vodeb draw a link between today’s Branding and the Branding of Nazi Germany: ‘This Nazi history is particularly interesting because although these are antecedents, and what we now call branding is very much a contemporary neoliberal phenomenon, the parallels are striking. For example, counter to what we might think, Nazis actually wanted to abolish the state — for them it was just a means to an end. Does this sound familiar in today’s neoliberal context?’⁷⁸ Comparing today’s brands to the abhorrence of the Nazi regime might seem extreme, but given the fracturing geopolitical context can we afford to squirm away from this kind of friction? We would firmly argue that the answer is&nbsp;no.</p><p>Unlearning Branding</p><p>Where and how can we question what design does for whom and how?⁹ If design schools are becoming companies, students become customers and design degrees get branded like products, we will remain ‘prisoners’ in an unlocked global cell, passively compliant in a violent economic system. If we stay in our little design world, discussing output instead of outcome, how can we participate in this huge conversation called culture?¹⁰ If we want to change how design is used, which ultimately also changes how design is made, we need to ask the big questions together with all stakeholders of&nbsp;life:</p>  What does living well&nbsp;mean?  How do we design into this&nbsp;future?  How do we do this together?  <p>The answers will most likely play out as an infinite conversation. A dance born out of reciprocity, alive with curiosity and bound by aesthetic wisdom. In 2025 we invite you to join us as we continue to explore the culture and praxis of&nbsp;design.</p>LEE, LED and CD Dynamics, Emily Harris and Martin Lorenz, <a href="https://lee.darkmatterlabs.org/">https://lee.darkmatterlabs.org/</a> <a href="https://cds.darkmatterlabs.org/">https://cds.darkmatterlabs.org/</a><blockquote>Endnote about Conversational Design</blockquote><blockquote>An essential aspect of Conversational Design, as we understand it, is transparency. Design lives on an intangible layer and can be persuasive, which undermines the freedom of the reader. By disclosing our intention we want to enable the reader to question our decisions. In this text there were two main points we want to highlight:</blockquote><blockquote>1. Initially this text was written by one person. But is a text really ever written by one person? Isn’t everything we think and write based on the thoughts of others? Giving a voice to the hidden voices, by adding sources and footnotes, letting them speak, avoids a linear narrative, pretending to be the only truth. Multiple voices allow for a more nuanced and even better, contradictory conversation. We need opposition to spark the conversation in us.

He suggested that national flags should no longer dominate the sports venues and the opening ceremony. Instead, neutral flag groups in the Olympic colors would denationalize the games. However, the participating countries protested against this suggestion, not wanting to miss the opportunity to present their own national colors. Therefore, the flags of the individual nations continued to be displayed along the Olympic Stadium. In the Munich city area, however, Aicher’s colorful flag groups prevailed.  We did some research where we looked at the shift in how design studios have promoted themselves and self-identified. In Australia, for example, there were virtually no graphic design practices that called themselves “branding agencies” or offered “branding” as their key service prior to the year 2000. Only two decades later, in 2022, around 85% were doing it. Also consider branding guru Wally Olins’ bibliography. All his books prior to 2000 have “identity” or “corporate identity” in the title, but from 2003 (with On Brand) they all feature “Brand” instead. Universities design programs used to teach “visual identity design”; now they teach “branding.” This isn’t just the adoption of new terminology, it’s the emergence of a new industry.” <a href="https://www.printmag.com/daily-heller/the-daily-heller-is-post-branding-a-thing/">https://www.printmag.com/daily-heller/the-daily-heller-is-post-branding-a-thing/</a>  “You know, I think that the problem, as I said earlier, about the GNP argument is that, okay it’s nice to know that we’ve all contributed £28 billion, I think it was last year, to the Gross National Product. But it isn’t the most important thing. The most important thing is that we have been altogether — that doesn’t mean just ‘the artists’, so called, it means everyone, it means all the people actually in the community, everybody — has been generating this huge, fantastic conversation which we call culture.

<p>Using Your Digital Me Across Multiple Services with ShareRing, Hedera and FCSO</p>



<p>Imagine you want to apply for a loan (like a personal loan for a car or house) and you need to prove your identity, your financial standing, and your credit score. But here’s the challenge, you don’t want to hand over all your personal details to every service (like banks, loan agencies, or even insurance companies). You just want to prove who you are, show you’re trustworthy, and verify your financial reliability without disclosing everything.</p>



<p>Here’s how FSCO, ShareRing, and Hedera work together to solve this:</p>



<p>Step 1: Creating a Digital Identity (Digital Me) with ShareRing</p>



<p>First, you create your self-sovereign digital identity with ShareRing. This ‘Digital Me’ contains your basic credentials (like your name, age, credit score), but keeps your sensitive information private. With ShareRing, you maintain full control over your identity, deciding what data to share and when to share it.</p>



<p>ShareRing creates a verifiable credential for you, which is a secure, cryptographic proof that validates your identity without revealing everything about you. This is like a digital identity card that can be used for verification across different platforms.</p>



<p>Step 2: Connecting and Verifying with Hedera</p>



<p>Let’s say you now want to apply for a loan at a bank, but the bank uses a different platform (Hedera’s blockchain) to manage its operations. Instead of filling out lengthy forms or submitting piles of documents, the bank can instantly verify your identity and credentials through Hedera’s blockchain, using the data stored in ShareRing.</p>



<p>Hedera is a high-performance public ledger, meaning identity verification happens fast and securely, without delays. The bank can instantly check your digital identity, your credit score, and other necessary credentials, without accessing your private information. It’s a much quicker and safer way to confirm your financial standing.</p>



<p>Step 3: FSCO Ensures Everything Syncs Securely</p>



<p>This is where FSCO plays a critical role. FSCO acts as the “connector,” ensuring that your digital identity flows seamlessly and securely between ShareRing and Hedera. Think of FSCO as the bridge that links ShareRing’s Digital Me to Hedera’s verification system.</p>



<p>With FSCO’s infrastructure:</p>



<p>• Banks can access up-to-date, verified data instantly.</p>



<p>• The process remains private and trustworthy for users.</p>



<p>• The data synchronization happens securely and reliably, no matter the platform.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 4: Applying for the Loan</p>



<p>With all these pieces in place, applying for a loan becomes simple and stress-free:</p>



<p>• The bank verifies your identity and credit score through your Digital Me.</p>



<p>• You don’t share unnecessary details like your full address or history—just proof of eligibility.</p>



<p>The result? A faster, safer, and more private loan approval process for both individuals and financial institutions.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The Real-World Benefit:</p>



<p>In this scenario:</p>



<p>This collaboration represents a breakthrough for the Hedera ecosystem by introducing self-sovereign digital identities for real-world use cases:</p>



<p>• ShareRing provides the secure, user-controlled Digital Me.</p>



<p>• Hedera offers a fast and trusted blockchain verification layer.</p>



<p>• FSCO enables these systems to work together seamlessly, unlocking innovative solutions for identity verification.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Why is this important?</p>



<p>• Privacy-Preserving Verification: Users share only what’s necessary—no oversharing of personal data.</p>



<p>• Speed and Efficiency: Services like loan approvals happen almost instantly.</p>



<p>• Scalable and Secure: This solution lays the foundation for broader applications, including Web3 wallets, cross-border finance, and decentralized services.</p>



<p>By pioneering this solution on Hedera, FSCO and ShareRing are setting a new standard for trust, privacy, and efficiency in industries like finance, healthcare, and digital services.</p>

 <p>With years of hands-on experience in the commodity industry, we know the intricate, multi-layered nature of supply chains across various sectors such as cocoa, coffee, rubber, and beyond. We have developed a highly automated solution to help facilitate EUDR compliance.</p> 
  Building a Universal EUDR Solution&nbsp;  
 <p>We've worked with stakeholders at various levels—from cooperatives to traders to global brands— and we’ve seen firsthand the complexities involved in managing data from across the supply chain. Even more so, we know how complicated it can get when compiling all this data together, from multiple sources. This story has a tendency of getting even more complex when we add regulatory compliance to the mix.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>That’s why for farmer connect, whether you’re importing/exporting cocoa, coffee, rubber, or any other EUDR impacted commodity, our goal remains the same: facilitate your EUDR compliance journey with an automated and fully streamlined solution that integrates effortlessly into your existing operations, ensuring you get your valuable time back to focus on what really matters.&nbsp;</p> 
  Streamlined Compliance  
 <p>Our solution mirrors our clients' framework, providing a lean and flexible EUDR compliance journey and seamlessly integrating all necessary ESG data from internal and external systems and stakeholders. Adapting to your preferred data sources and documentation, our platform streamlines every step of the due diligence process</p> 
 <p>We give you your freedom: Bring your own partners or leverage our standard EUDR setup. We’re saying no lock-ins, just an uninterrupted compliance experience. We’ll automate where it makes most sense, andleave manual control where it’s needed.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>With a focus on empowering you, our platform ensures that you remain in control while navigating the complexities of regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
   
    
   <p>How Do We Do This?</p> 
   <p>Following industry-standard data protocols and ensuring full interoperability across various platforms, our solution streamlines the entire compliance process from start to finish. Through standard APIs available for integration, our platform compiles, into one place, all the relevant EUDR data from your systems, enabling automated compliance checks and reporting. By leveraging existing IT and ERP data and automating processes, we reduce the need for manual data entry and ensure greater oversight and control over compliance activities. Thus, giving you time back to focus on what matters, maintaining your business as usual.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p><br><br><br></p> 
    
   
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  ConnectHub: Our EUDR Compliance Solution  
 <p>ConnectHub is where EUDR data, such as geolocation information, date of production, legality info, business references, previous DDS numbers, gets consolidated. By leveraging APIs from ERP/IT systems or Supplier Portals, the platform ensures streamlined workflows.</p> 
 <p>Integrate with our third-party satellite analysis provider or bring in your own partners, and we’ll make sure the processes get linked to a seamless workflow that connects between systems.</p> 
  1.&nbsp;Regulatory Compliance  
 <p>To meet EUDR requirements, businesses must collect information on their commodities origins, conduct a risk assessment and submit a due diligence statement to the EU Information System. This data will need to be retained for 5 years and requires timely interactions with Competent Authorities whenever subject to audit.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Our solution aggregates relevant data from available sources, such as Supplier Portals or ERP systems, and enables automation where it brings most benefits. For added flexibility, data can also be uploaded manually, in bulk or in an intuitive drag and drop fashion. All data is structured into the GS1 format, ensuring compatibility with EU Information System requirements, for example GeoJSON file formats.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>2. Automated Due Diligence Statement Generation and Submission to EU Traces&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>When generating the due diligence statement, our solution automatically populates required fields with the necessary EUDR data. Directly within our platform, our clients can edit the DDSs right up until they get submitted to the EU Information System, EU Traces. This happens once all required data fields have been completed and validated. Once the submission is complete, DDS# can be obtained for cascading down the supply chain.&nbsp;</p> 
  &nbsp;  
  3. Automated Deforestation Assessments  
 <p>As an optional add-on, our solution, through our partnership with <a href="https://tradeinspace.com/">Trade in Space (TiS),</a> offers real-time deforestation assessments using uploaded geolocation data. TiS integrates multiple high-frequency, high-resolution data sources, giving regular updates on whether deforestation is occurring in the areas where commodities are sourced. This data is automatically integrated into our platform, providing a streamlined reporting mechanism that keeps you informed and compliant.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>However, our flexible approach allows integration with alternative deforestation assessment systems, making sure our solution aligns with your specific needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  Supply Chains are Complex Enough, Why Not Facilitate Where We Can ?  
   
    
   <p>We recognize the complexities of the EU Deforestation Regulation and have developed a scalable, fully interoperable solution designed to meet the compliance needs of businesses. Our approach is centred on three core principles: simplicity, automation, and compliance.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Hi, everybody. My name is Mike Engle, co-founder and head of strategy here at 1Kosmos. I’m joined today by Jens Hinrichsen. Say hello, Jens.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Hello, everybody.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Jens is our head of sales here at 1Kosmos, spends a lot of time in the trenches. And today we’re here to talk about remote caller verification. We have an acronym for that, RCV. But Jens, would you mind giving your quick pitch on what RCV is for the folks out there?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah, I would love to. And I think certainly also, Mike, with all the conversations that we’re both fortunate to have with a variety of organizations globally, please chime in with some of your own perspective as well. But I think remote caller verification, whether it is IT service desk for employees, contractors, other third parties that are interacting with an organization and have access to the inner sanctum, if you will, of an organization versus, say, contact center or call center. Where for years the industry has been working on solutions to mitigate fraud from a customer or outside facing standpoint, this is really about these emerging threat actor groups. Not even so much emerging, but Scattered Spider certainly has taken the cake recently in terms of being in the press most from MGM, Caesers, a host of other organizations where they have as a group socially engineered their way through the IT service desk of an organization.</p>
<p>So in the case of 1Kosmos, hi, I’m Mike Engle, I’m a co-founder. Service desk agent’s like, “Oh, my gosh, I got a co-founder on the call.” And if it’s not Mike and it’s a threat actor group, very charming, you name it, they can socially engineer their way in, get the credential reset, and then have Mike’s access to the company. So it is a big area of threat. It’s a big area of inefficiency also that organizations are trying to get better shored up. Mike, any other thoughts you have on that?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, so a lot of friends in the industry, I talk to them about this and they don’t have the right tools typically. So they’re using old, tired methods or no methods. They just turn it off because they can’t trust it. And an example would be secrets. What’s your employee ID? What was your date of hire? What was the amount of your last payroll deposits? Which I wouldn’t know that. So sometimes those are too hard and don’t work or they’re too easy to guess and anybody can use them. So social engineering has been around forever, but they’ve gotten really good at finding the information, the legacy ways that people have been using over time. What are some of the ways that they’re using now to get into help desks?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Well, it’s interesting, too. I think back to the point we made earlier from a fraud standpoint, I mean, there’s been social engineering going on for ages. Whatever that chain looks like, phishing, malware, getting information, and then pretending to be a customer of an organization, malicious actors are looking for economic gain and other impact for a variety of reasons. But where you can have big impact is when you’re able to infiltrate an organization. It’s one thing to steal $50,000 from a customer of an organization. It’s a big deal. You want to mitigate that, but as far as being able to get into the inner bowels of an organization’s IT stack moving laterally, whatever the case is, that is a huge area of focus these days.</p>
<p>So a lot of the, call it, the social engineering talent, the charms, I mean, Mike, you and I have even through different circles heard some of these calls and they’re … Wow, if I’m the service desk agent, yeah, I’m believing this person. You don’t have an ID for what reason or you don’t know this for whatever reason? Sure, of course. So I think it’s really been the same playbook focused on this avenue now. And again, it is really, really easy for these sophisticated threat actors to sound very believable, have core information that’s needed that would get a service desk agent to say, “Mr. Engle, co-founder of 1Kosmos, that’s fine that you don’t have this and this, but I’m going to issue a new credential to you right away. I want to make sure you’re happy.”</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right, and they may create a sense of urgency. I’m a doctor, I got a patient here at a table and I can’t unlock my stethoscope, whatever it is. So yeah, that’s a common tactic as well that we’ve seen them use. And then once they get that initial credential, they’re typically 50% of the way of getting into the core network and things go downhill from there. And so yeah, the traditional KBA, which you would think stands for knowledge based authentication.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Knowledge based authentication. Right.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
We actually refer to it as known by anybody, KBA. So it really is close to useless. And whenever I opened a new financial services account and they pop up those five questions, what was the type of car you had when you were five years old or whatever, I run for the hills if I can. So what can we do about it? How does 1Kosmos, for example, mitigate this threat?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. And even, Mike, before we go there, and I think one of the examples, what’s one of the KBA examples you’ve used before? It’s like your grandmother’s shoe size when she was nine or something. Well, whatever the iteration is, before we even get into solution, I think some of the really interesting parts that we’ve gotten more intimate with is even the other ways that organizations are trying to address this. So KBA, sure, that’s one. Known by anybody, as you said. OTP. Hey, I’m going to push you an OTP. Well, we still don’t know it’s Mike. And then we’re also seeing a lot of organizations, not even necessarily just at the highest level of privilege, but even more broadly where it’s an escalation to the manager. And you do the math on that in terms of just sheer productivity loss and in some cases you might not still be actually verifying it’s that genuine user.</p>
<p>So there’s these kind of clunky ways and tools that we as an industry have been trying to address this. And so to your question, Mike, it’s like, well, gosh, what is a way that an organization can do this where it’s effectively automated? So somebody is still calling into the service desk, but you’re removing the onus of verification from the service desk agent because the reality is service desk agents are being asked to do so many things already and they’re always do it in this amount of time, get it faster, faster. So you don’t want to forsake quality, but how do you have a very easy process for both agent and user, whether genuine or a malicious actor, to undertake that then gives the credence that, yes, this is actually Mr. Engle calling in? And so there are a few ways to do it. One that really gives, I’ll say, the minimum viable baseline would be a one-time identity verification or identity proofing event where I call into the service desk and I’m pretending to be you.</p>
<p>And the service desk agent says, “Okay, Mr. Engle, I’m going to send you a link either to your phone, to your email address.” There are a variety of things that you have to take into consideration obviously in terms of companies that might not have employees be able to have phones or are they company owned, et cetera. Those are all things that you see and we navigate accordingly, but the very simple process of opening up a link, scanning the front and back of a driver’s license, a passport, some other government issued document, and then doing a matching selfie against the image that’s on that document. And what we can do with very high assurance is give a thumbs up or thumbs down. And all we would do is simply say the agent, “Yep, this is Mr. Engle,” or in my case, pretending to be you, “No, this is not.” And so that’s a really simple initial way to do it. The really exciting part, and this is what permeates the next generation, which is actually here now and gaining steam, is the user control.</p>
<p>That reusable identity of, hey, once I have verified myself, once I essentially have an identity wallet that I can then present wherever it’s needed that proves that I am like Engle and I don’t have to go back through the whole process of scanning something, selfie, et cetera. So the elegance is there. You get high assurance, quick and easy, reduces call center times. And then again, you’re removing that, again, onus on the service desk agent of having to be the one. And there are other companies, too, Mike, where it’s, “Hey, can you hold your ID up to the camera?” It’s hard enough to tell that they’re real when you’re holding them, much less over a camera.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. And when I hold my license up to a camera, now what’s the other person doing with that information? First of all, they can’t verify it. It’s too hard. You can’t see the little security features and then now I’ve just showed you my driver’s license number. That’s something you don’t want floating out there on a video call. So yeah, the privacy preserving aspects are really key. If you can assure the help desk and your remote callers, your remote employees, or customers that it’s safe, then they’ll trust it and feel good about using it as well. That’s a great point. Yeah, so I think we’ve about done it. I guess one last thing is how hard is it to implement a tool like identity-based biometric verification for a service desk?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. What’s the usual answer? Well, we could have had it in yesterday, so you got a couple of flavors. And I think the great thing for us as an industry is you can literally start as fast as you can start with, call it, a touchless integration where you’re simply calling out to an API. That link that we talked about earlier that gets sent to the user, that’s essentially a service. It’s a hosted service and you’re not having to replumb or do anything on day one within your organization. You can address the threat, make it a simpler process literally within a couple of weeks. And then the subsequent steps that I know we’ve observed with our customers is there are things that you can do to tighten some of the workflows, whether it’s ServiceNow or whatever the service desk system or backend might be.</p>
<p>But then that next step, and it can come pretty quickly, is the organization’s adoption and use of that reusable identity. And it’s a pretty powerful thing when we think about especially at the point of, say, onboarding. Whether it’s say HR onboarding, contract, or third-party onboarding, you’re doing that verification once. The user now owns it. You made a great point about privacy preservation. I mean, that’s what we’re all in the space for, right? It’s one thing to have a point in time, but you have to make sure it’s privacy preserving. But then also, let’s make it efficient for everybody. Do the verification once and then all you’re doing is you’re essentially authenticating into systems or doing high-risk transactions or whatever the case is after that.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right, right. And you can’t implement something like this without uttering the words ROI, right?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
You have the obvious security benefits, stop bad guys, but the user experience is actually better. And then an organization can have 100,000 calls into a help desk a year. It’s an average of 30% to 50% are password reset or identity related, so why not remove that and save those calls from even coming in? You can automate this, you can do it in a self-service password reset manner as well, SSPR. So yeah, a lot of reasons to do it.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. Well, no, and you’re right. And it’s fun to build these business cases alongside organizations because it’s not just a security risk mitigation. There are very direct, like you said, Mike, very direct savings, overall operating efficiencies. Even to the point where as an organization lifts its security posture, they’re getting better policy. Their cyber insurance policies are coming down or at least not going up as quickly as they might go, depending on what most of us are feeling in the industry. So that’s a great point, that this is a really a multi-pronged business case. And I think we’ve observed 10, 20, 30X return on an investment in even just the first year.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. Yeah, it’s a no brainer. So hopefully we’ll get the phone calls before the bad guys get in and not after, but either way …</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Mike’s personal number is…</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
That’s right. Well, cool. Thanks so much for joining. It’s been fun chatting with you about this. Hopefully somebody out there will see it and will spark some ideas to make a difference in the world of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Brilliant. Great chat, Mike.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>2024 goes down in history as the year with the largest and most destructive <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>.</p>



<p>The non-profit <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/latest-alerts/">Identity Theft Resource Centre</a> says in the first half of 2024, the number of data breach victims surpassed 1 billion—a 490 per cent increase from the same time last year.</p>



<p>In 2024, masses of personal information from tens of millions of people—and sensitive medical data from roughly one-third of all Americans—was stolen and posted online. Other countries had similar large-scale breaches, such as the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/05/cybersecurity-news-lockbit-scattered-spider/">UK military data breach</a> and Australia’s <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/medisecure-hit-by-cyber-security-breach-607992">MediSecure data breach</a> which affected <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/medisecure-hit-by-cyber-security-breach-607992">around 12.9 million people</a> or roughly half of the country’s population.</p>



<p>Here’s a recap of the largest data breaches in the U.S. in 2024:</p>



 “Mother of all data breaches” 



<p>The year kicked off early as a record-breaking year for data breaches, with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/01/23/massive-26-billion-record-leak-dropbox-linkedin-twitterx-all-named/">“mother of all data breaches”</a>—a 12-terabyte database containing 26 billion leaked data records—discovered in January.</p>



<p>The data came from users of Chinese messaging giant Tencent; social media platform Weibo; platforms and services such as Twitter, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Adobe, Canva and Telegram; and various U.S. and other government organizations. In the hands of threat actors, the data could be used for a vast variety of attacks, including identity theft, sophisticated phishing schemes, targeted cyberattacks, and unauthorized access to personal and sensitive accounts.</p>



<p>Authorities say some of the data isn’t new and is probably more likely compiled records from thousands of previous breaches and data leaks, but combinations of passwords and usernames in the data still present significant risk for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing#:~:text=Credential%20stuffing%20is%20a%20type,user%20accounts%20on%20other%20systems">credential stuffing</a> attacks.</p>



 National Public Data data breach 



<p>More shocking because it is newly breached data is the National Public Data data breach in August 2024, which exposed <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/national-public-data-breach-what-you-need-to-know-843686f7-06e2-4e91-8a3f-ae30b7213535">2.9 billion records</a> (full names, social security numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers) of up to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/national-public-data-breach-what-you-need-to-know-843686f7-06e2-4e91-8a3f-ae30b7213535">170 million people in the U.S., Canada and the UK</a>.</p>



<p>The breach occurred because the NPD, an online background check and fraud prevention service (data broker), website had inadvertently published a zip file with the back-end passwords for the database. The stolen data included American social security numbers, and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/national-public-data-published-its-own-passwords/">experts</a> say it’s pretty likely that all social security numbers have been compromised.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already done so, follow the <a href="https://hr.berkeley.edu/news/national-public-data-breach-what-you-can-do">advice</a> to freeze your credit file at each of the major consumer reporting bureaus, and closely monitor your accounts for suspicious activity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, National Public Data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/national-public-data-the-hacked-data-broker-that-lost-millions-of-social-security-numbers-and-more-files-for-bankruptcy/">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>



 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/28/100-million-americans-medical-records-exposed-in-massive-data-breach/">Change Healthcare</a> 



<p>Considered <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/28/100-million-americans-medical-records-exposed-in-massive-data-breach/">“the largest healthcare data exposure in U.S. history”</a>, the Change Healthcare data breach exposed the personal, medical and billing information of 100 million customers, or roughly one-third of all Americans¾a number that is likely to rise.</p>



<p>In February 2024 the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group breached UnitedHealth’s Change Healthcare platform, a widely used payment processing system in the healthcare industry, stealing the data, disrupting billing and payment processing, and delaying patient care. And since the payment processing system is integral to healthcare infrastructure in the US, the impact went well beyond UnitedHealth to also impact <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/28/100-million-americans-medical-records-exposed-in-massive-data-breach/">innumerable</a> hospitals, clinics, and medical practices.</p>



<p>For more, see this <a href="https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/ns/health-data-breach.html">support page</a>.</p>



 <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/ATT-data-breach-Whats-next-for-affected-customers">AT&amp;T</a> (two data breaches) 



<p>In July the telecomms giant announcedcybercriminals had stolen&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/">the phone numbers and call records of “nearly all” of its customers, or around 110 million people</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/2024-in-data-breaches-1-billion-stolen-records-and-rising/">TechCrunch</a> says while the records don’t contain contents of texts and phone calls, the “metadata” still reveals who called who and when, and in some cases the data can be used to infer approximate locations.</p>



<p>This breach followed a data breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/2024-in-data-breaches-1-billion-stolen-records-and-rising/">73 million</a> AT&amp;T customer records in March.</p>



 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/">Ticketmaster</a> (Snowflake) 



<p>Ticketmaster was caught up in the much larger series of data thefts from cloud data giant Snowflake’s corporate customers this year, losing an alleged 560 million records. Read the hackers’ account of how they breached Ticketmaster, as told to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/">WIRED</a>.</p>



 How to stay safe in 2025 



<p>The year 2024 was clearly a bad year for data breaches, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/11/21/top-cyber-threats-to-protect-your-organization-from-in-2025/#:~:text=Expect%202025%20to%20be%20an,compliance%20and%20maintain%20operational%20integrity.">experts</a> say there’s no end in sight.</p>



<p>As a consumer, there’s never been a better time to proactively protect your personal information. If you discover your personal information was exposed in a data breach, quickly change your passwords, add a fraud alert to your credit reports, and place a freeze on your credit reports. More helpful advice is available at the non-profit<a> </a><a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity Theft Resource Centre</a>.</p>

 Last thoughts 



<p>Data breaches aren’t going away. They’re getting more sophisticated and the increase in ransomware attacks means even criminals with little computer skill can pull them off. If you consider that the number of data breaches in the U.S. was <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/">447 in 2012</a> and more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/">3,200 in 2023</a>, and that the cost of cybercrime is increasing <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/">15 per cent</a> year over year, the future for data privacy will likely be bleaker not better—unless you take steps to protect yourself.<br><br>Download <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>.<br>Download <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a>.<br>Discover other <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals">MySudo apps</a>.</p>

			 What is a VPN (Virtual Private Network) and what is it for? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>In recent years, increasing focus on online privacy and security has led many people to discover tools such as VPNs. With the increase in cyber threats and risks associated with surfing online, protecting one’s personal data has become a priority for many users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most effective solutions to guarantee security and privacy when accessing the Internet is to use a VPN, a service that protects data transmission on public networks and preserves one’s identity by detecting and rejecting malware, phishing and fraud attempts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This tool allows you to surf the Internet anonymously, protecting your information from eavesdropping and malicious attacks. But what is a VPN and what makes it so useful?</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is a VPN and why is it important? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It is a technology that creates a private connection between your own device and the Internet. In practice, a VPN connection allows you to surf online more securely by masking your IP address and encrypting your data in transit. This means that your information is more difficult to intercept by third parties, such as hackers or individuals trying to monitor your online activity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using this type of connection is essential to ensure security and privacy, especially in situations where the risk of personal data exposure is high. For instance, when you connect to public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in bars, restaurants or airports, your data can easily be intercepted by malicious attackers who could connect to your device. By encrypting your connection, a Virtual Private Network prevents information from being stolen or monitored even on these public networks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, many organisations, including marketing agencies, try to monitor your behaviour as you browse in order to collect personal information, such as history and sensitive data. To protect your privacy and prevent your data from being used without your consent, it is essential to use a private network. In fact, using a VPN makes it almost impossible for anyone to monitor your online activities, ensuring that your information remains protected and out of reach of prying eyes.</p>   						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Are VPNs legal? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>One of the most frequently asked questions concerns the legality of this tool: are VPNs legal? The answer depends on the country you are in. In general, the use of a VPN is legal in most countries, including the UK and Italy, but there are some exceptions. The key lies in the way the technology is used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While using this type of connection to protect privacy and surf safely is perfectly legal, in some countries the use of a private network to circumvent certain government controls or to access prohibited content may be restricted.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is a VPN for? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							As mentioned above, a Virtual Private Network is an indispensable tool for protecting data and privacy online. By using it, you can surf more safely and defend yourself against potential threats.

&nbsp;

Here are the main functions of a VPN connection:

&nbsp;
 
 	 Personal Data protection. A private network encrypts your Internet connection, making data, such as passwords and banking information, invisible to anyone trying to intercept them, especially on public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks. 
 	 Online anonymity. By hiding your IP address, it allows you to surf without being tracked. This means that websites cannot collect information on your location or surfing habits, guaranteeing completely private surfing. 
 	 Increased security. A VPN service protects online traffic from external attacks, such as hackers, and reduces the risk of unauthorised access. In addition, some private networks offer advanced features to protect against web threats, such as blocking suspicious applications in case of abnormal activity, malware and intrusive advertisements. 
 						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How does a VPN work? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>A virtual private network protects your Internet connection by creating a channel through which data travels encrypted, preventing anyone from intercepting or monitoring it.</p><p>Here is how a VPN works in greater detail:</p>  User and server authentication. When you connect to a Virtual Private Network, your device is first authenticated by the server. This ensures that only authorised users can access the private network.  Data encryption. Once authenticated, the server applies an encryption protocol to the data you send and receive. Encryption makes your data unintelligible to anyone attempting to intercept it, protecting your personal information during transmission. This creates a secure data exchange ‘tunnel’ that makes it impossible for third parties, hackers and even your service provider (ISP), to view the content passing over your connection.  Encapsulation of data packets. Data is wrapped in an external packet, which is also encrypted. This encapsulation process makes it even more difficult for anyone to access the data, keeping it safe during transfer.  Data decryption. Once data arrives at the destination server, the external packet is removed via a decryption process, allowing the data to be read securely.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, a VPN works by creating a private and confidential connection between your device and the destination server, ensuring that your data can be transmitted encrypted and protected. Using an encrypted tunnel prevents data from being intercepted or used without your consent.</p>

  Personal data licensing offers individuals enforceable control over their sensitive data by using digital tools to track, limit, and revoke data sharing.

<p>We recently proposed the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/how-personal-data-licenses-can-keep-digital-identity-private-part-1/">Personal Data License</a> (PDL): a system that leverages Verifiable Digital Credentials to give individuals control over the sharing of their sensitive data, including the ability to enforceably limit, revoke, or receive disclosures about that access. As part of this system, the person sharing data will issue a PDL using their digital wallet, establishing a clear record of the terms for data sharing. The PDL will then be countersigned by the recipient, signifying their acceptance of the user's conditions and creating a mutual agreement that protects both parties.</p><p>Combined with legislative enforcement, a Personal Data License system would allow individuals to share data for a limited time, requiring recipients to delete it after the agreed period or report its continued existence as required. This enhanced level of control greatly increases the power that individuals have over their data. The ability to revoke data, ensure its removal, or receive notifications about its existence would have a profound impact in a landscape where personal data is increasingly used for commercial purposes and massive repositories of outdated data remain vulnerable to a growing number of security breaches.</p><p>Personal Data Licensing (PDL) would also have a third important benefit: increasing user trust in the digital systems handling their data. The public is increasingly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">confused and worried</a> about how their data are used, by both private companies and governments. That anxiety could be a serious obstacle to the adoption of digital identity systems like the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">mobile driver’s licenses (mDL)</a>, which offer <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">significant improvements</a> to the current privacy and security status quo.</p><p>But how exactly would Personal Data Licensing work? Let’s dive in.</p> Forget Me Now <p>Enforceable data control is important, both practically and for public perception because the public has come to associate digital tools with sacrificing their privacy. There’s the ambient experience of surveillance-driven advertising, but also much more scary examples, such as when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Target’s algorithm detected and exposed a customer’s pregnancy</a> or the current uncertainty about what 23andMe will do with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/g-s1-25795/23andme-data-genetic-dna-privacy?ref=blog.spruceid.com">all the individual genetic information it owns</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The 23andMe situation illustrates how trackable data licensing would improve on the current status quo. In retrospect, 23andMe’s customers would probably have preferred to let the company handle their genetic data temporarily, not store it in perpetuity. Personal data licensing makes data more like a digital book out for a temporary loan. Notably, the goal is not to create a more nuanced commercial license to let users monetize data, a concept many experts believe would be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">exploitative and bad for privacy</a>. Instead, PDL is intended as a privacy tool for particularly sensitive data, such as medical records, allowing users to automatically and auditably request the deletion of their data from their smartphones. If a user revoked their PDL and then published this action to a public blockchain, there would be solid evidence that they requested their data deletion at a certain point in history, accessible to anyone with shared data records and an internet connection.</p><p>Personal Data Licensing would use the same mix of digital wallets and secure signatures that verify digital IDs like California’s mobile driver’s license. When data are shared from a document or record in a digital wallet, a PDL system could require the recipient to digitally countersign a data license indicating acceptance of terms. This is aligned with building blocks like <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kantara-Consent-Receipt-Presentation.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Katara’s verifiable “receipt”</a> for the data, which is based on standards outlined by groups, <a href="https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27560.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">including ISO</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>These licenses would be readable by both humans and machines, outline the purpose of the sharing, and have clear expiration dates. They might also define any rights for third-party sharing or provisions for the sharer’s right to revoke data access. They may also encapsulate reporting requirements, such as how to notify the user if further data sharing is needed. Data wallets would automatically retain copies of these licenses, with verifiable signatures from the data recipients. With legislation backing, such as an updated version of Europe’s GDPR, this paper trail would make data deletion auditable and enforceable.</p><p>These capabilities and interactions are not currently part of dominant digital ID standards, such as the ISO’s Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) or the W3C’s Verifiable Credentials standard. We believe the system can be designed externally to such standards in the “white space” left open—though ideally, data licensing would eventually be integrated with base standards.</p> Data Control and a Fairer Digital Economy <p>A system of digitally signed receipts for data sharing would create a verifiable record of what data we share, with which counterparties, and under which conditions. However, legislation would be needed to ensure compliance by imposing penalties on data recipients who didn’t comply with the conditions of a license. Analogs to such legislation already exist, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA), and the&nbsp; <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/right-to-be-forgotten/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">European GDPR’s “Right to Be Forgotten.”</a> Governments worldwide have been implementing policies to give people more control over their data.</p><p>Notably, Utah enacted the <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0491.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Government Data Privacy Act (GDPA) in May 2024</a>, which gives Utahns discretion over how their own government should manage their personal data. At SpruceID, we are generally aligned with actions that increase individual autonomy while avoiding the centralization of power.</p><p>However, the current enforcement state for these laws tends to favor large-scale data collectors, such as Google and Facebook, who can afford the staff and other overhead to comply. Compliance costs have even led <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/online-privacy/closing-shop-or-closing-off-companies-respond-to-gdpr?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Blocking%20out%20Europe&amp;text=The%20GDPR%20was%20a%20contributing,on%20business%20in%20other%20regions.">some smaller digital businesses to leave the EU</a> or even shut down entirely.</p><p>A standardized and open system of Personal Data Licensing, including verifiable “receipts,” would make both enforcement and compliance simpler, reducing the unfair burden that data policies have tended to have on smaller digital businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Public policy would need to support PDL systems with enforcement. Imagine, for instance, that months after releasing your blood test data to a medical provider, you start receiving health marketing messages that seem guided by that data.

One very practical upside of personal data licensing is that it will make privacy frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA much more implementable. A record-keeping standard simplifying policy enforcement gives individuals more control over their data while also reducing the compliance burden on firms that collect data for valid purposes.</p><p>More fundamentally, Personal Data Licensing would be a major step forward in digital identity’s overarching mission to improve privacy, security, and user control of data. Personal Data Licenses, paired with monitoring and enforcement, can reverse the power dynamic in data sharing. Instead of a presumption that users must hand over data on request, government agencies and data-hungry enterprises will be required to convincingly justify their data collection and how long it will be stored.</p><p>The data hoards built up by unrestricted data collection have become huge risks to global privacy, security, and democracy. They have been used for surveillance and mass manipulation. It’s time for a change in control.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

				  With a focused, achievable goal, you can quickly deploy your Verifiable Credential ecosystem and gain an edge over your competitors  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>If you’re looking to transform costly, inefficient, or user-unfriendly authentication and data sharing systems, our motto at Indicio is: “Start today, start small, scale smart.” This means beginning with a focused, manageable use case to build understanding of the technology, achieve results, and let these results create momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve helped customers implement Verifiable Credentials to solve a myriad of business issues: interoperability between partners and governments when privacy is a concern or when direct integration is too complicated and expensive; inefficient, error-prone, and repetitive processes based on manual, paper-based form-filling verification, and simplifying, securing, and speeding up access to systems and software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, rather than aiming to solve every challenge at once, we encourage customers to start with a small deployment that fixes one problem. This approach builds understanding and trust, drives stakeholder buy-in, and sets the foundation for long-term success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are a new digital authentication method that uses cryptographic proofs to verify identity or attributes without exposing unnecessary personal information or requiring the verifier to check in with the original source of the information or a third-party identity provider.</p>
<p>Here’s how they work:</p>
 
 Issuer: A trusted entity (e.g., a bank, government agency, or employer) issues a credential to a user (e.g., proof of identity, business license). 
 Holder: The user stores this credential securely in a digital wallet on their mobile device. 
 Verifier: When logging in or accessing a service, the user presents a cryptographically verifiable proof of the credential and, depending on the use case, information in the credential to the verifier. Importantly, only the necessary data is shared, and the verifier can confirm its authenticity without contacting the issuer. 
 
<p>This decentralized model for data ecosystems means that users hold their own data and that the data issued in a credential is completely under the user’s control. This decentralization eliminates the need to store personal data in a centralized database in order to cross check and verify it. It also removes the privacy concerns over how third-parties can use personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at the simplest decentralized identity ecosystem we can create, one where the issuer and verifier is the same entity —&nbsp;for example, an employer issuing an employee credential for seamless login to company systems and applications. This structure, often referred to as a closed ecosystem, provides a simple, controlled environment for implementing, testing, and understanding the solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a team experiences how easy it is to implement such a system, the path is much easier to adding outside verifiers (say a company’s benefits partners) or other issuers (say, government-issued credentials) to create new ecosystems for sharing verifiable data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in this way allows for iterative development and continuous improvement, ensuring smoother rollouts and minimizing risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our CTO, Ken Ebert calls this stage of development, a three-legged stool. While decentralized identity often seems like a purely technological solution, success relies on making important choices to balance the needs of three critical elements:&nbsp;</p>
<p> Business: What problem are you trying to solve with decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials? Who are the users, and how will they benefit? What funding model supports the initiative? We’ve seen the customers who are quick to answer these questions get the budget and speed to deployment the fastest.</p>
<p> Governance: Governance defines how users obtain the credentials, who uses them, who the other parties in the ecosystem are, as well as how the deployment adheres to emerging global data regulations. Ensuring compliance and clarity builds trust among stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Technology: This involves the foundational tools: the software for issuing credentials, holding credentials (in a digital wallet) and verifying credentials; the ability to write to and retrieve cryptographic material; and decisions over protocols and standards.</p>
<p>Our team at Indicio is active and lead many different communities where technologies and standards are being developed. From OpenID to DIDComm, W3C and IETF, chances are if you are interested in a specific protocol, credential type, or specification– we’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>An example of how these three elements work together: A company call center could issue credentials to customers, enabling quicker authentication. If this reduces verification time from 30 seconds to 5, with data to prove efficiency and customer satisfaction, the team can now ask for further funding for adoption. Here, the technology solves a business problem, and the governance is rooted in the trusted relationship between the company and its customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As new applications and improvements emerge during an initial rollout, the temptation to scale quickly can be strong. However, the key to sustainable growth is incremental expansion. Using the call center example, this might mean gradually adding new verifiers, issuers, or credential holders to improve routine transactions while maintaining a stable and secure system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is transformative. A key factor in the success of any decentralized identity project is effective communication of this — both internally and externally. Teams must articulate the value proposition to users, addressing the pain points that decentralized identity alleviates. This requires a combination of education, documentation, and messaging that engages stakeholders at every level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we help organizations take their first steps with decentralized identity and support their success as they grow into larger deployments. By providing enterprise-grade tools built on open-source technologies, a variety of hosting options, and customizable training programs, we provide businesses the flexibility to create a variety of scalable solutions to fit their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you’re just starting out in testing or ready to deploy, our expertise helps you confidently navigate the path to a successful decentralized identity ecosystem.</p>

  <p>In an era where cyber threats are constant, organizations must prepare not for if a breach will happen but when. The urgency to identify, address, and bounce back from security incidents has never been greater. Privileged Access Management (PAM) plays a vital role in bolstering defenses and streamlining responses to these incidents. However, many organizations still struggle to unlock its full benefits, leaving critical vulnerabilities exposed.</p>
<p>Modern PAM solutions offer a range of capabilities that extend far beyond traditional access control. By integrating PAM into incident response strategies, organizations can significantly improve their ability to identify threats, contain breaches, and streamline recovery processes. Join us as we explore how PAM can be leveraged to transform human risk into human assets, providing full visibility and control over internal risks.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the state of PAM and compare common versus emerging capability areas. He will discuss to which extent these capabilities can support not only protective requirements but support in the analysis of incidents and thus streamline incident reporting.</p>
<p>Aleksandr Dymov, Product Manager at Syteca, will showcase the Syteca platform, a comprehensive cybersecurity solution designed to meet the diverse needs of modern organizations. He will present a case study and provide a live demo, illustrating how Syteca's customizable security toolkit enables granular PAM and advanced user activity monitoring to secure organizations against insider threats.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-your-secret-weapon"></a>

				  Our success in developing OpenID for Verifiable Credentials is paving the way for new use cases and quicker adoption.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Gareau</p>
<p>Our mission at Indicio is to make decentralized identity accessible and practical for real-world adoption. A key to this is our active involvement in developing and supporting OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC) and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP). Part of the emerging <a href="https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/">European eIDAS 2.0 identity standards</a>, these protocols specify how Verifiable Credentials can be used, building on OpenID Connect (OIDC), a widely used framework for authenticating user access to applications and websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OID4VC</a>: Streamlines the issuance of Verifiable Credentials using familiar web technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html">OID4VP</a>: Facilitates the presentation of these credentials, ensuring interoperability with existing OpenID-based systems.</p>
<p>These protocols make the transition to decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials easy for many organizations, as they are familiar with the underlying authentication technology and don’t have to replace their identity and access management systems. This means companies and organizations can quickly implement seamless operations and services that deliver immediate value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Gartner Research notes in its <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5560195">2024 Market Guide to Decentralized Identity</a>, the technology “represents magnitudes of improvement in terms of efficiency, cost and assurance” for authentication, account security, fraud, privacy, and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio’s OID4VC in action</p>
<p>An example of Indicio’s work with these protocols is the<a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/"> IATA One ID Proof of Concept (POC)</a>. This was developed with our strategic partner SITA, along with Delta Airlines and the Government of Aruba, and showcased at the joint<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/events/all/wfs--wps/"> IATA World Financial Symposium (WFS) and IATA World Passenger Symposium (WPS) </a>in October 2024.</p>
<p>The POC showed how two different Verifiable Credentials, a <a href="https://www.icao.int/Meetings/TRIP-Symposium-2021/PublishingImages/Pages/Presentations/Digital%20Travel%20Credential%20%28DTC%29%20Policy%20and%20Guiding%20Principles.pdf">Digital Travel Credential</a> using the DIDComm protocol and a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">One ID</a> credential using OID4VC, can work seamlessly together to facilitate seamless check in, baggage management, lounge access, and international border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POC showed just how easy it is for a person to enroll in both at the same time with a passport and mobile phone, and then use them for instant, seamless authentication through each step of the passenger journey from home to destination. This was the first ever One ID implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://youtu.be/StRH7uOqxQA?feature=shared">a demonstration</a> from a recent <a href="https://indicio.tech/how-decentralized-digital-identity-is-creating-simpler-more-streamlined-air-travel/">meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>At Indicio, we see the future as a multi-credential, protocol, and standard world, and our goal is to provide the best implementation of each to meet our customer needs and to ensure that all work together so that our customers can seize every opportunity.</p>
<p>Our success in implementing&nbsp; OID4VC and in combining and bridging different credentials and protocols has made Indicio a trusted partner for global organizations looking to implement cutting-edge identity solutions.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to explore how OID4VC can revolutionize your identity ecosystem, or to explore our solutions in education, finance, health, agriculture, the public sector, and travel and tourism, we’re here to help you every step of the way. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Reach out to Indicio today!</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> A&nbsp;Game-Changer in Data Backup and&nbsp;Cyber Resilience&nbsp; 
<p>On December 10th, 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cohesity.com/press/cohesity-becomes-worlds-largest-data-protection-provider-after-completing-combination-with-veritas-enterprise-data-protection-business/">Cohesity and Veritas&nbsp;announced</a>&nbsp;that they have finalized their union. This is a major development as it will create the largest player in the rapidly growing market for cyber resilience and data protection. Data is not only fundamental to all organizations’ business processes but now also defines the very infrastructure upon which these processes depend.&nbsp; Cyber-attacks and ransomware are an existential threat to this data and data protection solutions are essential for cyber resilience.&nbsp; This union represents a pivotal moment in the worldwide marketplace for these solutions.&nbsp;</p>
 Why This Merger is Important&nbsp; 
<p>Digitalization of business processes has increased the potential impact of cyber threats.&nbsp; This, taken together with increased regulation on cyber resilience, makes the market for these solutions strong. Based on our current research the Cloud Backup market size was last estimated at over $5.75B with an annual growth rate of 18.7%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The merger of Cohesity and Veritas underscores the importance of dependable, scalable, and innovative data protection solutions for cyber resilience. Both these vendors are recognized as leaders in our recent Leadership Compass report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80868/cloud-backup-for-ai-enabled-cyber-resilience">Cloud Backup for AI Enabled Cyber Resilience</a>&nbsp;with each bringing their own complementary strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Complementary Strengths&nbsp; 
<p>Cohesity brings its modern, cloud-native approach to data management and Veritas brings its long-standing expertise in enterprise-grade data protection. By combining their strengths, the new entity is well placed to address the full spectrum of data protection and cyber resilience needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohesity offers the Cohesity Data Cloud (CDC), built on SpanFS, an immutable filesystem ensuring data integrity and security plus instant file serving of backed-up NAS data, and using SnapTree chain-free metadata such that essentially each point-in-time backup can be accessed as rapidly and efficiently as if it had been originally made via a full backup.  Veritas products include Veritas Alta™ Data Protection, NetBackup – an enterprise backup and recovery solution, and Backup Exec - designed for backup and recovery for small to mid-sized businesses. Together these combine modern architecture with a wide range of capabilities and coverage.&nbsp;</p>
 The Importance of&nbsp;ML and&nbsp;GenAI&nbsp; 
<p>An important market trend is the evolution of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular generative AI (GenAI).&nbsp; ML and GenAI provide capabilities that can be helpful to enhance cyber resilience, and we expect cyber resilience solutions to exploit these technologies where appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both vendors have recognized the importance of ML and GenAI both in terms of the opportunities they provide as well as the data protection needs, they introduce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Veritas uses GenAI/ML with the AI-powered Operational Assistant, Veritas Alta™ Copilot. Alta Copilot brings the power of GenAI to Alta View, making it more intuitive and accessible for all users to detect suspicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohesity’s AI framework, including the patent-pending Cohesity Gaia, leverages GenAI throughout the platform to offer operational insights, anomaly detection, information insights, and predictive analytics. Gaia enables users to search based on meaning rather than search based on characters, and converse with their data using natural language. The platform also includes AI-driven data classification and threat detection, utilizing machine learning to enhance security and compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our view, in future an organization should be able to give a GenAI based backup and disaster recovery solution a set of resilience objectives, compliance requirements and cost constraints for the system to build, evaluate, and implement the technology elements and support the manual processes needed to meet these.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Impact on Customers&nbsp; 
<p>Not all marriages last and customers may be anxious about what this union may mean for them.&nbsp; Both companies recognized that it is easier to lose customers than to gain them. In February 2024, when they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cohesity.com/press/cohesity-and-veritas-data-protection-business-to-combine-forming-a-new-leader-in-ai-powered-data-security-and-management/">announced</a> their intention to combine, the announcement included a “no customer left behind” <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/product-roadmap-strategy/">product roadmap</a> in which “...all products will be supported for many years. Customers can migrate when and if they want, on their own schedule.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what we expect the new entity to provide:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transitional Arrangements&nbsp;– to ensure that all capabilities from the existing products remain available with the opportunity to mix and match between the two product ranges.&nbsp; No enforced customer migration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced Capabilities:&nbsp;a unified portfolio that combines the best of both companies' technologies. These will likely be based around the Cohesity Data Cloud (CDC), to provide a unified interface and exploit the wide range of data connectors from Veritas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Global Reach and Support:&nbsp;With their combined resources, the new entity will be better positioned to provide support and expertise across regions and industries. This is particularly important for enterprises operating in highly regulated sectors such as healthcare, finance, and government.&nbsp;</p>
 Technology Advances to Watch For&nbsp; 
<p>The Cohesity-Veritas merger is not just a consolidation of market share but a bold move to accelerate technological advancements in data backup and recovery. Key innovations we anticipate include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI and Machine Learning for Data Resilience:&nbsp;Leveraging Cohesity’s AI-driven analytics and Veritas’s deep integration capabilities, the new entity is likely to push the boundaries of predictive and autonomous data recovery. This could minimize downtime and enhance ransomware recovery strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seamless Multi-Cloud Integration:&nbsp;As businesses increasingly adopt hybrid and multi-cloud environments, the combined expertise of Cohesity and Veritas will result in more robust and seamless cloud-native solutions, protecting data and data defined infrastructure in a common way across diverse environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comprehensive Data Governance and Compliance:&nbsp;With increasing regulations on data protection and cyber resilience worldwide, the union offers an opportunity to deliver solutions to help organizations to meet and exceed their regulatory obligations.&nbsp;</p>
 Our Opinion&nbsp; 
<p>The union of Cohesity and Veritas is a transformative moment for the data protection and cyber resilience market. As the largest player in the market, the combined company has the power to set new standards, influence industry trends, and drive the next wave of innovation. For customers, this means access to unparalleled technology and expertise, though the path forward may ultimately require customers to adapt and align with new offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As dust settles on this announcement, one thing is clear: the data protection and cyber resilience market has forever changed, and we are just beginning to understand the full impact of this historic combination.&nbsp; Stay tuned and book now for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2025">EIC</a>&nbsp;in May 2025 to hear the latest news.&nbsp;</p>

             December 2024   
	 
		 
			 Bitcoin Hits $100K: The Tokenization Tipping Point? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Last week, Bitcoin hits $100k!</p>
<p>This milestone, fueled by institutional adoption and a promising regulatory shift under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, sets the stage for a transformative 2025 in onchain finance and tokenization. It is clear that institutional capital is going onchain, it is crucial to start bringing assets onchain now. The tokenization trend is inevitable.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>But to reach that tipping point, we must overcome a few critical challenges.</p>
 Challenge 1: Lack of Actionable Data 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Private assets often lack actionable data that allow all ecosystems to easily read the data of the tokens, such as Net Asset Value (NAV). Without this, other applications like data aggregators, distributors, and other service providers, can not provide accurate data to their audience.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
ERC-3643 is designed to solve this. With its built-in AssetID smart contracts, tokenized assets gain a unique onchain identity. Asset data (Asset type, NAV, ISIN, LEI, ESG ratings…) can be verified and directly linked to AssetID. This allows the ecosystem service providers to access verified asset information.</p>
 Challenge 2: Limited Accessibility 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Despite the promise of tokenized RWAs, they remain out of reach for most investors. Take BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, as an example. Its $454 million market cap in Ethereum is held by just 23 investors, with 40% owned by a single Web3 company. High minimum investments exclude smaller investors from participating. Many institutions are still hesitating to open their onchain products to retail investors. They are afraid of losing control and fail to enforce compliance.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
The ERC-3643 token standard enables issuers to tokenize more accessible financial products while maintaining full control and automated compliance. ERC-3643 tokens are permissioned tokens. They ensure issuers decide who can participate, and under what conditions, and even allow for token freezing or recovery. Issuers can scale by using this token standard and open onchain assets to smaller investors. The protocol has already been used many times to tokenize securities available to retail investors, such as open-ended public funds, or even with prospectus exemptions in Europe.</p>
 Challenge 3: Fragmented Liquidity 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Secondary markets for RWAs remain siloed. Distributors can only offer assets within their isolated order books, leaving unmatched trades, inactive markets, and frustrated investors.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
Shared liquidity. Imagine all distributors leveraging a shared order book while retaining full control of their platforms and investor relationships. In the new era of tokenized assets, trading offers are universal. Investors publish a trading offer on one platform, and it is instantly visible across all others. Smart contracts ensure compliance by design: Onchain identity checks confirm the buyer’s eligibility, enforce transfer restrictions, and verify wallet balances. Unauthorized transactions are denied instantly. The best part is delivery vs payment enabling instant settlements. Trades are completed in seconds without counterparty risk or intermediaries, creating a seamless and risk-free experience.</p>
<p>This vision is no longer theoretical. ERC-3643 tokens, combined with the open liquidity protocol DINO, make it a reality. By sharing an onchain catalog of offers, blockchain has been turned into a giant marketplace.</p>
<p>But unlocking this potential requires collective action.</p>
 
 For asset issuers: Adopting the open source ERC-3643 standard ensures compliance and future interoperability. 
 For asset administrators: Defining their operating models to support seamless onchain operations. 
 For distributors: Connecting to the ERC-3643 catalog of tokens and starting managing onchain transactions. 
 
<p>At Tokeny, our mission is to provide the best in class tokenized assets orchestration platform and expertise for all stakeholders to thrive in this financial revolution, empowering institutions to upgrade finance, onchain.</p>
<p>Change is no longer optional, it’s an opportunity, let’s make 2025 a bull market for RWAs!</p>

  The Identity Fabric paradigm has established as the guiding principle for building modern Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) infrastructures. Since the introduction by KuppingerCole Analysts more than five years ago, many organizations have adopted this concept to streamline their IAM architecture, portfolio, and investments. With the newest release of the Identity Fabric, KuppingerCole Analysts provides an updated framework that not only reflects the evolution of IAM with respect to supported identity types and technologies, but also provides additional perspectives and layers to help organizations shape their own Identity Fabric for human and non-human identities. The Reference Architecture as second major framework of KuppingerCole Analysts adds more detail to the Identity fabric by going more into detail on IAM.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) has long been the backbone of enterprise security. As digital transformation accelerates and compliance requirements grow more stringent, the need for a flexible, scalable, and future-proof IAM framework has never been more critical. This is where the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric comes into play - a holistic framework expertly designed to tackle these challenges head-on.</p>
<p>But why is a comprehensive IAM blueprint so crucial? According to recent data, only 40% of companies currently have a complete IAM blueprint in place, while 26.8% are in the process of developing one, and a concerning 33.1% have no blueprint at all. This gap highlights a significant vulnerability for many organizations, leaving them exposed to risks that could be mitigated with a well-defined IAM strategy. The Identity Fabric addresses this very issue by providing a structured, adaptable approach to IAM, ensuring that organizations not only close this gap but also stay ahead of future challenges.</p>
<p>Building on its successful design and widespread adoption, KuppingerCole analysts and advisors are currently finalizing the updated revision of the Identity Fabric for 2025, scheduled for release soon. This new version is not just a routine update; it is a carefully crafted evolution that leverages valuable feedback from the industry, incorporates insights and experiences from end-user organizations, and integrates the latest market and technology trends.</p>
 Understanding the basics: What is the Identity Fabric? 
<p>At its core, the Identity Fabric is a comprehensive, holistic framework for architecting, evolving, and modernizing IAM systems. It is essential for organizations looking to keep pace with the demands of their future challenges, ensure compliance, and address evolving business requirements. Identities are the cornerstone of cybersecurity frameworks, and the Identity Fabric offers a structured approach to managing them effectively.</p>
<p>The benefits of the Identity Fabric are multifaceted. It not only provides a robust high-level model for IAM but also ensures that systems are adaptable to future challenges. This adaptability is crucial as the digital landscape continues to evolve, bringing with it new threats and opportunities. The business value of the Identity Fabric lies in its ability to streamline IAM processes, reduce operational costs, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
 Applying the Identity Fabric: Why is it so useful? 
<p>The Identity Fabric is not just a theoretical framework; it is a practical tool that can be applied across various IAM scenarios. Whether you are designing a new IAM platform or evolving an existing one, the Identity Fabric provides the entry point for a clear roadmap. Areas of application include:</p>
 
 Strategy Definition for New IAM Platforms: Implementing new IAM platforms requires more than just technical know-how - it demands a strategic vision. The Identity Fabric helps define long-term goals and ensures that the platform is built with future scalability in mind. 
 Strategy Definition for Evolving IAM Platforms: Just as new platforms need a strategic direction, so do existing systems undergoing transformation. The Identity Fabric guides the modernization process, ensuring that legacy platforms meet both current and future business requirements. 
 Architecture Design for New IAM Platforms: When building new IAM platforms, the Identity Fabric framework ensures a robust, scalable, and flexible architecture. This architecture can adapt to changing business needs and technological advancements, making it future proof. 
 Architecture Design for Evolving IAM Platforms: For organizations with existing IAM systems, the Identity Fabric offers a pathway to modernization. By aligning legacy systems with the framework, businesses can enhance functionality and improve scalability without the need for a complete overhaul. 
 Review and Analysis of Existing IAM Service Platforms: To fully leverage the Identity Fabric, organizations must first understand their current state. Thorough reviews and analyses help identify gaps, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement, allowing the Identity Fabric to guide the necessary changes. 
 Portfolio Management: Effective IAM is not just about managing individual systems - it’s about managing a portfolio of services and solutions. The Identity Fabric ensures that all elements are aligned with business objectives and that resources are allocated efficiently. 
 
 Evolving the Identity Fabric for 2025: A Sneak Peek 
<p>The upcoming 2025 update to the Identity Fabric brings several exciting enhancements, each aimed at ensuring that the framework remains relevant in the face of both technological and business changes.</p>
 
 A Revision of the Conceptual Design: The new Identity Fabric will feature a slightly updated conceptual design that encapsulates all relevant themes. The structure of the Fabric will be more refined, looking at all types of identities, with all relevant IAM capabilities consolidated into IAM services and mapped to tools and market segments. 
 Integration with the IAM Reference Architecture: One of the key enhancements in the 2025 update is the integration of the Identity Fabric with the existing IAM Reference Architecture. This ensures that the Reference Architecture is aligned within the Fabric context. 
 Development of Detailed Blueprints: The 2025 update will also enable new applications of the Identity Fabric through deriving detailed, bespoke, and individualized detail identity fabrics. Crucial will be a new model of a two-tiered refinement of the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric (IF), which aims to provide a structured framework for managing identity and access within different organizational contexts. 
 
<p>The Identity Fabric can be adjusted two levels of abstraction:</p>
 
 Level 1: Master Identity Fabric (IF) - This is the core framework designed to manage functions and services across various identity and access management (IAM) requirements. It acts as the central IAM blueprint applicable to a broad range of organizations. 
 Level 2: Tailored Identity Fabrics per Business Model and/or Maturity Level&nbsp;- At this level, the Master Identity Fabric is refined into more specific models to serve different organizational needs and maturity levels. These refined models serve as role models for other organizations and are designed to meet the distinct challenges and requirements of various industries. 
 
<p>This hierarchical approach allows for greater flexibility, ensuring that the Identity Fabric can be adapted to fit specific organizational contexts while maintaining a standard core framework.</p>
 Looking Ahead: The Future of IAM 
<p>The KuppingerCole Identity Fabric 2025 is more than just an update - it’s a strategic evolution that prepares organizations for the future of IAM. By adopting this enhanced framework, businesses can ensure that their IAM systems are not only capable of meeting today’s challenges but are also ready for the unknowns of tomorrow. As identities continue to be at the core of cybersecurity, the Identity Fabric offers a clear path to resilience, adaptability, and long-term success.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the official release of the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric 2025, where these enhancements and more will be fully detailed, providing a cutting-edge framework for the next generation of IAM.</p>

 After three years, IDnow’s research project, Soteria has come to an end. Here, we share the findings and what it could mean for the future of personal data management. 



<p>Soteria, named after the goddess of safety and harm prevention, was a joint research project funded by the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. Carried out in collaboration with 12 other European partners, the main aim of the project was to explore digital security and user privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Where does our personal data go?&nbsp; 



<p>Nowadays, many carry out the majority of&nbsp;their daily tasks online; managing bank accounts,&nbsp;accessing insurance details and even attending medical consultations to name but a few. Accessing these services requires the authentication of the user, which is facilitated by the transfer of personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As personal data invariably needs to be entered to access personal online services, this can be a frustrating experience for the user. How this personal data is collected, stored and used is often not clear to the user, nor the organization that requests the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/project/2015/fundamental-rights-survey">Fundamental Rights Survey</a>, which asked people about their views on sharing personal data, 55% said they feared that criminals or fraudsters could access their personal data, while 30% said they worried that advertisers, businesses and governments could access their information without them knowing.&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are currently no solutions on the market to enable users to take control and manage their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These personal data have to be repeatedly completed to access to each service, which can be time-consuming for the citizens. In addition, the use of the personal data collected is most of the time not transparent for the citizen, as well as the organisations which have access to them.</p>



<p>For these reasons, more than 70% of the EU citizens have concerns about the online use of their personal data. Currently, there is no solution to allow users to take control and manage their data as they see fit.</p>



 Enter SOTERIA: a secure, privacy-friendly digital wallet. 



<p>In an attempt to address this issue, the SOTERIA project proposed the creation of a digital wallet that combined a digital identity, secured by high-level remote identity verification, with a data storage platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of three years, IDnow and its partners carried out the following:</p>



  Extensive consultation: 3,600 members of the public were surveyed to understand their expectations of data protection and digital wallets.&nbsp;  



  Development of a digital wallet prototype: The SOTERIA wallet includes advanced identity verification at account creation, limiting potential fraud and enabling users to authenticate themselves to access various online services and store certified information in the form of ‘verifiable credentials.’ Users can easily share this information with online service providers while retaining full control over the shared data, with the option of revoking access at any time.&nbsp;  



  Experimental security solutions: Several new tools to guarantee data security and protect users’ privacy were explored.&nbsp;  



  Integration with online voting and examination platforms: The wallet was integrated with online voting and examination platforms, demonstrating its effectiveness in connecting to services and storing documents like examination certificates, online voting receipts and health documents.&nbsp;  



  Large-scale pilots: We conducted tests with 1,200 members of the public in Austria, Romania and Spain, using the wallet for online exams and e-health services.&nbsp;  



  Feedback analysis: Feedback from users has shown that using the digital wallet enhances their sense of security and privacy when transacting online.&nbsp;  



<p>The SOTERIA wallet is user-centric, accessible to all, and requires no specific IT skills. It protects the privacy of European citizens and gives them full control over their data, ensuring that only the data needed to access a service is shared with the service provider.</p>



<blockquote><p>The results of this project will enable IDnow to adapt its solutions to offer an eIDAS 2.0 compliant digital wallet.</p>Noémi Thomazo, Research Project Manager at IDnow.</blockquote>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a critical pillar in cybersecurity frameworks, safeguarding sensitive systems and data from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. Privileged credentials—such as those used by administrators, developers, or automation scripts—are often the target of cyberattacks due to the expansive access they provide. As such, organizations require robust PAM solutions that go beyond traditional boundaries to address emerging challenges such as shadow IT, insider threats, and secure remote access.</p>
<p>The demand for PAM solutions is driven by the growing complexity of IT environments, which now encompass hybrid infrastructures, multi-cloud ecosystems, and remote work arrangements. However, deploying and managing PAM solutions comes with its own set of operational challenges. Organizations must navigate the integration of these tools into existing systems, ensuring seamless functionality while managing privileged identities across distributed environments.</p>
<p>Effective PAM solutions today are more than just vaults for storing passwords—they enable organizations to enforce dynamic, time-limited access controls, continuously monitor user activity, and generate comprehensive audit trails. These capabilities are not only essential for security but also for meeting regulatory requirements. Syteca, formerly Ekran System, has redefined its offerings to meet these evolving demands, placing functionality, usability, and real-world applicability at the core of its approach.</p>
 The Growing Competition in the PAM Market 
<p>The PAM market has evolved rapidly over the past decade, with established players and new entrants competing for a share of this critical space. This growth reflects a broader trend in cybersecurity, as organizations increasingly prioritize the protection of privileged credentials. However, the shift toward hybrid and multi-cloud environments has added new dimensions to the challenge.</p>
<p>Organizations are no longer looking solely for tools that secure credentials; they need PAM solutions that provide agility, scalability, and ease of use without compromising security. Features like Just-in-Time (JIT) access, seamless integration with Zero Trust architectures, and compliance with ever-changing regulatory landscapes have become standard expectations.</p>
<p>Vendors are responding to this demand with diverse offerings, from feature-rich enterprise solutions to specialized tools tailored to specific industries. In this crowded market, differentiation is key. Solutions that adapt to unique business needs while addressing broader challenges, such as securing remote access and monitoring insider activities, are more likely to succeed. Syteca’s recent transformation and expanded capabilities position it as a strong contender in this competitive landscape.</p>
 Why Ekran System Became Syteca 
<p>In May 2024, Ekran System rebranded as Syteca, a strategic decision that signifies the company’s evolution and commitment to addressing the challenges of modern cybersecurity. The new name reflects Syteca’s expanded focus on delivering innovative system security and technology management solutions.</p>
<p>This transformation is more than a rebranding exercise; it marks a shift in how the company approaches Privileged Access Management. Syteca aims to align its tools with the practical needs of organizations, emphasizing usability and efficiency. Enhanced features, such as real-time threat detection, advanced session recording, and streamlined workflows, underline the company’s goal to offer comprehensive yet intuitive solutions.</p>
<p>By rebranding, Syteca positions itself as a forward-thinking player in the PAM market. The company is not only addressing the challenges organizations face today but also anticipating the needs of tomorrow, ensuring its solutions remain relevant in an ever-changing landscape.</p>
 Key Use Cases Highlighting Syteca’s Capabilities 
<p>Syteca’s approach to PAM is best understood through its real-world applications. These use cases demonstrate how the solution addresses critical security challenges across various industries and scenarios.</p>
<p>1. Detecting and Securing Shadow Accounts</p>
<p>Shadow IT accounts—those created without authorization or outside central control—pose significant security risks. These accounts are often overlooked, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by attackers. Syteca automates the discovery of shadow accounts across Windows servers and Active Directory, onboarding them securely into its secrets management system. Once onboarded, passwords are rotated, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring compliance. Security teams can then evaluate and either disable or remove unauthorized accounts, reducing exposure to potential threats.</p>
<p>2. Mitigating Insider Threats with Privileged Account Monitoring</p>
<p>Insider threats remain a major concern for organizations, particularly when dealing with privileged accounts. Syteca addresses this challenge by continuously monitoring Active Directory for new privileged accounts. Discovered accounts are secured with two-factor authentication (2FA), session recording, and role-based access control (RBAC). These measures ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive systems, with all activities logged and auditable. This proactive approach helps organizations detect suspicious behaviour early and mitigate risks effectively.</p>
<p>3. Securing Sleeping Accounts</p>
<p>Inactive or dormant accounts often go unnoticed, becoming an attractive target for attackers. For example, the account of a former employee may still be active and exploitable. Syteca’s automated discovery tools identify these sleeping accounts, onboard them into the secrets management system, and rotate credentials to cut off unauthorized access. In real-world scenarios, this capability has helped organizations close security gaps caused by oversight, ensuring that no dormant accounts remain vulnerable.</p>
<p>4. Managing Third-Party Database Administrators (DBAs)</p>
<p>Organizations often rely on external contractors, such as third-party DBAs, to maintain critical systems. These contractors require temporary yet secure access to isolated networks. Syteca facilitates this through a combination of Jump servers, ticketing system integrations, and controlled access mechanisms. Contractors can only access specific resources via pre-approved workflows, with passwords rotated after each use. Session recording ensures that all activities are logged, providing full accountability.</p>
<p>5. Enhancing Security in Healthcare</p>
<p>In healthcare settings, securing access to electronic health records (EHRs) is paramount. Hospitals and clinics use Syteca to enforce strict access controls, such as 2FA and time-based restrictions, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access patient data during working hours. Additionally, audit capabilities allow administrators to monitor and review all activities involving sensitive data, helping organizations maintain compliance with industry regulations like HIPAA.</p>
<p>6. Enabling Secure File Transfers for Marketing Agencies</p>
<p>Collaborating with external vendors often requires temporary access to sensitive systems. For a marketing agency, Syteca facilitates secure file transfers via an FTP server. Access is granted only through secrets management, with manual approval workflows ensuring that each request is vetted. Passwords are rotated after use, and sessions are recorded for auditing. This approach allows agencies to collaborate confidently without exposing sensitive client data to unnecessary risk.</p>
 The Future of PAM 
<p>The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, and Privileged Access Management is at the forefront of this change. Organizations face mounting pressure to secure their privileged credentials while navigating complex IT ecosystems and regulatory requirements. Syteca’s transformation and its ability to address diverse use cases illustrate its commitment to meeting these challenges.</p>
<p>By focusing on usability, scalability, and real-world applicability, Syteca provides organizations with tools to address critical security gaps. Whether detecting shadow IT accounts, mitigating insider threats, or securing third-party access, Syteca demonstrates how PAM solutions can evolve to meet the needs of today’s security-conscious organizations.</p>
<p>As competition in the PAM market intensifies, solutions like Syteca will be instrumental in helping organizations achieve their security goals. With its comprehensive feature set and forward-thinking approach, Syteca is well-positioned to redefine what it means to manage privileged access effectively in the 21st century.</p>

			 What the electronic seal is and what it is for 		 
				 
				 
				 
			 What the electronic seal is and how it works 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>The electronic seal is a digital technology that guarantees the authenticity, integrity and origin of the digital documents to which it is applied. It was introduced by EU Regulation 910/2014 (eIDAS), which defines it as a set of data in electronic form “which is attached to or logically associated with other data in electronic form” with the aim of guaranteeing the origin and integrity of the document.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This tool can be considered as a kind of digital stamp, used predominantly by legal entities (companies, organisations) to certify the origin and integrity of digital documents. Unlike an electronic signature, which identifies a natural person, an electronic seal associates the document with an organisational entity, protecting it from unauthorised modification and guaranteeing its authenticity.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 The qualified electronic seal (QeSeal) 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>The qualified electronic seal is created using a device that contains a qualified certificate, which guarantees the highest level of security and reliability for the authentication of digital documents. This is an advanced version of the electronic seal, which offers additional legal guarantees thanks to its compliance with strict European standards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Unlike the advanced electronic seal (AdESeal), a qualified electronic seal is created by means of a device containing a certificate issued in compliance with the requirements laid down by EU legislation. It can, therefore, be defined as the equivalent of a qualified electronic signature, the only difference being that it does not refer to a natural person, but to a legal entity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So while, through a digital signature, the data of the natural person who applied it can be traced, a qualified electronic seal makes it possible to trace the name of the legal entity. For this reason, it can be used for myriad activities, even by numerous parties belonging to the same company or organisation. It can, for example, be used to prove ownership of business documents, to protect intellectual works, for certificates of incorporation, for the management of medical records and medical reports as well as for many other purposes.</p>   						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How to Obtain It 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>To obtain it, a legal entity must go through an even more stringent verification process, conducted by a Certification Authority authorised by a government agency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>InfoCert was among the first Qualified Trust Service Providers to be certified for the Qualified Electronic Seal, gaining recognition for its qualified validation services. This allows InfoCert to issue electronic seals for multiple uses, such as the <a href="https://infocert.digital/consumer/eprel/">eSeal for EPREL</a>, the European Product Registry for Energy Labelling, with which companies wishing to apply for the energy classification of their products must register.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Find out more about the <a href="https://infocert.digital/consumer/eseal/">Electronic Seal</a>.</p>

<p>Interoperability is the cornerstone of decentralized identity, ensuring that diverse ecosystems can seamlessly interact&nbsp; with each other. At Indicio, we are constantly working to advance&nbsp; interoperability so that customer solutions will be able to work with all the emerging standards and protocols and effortlessly scale to meet opportunities. This is why we are excited to participate in the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/join-the-didcomm-interop-a-thon/">upcoming DIDComm Interop-a-thon, organized by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://didcomm.org/">DIDComm</a> is short for Decentralized Identifier Communication, an open standard for secure, private, peer-to-peer communication between Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). It’s one of the least-well understood aspects of decentralized identity and one of the most powerful —&nbsp;especially for business. DIDComm enables each party in a decentralized identity ecosystem to seamlessly authenticate the other over a secure channel before sharing data. But it also enables a mobile device to function with the capacity of an API, enabling anyone with a mobile phone and digital wallet to become their own, highly available, easily permissioned, data platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many people think about decentralized identity as an “identity verification” solution — not surprising given the scale of current identity fraud —&nbsp;DIDComm enables decentralized identity to go beyond that and create trust networks for much richer digital relationships and data sharing.</p>
<p>For the upcoming Interop-a-thon, Indicio is providing our <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-public-mediator-2/">robust mediator</a>. Mediators play a critical role in the DIDComm protocol, enabling message routing between mobile devices, ensuring smooth and secure communication. Developers will be able to access the Indicio Mediator to test routing and communication scenarios in a secure, reliable environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we are committed to supporting the decentralized identity community. By supporting events like the DIDComm DIF Interop-a-thon, we’re not only contributing infrastructure but also championing the values of collaboration and innovation that drive this space forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see the incredible advancements that emerge from this event. If you’re attending, be sure to test with our mediator and share your experiences with us. Together, we’ll continue to build a decentralized future that works for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to learn more about the DIDComm DIF Interop-a-thon or our work with mediators? <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Contact us</a>. Let’s build the future of interoperability together!</p>

  Name: Juliano C. C. Tavares<br>Team: Engineering<br>Based in:&nbsp;Paraná, Brazil   About Juliano <p>I always knew I wanted to work in computing, and my journey began with university projects. My focus then was distributed systems and wireless networks, so I started specializing in those. I worked for a few years with wireless networks and embedded systems, completing a master's degree in IoT during that time. After a few years of working in the field, I realized that I liked working with web development much more and started to follow that path.</p><p>SpruceID came into my life years later as a professional challenge. It is very exciting to develop ambitious projects and open-source libraries that contribute to the digital future.</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>I'm currently a senior software engineer at SpruceID, working mainly with front-ends and occasionally touching some wild Rust code. I believe my biggest contributions here were in the SSX project, which is a wrapper for our other library SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum), and also this year in the project with Utah. I had the opportunity to work here on some things I was very interested in learning about (e.g., WebAssembly and mobile development) and things I had never imagined working with (Rust front-end). We definitely have a lot of challenges and opportunities to learn and apply new tools and technologies.</p> What do you find most rewarding about your role? <p>I am very happy when we finish a project, and it starts to be used by customers. At SpruceID, in addition to the projects that the end user will use, we also have libraries that other developers can build with. There is a huge potential for people who will be reached by our work.</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Curiosity and persistence. We work with technologies that are still evolving, and our decisions will shape many of the paths forward. With no established playbook to guide us, we rely on our own exploration and determination to define the way.</p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>I have a web development background and am venturing into mobile. I'm still trying to improve my skills and knowledge in this area.</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>In addition to what I said earlier about the projects, I couldn't leave out our team meetings. We had many incredible moments in Japan, Ireland, and Portugal, and I can't forget to mention everyone's visit to Brazil, where I was able to show a little more about my culture.</p> What's the best piece of advice you've received since starting here? <p>Have confidence in your work—it’s genuinely excellent, and we all recognize and appreciate that.</p> What is some advice that you’d give to someone in your role who is early in their career? <p>Challenge yourself to solve problems that you look at and say, "I have no idea where to start."</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>Deliver on time, few without bugs, and with good code.</p> Fun Facts <p>What do you enjoy doing in your free time?:&nbsp;cooking, watching movies, playing volleyball and camping with friends.</p><p>What is your favorite coding language (and why?):&nbsp;JavaScript/TypeScript, because it's what I've used the most and feel most comfortable coding with.</p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: I would be a Trumpet Tree. It is a Brazilian tree, and here we call it Ipê, which is a name originating from Tupi and means "rough-barked tree." This tree is very common here and always colors our springs.</p><p>Interested in joining our team?

  <p>Disruptions are a constant in the world of cybersecurity. Deliberate disruption is becoming more prevalent as attackers find ways to maximize profit by undermining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of our data. As attackers refine and mature their techniques to drive greater disruption, we must explore how we can become more resilient. But is securing everything by design the best approach? This session will suggest a different path, called the DIE Triad, which enables us to become truly resilient and even stronger in the face of today's disruptions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/die-triad-approach-cyber-resilience-strategy-cre24"></a>

<p>This article is the sixth and final article in a series about our <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking product</a>, Track &amp; Trust. Our previous articles described how the system works. Now, we dive into the results of our pilot operations. TLDR – We successfully tracked all the goods to their final delivery locations despite serious challenges!</p>
 The Track &amp; Trust Mission in Southern Lebanon 
<p></p>
<p>We chose to track shipments of solar equipment for the Track &amp; Trust Pilot. Destined for clinics and schools serving refugees in Beqaa Valley, Lebanon, these shipments were critical to the region. The area is home to over 300,000 Syrian refugees, according to <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/lb/bekaa-zahle#:~:text=As%20of%2001%20January%202023,total%20number%20of%20registered%20refugees.">UNHCR</a>, and they all need medical care. Our partners, <a href="https://aidpioneers.com/home">Aid Pioneers</a>, <a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/about-us/">Multi Aid Programs</a>, and <a href="https://al-manhaj-lb.org/home/">Al-Manhaj</a>, collaborate to provide logistics, education, and medical care on the ground.</p>
<p>The clinics and schools require continuous a continuous electrical power supply. Due to Lebanon’s severe energy crisis, the public grid provides only about two hours of electricity per day, making the delivery of efficient healthcare services an immense challenge. In absence of a stable grid, most of the region’s essential services rely on generators, leaving the financial stability of operations at the whim of the ever-increasing price of diesel. Typical health clinics have thousands of dollars in monthly operating costs due to the need to purchase this fuel. To address this, Aid Pioneers is replacing diesel power systems with clean, abundant solar energy, one clinic at a time. By reliably shipping the equipment from Tripoli to Beqaa Valley, they achieve this goal with our help. Specifically the shipments we’ve tracked during the pilot contained all the equipment needed to outfit two clinics with enough solar power to cover all their needs. Aid Pioneers partner, <a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/about-us/">Multi Aid Programs</a><a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/">&nbsp;</a>runs the clinics which received the solar and medical equipment we tracked.</p>
 Tracking Impact 
<p></p>
<p>Using Track &amp; Trust, Aid Pioneers and their partners gained a clear view of what was happening to the parts in their shipment. As a result, they avoided extra trips, saving work and potential exposure to danger. Our team planned this deployment long before the recent conflict broke out, and our system performed well in the midst of a very difficult situation. Effective management of the challenges that arose was crucial to the success of the project.</p>
<p>During the shipments, ground personnel encountered outages of critical infrastructure, losing power and 4G connectivity several times. Fortunately, our Track &amp; Trust mesh node infrastructure filled the gap, and our battery backup system enabled the system to run despite the power grid being down. The system’s design allowed it to handle such outages.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When 4G connectivity was lost, our mesh nodes cached delivery data until it could be passed between nodes. Utilizing technologies developed with our partner, <a href="https://www.weaverlabs.io/">Weaver Labs</a>, we ensured the data was secure. Next, we used a satellite-enabled mesh node to post data that would have otherwise been lost via Iridium satellite uplink, developed by our partner <a href="https://ororatech.com/">Ororatech</a>.</p>
<p>Aid Pioneers received hundreds of updates about the status of the goods from us. To ensure the integrity of the data, we cryptographically signed and anchored these updates to the ASI Alliance blockchain, making them highly trustworthy. This extra step was crucial to the project’s success. Together the result is highly trustable <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking</a>.</p>
 Energy Independence One Clinic at a Time 
<p></p>
<p>Two major sets of shipments were completed under the watchful eye of Track &amp; Trust, and a third set is currently being shipped to Lebanon. With 110 kWp of power, the solar systems make two entire clinics energy independent for the next twenty years. Additionally, we tracked a container of medical goods, which <a href="https://al-manhaj-lb.org/home/">Al-Manhaj</a> and <a href="https://multiaidprograms.org/about-us/">Multi Aid Programs</a> are using to save lives and provide medical treatment in Tripoli and the Beqaa Valley.</p>
 Track &amp; Trust Proof of Resilience 
<p>The design of Track &amp; Trust allows it to work in various contexts, providing resilience and <a href="https://datarella.com/track-trust-probabilistic-360-supply-chain-tracking/">probabilistic 360° supply chain tracking</a>. Adaptable to different scenarios, our system is highly versatile. As we continue to develop and refine our system, we will meet the changing needs of our partners.</p>
 Next Steps 
<p>Following this piloting success, we will examine plans to make the system more user-friendly. Logistics organizations that could use more resilience in their field operations are also being contacted. If this series of blog posts has piqued your interest, please <a href="mailto:rebecca.johnson@datarella.com">reach out</a>, and we will schedule a call or demo.</p>

 Digitalization ‘for all’? An Update on Germany’s Public Sector from the 2024 Smart Country Convention <p>As governments around the world step up to regulate artificial intelligence and biometrics, a different class of technology aims to disrupt digital identity: digital wallets. Caribou is leading a research project that aims to advance migrants’ identification needs in digital identity wallet policy and technology design. <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/identity-and-migration/">Explore the&nbsp;project</a>.</p><p>Since 2018, the Smart Country Convention has set out to bring together Germany’s digital economy and political decision-makers, as well as other stakeholders in the ever-growing field of public sector digital transformation.</p><p>The event is hosted by Messe Berlin, the Berlin Expo Center, and bitkom e.V., one of Germany’s largest industry associations for the digital economy. According to <a href="https://www.smartcountry.berlin/en/concept/facts-and-figures/">its website</a>, the Smart Country Convention — or SCCON for short — has become “the biggest event for smart cities, smart regions and e-government” in Germany. Indeed, with more than 18,000 attendees, over 17,000 square meters of exhibition space and a conference program featuring more than 650 speakers on 7 stages, the event is a large-scale, upbeat demonstration of what the future of the German public sector might look like — or at least what technology vendors, policymakers and other professionals in this field imagine it&nbsp;will.</p><p>In between ping-pong matches, live podcast recordings, and free frozen yoghurt, keynote speakers and panelists discussed the current state of digital transformation in the German public sector. They shed light on challenges, best practices and how to work towards Germany’s policy priorities for digital transformation, as outlined in the <a href="https://digitalstrategie-deutschland.de/static/eb25ff71f36b8cf2d01418ded8ae3dc2/Digitalstrategie_EN.pdf">2022 Digital Strategy</a> of the now defunct <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v3r046pzzo">Traffic Light Coalition</a>. These insights also revealed the stark discrepancy between the image projected by SCCON and where the country actually stands. Take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRtjBQ5YSaQ">opening keynote by Kai Wegner</a>, the governing mayor of Berlin, on the second day of SCCON. He announced that Berliners can now register/change their address online — if they have downloaded the AusweisApp, opened a BundID account, have an NFC-enabled smartphone or special card reader, and either the German national ID card, the eID card for citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area, or an electronic residence card with an active eID function (and remember the PIN code they need for all of this to&nbsp;work).</p>October 16, 2024, Day 2 Opening&nbsp;Keynote.<p>The excitement and sense of digital awakening evoked by Wegner’s keynote, set against a backdrop of flashing lights and cinema-size screens, illustrates the immense undertaking Germany has ahead of it. So far, the country <a href="https://www.bundesrechnungshof.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Berichte/2023/onlinezugangsgesetz-volltext.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">has fallen far short of its stated goal of digitizing access to nearly 600 public services by 2022.</a> On the day of the deadline, only 19% of these services were available online. <a href="https://insm.de/aktuelles/publikationen/digitale-transformation-deutschland-scheitert-beim-e-government">By the beginning of 2024, only 153 services had gone online nationwide.</a> In terms of the overall target, this represents an implementation rate of just 26.6% — a full year after the original deadline. Germany’s sluggish pace makes the city-state of Hamburg,<a href="https://dashboard.digitale-verwaltung.de/"> where 284 public services are available online</a>, the (literal) North Star of this ongoing restructuring process.</p><p>At the heart of this public administration overhaul is the issue of digital identity management and how governments, whether at the federal, regional or local level, enable access to services. It’s against this backdrop that another name has emerged in the competition for the most innovative city: Wiesbaden. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSLpFpihvSg&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=24">Maral Koohestanian, Deputy Mayor of Wiesbaden, was one of four panelists who discussed the state of digital identity in Germany at this year’s SCCON, moderated by Clemens Schleupner of bitkom.</a> Koohestanian, <a href="https://voltdeutschland.org/neuigkeiten/maral-koohestanian-fuehrt-volt-in-die-bundestagswahl-2025">who is now leading the Bundestag election campaign for Volt</a>, emphasized Wiesbaden’s pragmatic approach. <a href="https://webid-solutions.com/de/ressourcen/presse/egovernment-wiesbadens-politik-beschliesst-videoidentifikation-stadtweit/">Working with WebID and ekom, the city has adopted VideoID to provide access to public services.</a></p><p>According to Koohestanian, Wiesbaden’s approach is unique in Germany. Many people have already been introduced to VideoID, for example when opening a bank account. So the process is known and accepted. In comparison, the identity verification approach taken by Berlin and other cities is based on the national eID infrastructure, as mentioned above. While Germany’s national eID infrastructure covers three types of documents (i.e. the national identity card [Personalausweis], the eID card for EU/EAA citizens, the electronic residence permit), VideoID can be used to verify around 200 international identity documents. VideoID therefore is open to more users, also because it requires less specific equipment.</p><p>During the panel discussion, Koohestanian underlined the advantage that VideoID offers in terms of the inclusiveness of the approach and its overall user acceptance. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSLpFpihvSg&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=24">The numbers she presented</a> seem to speak for themselves: When registering a wedding date at the Wiesbaden registry office, 98% opted to do so online, compared to 2% of people who preferred to register in person (in all cases, the ceremony itself takes place in person). Of the online users, 92.5% chose VideoID, compared to 7.5% who preferred the eID option. If people want to register/change their address online, <a href="https://www.wiesbaden.de/medien/rathausnachrichten/PM_Zielseite.php?showpm=true&amp;pmurl=https://www.wiesbaden.de/guiapplications/newsdesk/publications/Landeshauptstadt_Wiesbaden/141010100000474138.php">in Wiesbaden this service is for now carried out exclusively via&nbsp;VideoID.</a></p><p>Koohestanian’s emphasis foreshadowed the theme of the next day’s opening keynote by Federal Minister Lisa Paus (Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth). “Some people today are afraid that the digitalization train could leave without them,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WU6Prs2rOdo&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa-wn8ynMFrNZCEFGBL60Pga&amp;index=57">Paus said in her speech</a>, stressing the need to strengthen inclusion, participation and accessibility of the digital transformation in Germany. While focusing on the inclusion of the elderly, Paus raised the question of how to ensure that digitalization is for all. As important as this question is, it however first requires a definition of what ‘for all’&nbsp;means.</p><p>Looking at the emerging digital identity ecosystem in Germany, ‘all’ currently seems to include only those who have access to the country’s existing eID infrastructure, i.e. people with German citizenship, EU citizens living in Germany, and non-EU citizens who have successfully applied for a residence permit. This may sound like Germany has all its citizens and residents covered. But the situation is more complicated than it might seem at first glance. Take, for example, non-EU citizens who come to Germany to take up a job offer. <a href="https://www.bamf.de/EN/Themen/MigrationAufenthalt/ZuwandererDrittstaaten/Migrathek/Einreisebestimmungen/einreisebestimmungen-node.html">If they enter on a work visa, this title is usually valid for up to 12 months.</a> During this time, they will have to deal with the German bureaucracy, especially the immigration authorities at their place of residence to apply for and receive their electronic residence permit.</p><p>At present, this interaction can be a largely paper-based, face-to-face process, depending on the local authority, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIE-jsSUZ3g&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=54">a topic that was the subject of another panel discussion at SCCON.</a> During this panel discussion, Engelhard Mazanke, head of the Berlin Landesamt für Einwanderung, the city-state’s immigration authority, explained that practices vary widely across Germany. Not every immigration authority allows things to be sent to them as PDFs. Often documents have to be submitted in the original, perhaps even with an apostille. Mazanke criticized the fact that migration-related procedures are always dealt with on the assumption of potential misuse, even when processing applications for what he described as the ‘Rolls-Royce’ category of all residence permits, the EU Blue Card. Opportunities for digitizing processes and simplifying bureaucracy are limited if this is the default attitude towards non-Germans, he explained.</p><p><a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2024/wiesbaden-und-koeln-bedenkliches-videoident-verfahren-soll-gang-aufs-amt-sparen/">Concerns about misuse are also a reason for criticism of the use of VideoID in Wiesbaden.</a> The German eID infrastructure, on the other hand, is regarded as highly secure. In the context of eIDAS 2.0, it provides the only means of identification suitable for verifying the identity of Germany-based EUDI wallet users in accordance with LoA high requirements. At the SCCON panel on digital identity, the representative of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior raised the issue of the reliability of identity systems outside Europe when asked how people in Germany who are outside the national eID infrastructure could be integrated into the country’s emerging wallet ecosystem. About an hour later, on another stage, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIE-jsSUZ3g&amp;list=PLudpuI-TLPa9sr2tZEOY0My7i62E7Wo82&amp;index=54">Tobias Lindner, Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office, emphasized the need for attractive migration processes and for Germany to present itself as welcoming and service-oriented to new residents and citizens.</a></p><p>As such, SCCON brought to the fore another challenge for Germany’s digital transformation efforts. Not only is there a tension between inclusion and security concerns. The messages from government officials and policymakers tell different stories, illustrating the fragmentation of political decision-making and implementation processes. Given the centrality of digital identity to Germany’s vision of modern statehood, it would certainly be a good topic for the country to start speaking with one&nbsp;voice.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digitalization-for-all-fb86e03ad679">Digitalization ‘for all’?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>How can we ensure that the person presenting a credential is truly the same person who received the credential? This is a crucial question, especially when dealing with sensitive information. Our approach is to have the biometric provider issue a short-lived credential attesting to a recent biometric check whenever the issuer or verifier needs to confirm the physical presence of a credential holder. This biometric check credential can be used by the issuer to embed biometric-binding attributes into the primary credential of interest (the credential issued by a standard issuer, such as a bank or government authority), and then it can be used by the verifier to check that it is the same person presenting the primary credential. Let's break down the process:</p>  Enrollment: The first step involves the user providing a biometric sample, such as a thumbprint or face scan, which the biometric provider can use to generate a biometric enrollment credential. The key advantage here is that the biometric data remains on the user's device—there's no need for the biometric provider to maintain a large, potentially vulnerable database. This credential, signed by the biometric provider, is secure and tamper-proof.  Issuance: The biometric provider can use the enrollment credential from the previous step to derive a separate biometric check credential that is shared with the issuer of the primary credential. The biometric check credential does not contain the biometric data, but is evidence that the biometric provider was able to successfully check a biometric that matches a specific privacy-preserving biometric ID. The issuer embeds into the primary credential some attributes identifying the issuer of the biometric check credential and the biometric ID that was used. These are known as biometric-binding attributes.  Verification: When verifying the primary credential, relying parties will also request a fresh biometric check credential. The user’s wallet will enable the biometric provider to perform a new biometric check and issue the associated credential containing the same biometric ID that was recorded in the enrollment credential. The verifier can then confirm that the biometric ID in the primary credential matches the biometric ID in the biometric check credential, proving that it is the same physical person who was issued the primary credential.  <p>As an example, let’s look at how a bank can tie a customer identity credential to an individual’s biometric. Before issuing the credential, the bank would request that the customer shares a fresh biometric check credential. This will trigger the wallet to enroll the customer’s biometric as part of issuing the biometric check credential. The bank can then embed the biometric-binding attributes into the customer identity credential that they issue. When the customer wants to prove their identity to a verifier, the verifier can require a recent biometric check credential along with the bank-issued identity credential. This will trigger the wallet to have the biometric provider run a biometric check and issue a new biometric check credential which will then be used to confirm that the person presenting the bank identity credential is indeed the same person who originally received it.</p><p>By making the biometric provider a recognized issuer within the credentialing ecosystem, we streamline the process. All necessary integrations happen on the user's device, ensuring data security while allowing for robust biometric proofing and credential binding. This method eliminates the need for each participant in the ecosystem to integrate directly with the biometric provider, reducing complexity and cost. Additionally, the biometric provider can monetize their services as these credentials are utilized throughout the ecosystem.</p><p>You can learn more by reading our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/solutions/biometric-bound-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">documentation on biometric-bound credentials</a> and the <a href="https://docs.dock.io/developer-documentation/wallet-sdk/biometric-plugin?ref=blog.dock.io">biometric service provider plugin for wallets</a>.</p>

  <p>The increasing popularity of the term “Identity Security”, coupled with the explosive growth in the number of&nbsp; identity security vendors, bears testament to the fact that security starts and often ends with identity. But with so many tools, so many processes moving part making up the modern identity fabric, do you really know what is really happening behind the curtain and inside all that IAM infrastructure?&nbsp; Accounts are created, entitlements are assigned, users authenticate, access is authorized and data is accessed.&nbsp; This process not only happens for the standard users coming in through a nicely federated, passwordless authentication solution, but also for your admins, your agents and the service accounts they leverage. The very process of IAM is happening across all of your infrastructure, from legacy applications to cloud services and beyond into IaaS and the SaaS services you subscribe to. But when something changes in that flow, the configuration for an IdP or a relying system changes, or an update is made to profile configuration, orchestration flow or group assignment - will you identify the change, understand its meaning and forecast its overall risk to your identity security posture?&nbsp; Are you instrumented for the future state of IAM?</p>
<p>In his talk, KuppingerCole Fellow Analyst Darran Rolls, former CISO and CTO at SailPoint, will outline how Identity instrumentation and orchestration technology can help reverse-engineer the authentication and authorization flow of applications and provide key insights into configuration and usage.&nbsp; He will explain how the future state of IGA, ITDR, and overall Identity Security must deliver instrumentation to allow visibility, configuration and usage information for all applications and will highlight how emerging technologies can help fill this gap.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/looking-behind-the-curtain-cre24"></a>

  <p>AI agents are starting&nbsp;to&nbsp;reshape enterprise IT, forcing security leaders to cut through the marketing hype and identify true innovations. Using recent CyberSecEval benchmarks, we'll examine what these technologies can and cannot do in real security applications. We'll compare how AI agents impact both attack and defense, determining if either side gains a decisive advantage. Through practical examples, we'll see how these agents are already at work in security operations. Finally, we'll explore emerging design patterns and security principles, giving leaders clear direction on safely navigating the AI revolution in cybersecurity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/agent-smith-entered-the-game-cre24"></a>

<p>If a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is. Scroll on, or be very cautious if you decide to click. That’s the warning coming from just about everywhere as the 2024 holiday season ramps up.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-ai-deepfakes-and-scams-are-changing-the-way-we-shop-online/">McAfee’s 2024 Global Holiday Shopping Scams Study</a> pinpoints AI-generated deepfake texts, emails and web sites promoting fake products, deals and giveaways as the main concern for holiday shoppers this year, with <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/tips-tricks/how-ai-deepfakes-and-scams-are-changing-the-way-we-shop-online/">70 per cent</a> of American shoppers saying AI-driven scams are changing the way they shop online, and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241115918692/en/McAfee%E2%80%99s-2024-Global-Holiday-Shopping-Scams-Study-Highlights-Growing-Concerns-Over-AI-Powered-Scams-Including-Deepfakes-Impacting-Holiday-Shoppers">59 per cent</a> saying they’re more concerned by scams this year than they were last year.</p>



<p>Deepfake technology uses AI to create fabricated content such as video or photo impersonations, fake or cloned voices, images, or email. It makes content look like the real thing, within the proper context, and sounds or reads like&nbsp;a legitimate message. Behind the fake site or message is a bad actor waiting to pounce.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/11/07/new-chrome-safari-edge-firefox-warning-do-not-use-these-websites/">Forbes</a> and other outlets recently warned the billions of users of the most popular web browsers Chrome, Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox about bad actors who had infected 1,000+ web sites to create and promote fake product listings that landed high in search listings and were backed by 121 fake web stores. Estimated losses ran into the tens of millions over the past five years, and affected hundreds of thousands of consumers—and that was just from one scam campaign under investigation.</p>



<p>Leading into the holiday season and massive sales days like Black Friday, <a href="https://home.barclays/news/press-releases/2024/11/deal-or-steal--black-friday-shoppers-at-risk--as-only-half-carry/">Barclays</a> is warning shoppers not to be lax about scam checking, particularly those that come via email—the most reported type of shopping scam. Barclays is urging customers to check email alerts of sales that claim to be from a legitimate retailer like Amazon or Costco advertising their Black Friday deals before making a purchase.</p>



<p>In fact, being hypervigilant about checking the authenticity of holiday sales <a href="https://www.choice.com.au/consumers-and-data/protecting-your-data/data-privacy-and-safety/articles/how-to-check-if-email-or-text-is-scam">messages and email</a>s and the <a href="https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/education/basics/how-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit">URL</a>s they point you to, is key to beating the scammers.</p>



<p>Here’s our best advice:</p>



 Be suspicious of messages with: 



 
 Unsolicited offers or deals that seem too good to be true 



 Poor grammar or odd phrasing (but don’t rely on this being the case, as scammers and their AI-generated solicitations are getting more sophisticated) 



 A sense of urgency, such as “limited time offers” or “act now or miss out” messages 



 Links to unfamiliar websites. 
 



 Use secure payment methods 



<p>Use only reputable payment systems like credit cards or PayPal, which offer buyer protection. Avoid wire transfers or sending money via gift cards. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">Or use a MySudo virtual card</a>.</p>



 Before purchasing, look for reviews of the online store or product you’re interested in 



<p>But remember: AI-generated fake reviews are now commonplace, so be cautious if the reviews seem overly positive or generic.</p>



 Be alert to fake holiday giveaways and contests, and fake social media profiles 



<p>Giveaways and contests that ask for personal information or require you to click a link are almost certainly scams. Always check the authenticity of any giveaway and don’t share your personal information unless you’re sure it’s with a legitimate source.</p>



<p>Scammers use AI to create fake social media profiles that look like real people, offering fake promotions or asking for donations. Look for verification badges or use reverse image search to confirm the person or brand is legitimate.</p>



 Be careful of pop-ups and banner ads that offer discounts, prizes or exclusive deals 



<p>Understand that these could redirect you to fake websites or lead to malware downloads.</p>



 Only click on links from trusted sources 



<p>If you see a link in an email or message that seems too good to be true, manually type the URL into your browser. Or, if it’s a merchant you have used before, use your bookmark for the site if you have one.</p>



 Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) 



<p>Adding an extra layer of security to your accounts on shopping sites, email accounts, and banks, can protect you from scams that want your login credentials. Don’t share or reuse passwords across different sites, especially for sensitive accounts.</p>



 Warn family and friends 



<p>Tell your people about the risks of AI-driven scams, especially older adults who may be less tech-savvy. You can also avoid deepfake scams involving loved ones, particularly the common <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-to-use-mysudo-to-save-loved-ones-from-voice-deep-fake-scams/">grandparent scam</a>, by using MySudo:</p>



<p>1.&nbsp;Set up a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;and assign it a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;that you&nbsp;only ever give out to your closest family and friends.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp;Be diligent about only giving out the number to your loved ones so that you build and protect a&nbsp;trusted communication channel with your inner circle.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;Tell your loved ones they can trust the safe Sudo number. If that number rings, the call recipient will know it’s a legitimate communication and it’s you on the end of the phone line. If you’ve been diligent in protecting your safe Sudo number, it is very unlikely a criminal would have it.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">Invite your family and friends</a>&nbsp;to use MySudo and use the app’s&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/securely-chat-with-your-friends-with-free-sudo-handles/">handle</a>-based&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">end-to-end encrypted</a>&nbsp;calling to communicate with each other.</p>



<p>Share scam alerts, and follow organizations like the <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/scams">Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a> and <a href="https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker">Better Business Bureau (BBB)</a> to learn about and report scams.</p>



 Check the website’s URL 



<p>Always double check the website’s URL starts with “https://” and includes a secure padlock symbol in the address bar. <a href="https://www.chase.com/personal/credit-cards/education/basics/how-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit">Learn more</a>.</p>



 Keep software updated 



<p>Regularly update your devices, browsers, and security software to protect against known vulnerabilities.</p>



 Keep up with AI trends 



<p>Get familiar with common AI scam tactics so you can spot them early and easily.</p>



 Fight AI with AI 



<p>Some antivirus and security software now includes AI-powered features that help detect phishing attempts, malicious links, and other scam activities. Use these tools for added protection.</p>







 Use <a href="http://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo">MySudo</a>&nbsp;to set up a dedicated shopping email and phone number for buying online year-round, but particularly during holidays 



 
 Set up a dedicated shopping Sudo: 



 Name your Sudo. This is the name you want to go by when using this Sudo. It might be your own name or a nickname. 



 Add a purpose. Call it Shopping Sudo or something else you’ll remember. 



 Confirm the email address that displays during Sudo set-up. 



 Add a phone number. 



 Supercharge your privacy by adding a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">virtual card</a>. Virtual cards are secure stand-ins for your actual cards or bank accounts and protect your personal information and your money. 



 Use your Shopping Sudo’s details instead of your personal details for all your shopping-related activities: 



 Use your Sudo email to open store accounts and sign up for deals and discounts. 



 Use the private browser in your Sudo to find the perfect product or search for sensitive purchases. The browser is ad and tracker free and keeps your browsing history, bookmarks and tabs all within the relevant Sudo. 



 Once you’ve found a great deal, check out and pay for it with your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">virtual card</a>. A virtual card doesn’t reveal any of your personal information when you make purchases. You might use your Sudo phone and email at the checkout, too.

This approach allows them to test various strategies in diverse contexts, and identify what works best and for whom. However, this comes with a challenge for portfolio managers, how can they make confident decisions when presented with fundamentally different types of evidence?</p><p>Take two digital upskilling programs for entrepreneurs. One has gathered a selection of insights that shows high participant satisfaction scores and a series of uplifting stories. The other has modest results from a well-implemented randomized evaluation. Which one should get continued investment? This question reveals an often frustrating challenge in portfolio management: while demonstrating impact is key to scaling successful interventions, an end-to-end approach to measurement isn’t always feasible. This requires a framework to join disparate kinds of evidence.</p><p>This challenge emerges from the nature of portfolio work itself. Programs may be at different implementation stages, involve distinct initiatives, or offer different opportunities for measuring change based on their design and context. These differences naturally lead to varied impact measurement approaches. A startup testing a new financial inclusion solution requires different evaluation metrics than an established program preparing for national expansion.</p> Descriptive studies give an indication of immediate outcomes but may overstate long-term impact <p>Caribou’s analysis of 143 studies in our recently updated <a href="https://evidence.strivecommunity.org/">Small Business Evidence Map</a> shows that different evaluation approaches tell different parts of an impact story. Initial assessments, like ex-post surveys or interviews, often present a positive view of a program. By capturing immediate reactions and experiences, they help programs adapt to local contexts and highlight key components that drive&nbsp;success.</p><p>This aligns with Bertrand and Mullainathan’s (2001) insights into <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=260131">subjective survey data reliability</a>. Data often captures immediate reactions and intentions rather than long-term behaviors. Participants, especially young entrepreneurs, may express optimism about their future, influenced more by personality and outlook than by any tangible support they received. McKenzie and Woodruff (2014) <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/cbf23c46-7c97-5a20-b403-a5fe1f0ffe5f/content">document similar patterns</a> in business training evaluations, where participants’ stated intentions often diverged from actual implementation when faced with day-to-day time and resource constraints.</p><p>One of Caribou’s partners recently conducted a survey on the impact of a digital upskilling platform for entrepreneurs in a middle-income country. They asked about entrepreneurs’ perception of their business’ growth over the previous three&nbsp;months:</p><p>The data alone might be encouraging — over half of surveyed entrepreneurs reported business growth. This aligns with what we often see in entrepreneurship programs: participants tend to express optimism about their business trajectory. However, in this case their optimism has nothing to do with any support they received. Additional data reveals a fuller&nbsp;picture:</p><p>Comparing the control group to entrepreneurs who were actually invited to participate in the program shows almost identical levels of perceived growth. What initially looked like evidence of program success — high rates of perceived business growth among participants — was simply capturing the natural optimism of entrepreneurs and perhaps broader economic conditions. Without this comparison group, this positive outlook might have been mistakenly attributed to the&nbsp;program.</p><p>This example illustrates a broader point: the validity of findings depends heavily on study design and the potential for biases. <a href="https://catalogofbias.org/biases/selection-bias/">Selection bias</a>, <a href="https://catalogofbias.org/biases/recall-bias/">recall bias</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribution_bias">attribution bias</a> are common challenges. Without proper comparison, positive outcomes may be incorrectly attributed to a program’s influence. Yet understanding underwhelming or null results often requires looking beyond the numbers. Qualitative insights and implementation analysis can reveal more about the mechanisms behind underperformance.</p> Causal studies provide more reliable, and (usually) more modest, estimates of effectiveness <p>Causal studies, including <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/introduction-randomized-evaluations">Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)</a>, attempt to address these challenges by measuring actual behaviors rather than intentions. Their strict design and focus on specific pathways make it easier to attribute change to a program, though often they can only test limited pathways at a time. Between purely observational studies and RCTs lie other methods — like qualitative comparative analysis and process tracing — that can help establish causal relationships while accommodating complexity.</p><p>While causal studies excel at establishing causality, they often do so at the cost of generalizability. They are costly and may miss subtle mechanisms or long-term effects shaped by cultural, institutional, or local contexts. The trade-off between internal validity (precision in measurement) and external validity (ability to generalize) can be significant in portfolio evaluation, yet often lies beyond the scope of experimental designs (see Ravallion 2001 for an <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/410881468180273314/pdf/773500JRN02001000Vanishing0Benefits.pdf">entertaining and insightful discussion</a> of such methodological tensions).</p> Why not both? Strategically matching impact evidence&nbsp;types <p>Effective portfolio facilitation requires matching evidence approaches to specific needs. A mixed methods approach can strengthen causal claims by combining qualitative insights with quantitative rigor. Qualitative methods can reveal underlying mechanisms, while descriptive quantitative analysis helps identify patterns that need further&nbsp;testing.</p><p>This matching process requires careful judgment. For instance, an upskilling intervention might seem ready for scaling based on participant support, but portfolio managers need to understand if it actually improves business outcomes and under what conditions. Meanwhile, a program showing modest impacts in an RCT may offer key implementation lessons that could boost impact in different iterations through a careful analysis of its components.</p> Four practical ways to achieve a nuanced understanding of portfolio impact <p>Understanding impact requires both rigor and context. As development practitioners, we need to appreciate the value and limitations of both observational and causal studies to develop a nuanced understanding of intervention outcomes. At Caribou, we employ four specific strategies to effectively navigate the challenges of diverse impact approaches within a portfolio:</p>  We strategically mix impact approaches within projects and portfolios. A mixed methods approach can be used either within specific projects or across a portfolio of projects to get a fuller picture of impact. Within a single project, combining descriptive with causal studies can provide both qualitative insights and rigorous validation. However, using both methods for every project is rarely feasible due to resource or time constraints. At the portfolio level, employing a mix of study types across different projects can balance depth and rigor — using observational methods where exploratory insights are needed and causal studies where robust validation is possible. This strategic use of mixed methods gives us a more comprehensive understanding of impact across varied contexts. However, resource-intensive causal studies may not be needed for every scenario, especially if strong evidence is already available.  We exercise caution in interpretation. In practical terms, this means recognizing the limitations of each study type and not overrelying on any one method. For instance, when descriptive studies indicate a positive outcome,we consider whether biases might influence these findings. If causal evidence is lacking, we use the insights cautiously and look for additional validation before making major decisions or scaling interventions.  We adapt evaluation methods by program phase. In early stages, we use descriptive methods to gather insights and inform design. As programs mature, we incorporate causal methods to validate impact and ensure robustness.  We communicate findings transparently. We communicate clearly about the type of evidence used and its limitations, helping decision-makers make well-considered choices.  <p>By strategically combining and understanding the strengths and limitations of observational and causal studies, portfolio managers can overcome the challenges of using diverse impact approaches and instead, embrace their contributions. This helps achieve a balanced understanding of what works, for whom, and in what&nbsp;context.</p><p>If you are interested in discussing our approach, please contact us at <a href="mailto:marius@cariboudigital.net">Marius Karabaczek</a> or <a href="mailto:niamh@cariboudigital.net">Niamh&nbsp;Barry</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/blending-impact-evidence-types-across-portfolios-a-strategic-approach-to-decision-making-b001b73f756c">Blending impact evidence types across portfolios: A strategic approach to decision-making</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
