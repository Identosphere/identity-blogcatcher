 Representing base IP with ERC721 and fungible IP licenses with ERC20, to combine benefits of&nbsp;both  Summary <p>The goal of this series is to practically connect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP) to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It uses the language of IP and focuses on Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">article 2</a> on ERC20 fungible token standard. This article links ERC721 &amp; ERC20, and describes how combining them gets benefits of&nbsp;both.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 Scenarios <p>There are two big-picture scenarios on how base IP and sub-licenses relate.</p>  Just base IP. This is quite simple. It’s a single artifact and there is no sub-licenses. For example, an artist paints a painting and has a copyright of it. That painting is sold to a collector who then gets exclusive rights to it. The base IP started as copyright held by the painter, then was transferred to the collector.  Sub-licenses against the base IP. This has many varieties. Typically the sub-licenses are fungible. For example, an author writes a book and has copyright of it; he does an exclusive license of this base IP to a publishing house. The house sells 10,000 physical books, each having its own fungible sub-license against the base IP. As a second revenue stream, it might also sell 20,000 e-books, each having its own fungible sub-license (a different license compared to the physical&nbsp;books).   1.2 Implementing Scenarios in Blockchain <p>Here’s how these scenarios might get implemented in blockchain.</p><p>For scenario 1 above, the Single-Edition ERC721 described in Article 1 is appropriate.</p><p>Scenario 2 is much richer, leading to several implementation possibilities. Article 1 described how Limited-Edition ERC721 could be used, and Article 2 described how ERC20 could be used. This article will describe a third approach that combines both. But first let’s do some comparison.</p> 1.3 Comparing ERC721&nbsp;andERC20 <p>Here are pros and cons for ERC721 for limited-edition / fungible&nbsp;IP.</p>  EC721 Benefits. First, if history of each unique token matters, and its provenance needs to be traced. Second, user experience is decent, since ERC721 wallets explicitly hold ERC721 tokens and render images alongside the ERC721. ERC721 markets have good price discovery for truly non-fungible assets, typically using auctions.  ERC721 Challenges. Limited-edition ERC721 assumes the tokens are non-fungible, even if the actual asset is fungible IP licenses. This makes the pricing problem harder, because it converts an apples-to-apples comparison into an apples-to-oranges one. Then, it can’t use AMMs and other powerful ERC20 price discovery tools. Finally, limited-edition ERC721 doesn’t model who owns the base IP at all, let alone make it easy to&nbsp;manage.  <p>Here are pros and cons for ERC20 for Limited-edition / fungible&nbsp;IP.</p>  ERC20 Benefits. First, tokens can go directly in AMMs which allows automatic price discovery, liquidity, and curation. Second, tokens play well with the rest of ERC20 &amp; DeFi infrastructure, from ERC20 wallets to bridges to loans. Third, base IP is represented by ERC20.owner address, and therefore it can be transferred and&nbsp;managed.  ERC20 Challenges. While base IP can be transferred and managed, tooling doing so is poor. For example, wallets only store the private key for the ERC20.owner address; it doesn’t show up as a&nbsp;token.  <p>Here’s the key takeaways. First, the benefits of one are roughly the challenges for the other. Second, neither does well in managing base IP. It’s nonexistent for ERC721 and poor for ERC20. Yet managing base IP is extremely important! We want to make it easy for people to sell base IP, have multiple revenue streams against it, link it with physical objects and&nbsp;more.</p> 1.4 Combining ERC721 + ERC20:&nbsp;How <p>This section describes at a high level how to combine the benefits of ERC721 and ERC20, and better manage base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>The basic idea is to tokenize the base IP and tokenize sub-licenses against it. Let’s bring in specific token standards.</p>  Base IP is non-fungible, so ERC721 is a good way to represent it.  Fungible IP sub-licenses are best represented by fungible token standard ERC20. And, we generalize this to multiple revenue streams against the base IP; some use ERC20, some may use ERC721, and others may use other standards or fully custom approaches [1]. A “good default” is simply&nbsp;ERC20.   1.4 Combining ERC721 + ERC20:&nbsp;Benefits <p>This leads to benefits at a high level, benefits from ERC721, and benefits from ERC20. Here are high-level benefits:</p>  Simple mental model non-fungible base IP → non-fungible token standard, and fungible IP licenses → fungible standard.  Enables multiple revenue streams against the base IP, with different sub-licenses. For example, a book might have a kindle version, softcover print version, and hardcover print version&nbsp;[8].  <p>Base IP inherits benefits of&nbsp;ERC721:</p>  Direct wallet support for base IP. Render images, transfer base IP, versus just holding the private key for ERC20.owner  Sell base IP in marketplaces focusing on ERC721 NFTs, with corresponding price discovery tuned for ERC721. E.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>  Easier to link physical objects with base IP, e.g. <a href="https://www.wisekey.com/press/wisekey-partners-with-ocean-protocol-to-launch-trustednft-io-a-decentralized-marketplace-for-objects-of-value-designed-to-empower-artists-creators-and-collectors-with-a-unique-solution-for-the-auth/">WISeKey chips in paintings, linked directly to&nbsp;NFTs</a>  Tools to fractionalize ownership of base IP, e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.org/">Niftex</a> tool. This allows co-ownership of base IP, such as <a href="https://www.vita-dao.io/">VitaDAO</a> for drug discovery data  <p>Fungible IP sub-licenses inherit benefits of&nbsp;ERC20:</p>  Fungible IP tokens can go directly in AMMs, for automatic price discovery, liquidity, and curation.  Fungible IP tokens play well with the rest of ERC20 &amp; DeFi infrastructure, from ERC20 wallets to bridges to&nbsp;loans.  <p>This combines the UX benefits of ERC721 with the fungibility benefits of ERC20. ERC20 doesn’t have to be limited-edition either; for example ERC20 tokens (licenses) could be minted on-the-fly.</p><p>At Ocean Protocol for V3, we built an ERC20-based IP framework. We’re now working on ERC721+ERC20 for Ocean&nbsp;V4.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical; it describes what ERC721+ERC20 code is doing from an IP perspective.</p> 2. ERC20 + ERC721 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP  2.1 Definitions   To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. The claim is via ERC721._safeMint() at a new tokenId with to=self, and metadata points to a<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> T&amp;C</a> stating this is a claim of base IP. Metadata follows<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721"> ERC721Metadata extension</a>. Then, use ERC20.constructor() and ERC20.mint(to=self, value=n licenses) to prepare for sub-licensing. The ERC20 can be linked to ERC721 in one of many&nbsp;ways.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC20.transfer(to=licensee, value=1.0) [6]. For legals, T&amp;C states that owning ≥1.0 tokens means having a sub-license with specific rights. Those sub-license rights associated with the given ERC20 contract, not the ERC721 contract.  Base IP: represented by the tuple of {ERC721 deployment, tokenId}.  Base IP holder: represented by the owner of the address at ERC721.owners[tokenId].  Sub-licensee: any address holding ≥ 1.0 ERC20&nbsp;tokens.   2.2 ERC20 + ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls ERC721._safeMint() to claim the base IP, which sets the value at ERC721._owner[tokenId=7] is set to addressP. Then the publisher calls ERC20.constructor() and ERC20.mint() to mint 3 sub-license tokens with addressP as initial owner; this sets the value at ERC20.owner to addressP, and ERC20.balances value at key addressP is set to&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>Step ❷, ❸ and ❹ only involve the ERC20 contract, and work exactly like Limited-Edition ERC20 sub-license steps.</p><p>Step ❺ transfers the base IP to a new exclusive license holder, by calling ERC721.safeTransferFrom() which changes ERC721.owners[tokenId=x] to a new&nbsp;address.</p>ERC721+ERC20: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.3 ERC20 + ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each action. The two images below illustrate.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the ERC721._owners[tokenId=7] value is addressP, meaning the publisher is the base IP holder. The ERC20._balances attribute holds one entry with key addressP and value 3.0, meaning the publisher holds three sub-licenses.</p><p>The ERC20 can link to the ERC721 in one of many ways. In this example, we riff on ERC20 Ownable mixin with an NftOwnable mixin, replacing ERC20.owner with ERC20.nftOwner that points to the NFT tuple {ERC721 address, tokenId}. Ability to mint ERC20 tokens and other permissions that Ownable gave to the address at ERC20.owner now go to the address at ERC721._owners[tokenId].</p><p>Steps ❷, ❸ and ❹ only involve the ERC20 contract. They only change ERC20._balances variables just like Limited-Edition ERC20 sub-license steps. ERC721 state is not&nbsp;changed.</p>ERC721+ERC20: UML Structure Diagram, steps&nbsp;1–4<p>When ❺ is complete, base IP has been transferred. ERC721.owners[tokenId=7] now holds the value address3 (not shown). The address3 owner now controls ERC20 minting and other permissions.</p>ERC721+ERC20: Structure Diagram, step&nbsp;5 3. Conclusion <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">article 2</a> on ERC20 fungible token standard.</p><p>This article connected IP to ERC721+ERC20 Solidity implementations, and how it combines the benefits of ERC721 and of ERC20 individually.</p> 4. Appendix: Related Approaches  4.1 NFT&nbsp;Vaults <p>This is another approach represent base IP &amp; fractional licenses. Start with ERC20 setup of article 2, but put the private key that owns ERC20.owner attribute into an NFT “vault” using <a href="https://hack.ethglobal.co/showcase/nfwallets-recErbcXq0xNSP8zX">NFwallets</a>, <a href="https://charged.fi/">Charged Particles</a>, or <a href="https://circuitsofvalue.com/">emblem.vault</a>.</p><p>This seems simple at first glance. However, each ERC20’s owner would be represented by a different NFT, which causes ambiguity if only one of those NFTs is transferred. Also, the workflow to publish is clumsier. Finally, the overall mental model is more complex, which hinders adoptability.</p> 4.2 Fractional ownership of&nbsp;ERC721 <p>Base IP can have fractional ownership. Here’s a traditional example: a company holds a patent, and that company has 10 shareholders. Each shareholder therefore has fractional ownership of the base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>Standards like <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1633">EIP1633</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2981">EIP2981</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3601">EIP3601</a>, and tools like Niftex allow one to shard ownership of an ERC721 token, where ERC20 tokens represent the fraction of ownership into the ERC721 token. That’s highly useful to shard ownership for base IP, including the setup in this article where base IP is represented by&nbsp;ERC721.</p><p>The main goal of this article is to contemplate representing ERC20 as fungible IP license against ERC721 base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>In short, there are (at least) two complementary ways to use ERC20 in relation to ERC721: ERC20 to shard an ERC721 token, and ERC20 for fungible IP licenses against base ERC721 IP. This article focuses on the&nbsp;latter.</p><p>Interestingly, by using ERC20 for fungible IP licenses, we get fractional ownership of these IP licenses (if decimals &gt; 0, which is usually the&nbsp;case).</p> Acknowledgements <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series acknowledges the many people that have helped towards the whole series, including this article. Thank you&nbsp;again!</p> Notes <p>[1] Having base IP represented as ERC721 tokens is general enough to allow monetization beyond basic ERC20 IP sub-license datatokens. For example, have Superfluid ERC20 datatokens for streaming payments in C2D or subscriptions. Or, have ERC721 IP sub-licenses. Basically anything, since they just point to the&nbsp;ERC721.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">NFTs &amp; IP 3: Combining ERC721 &amp; ERC20</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<br>
<p>Recently, the <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/35">first upgrade</a> to the
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/azimuth/">Azimuth</a> smart contracts which make up Urbit ID was
put up to an <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/upgrade/">upgrade proposal vote</a> by the
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/senate/">Galactic Senate</a>. This vote is still open and will
last for 30 days (June 20th) or until an absolute majority is reached. We’d like
to take this opportunity to discuss two things. <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#changelist">First</a>, what the
proposed changes are, and <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#senate">second</a>, a review of how Urbit governance
works and where we’re at with respect to the decentralization process.</p>
<p>Before we dive into what the proposed changes are, let’s review what the Senate
is actually capable of changing. Urbit ID is really two sets of smart contracts:
Azimuth and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ecliptic/">Ecliptic</a>. Azimuth is the data of the
public key infrastructure - roughly, this is the list of
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ship/">ships</a> and which Ethereum addresses own them, along
with other data such as networking keys and sponsorship status. The Senate has
no ability to touch this data directly. This is in direct contrast to all
existing centralized services, where your account is always at risk of being
taken away from you. What the Senate can change is Ecliptic, which is the
“business logic” that decides how you can interact with the data in Azimuth.
These are mechanisms such as what powers various
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/proxies/">proxies</a> have, how stars/planets are released over
time, and how sponsorship works. Put another way, the data and database format
must remain the same, but the rules by which we interact with it may change
according to the governance rules we <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#senate">detail below</a>.</p>
 Changelist 
<p>The currently open vote to Ecliptic contains the following changes: </p>
 
 Fixed ERC721 compatibility  
 Self-modifying proxies  
 Upgraded Claims contract 
 
 Fixed ERC721 compatibility 
<p>The contract definition of the Ecliptic includes various functions and events
that make it conform to the ERC721 (non-fungible token) standard. However, two
events have <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/issues/8">ever so slightly
non-confirming</a> descriptions. This
causes Ethereum explorers like Etherscan to incorrectly recognize Azimuth as
ERC20 (fungible token), rather than ERC721.</p>
<p>The proposed change simply modifies the event descriptions to accurately match
the ERC721 definition. This does not affect any functionality within the
contract itself.</p>
 Self-modifying proxies 
<p>Owners of Azimuth assets are allowed to configure "proxy addresses" for those
assets: Ethereum addresses allowed to act "as" the owner, but only for a subset
of operations. For example, setting the management proxy will let you change
your networking keys and sponsor using that address, just like your ownership
address can. This is useful for keeping the ownership keys in very cold storage,
while still letting you perform lower-value operations.</p>
<p>Currently, only the ownership address is allowed to change proxy addresses.
Fairly early on after Azimuth's deployment, we realized it might be nice for
proxies to be able to change themselves.</p>
<p>This means that, in addition to being able to configure networking keys and
sponsorship, your management proxy would be able to assign a new management
proxy. This would allow you, or a trusted third party holding your management proxy,
to rotate your proxy keys without needing to take your ownership keys out of cold
storage.</p>
 Upgraded Claims contract 
<p><a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/blob/master/contracts/Claims.sol">The Claims
contract</a>
lets asset managers associate various attestations with their identity. For
example, an Ethereum address to send donations to, or proving ownership of a
Twitter account.</p>
<p>For ease of use by off-chain tools and services, the contract emits events
(notifications) whenever any claims are updated. However, the current version of
the contract has a bug where it does not emit events when all claims are removed
at once (clearClaims()). This "gap" in the event stream makes it much more
difficult to write off-chain tools around this contract. Considering Claims has
seen <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe7e7f69b34d7d9bd8d61fb22c33b22708947971a#events">practically no
use</a>
since it was first deployed, it should not be a problem to simply start over
fresh with a new contract that contains <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/32">the
fix</a> for the described bug.</p>
<p>The reason we must do an Ecliptic upgrade to switch to a new Claims contract, is
that it is tied in with the logic for transferring an asset. If the asset is
flagged for "reset" (common when transferring to/from someone other than
yourself), its configured proxies, networking keys and claims are cleared during
transfer. As such, the Ecliptic will need to know about the address of the new
Claims contract.</p>
 Urbit Governance 
<p></p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Urbit is to become a digital republic manifested as a peer
to peer network owned and controlled by its users. The goal of Tlon, then, is to
become a company which builds products for Urbit rather than being the primary
driving force behind its development. We’d like to take this opportunity to
spell out our perspective on where we’re at in that process. We’ve already
written a good deal about Urbit governance in the past on this blog, so we avoid
rehashing too much, but the first contract upgrade is an apt time for a routine
checkup. Here are some previous posts that are relevant, but please note that
some of them are several years old and as such may not accurately reflect our
current position, but still serve as useful historical markers. We hope to
revisit and refresh these documents soon. </p>

 Galactic Senate 
<p>The Galactic Senate is composed of all <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/galaxy/">galaxy</a>
holders, which at present consists of more than 100 individuals and a few
organizations, including Tlon and the Urbit.org Foundation. Using the Azimuth
voting contract, the Senate can present and vote on two kinds of proposals:
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/docvote/">document proposals</a> and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/upgrade/">upgrade
proposals</a>. Thus far, all matters which the Senate
has voted on have been document proposals. The <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/34">most recent
vote</a> declared the Urbit network as
(i) being secure (as confirmed by a <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/security-audit/">third party
audit</a>) and (ii) having reached continuity (as in, no
further <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/breach/">network breaches</a> are expected). Previous votes
were to declare that <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/25">Azimuth is live</a>
and that <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/24">Arvo is stable</a>.</p>
 Address space distribution 
<p>Perhaps the most informative measure of how decentralized Urbit is in terms of
how many independent parties hold address space. By the very nature of Urbit, it
is impossible to know this with great accuracy (a common feature of
decentralized projects). However, the movement of galaxies is closely watched
and thus we have a fairly good idea of how distributed they are.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Urbit’s creator Curtis Yarvin was in possession of the entire
address space - all 256 galaxies, and everything underneath it. A network of one
is no network at all, and so over the last decade Urbit’s development has been
primarily driven by selling or giving away these galaxies. On <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/the-urbit-address-space/">June 1,
2016</a>, the allocation was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>95, to the Tlon Corporation. 50, to urbit.org, the future community
foundation. 40, to Tlon employees and their family members (24 to Curtis, who
started in 2002; 16 to everyone else, who started in 2014). 34, to outside
investors in Tlon. 37, to 33 other individuals, who donated to the project,
contributed code or services, won a contest, or were just in the right place
at the right time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the period since then leading up to the present, Tlon has sold a number of
its galaxies to fund development, and others have changed hands, to the point
that Tlon and urbit.org no longer possess a majority share of galaxies. In
January 2019, <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/a-founders-farewell/">Curtis gave all of his galaxies</a> to
Tlon when he left the project. In August 2020 we shared an update on the <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/value-of-address-space-pt3/">known
distribution of address space</a>, where
Curtis’ galaxies are marked as Tlon’s “naked galaxies”. Since then, Tlon
disbursed its naked galaxies among the employees that wanted one who did not
already possess one, thus removing Tlon and urbit.org’s controlling share of the
Senate. Galaxies held by current and former Tlon employees are entirely
independent of Tlon Corporation—they may do with them, and vote with them, as
they please. <code>~ravmel-ropdyl</code> plans to give more color to this decision in the
near future.</p>
<p>Distribution of stars is much more difficult to know. There is an active market
for stars on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/urbit-id">OpenSea</a>, so we know that
they are changing hands frequently, but checking the number of distinct Ethereum
addresses that hold stars does not tell you very much information since there
are many legitimate reasons one person might hold each of their stars at
different addresses.</p>
 Software and smart contracts 
<p>As was written in <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/">The DAO as a Lesson in Decentralized
Governance</a>,
we are keenly aware of the threat of decentralization theater. Urbit has
undergone steady progress towards decentralization, and with the developments we
outline below, it’s never been more clear that the project is beginning to leave
the cradle of Tlon. It’s also important to note that decentralization of a
project is always a procession away from an initial centralized state⁠—you cannot
go from A to Z without first traversing every letter in between. While Urbit was
centralized during its earliest stages, the journey towards a network owned and
controlled by the users is now well underway.</p>
<p>In the past, nearly all Urbit software was written by Tlon. While Tlon is still the only corporation actively updating Urbit’s MIT-licensed open source software, namely <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vere/">Vere</a> (the runtime), and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/arvo/">Arvo</a> (the kernel), unaffiliated individuals have been making enormous contributions to Urbit over the past couple of years via the <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/history">grants program</a>. Recent examples include the <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/4940">Bitcoin node and wallet integration</a>, <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/proposals/21131866-webrtc-gall-agent-and-external-app">WebRTC integration</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arthyn/port">Port, an Urbit installer and ship manager</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/4820"><code>|fuse</code>, an important primitive for 3rd party software distribution</a>.</p>
<p>The only real power Tlon holds over Urbit is the ability to push <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ota-updates/">OTA
updates</a> via <code>~zod</code>, and suggest that people
download our binaries. To the best of our knowledge, all extant galaxies
retrieve their OTA updates from <code>~zod</code>, who forward it to their stars, who
forward it to their planets. This software distribution route is merely a
convenient default setting. Ships initially retrieve OTA updates from their
sponsor, but they have full authority to retrieve updates from whoever they want
with the <code>|ota</code> command, or even to only install software updates by hand if
they so choose.</p>
<p>In the future, one can easily imagine many organizations shipping their own
distributions of Urbit from their own urbit nodes, somewhat analogously to the
large number of Linux distributions which exist today. There is nothing we can
do to stop a group from forking Urbit, declaring <code>~sampel-palnet</code> the new <code>~zod</code>
(both for updates and for sponsorship purposes), and retrieving all OTA updates
via that route and building their own binaries. This is all by design, and we
wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p>The use of the Azimuth smart contracts is also somewhat optional. By changing a
few lines of code to point their ships at another set of PKI smart contracts,
they could rid themselves of hierarchical peer discovery entirely and make use
of some other routing strategy such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia based DHT
routing</a>. This would likely give rise to
an entirely separate network. The fact that the network is fully capable of such
a schism helps keep the Senate honest and accountable to the users. If they ever
were to vote on a contract modification that greatly angered or upset a portion
of the user base, they would be inviting such a schism and be entirely deserving
of it. In that sense, the power to control the network is already held by the
users, they just have not yet had a reason to make use of it.</p>
 Legitimacy 
<p>The only way by which Tlon and the Senate hold any power is via legitimacy.
Vitalik Buterin recently wrote a <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">very informative
article</a> on the role of
legitimacy in decentralized governance, and I do not know of a better source to
understand how Tlon and the Senate are kept in check by the users. Besides the
DAO split resulting in Ethereum and Ethereum Classic mentioned in the article,
perhaps the most prominent example of the power users have over a decentralized
network is the saga of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/justin-sun-bought-steemit-steem-moved-to-limit-his-power">Steem and Justin
Sun</a>.
The short version of the story is that Justin Sun bought a controlling share of
the Steem blockchain and attempted to exert control over it, and the users
banded together to fork the blockchain into one called Hive, which was identical
to Steem except with Sun’s token balance set to zero. An analogous outcome for
Urbit would be that the Senate makes sweeping changes to the PKI and invites a
schism like that outlined above.</p>
<p>For these reasons, there are strong disincentives for any one organization or
individual to acquire too many galaxies. The more galaxies one party possesses,
the fewer there are with strong incentives to stimulate efforts to build on the
network, reducing the value of holding that space, and the greater the risk that
the users will perceive this as a power grab by a party without their interests
in mind. This is in contrast to real-life republics, where there is little risk
for one party to accumulate as much power as they can manage since the cost to
the citizens to overthrow that power is enormous. Thus, only especially
egregious displays of power ever result in rebellion. Within the Urbit republic,
users need only to change the code they run to leave the Senate powerless, and
so the threat of rebellion is much more real. We estimate that within a digital
republic like Urbit, the centrifugal forces outweigh the centripetal forces, and
that the outcome of this is more stable than the reverse.</p>
 Why have governance at all? 
<p>An important question the reader may still have lingering is: why does Urbit
need governance at all? The short answer is: (i) there will always be necessary
protocol upgrades that cannot be foreseen, and (ii) a total lack of governance
inevitably gives rise to a shadow government with undefined powers that is
almost impossible to hold accountable.</p>
<p>With (ii), we see this to be the case on many early blockchain projects where
power is shared by the developers and the miners, but what each is capable of
doing has never been codified, and thus users of the blockchain can never have a
great deal of certainty of what changes might occur in the future. This doesn’t
guarantee a bad outcome, but it does create more wariness for individuals to
contribute to a project when they cannot know whether they really have a say in
its direction. Recognizing this issue, many newer blockchain and
blockchain-adjacent projects have built-in governance mechanisms that lay out
exactly what an individual can expect should they join and contribute to that
network.</p>
<p>As for (i), with Urbit being a wholly new kind of network, it would take some
incredible luck and crystal ball gazing to get the PKI exactly right on the very
first try without ever needing another modification. Thus, some mechanism was
needed to guarantee that the PKI’s logic could be altered. Leaving control of
Azimuth in the hands of Tlon would have just granted Tlon dictatorial power and
a future that becomes more uncertain the further one gazes. There’s certainly
room to argue that the Galactic Senate is not a perfect system, but our interim
constitution did outline potential roles for stars and planets to play in
governance in the future, so there is ample opportunity for the system to evolve
in response to the will of the users. As always, it is important to keep in mind
the unfinished nature of the Urbit of today and the still moldable clay of the
Urbit of tomorrow⁠—nothing yet is set in stone.</p>

<p>A lot of what I've shared recently has been about Holo hosting -- getting all the bits really robust so they handle both 'happy path' user interactions (everything is working as expected) and 'sad path' ones (HoloPort goes down, login fails, etc). But I haven't spent much time talking about how Holochain itself is improving -- and when I have, it's usually been about bugfixes to support the aforementioned Holo work.</p><p>But behind the scenes, Holochain has been getting some big upgrades to some of its parts. This is mainly to make it faster -- fast enough for the next stages of Elemental Chat testing. (And of course, Elemental Chat testing is really about Holo hosting and Holochain.)</p> LMDB to SQLite: the road to infinite scalability <p>A lot of peer-to-peer networks, from decentralised social networks like <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a> to blockchains like Bitcoin, are built on something called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol">gossip protocol</a>'. It's a simple protocol, and it works like it sounds like it would work: I know a bunch of people (or rather, computers), and when one of my friends shares something with me I share it with everyone else I know. With this protocol, messages spread rapidly through networks without a central authority.</p><p>And it also creates a lot of network traffic. That might be fine for blockchains, in which every machine is online most of the time and needs to know about everything anyway. But for networks that power everyday applications, you want to be respectful of your users' bandwidth -- and you can't expect their machines to be on all the time either. (Even blockchains tweak gossip to make it more efficient.)</p><p>Holochain is based on the idea of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/">'neighbourhoods' of authority</a> -- each piece of data gets an address, and it's only sent to a group of machines that have taken responsibility for the range of addresses that cover its address. That means traditional gossip is too chatty -- as an authority, you need to constantly make decisions about what to share with your neighbours, given that they aren't responsible for the exact same range that you are.</p><p>It gets more complicated when machines are turning on and off all the time (which happens a lot when they're just users' devices). A machine that's been offline for a while will want to get up to date with the latest gossip, and will ask its peers for a digest of new stuff since they were last online.</p><p>This means you have to be able to ask your own database questions like "which of my neighbours' responsibility ranges start before, and end after, address <code>531993928</code>?" and "what new data have I collected within my neighbour Alice's responsibility range <code>112513216</code> to <code>241661317</code> since yesterday morning at 08:37 UTC?" These sorts of questions, called range queries, are really hard for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database">key/value database</a> like <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/">LMDB</a> to answer, but they're really easy for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">relational database</a> like <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>.</p><p>Because all data in Holochain is just keys (addresses) and values attached to those keys, LMDB initially made sense -- it was much faster than any relational database out there when it came to key/value lookups, as well as being gentle on CPU and RAM. But as the core developers started looking at <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">sharding</a>, it became obvious that the large amount of range queries would hurt performance unacceptably if they stuck with LMDB.</p><p>As a side bonus, SQLite also makes it possible for us to encrypt source chain and DHT data at rest using <a href="https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/">SQLCipher</a>. (Note: this doesn't prevent you from reading your peers' published data -- that's not how Holochain works. But it does prevent an attacker from stealing it if they gain access to your computer.)</p> Other gossip upgrades <p>As mentioned, when machines come back online after being offline for a while, the catching-up process has been pretty network-heavy. Now when it happens, machines <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/752">compare their lists</a> of held data using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filters</a>. This technique results in more back-and-forth messages between nodes but less data being exchanged overall. This is already speeding up syncing, even though sharding is yet to be introduced.</p> New versions of Wasmer and Rust <p><a href="https://wasmer.io/">Wasmer</a>, the <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> engine we're using to run the 'rules' of a Holochain app, is now at version 1.0, so we've <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/801">upgraded it</a>. It comes with better memory management, a faster compiler and runtime, and a bunch of bug fixes. It also lets us compile and run Holochain on ARM CPUs like the HoloPort Nano.</p><p>Wasmer 1.0 will also let us implement compute metering for Holo hosting, as well as runtime budgets to prevent infinite loops from <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/halting-problem/">chewing up all of a host's CPU capacity</a>.</p><p>A new version of the Rust programming language has been released as well, so we've upgraded Holochain to use that too.</p><p>As a side effect, macOS developers are now first-class citizens again -- these updates plus some bugfixes have <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix/pull/212">resolved</a> the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix/issues/211">macOS build issues</a> for Holonix, our development environment.</p> What's next? <p>Wasmer 1.0 and Rust 1.52 have already been integrated into Holochain, and they'll be rolled out along with the SQLite update. Expect to see faster install times soon too; we're researching automated build servers for Holonix so you don't have to wait an hour for everything to compile!</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/767">work of integrating SQLite is done</a>, and the slower performance of key/value lookups is more than offset by the faster performance of range queries. It's currently being tested on a single HoloPort with an automated Elemental Chat test involving 20 hosted users and one self-hosted instance, which has revealed a bug related to clogged processing queues. If there are no other show-stopper bugs, it'll replace the current LMDB-based Holochain on all HoloPorts soon.</p><p>Now that this work is almost ready, the core devs have been able to work on sharding the DHT. So far it's been 'full-sync', which means everybody stores everything, a lot like a blockchain. This is good for redundancy but bad for performance (although community testers have been consistently talking about how fast Elemental Chat already is). So far they've completed about half of the tasks involved in sharding.</p><p>Sharding has always been part of our promise to make dApps fast and scalable, so I'm excited to see this happening.</p> Reminder: Register for Dev Camp! <p>The next community-led <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">Dev Camp is starting at the end of June</a>. The project you'll be working on, a game called Tragedy of the Holocommons, will help you understand how to design an app that works well without a single source of truth. I think it's a brilliant idea.</p><p>Dev Camps are still free, and they’re run by a fantastic and knowledgeable group of volunteers.</p><p>The Holochain developer community is growing, along with the ecosystem of learning materials and open-source libraries, tools, and apps. If you've been holding back, waiting for the ecosystem to mature, it might be time to check out the forum and GitHub and get involved.

<p>Whether your company uses direct deposit or other direct payments through the ACH network, you’re likely leveraging WEB debit transfers in some way. And if you’re using WEB debits, you should be adhering to Nacha’s WEB debit rule. Doing so will not only keep you on good terms with Nacha, but it’s also an opportunity to enhance payment experiences and protect your company. Here’s how.</p>
 How Prevalent Is ACH Fraud? 
<p>Nacha’s WEB (meaning internet-initiated entry) debit compliance rules are designed to protect both the ACH network and your company from rising ACH fraud. The <a href="https://www.afponline.org/publications-data-tools/reports/survey-research-economic-data/Details/payments-fraud/">Association of Finance Professionals</a> (AFP) 2020 Payments Fraud and Control Survey Report found that 81% of businesses were targets of payments fraud and 55% of businesses were directly impacted by ACH fraud, with 33% of that fraud from ACH debits and 22% from ACH credits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud usually occurs when a criminal accesses a customer’s account and submits an unauthorized ACH transaction. In the past, all a criminal needed was an account number and a bank routing number. How many abandoned checkbooks might be floating around in the landfill, waiting for an eager fraudster?</p>
<p>With a third of businesses falling victim to ACH WEB debit fraud, it’s no wonder Nacha is updating its rules to protect both the ACH network and your company.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Nacha WEB Debit Compliance Rules? 
<p>Nacha has established operating rules that keep the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/what-is-ach-6-fundamentals-to-get-you-started/">ACH network</a> secure. As part of those operating rules, originators of WEB debit entries must use a “commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection system” to screen those debit transactions for fraud. What that detection system specifically looks like has been largely up to the businesses initiating ACH transfers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Nacha <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">has recently augmented this requirement</a> and now specifically requires that the “fraudulent transaction detection system” includes account validation. Under the new rule, an account must be validated with the first use of the account number, or after any changes to the account number. This updated rule aims to cut down on the WEB debit fraud that continues to climb.</p>
 When Do Businesses Need to Be in Compliance? 
<p>Nacha had originally set January 1, 2020, as the effective date for the new WEB debit rule. The Board of Directors then approved an extension to March 19, 2021 to allow businesses to educate themselves and implement the new processes. As of now, the WEB debit rule is in effect. Originators of WEB debit payments have one year from the effective date of the rule to implement an account validation solution.</p>
 How Can You Ensure Your Payments Are Compliant? 
<p>To be compliant with Nacha’s WEB debit rule, your payment solution must include some form of account validation. This validation can take several Nacha-approved forms:</p>
 
 Prenotification entry: The payment originator sends a zero-dollar entry through the ACH network to the account several days prior to the live entry. 
 Micro-deposit verification: Small amounts—usually between a couple cents and a dollar—are sent to an account and must be verified by the account holder. 
 Instant account validation: The customer provides consent to access their account information, ideally through a direct API connection to the customer’s financial institution. Of these verification methods, instant account validation delivers the most accurate information in real time and doesn’t rely on the customer manually keying their account and routing information. They simply log in to their account and provide consent for the validation. 
 
<p>Nacha also notes that companies may leverage other validation means. For example, proving that an account has a reliable history of prior successful payments may act as a sufficient validation. Ultimately, Nacha recognizes that every company’s position and situation is unique, and so determining whether an account validation method is “commercially reasonable” will differ, and each company should consult their own attorneys, risk department, or other advisors to ensure the validation method is compliant.</p>
 How Finicity’s Instant Account Verification Prevents Fraud and Enables A Better User Experience 
<p>Through our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">Finicity Pay</a><a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/"></a>&nbsp;solution set, we offer instant account validation that satisfies Nacha’s updated WEB debit rule and provides additional valuable data to improve the experience and efficiency of ACH payments. Our instant account validation enables money movers to mitigate fraud and maximize the accuracy of payment transactions by providing account and routing numbers, account owner verification, and balance checks to streamline and secure ACH payments. And with easy and fast consumer permissioning, our validation solution empowers consumers to benefit from their own data to have better financial services experiences.</p>
<p>In addition to validating account information, the consumer-permissioned data Fincity’s open banking platform provides can be used to check balances prior to processing payments to avoid fees and returns due to insufficient funds. It can also support Know Your Customer (KYC) by providing the name and address of the account owner on file at the financial institution. While this data is useful for payments, it can also be leveraged in account opening, digital wallet or prepaid card funding, or other use cases where similar information is needed.</p>
<p>Don’t just take our word for it. Nacha has named Finicity a Preferred Partner, which guarantees that our validation solution aligns with Nacha’s core strategies to advance the ACH networks. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/nacha-announces-finicity-preferred-partner-account-validation">According to Nacha</a>, those who are preferred partners:</p>
 
 Facilitate efficiencies in the use of ACH information and messaging formats and standards 
 Improve ACH risk management and transaction quality that is conducive to ongoing innovation in the ACH network 
 Conduct business according to the highest standards 
 
<p>Nacha’s WEB debit rule protects you and ensures better ACH payment experiences. And with Finicity’s instant validation solution, you’ll also empower your customers and get access to the highest-quality real-time data.

  Learn how HYPR’s latest QR code login helps users to initiate web login with the HYPR App to avoid push fatigue and push-based attacks

<p>What are push attacks? Push attacks are used by malicious actors whose goal is to get past mobile push-based multi-factor authentication (MFA). The malicious actor spams the victim with notifications to authenticate until they are fatigued and finally accept it. When deployed on a mass scale, even a low success rate of <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-2-factor-authentication-isnt-foolproof/">less than 3% is significant.</a></p>
      
<p>Push attacks are a growing concern among security experts, and many of today’s MFA solutions offer push authentication as a form of MFA. That’s why the latest HYPR Cloud Platform 6.12 offers a technology preview of QR code login.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>No Passwords, No Push, Just Scan QR to Log In</p>
      
 HYPR’s QR Code Login 
      
<p>6.12 now enables users to log into their SSO-managed web apps by scanning a QR code with the HYPR App or camera on their smartphone.</p>
      
<p>QR code login is a passwordless MFA alternative in situations where push notifications to the mobile device aren’t available, or undesirable from a security standpoint.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Before partnering with HYPR, a higher education customer struggled to secure their 3,500-person University campus with their existing password-based login and potential push-related security risks. Push fatigue inadvertently allowed access to another user who correctly guessed the victim’s username and spammed their account for a push authentication.</p>
      
<p>QR code login is impactful because it prevents push fatigue and its potential for push attacks. It gives more control to the end-user as they initiate their authentication by scanning the code rather than waiting for a push notification to arrive on their smartphone.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Device pairing is still required to register a trusted device, so the QR code will only prompt the user to verify their identity with their registered device.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>HYPR Cloud Platform 6.12</p>
      
<p>In addition to QR code login, another notable update includes our API Endpoint Security Enhancement feature. This feature further improves the overall security posture across components of the HYPR Cloud Platform by passing an encrypted token to the HYPR Server when making internal API calls.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>To learn more about what 6.12 has to offer, read our latest release notes for <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/installinghypr/docs/workforce-access-6120">Workforce Access 6.12</a> and <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/integratinghypr/docs/customer-authentication-6120">Customer Authentication 6.12</a>.

It uses the language of IP and focuses on Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard. This article focuses on the ERC20 fungible token standard for blockchain * IP, and describes how it helps price discovery and more. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">Article 3</a> links ERC721 &amp;&nbsp;ERC20.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 Fungibility &amp; Price Discovery <p>Apple-apple. If you have two identical apples side by side, and one sells for $0.75, then you can readily establish the price of the other apple as $0.75. You can swap them for each other and it doesn’t matter. That is, they’re fungible. With gold, one ounce of can be swapped for another; it’s fungible. Same for TSLA stock. Same for Bitcoin. Same for ERC20 tokens (fungible token standard).</p><p>Apple-orange. If you have an apple and an orange side-by-side, and the apple sells for $2, you still don’t have much information to price the orange. The apple and orange can’t be swapped for each other. They’re non-fungible. This makes them harder to price. An ounce of gold can’t be swapped for an ounce of silver; it’s non-fungible. A one-of-a-kind painting can’t be swapped with another painting; it’s non-fungible. Same for ERC721 tokens (non-fungible token standard).</p><p>Price discovery. Of the two scenarios above, it’s easier to price apples to apples, rather than apples to oranges, because “apples to apples” are fungible. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this: fungibility greatly helps price discovery. It’s easier to price ERC20 tokens <a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1353091225897869312">than ERC721</a>&nbsp;[1].</p> 1.2 Fungible IP&nbsp;Licenses <p>When a publisher prints a book, they print thousands or millions of copies. Coming off the press, each of those copies can be swapped for another. They’re fungible.</p><p>Open up a book to one of the first pages and you’ll find information about the place of publication, and what printing round it was. Importantly, you’ll also see the well-known copyright © symbol, and the name of the base IP rights holder. This matters because the physical copy of that book includes a license to use that copyrighted material, that base IP. Holding that book in your hands gives you physical access to use that IP. A printed book includes a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>If you rent a movie from Amazon Prime, you’re getting a license to the IP of that movie, that base IP. You get digital access to it for 48 hours. Over time, millions of people may rent that movie, i.e. license that base IP. A rented movie includes a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>Consider a weather station recording temperature, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, and air pressure over years. The weather station owners hold this dataset as IP, and license it to thousands of weather-prediction agencies throughout the world. Each license is just like the other licenses. A weather data license is a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>There are plenty more examples in music, video games, photographs, and more. It goes beyond copyright IP; it happens for trademark IP and patent IP as well, anytime there is more than one swappable license.</p><p>Fungible IP licenses may have limited or unlimited editions. Limited edition use cases are around collectibles and the art world. Unlimited edition use cases include licensing stock photos, renting movies, buying e-books, and&nbsp;more.</p> 1.2 ERC20&nbsp;Standard <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC20</a> is a fungible token standard. It’s the most popular standard for tokens, fungible or otherwise.</p><p>Most crypto wallets support ERC20. AMM DEXes exploit ERC20 fungibility property for price discovery, to great success: they now have have billions in daily volume. It’s not just for exchanges; the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance"> DeFi</a> community has developed tools for loans, stablecoins, insurance and more, all around ERC20. Even many non-Ethereum chains support&nbsp;ERC20.</p><p>If one wants to tokenize fungible assets, ERC20 is a good&nbsp;choice.</p> 1.3 Fungible IP Licenses via&nbsp;ERC20 <p>IP licenses can be fungible; and ERC20 is the leading fungible token standard. Then, ERC20 is a logical choice to represent fungible IP licenses. The NFT<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-difficult-to-explain-fungibility-sightings-in-nfts-26bc18620f70"> field</a> uses it accordingly; let’s review some examples.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC_%28musician%29">RAC’s</a><a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape"> $TAPE</a> token is an example using ERC20. Here, 1.0 TAPE tokens are used to<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-democratization-of-value"> redeem</a> a music license in a cassette medium.<a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc85cdd3240385af9958ef99bc2ff0c4de5640bcb"> TAPE is on Uniswap AMM</a>, enabling price discovery to around <a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">$4K per token</a> these&nbsp;days.</p><p><a href="https://unisocks.exchange/">$SOCKS</a> is another example, where SOCKS tokens redeem a pair of socks. Or, <a href="https://www.saintfame.com/fame">$FAME</a> and<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/introducing-bankless-apparel"> $BAP</a> are used to redeem t-shirts. While the focus is on the physical artifact, each has an associated copyright design. AMM price discovery has led to a single $SOCKS edition hitting $164K, and $thousands for $FAME and $BAP. These are exciting use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The above are example one-off tokens. <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> scales this, as a platform that makes it easy to publish, stake/swap and redeem<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837"> ERC20 tokens for IP</a> with appropriate<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> legals</a>. It uses<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3"> AMMs for price discovery, liquidity, and curation</a>. Ocean Market is a reference marketplace; more than a dozen teams have forked its Apache2 frontend code to make their own blockchain IP markets for their own&nbsp;niche.</p> 1.4 *Non* Fungible IP Licenses &amp;&nbsp;ERC20 <p>In the book example above, the author got copyright for their book committing their creative writing to paper. The author could then print many copies of the book themselves, as fungible licenses. However, printing books may not be the author’s forte. So they’d typically do an exclusive license of the base IP to the publishing house; then, the house prints the books as fungible sub-licenses.</p><p>Same for music. The musician could license their works directly to their thousands of listeners. Traditionally this has been hard, so musicians would typically do an exclusive license of the base IP (“master tape”) then the label would do fungible sub-licensing to listeners etc. The exclusive licensee takes over the rights that the copyright holder had initially.</p><p>ERC20 has a means to represent the owner of this base IP (copyright / exclusive license): the address that controls ERC20.owner [4]. We elaborate below.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical; it describes what ERC20 code is doing from an IP perspective.</p> 2. ERC20 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP <p>This section describes how ERC20 code-level behavior maps to an IP framing. To emphasize similarity to the limited-edition ERC721 approach given in the first article, here we use an example on limited-edition ERC20 (vs. unlimited edition; without loss of generality).</p> 2.1 Definitions <p>Limited-edition ERC20s means there are several licenses (editions) for the same base IP. Here’s how to implement.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. The claim is via ERC20.constructor(), and metadata points to a<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> T&amp;C</a> stating this is a claim of base IP. Metadata is stored as an<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1046.md"> extension to ERC20</a> or in a<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/metadata/Metadata.sol"> separate contract</a>. Then, ERC20.mint(to=self, value=n licenses) to prepare for sub-licensing.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC20.transfer(to=licensee, value=1.0) [2]. For legals, the T&amp;C states that owning 1.0 tokens means having a sub-license with specific rights. In deploying the ERC20, one could set decimals=0 to represent exactly 1 license always. Even better, if we set decimals=18 we allow fractional ownership of licenses [3], and enable the token to work for AMMs, loans, etc (a big&nbsp;plus).  Base IP: represented by the ERC20 address from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder: Stored in ERC20.owner. This means that ERC20 gives a convenient way to identify the base IP&nbsp;holder.  Sub-licensee: any address holding ≥ 1.0 ERC20&nbsp;tokens.  <p>It’s important that the tokens of a given ERC20 contract can only redeem a single type of license / item, otherwise it inadvertently replaces the semantic meaning of the ERC20 token itself (“it’s a license”) with simply being a unit-of-exchange token.</p> 2.2 Limited-Edition ERC20: Management of Base&nbsp;IP <p>ERC20 tokens themselves are for management of IP licenses. Interestingly, the setup supports managing the underling base IP (copyright or exclusive license). Here’s&nbsp;how.</p><p>First, recall that base IP ownership is stored in a state variable (ERC20.owner). So, one can transfer base IP ownership by changing its value to a new address via<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable"> ERC20.transferOwnership()</a>. Base IP ownership is fractional when a multisig wallet or DAO controls the address. Value can accrue to base IP before any licenses are created, ie before ERC20 tokens are minted. To monetize with &gt;1 license types (e.g. e-book vs print book), create one ERC20 contract for each license type, each with the same base&nbsp;IP.</p> 2.3 Limited-Edition ERC20: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls ERC20.constructor() method to claim the base IP, then ERC20.mint() to mint 3 tokens with addressP as initial owner. The ERC20’s owner attribute (an address) gets updated to addressP, and its balances attribute (a mapping) gets updated to 3.0 at index addressP.</p><p>Step ❷ is a Sub-License action of one edition, from Publisher to Licensee1 (address1). ERC20.balances gets updated: the value at addressP is decremented by 1.0, and the value at address1 gets set to&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>Step ❸ is a Sub-License action of one edition from Licensee1 to Licensee2. ERC20.balances gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❹ is a Sub-License action of one edition from Publisher to Licensee3. ERC20.balances gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❺ transfers the base IP to a new exclusive license holder, by calling<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable"> ERC20.transferOwnership()</a> which changes ERC20.owner to a new address. (Note: this step wasn’t shown for Limited-Edition ERC721 because it’s not possible in that&nbsp;setup.)</p>ERC20: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.4 Limited-Edition ERC20: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each&nbsp;action.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the value of ERC20.owner is set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT editions haven’t been transferred yet, the addressP owner is interpreted as the base IP holder. ERC20._balances indicates that addressP is the only holder of sub-licenses (3 of&nbsp;them).</p><p>When Completed ❷ (Sub-License), addressP owner has 2 sub-licenses(from 3) and address1 owner has 1 sub-license (from&nbsp;0).</p><p>When Completed ❸ ❹, then addressP, address2, and address3 owners have 1 sub-license each. The Base IP holder remains addressP&nbsp;owner.</p><p>When Completed ❺, the Base IP holder has changed, to address3 owner (not&nbsp;shown).</p>ERC20: UML Structure Diagram 3. Auto Price Discovery in ERC20&nbsp;IP <p>When ERC20 tokens represent IP licenses, then AMMs and other ERC20 &amp; DeFi tools can help tremendously with automatic price discovery, liquidity and curation. The image below illustrates.</p><p>The ERC20 IP tokens may initially be distributed in an AMM (image: top right), Dutch Auctions,<a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/smart-contracts/smart-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-faq"> LBPs</a>, or any mechanic used for traditional Initial Coin Offerings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering">ICOs</a>). These tokens may go on to secondary markets in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange"> DEXes</a> like AMMs (image: bottom right) or<a href="https://dyor-crypto.fandom.com/wiki/Centralized_Exchanges_%28CEX%29"> CEXes</a>. Being ERC20-based allows for IP index funds (<a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1339534813330628612">example</a>), IP loans, IP-backed stablecoins, and ERC20 DeFi tools applied to&nbsp;IP.</p><p>The DEXes and CEXes naturally allow for automatic price discovery and liquidity. Fees and airdrops incentivize providing liquidity. The amount of liquidity in a particular IP’s pool is a useful curation signal — the more stake the higher the quality of the IP&nbsp;asset.</p>ERC20: Structure Diagram showing automatic price discovery 5. Conclusion <p>This article connected IP to ERC20 Solidity implementations, and how it enables price discovery and other benefits.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">next article</a> covers IP*blockchain using ERC721+ERC20, to combine the benefits of&nbsp;both.</p> Acknowledgements <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series acknowledges the many people that have helped towards the whole series, including this article. Thank you&nbsp;again!</p> Notes <p>[1] Price discovery for single ERC721s remains a challenge.<a href="https://blog.coinfund.io/appraisal-games-and-the-nft-liquidity-problem-904afe6bc7af"> This piece</a> by Jake Brukhman points to many exciting projects aiming to tackle this. Interestingly, several of them re-introduce fungibility.</p><p>[2] For readability, we use values scaled for ETH, not Wei. An actual implementation would use&nbsp;Wei.</p><p>[3] With fractional ownership of base IP, one may need to account for securities laws in some jurisdictions.</p><p>[4] For more flexibility, replace traditional ERC20.owner with ERC725y.owner.

<p><a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/">Write the Docs Portland 2021</a> has concluded, and I wanted to share a couple of key insights and observations from the conference.</p><p>First, it was fun, a wonderfully nice group of people, and a well-organized event. Virtual conferences are new for many events and Write the Docs pulled it off really well.</p> Docs as Code <p>One repeated theme throughout the conference was technical writers embracing git-based workflows. Writers can more easily collaborate with developers when they work on documentation iteratively. Benefits include avoiding a rush to document at the last minute before a release, less out-of-band communication to understand upcoming changes, and less tooling across an organization.</p><p>The cost is that technical writers must learn git, git-based workflows, and plain-text formats, but the benefits are significant, and many writers are learning or already actively using these tools.</p><p>Write the Docs has a page with more information on <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/">Docs as Code</a>.</p> Evolutionary Documentation <p>One of the more striking talks at the conference was “Always complete, never finished” given by Daniele Procida. The <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/speakers/#speaker-daniele-procida">talk summary</a> states it best:</p><blockquote>an incremental, evolutionary way of working on large documentation tasks that makes every step, from the very first one, a value-adding improvement</blockquote><p>Large documentation refactors taken as a single task can be stressful, time-consuming, and may be out-of-date before they are complete. Instead, documentation can evolve in iterative steps that each improve the overall quality of the documentation.</p><p>Notice the iterative nature of this process and how it relates to Docs as Code. Yes, they are synergistic and work together nicely.</p> Vale: A syntax-aware linter for prose <p>As documentation matures, consistent style and tone grow in importance, and many organizations adopt a style guide or develop their own. While these rules are needed, it can be bothersome and inefficient to need to refer to the style guide manually to keep writing consistent.</p><p>One unconference session was devoted to <a href="https://github.com/errata-ai/vale">Vale</a>, a tool that lints prose based on the rules in a style guide. I love a good code linter, and this tool looks fantastic for prose.</p><p>The Vale ecosystem seems great and includes:</p>  A GitHub action: <a href="https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action">GitHub - errata-ai/vale-action: The official GitHub Action for Vale -- install, manage, and run Vale with ease.</a>  A VSCode extension: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=errata-ai.vale-server">Vale - Visual Studio Marketplace</a>  Emacs support: <a href="https://github.com/abingham/flycheck-vale">GitHub - abingham/flycheck-vale: Flycheck integration for the vale natural language linter</a>  A nix package: <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=20.09&amp;show=vale&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=vale">NixOS Search</a>  <p>It can be used on a variety of plain text formats, comments in code in many languages, and some GUI-based tools (with a paid subscription). See the <a href="https://docs.errata.ai/vale/scoping#formats">complete list of supported formats</a>.</p> So Many More <p>These were just a few of the great things from Write the Docs this year, but there were so many more! All of the talks should now be posted to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr019846MitZUEhc6apDdcQ">Write the Docs YouTube channel</a>.</p> <p>Brian is part of the Developer Success team at Fission and spends a lot of time improving our <a href="https://guide.fission.codes">guide</a> and making better code examples and other ways to help developers succeed in using Fission.</p>

 Compare and Contrast — IRMA vs Verifiable Credentials IRMA vs&nbsp;VC<p>Self-sovereign identity, the next step in the evolution of identity management, revolves around empowering users to own their identity and control how it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Given the many concerns revolving around privacy and data sharing that exist today, SSI is being increasingly seen as a potential solution for secure sharing, privacy, and interoperability in the digital world. As a result, the last few years have seen the development of many systems and frameworks to bring SSI closer to&nbsp;reality.</p><p>In this article, we will be comparing two such SSI-based systems, namely, “I Reveal My Attributes” (IRMA) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p> What is&nbsp;IRMA? <p>IRMA was founded by the Digital Security Research group at the Radboud University in the Netherlands. The aim of this group was to create open, secure, and privacy-friendly systems that would give users complete control over their identity.</p><p>This pilot project was called IRMA and it was based on the Idemix technology.</p><p>Idemix is a public-private key pair where the private key is used by the issuer to sign a credential and the public key is used by the verifier to establish that the credential is signed by the issuer and hence is authentic.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable credentials</a>, or VC in short, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically.</p><p>There are three essential components of verifiable credentials, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  It is machine verifiable  It is secure and tamper-proof  Has been issued by a competent authority.   Underlying Cryptography <p>Both IRMA and VCs can use <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof</a> as their cryptographic foundation, but they use different cryptographic frameworks. While IRMA uses Idemix, many VC implementations rely on the Charm framework.</p><p>Idemix is a Java library while Charm is a Python API that works well for key pairings and signature schemes. The Charm Framework uses a hybrid design that combines mathematical operations in the C language with crypto modules written in high-level languages.</p><p>When you compare the two, Charm is a more advanced crypto framework that supports rapid prototyping. It also reduces the development time and allows the components to be reused. It comes with standard APIs as well that are conducive for digital signatures and encryption.</p> Schemas <p>The schemas used by IRMA and VCs are vastly different too, as VCs use the more popular <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</a>, a type of identifier to enable digital identity. The advantage with DIDs is that it gives users complete control over the usage of verifiable credentials, but the disadvantage is that it lends to the creation of different custom&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Here’s how a VC schema looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>IRMA’s approach to schemas is a stark contrast to VC. It uses a more centralized approach and IRMA has published its schemas on GitHub. Those wanting to create new schemas have to reach out to IRMA and add it to their&nbsp;list.</p><p>IRMA uses such a centralized approach because it finds no immediate need to decentralize the creation of new schemas at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>Here’s how the Schema Manager looks like in&nbsp;IRMA</p><blockquote>SchemeManager</blockquote><blockquote>+ — IssuerName</blockquote><blockquote>| + — Issues</blockquote><blockquote>| | + — CredentialName</blockquote><blockquote>| | + — — description.xml</blockquote><blockquote>| | + — —&nbsp;logo.png</blockquote><blockquote>| + — PublicKeys</blockquote><blockquote>| | + — 0.xml</blockquote><blockquote>| | + — 1.xml</blockquote><blockquote>| + — PrivateKeys (need not be&nbsp;present)</blockquote><blockquote>| | + — 0.xml</blockquote><blockquote>| | + — 1.xml</blockquote><blockquote>| + — description.xml</blockquote><blockquote>| + — logo.png</blockquote><blockquote>+ — description.xml</blockquote><blockquote>+ — index</blockquote><blockquote>+ — index.sig</blockquote><blockquote>+ — pk.pem</blockquote><blockquote>+ — timestamp</blockquote><p>As you can see, the schema creation process of each of these frameworks comes with its share of advantages and disadvantages, so there’s really no better one. Just depends on the implementation and developer preference.</p> Real-world Implementations <p>At the time of writing this piece, IRMA has three known implementations in the real&nbsp;world.</p>  Age verification in liquor stores in Almere, Netherlands  A consortium of e-health companies called nuts.nl that identify and authenticate users using&nbsp;IRMA  A work-in-progress (WIP) implementation to mitigate fake news using digital signatures.  <p>VCs, on the other hand, have many implementations. Here’s a look at some <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">real-world implementations</a> of participants in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-pocathon-2021-announcing-the-winners-40b2a5a79fa4">Affinidi’s PoCathon</a> and some possible <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">VC use-cases</a> that are waiting to be implemented.</p><p>Here is a table that summarizes these key differences.</p> Comparison at a&nbsp;Glance <p>To learn more about building VC-based applications, check out our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Developer resources</a>.

 How tools of IP can help creators and collectors better protect their rights and&nbsp;monetize  Summary <p>This article aims to improve understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP), as a tool to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It gives a mini backgrounder on IP, then connects IP to ERC721 NFTs at Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p>Follow-up articles explore <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">ERC20</a>, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">ERC721+ERC20</a> for NFTs &amp;&nbsp;IP.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 “Your Keys, Your&nbsp;Bitcoin” <p>Ownership of a hundred dollar bill is straightforward: “if you hold it, you own it”. Same for a physical painting. Ownership of real-world objects is defined through physical access control [0]. This has benefits: it’s a simple mental model, it protects the owner, and transfer of ownership is&nbsp;easy.</p><p>We’re half a century into the computer era. Yet it hasn’t been easy to translate ownership of physical assets to intangible assets like electronic money or digital art. As a workaround, the world has used human-readable contracts for these intangible assets. Alas, these “<a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html?m=1">wet-code</a>” contracts are tedious to understand, expensive, slow, and error-prone. For example, “this 100-page document says you own it”&nbsp;😬.</p><p>Then along came Bitcoin, a “<a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html?m=1">dry-code</a>” machine-readable approach to electronic money, with blockchain as the basis. Like real-world assets, ownership of digital assets is defined through access control. For Bitcoin this means “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnC5mFaIW3Q&amp;ab_channel=BitcoinIsrael">Your keys, your Bitcoin</a>”. This gains the benefits of real world assets: simple mental model, protects the owner, and easy transfer of ownership. It’s cheaper, faster, and less error-prone than previous “wet-code” approaches to digital assets. Digital tools can track ownership of physical assets as&nbsp;well.</p> 1.2 IP as a Tool → “Your Keys, Your&nbsp;NFT” <p>Inspired by Bitcoin, in 2013 we <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1376105737827594241">built</a> <a href="http://trent.st/content/2015-06-24%20ascribe%20whitepaper.pdf">ascribe</a> for “dry code” digital art and other creative works. ascribe leveraged Bitcoin blockchain. Our mantra was “<a href="https://medium.com/silicon-allee/art-and-tech-in-berlin-a-powerful-combination-c40e9b328f7">own digital art the way you own Bitcoin</a>.” Blockchain technology helped creators and collectors secure their work and monetize.</p><p>Early on in ascribe, we discovered that Intellectual Property (IP) was an incredibly useful toolbox to help creators and collectors protect their rights and earn a living. The language and laws of IP go back literally centuries. All the books you’ve read, music you’ve heard, and movies you’ve watched have IP language backed up by laws to protect the authors, musicians and filmmakers.</p><p>So for ascribe, we used the language of IP to make the rights for creators &amp; collectors maximally clear. It’s a powerful tool, and we leveraged it heavily. We also used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160606190958/https://www.ascribe.io/terms/">legal contracts</a> to help bridge the “wet code” world’s laws of&nbsp;IP.</p><p>Whereas ascribe was an early IP * blockchain project, IP * blockchain has now evolved into full-fledged <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-difficult-to-explain-fungibility-sightings-in-nfts-26bc18620f70">field</a>: NFTs. The mental model is all about access control: “your keys, your&nbsp;NFT.”</p><p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> has been my focus for several years now. It’s about sharing, buying and selling data as an asset, by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">tokenizing digital access control</a>. Since data is IP, Ocean is about data IP assets. “Your keys, your data.” In Ocean, we also leverage the language of IP and, as a bonus, legal contracts to bridge the “wet code” world’s laws of&nbsp;IP.</p> 1.4 Outline <p>We’ve realized that our experiences over the last eight years may be helpful to others in the NFT field. The aim of this post (and subsequent posts) is to help clarify. This post is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Section 2 is an IP mini-backgrounder. In it, we introduce key terms from the language of IP — copyright, exclusive rights, licenses — along with a brief history and legal implementation.</p><p>Then in sections 3 and 4, we describe what the most popular NFTs standard — <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC721</a> — is doing from a framing of IP language, and how to leverage IP law for further protection.</p>  We do this for two specific cases: single-edition ERC721 (section 3) and limited-edition ERC721 (section&nbsp;4).  For each section, we first describe definitions — how “publish”, “sub-license”, “base IP”, “sub-licensee” etc is modeled in smart contracts and license terms. Then we provide a sequence diagram to illustrate the actions, followed by a structure diagram to show system state after each action. It’s fairly technical — we found this necessary in order to have enough clarity, all with the goal of protecting rights of creators and collectors.   2. IP Mini-Backgrounder <p>This section is a mini-backgrounder on intellectual property (IP), which is all about property of the intellectual variety.</p><p>IP and Copyright Law. Rights on digital art, physical art, music, books, and data all fall under IP law, specifically copyright law [1]. The<a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/summary_berne.html"> Berne Convention</a> of<a href="https://www.wipo.int/"> WIPO</a> was signed by<a href="https://copyrighthouse.org/countries-berne-convention/"> 179 countries</a> including USA and Germany. Each country enacts its own laws according to its guidelines.</p><p>Copyright. The Convention provides creators “with the means to control how their work is used, by whom, and on what terms”. In it, the “creator of a work<a href="https://copyrighthouse.org/countries-berne-convention/"> doesn’t need to apply</a> for copyright, or to register it.” Rather, copyright automatically exists once it has been put it into “a fixed form”, e.g. as a recording on audio tape or as magnetic bits on a hard disk. However the Convention does suggest registration, to help prove that you’re the creator of the work in the event of&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Exclusive Rights. If a publishing house “buys the rights” to an author’s work, they typically get an exclusive license (a contract) to use that work for their own profit. The base IP goes from the author to the publishing house. If a music label “buys the rights” to a musician’s work, the base IP goes from the musician to the label. And so&nbsp;forth.</p><p>Sub-licenses. When you buy an e-book, you’re buying the license to read it, for personal consumption. But you can’t re-sell 1000 copies, since your contract doesn’t include those rights. When you buy a song from iTunes, you’re buying the license to listen to it, for personal consumption. But you can’t re-sell it or play it on the radio, since you don’t have the license for&nbsp;that.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical. It describes what <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC721</a> code is doing from an IP perspective. We start with single-edition NFTs.</p> 2. Single-Edition ERC721 code &amp;&nbsp;IP  2.1 Definitions <p>This section describes how IP legals get implemented in Single-Edition ERC721 [3]. The two main actions are to publish and to sub-license. They’re defined, and represented as&nbsp;follows.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, i.e. copyright or initial exclusive license. This is implemented as ERC721._safeMint() at a new tokenId with to=self&nbsp;. To implement legals, metadata points to a T&amp;C stating that _safeMint() is a claim of base&nbsp;IP.  To Sub-license means transfer exclusive license to new exclusive licensee. This is implemented as ERC721.safeTransferFrom(). To implement legals, the T&amp;C states that safeTransferFrom() is a sub-licensing action that grants specific&nbsp;rights.  <p>Base IP, Base IP Holder, and Licensee are defined and represented as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Base IP means the artifact being copyrighted. Represented by the {ERC721 address, tokenId} from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder means the holder of the Base IP. Represented as the the actor that did the initial “publish” action.  Sub-licensee is the holder of the sub-license. Represented as the entity that controls address ERC721._owners[tokenId=x].   2.2 Single-Edition ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example with focus on behavior. The corresponding image is below. We use a UML sequence diagram. Each arrow indicates a Solidity method call to the ERC721 contract. The origin of the arrow is the entity who initiated the call, such as publisher or licensee1. The arrows do not show value transfer, e.g. from publisher to licensee1. The UML structure diagram farther below helps to build intuition on the result of each method&nbsp;call.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls the deployed ERC721 contract’s _safeMint() method, keeping ownership to themselves (to=addressP). An ERC721 contract can hold many NFTs; therefore the publisher must specify which one (tokenId=7). The ERC721’s _owner attribute (a mapping) at tokenId=7 gets updated to addressP.</p><p>Step ❷ is an (exclusive) Sub-License action from Publisher to Licensee1. The publisher calls ERC721.safeTransferFrom() to send the NFT to Licensee1 (to=address1). The ERC721’s _owner attribute gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❸ is an (exclusive) Sub-License action from Licensee1 to Licensee2. The ERC721’s _owner attribute gets updated accordingly.</p>Single-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.3 Single-Edition ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each action. The corresponding image is below. It roughly follows the format of a UML Composite Structure Diagram&nbsp;.It focuses on which actor has which IP rights, i.e. who owns&nbsp;what.</p><p>After Step ❶ (Publish), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT hasn’t been transferred yet, then the entity at this address can be interpreted as the base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>After Step ❷ (exclusive Sub-License), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is now set to address1. The address1 owner is the exclusive licensee. Since the license is exclusive, this entity is also the Base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>After Step ❸ is like ❷, except now the address2 owner is exclusive licensee and Base IP&nbsp;holder.</p>Single-Edition ERC721: UML Structure Diagram 3. Limited-Edition ERC721 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP  3.1 Definitions <p>Limited-edition NFTs means there are several NFT tokens for the same base IP [4]. Each token is its own&nbsp;edition.</p><p>Each edition may be considered fungible or non-fungible:</p>  Fungible if the edition can be swapped with another edition and no one cares. For example, a digital visual artwork in a gif has 10 limited editions available and there are no serial numbers. Or an e-book novel with 1000 limited editions.  Non-fungible if a swap does matter. For example, the NFT has a history of ownership or usage (provenance) that influences the price. Or collectors assign higher value to a particular edition number (“edition 3 is more valuable than edition&nbsp;17”).  <p>Here’s the implementation using ERC721. It would be fairly similar if using <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155">ERC1155</a>; for ease of reading we will focus on&nbsp;ERC721.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. This is implemented as one ERC721._safeMint() call for each edition. Each call has a unique tokenId input. The IP claim is being made a separate time for each call; this works assuming one address does all initial&nbsp;minting.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC721.safeTransferFrom().  Base IP: represented by the {ERC721 address, tokenId} from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder: whoever performed the initial publish&nbsp;actions.  Sub-licensee: the owner of address ERC721._owners[tokenId=x,y,z] (example of 3 editions).   3.2 Limited-Edition ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls _safeMint() method three separate times, specifying tokenId=7, 8, and 9 for each&nbsp;edition.</p><p>Step ❷ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=7, from Publisher to Licensee1. The limited edition for tokenId=7 is sub-licensed to Licensee1 (address1). This method call is a non-exclusive sub-license; compare to an exclusive sub-license for the same call in the single-edition ERC721&nbsp;case.</p><p>Step ❸ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=7 from Licensee1 to Licensee2.</p><p>Step ❹ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=8.</p>Limited-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 3.3 Limited-Edition ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each&nbsp;action.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the ERC721._owners at tokenId=7, 8, and 9 are set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT editions haven’t been transferred yet, the addressP owner is interpreted as the base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>When Completed ❷ (Sub-License), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is now address1, meaning the address1 owner is sub-licensee for edition tokenId=7. The Base IP holder remains the Publisher (addressP). There isn’t an explicit way to do an exclusive sub-license of the base IP. This has a different interpretation than single-edition ERC721, where the same method call means an exclusive sub-licensing of the Base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>When Completed ❸ ❹, then the address2 owner is sub-sub-licensee for edition tokenId=7, and the address3 owner is sub-licensee for edition tokenId=8. The Base IP holder remains the Publisher (addressP).</p>Limited-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 4. Conclusion <p>This article aimed to improve understanding of Intellectual Property (IP), as a tool to help creators and collectors. It gave a mini backgrounder on IP, then connected IP to ERC721 NFTs in Solidity implementations.</p><p>Subsequent articles cover IP*blockchain implementations in ERC20 (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">link</a>) and ERC721+ERC20 (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">link</a>).</p> Acknowledgements <p>Thanks to the following people who contributed to this article and follow-on articles in this series.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Google has launched <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai" title="Vertex AI">Vertex AI</a>, its fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) platform for the enterprise. It tackles the challenge of operationalizing AI/ML projects with automated pipelines, accessibility for business users, data scientists, and ML engineers, and pre-trained APIs for speech, vision, video, and more. The divide between technical know-how and precise customization and implementation of ML models is shrinking rapidly, thanks to AI Service Clouds.</p>
 Fully Managed will be a Distinguishing Feature 
<p>Fully managed will become a distinguishing feature of AI Service Clouds. Although attention is primarily given to the AI capabilities of AI Service Clouds, such as plug-and-play language, cognitive, and prediction capabilities, the implementation of these is simplified with managed services. For a wide variety of personas to collaborate on an AI project, a few things have to be in place: a user interface that abstracts away complexity from reliable AutoML that assists in data preparation, model selection, feature engineering, testing, validating, and beyond. The computational effort to power AutoML for model development, let alone implementation, is accessed most realistically from the cloud. The requirements are many: data storage of training and operational data, flexible training requirements like distributed, spot, or batch, model versioning, and much more. AI Service Clouds that are managed services abstract away the complexity of running AI/ML projects and hand off managing the computation-intensive tasks.</p>
<p>AI Service Clouds is an emerging market space, with much emphasis on AutoML, automated pipelines, pre-build models accessible via API, and making AI/ML accessible to business users without formal training in the field. But the computational effort that is required to make MLOps appear so effortless remains a fundamental part of this new wave of enterprise AI.</p>
<p></p>
 Our Recommendations 
<p>Be aware of your data: Your data has gravity, and whether intentional or not, the place where your data resides has an influence on the vendors and services you use. Especially in the AI/ML field which is so data-reliant, be strategic about planning where and how data is stored <a></a>so that it can serve your use cases in the best way possible. Security and privacy controls of your ML data should be considered on-prem and especially in the cloud. Google Cloud Vertex AI does provide additional security measures for sensitive data, such as encryption and dataset aggregation and obfuscation.</p>
<p>Be aware of your use cases: It’s okay to dream big when it comes to AI/ML, but don’t let the dream steer strategy. Always consider what the business needs are, then consider which technologies or revised processes could serve it. Don’t pursue AI for its own sake.</p>
<p>Be aware of who your AI/ML project impacts: If there is any time to implement multi-stakeholder practices, it is with your AI/ML projects. You will need a diverse development team to ask the right questions: How was the data that we use for training collected? Is it representative of your customers, or does it identify or alienate any group? Does the data adequately meet the needs of the business case? What communication strategies with end users are in place?</p>
<p>By automating and abstracting away complexity, AI Service Clouds make diverse teams more feasible, offer ready-made MLOps tools to the enterprise, and bring flexibility to the computation question. Read the Market Compass: AI Service Clouds to learn more.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce Anonyome Labs is listed in the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/">Privacy Tech Vendor Report 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs joins&nbsp;355&nbsp;other&nbsp;qualified organizations in&nbsp;the&nbsp;2021&nbsp;compendium of&nbsp;privacy tech vendors. This is a significant increase from the 44 vendors listed in the inaugural report in 2017.&nbsp;The number of&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories&nbsp;is also higher in 2021: now 11 categories split across two groups&nbsp;—&nbsp;Privacy program management and&nbsp;Enterprise privacy management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see this growth in both vendor numbers and&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories as evidence of the explosion in market awareness of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;of&nbsp;the vital need to protect&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;among consumers and enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAPP agrees, saying these changes represent as a “metamorphosis” in the privacy landscape in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the IAPP released its 2017 report, it described the privacy technology marketplace as being “on the precipice of a major evolutionary shift”. You’ll recall the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;was about a year off becoming law and the marketplace had some early tech vendors.&nbsp;(<a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;was around at this time—we were established in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">2014</a>&nbsp;through the pioneering foresight of our early founders—but&nbsp;we&nbsp;were still developing our early products.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2017,&nbsp;the world has&nbsp;seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/california-prop-24-puts-more-brakes-on-big-tech/">California Consumer Privacy Act&nbsp;2018</a>, Brazil’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-vs-lgpd/">General Data Protection Law2018</a>, and other privacy laws around the world, including plenty of&nbsp;regulatory&nbsp;movement at the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">state level in the US</a>.&nbsp;This raft of&nbsp;new&nbsp;compliance requirements has brought&nbsp;a corresponding increase in the demand for privacy tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an aside, the rise of privacy&nbsp;tech was the focus of an expert panel at this year’s Data Privacy Day. Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">8 Key Takeaways From the ‘Rise of Privacy Tech’ Panel With Our Co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley</a>&nbsp;for some considered insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In releasing the&nbsp;5th&nbsp;edition of the&nbsp;Privacy Tech Vendor Report&nbsp;in&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;the IAPP&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/">observes</a>: “Privacy tech has undergone a paradigm shift over the past five years, affecting everything from the development of&nbsp;privacy tech tools to the attitude toward privacy tech vendors. The five-year mark of the report’s existence is perhaps the proper time to look at how far the privacy tech market has gone and where it will go in the future”.&nbsp;(We’ve been thinking about the future of privacy for a while. Read our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">10-year forecast</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 2021 report, Anonyome Labs is listed under the Privacy Information Managers category&nbsp;as the best fit, but we acknowledge that our enterprise offering,&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a>, is difficult to categorize given its unique depth and breadth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudo&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;is&nbsp;a scalable developer platform that provides companies with the necessary tools to build privacy and&nbsp;cybersafety&nbsp;solutions into new and existing products for their end users. The&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform’s public APIs and SDKs offer developers various privacy-oriented capabilities including private telephony and email services, end-to-end encrypted communications, private browsing, password management, virtual card payments. These capabilities are available for mobile, desktop, and web applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Inside&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>At the heart of&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform is our&nbsp;innovative digital identity concept called the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">Sudo</a>. A Sudo is a secure, customizable digital identity or ‘profile’ that intentionally differentiates from a consumer’s personal identity and protects their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;isn’t a ‘burner’ or fake ID—it’s a real, alternative identity that a consumer can use anywhere their personal identity is required. The consumer’s&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile is a secure stand-in for their personal identity, and it’s entirely under their control. They create the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile and manage it.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudos are the&nbsp;centerpiece&nbsp;of our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a> complete business toolkit for rapidly producing branded cybersecurity solutions, and our exemplar consumer privacy app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">MySudo</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When enterprises access&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform to rapidly produce branded cybersecurity solutions, they can use the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;as part of a <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">menu of high value privacy tools</a> delivered as easy-to-use APIs and SDKs.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>When giving the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/">Engineers Australia</a> Annual Informatics Lecture, our co-CEO and CTO, <a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Dr Paul Ashley</a>, spoke on <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and the tech driving it this <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">decade</a>, particularly identity and anonymous profiles online. Paul shared that in developing the&nbsp;Sudo, we wanted to do something that hasn’t been done before. And that’s what the global fight for privacy will demand from us and others in this space, as well as any company that engages with user data: out of the box thinking and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Before the Internet was born in 1983, computer networks lacked a standard method of communicating with one another. In the years since — as online communications have grown interwoven with our daily lives and revolutionised the world we live in — there remains a crucial thing we still don’t have a standardised way of talking about in the digital world: you.</p>



<p>Without a standardised way of identifying people online, websites began to use local accounts with usernames and passwords. You likely have several of these that you rely on in your daily life: your Amazon account, your email account, your Netflix account. These sites also began storing usage information, personal data and data about the user obtained through 3rd party sources in the user account. This approach created&nbsp; so-called siloed identities.</p>



<p>As the internet has grown to encompass everything from your private inbox to your grocery orders, your workout regimen and your finances, your personal data is now collected and stored in dozens of places outside your control. You — the digital you that is — are a string of accounts where third parties hold your information on their servers.</p>



<p>This creates big problems. Your data resides in silos that are potentially vulnerable to hackers, data leakage and other privacy breaches. Just ask the 338 million customers of Marriott Hotels whose personal information, including passport numbers, were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54748843">leaked</a> between 2014 and 2018. In 2020 alone, the number of personal records <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/01/21/new-research-no-of-records-exposed-increased-141-in-2020/#download">compromised</a> in data breaches grew 141 percent to 38 billion, according to security firm Risk Based Security (RSB). The other problem is that the usage of this data, even if it is secure, cannot be controlled — the user even doesn’t know what is stored where and has no direct access. Not to mention that this approach requires a separate account for every service you use, leaving you with dozens or even hundreds of passwords and logins (remember, you should never reuse a password!), multiplying the spread of your personal data across the internet and contributing to a less-than-satisfactory user experience. What’s more, this situation leaves internet users vulnerable to phishing and other scams that trick people into giving away their personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rise of&nbsp; internet giants like Google and Facebook came the idea of federated identity. That’s when third parties allow you to log in to their site or app using, for example, your Gmail account. If you go to a website and use the “sign in with” functionality, known as “single sign-on”, you’re using a federated identity — Google or Facebook are playing the role of identity provider.&nbsp; In such a setup, the multi-account problem may have been solved, but new, serious problems arise. The companies that dominate the federated identity space, basically acting as middlemen for your digital existence, have huge economic incentive to collect as much data about your online interactions as possible — and mine it for profit. Google, for example, has been accused of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49593830">secretly tracking</a> its own users in Europe, and was fined for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html">illegally harvesting data</a> from children in the US. A less obvious issue is that the providers of single sign-on services also have control over where you are allowed to use your identity and can potentially deny its usage according to their will, be it economic interest, opaque&nbsp; ethical principles or governmental pressure. Twitter can ban you forever, Instagram can close your account, Facebook can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/01/facebooks-australian-news-wipeout-showed-it-can-delete-our-history-at-any-time">wipe your page</a>. You could say that they control your digital existence.</p>



<p>Thankfully, a better way is emerging. It’s a third kind of online identity where your personal data is neither strewn across an inefficient patchwork of silos nor controlled by a big company that mines your personal data for money.</p>



<p>It’s called self-sovereign identity (SSI).</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is the next major step in the evolution of digital identity. It closes the gap on inefficiencies and privacy concerns around the ways you make yourself known online by putting you in control.</p>



<p>First, here’s the theory behind it.</p>



<p>Basically, SSI means a person, or an organisation, completely owns, controls and manages their identity online. You are your own identity provider — there is no one else who can claim to “provide” your identity for you because it’s intrinsically yours.</p>



<p>In a more formal way we can say that SSI follows 10 key principles, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">as first outlined by Christopher Allen</a>:</p>



  SSI provides an independent existence and absolute control for its users, who hold the access to their own data. That means no intermediaries owning or sifting through your data: it belongs to you.  SSI is transparent (so that you can understand any system or algorithm involved), interoperable (so it integrates well with other systems) and portable (meaning no vendor or device lock-in).&nbsp;  SSI offers persistence (the identities will last for as long as you want them to last… no need to worry about Facebook deleting your Instagram account) and protection (erring always on the side of protecting individuals’ freedoms and rights).&nbsp;  SSI prioritises consent (users must always agree to how their identity is being used — whether that’s to disclose or restrict data) and minimisation (you should only disclose the data that you need to, supporting privacy as much as you can.)&nbsp;  



<p>To this practical list, <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi</a> adds an 11th principle of our own:</p>



  SSI values usability — it’s&nbsp; easy to use, adopt and understand. There are no complex bells and whistles, just the means to share and use the information you want, when you want, and it’s easy to carry around with you.  







<p>From the user perspective, practical SSI looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the user, you possess a digital identity wallet which stores the data related to your identity and interacts with other SSI-enabled systems. The wallet can be in the form of an app on your mobile phone or a web-based service or, often, a combination of both.</p>



<p>Your personal data is stored in the wallet in the form of verifiable credentials, rather than on centralised servers. It’s kept under the user’s sovereign control and literally in the user’s possession. A verifiable credential itself is a representation of data which is cryptographically tamper-proof and traceable to its origin (more on that later).</p>



<p>What sort of personal data can be stored in the identity wallet? Any statement about you that can be represented digitally! This could include digital representations of personal ID cards, education diplomas, login credentials, property deeds, corporate badges, vaccination passports, COVID-19 test results, any transaction records and much, much more. Using the wallet, you can selectively present some of these credentials to an interested third party, either some of the time or all of the time. You can record your consent to share data with others, and easily facilitate that sharing. Your data is persistent and not reliant on any single third party to be stored or forwarded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we have the basic components, let’s look at the interactions they enable. In the below diagram, we have a mental model for how identity can be managed in a way that delivers on the SSI principles. It is known as the SSI Trust Triangle.</p>







<p>Let’s walk through this diagram step by step.</p>



<p>An issuer makes claims or assertions about a user. These claims are bundled together into verifiable credentials and given to the user, who stores them in their digital wallet. From there, they can decide which verifiers they want to present these credentials to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the issuer in this case is a university. The assertion they want to make about you is that you’re a graduate and that you have an MBA. So they issue a verifiable credential that you can store in your identity wallet. Now, let’s say you’re applying for a job at a financial agency. As part of your application, you’re able to prove that you have an MBA by making your credential visible to the company you’re applying to. Note that the verifier — in this case the prospective employer — does not need to contact the university to confirm the authenticity of the diploma credential. Conversely, neither the university, nor anyone else, will know which companies you are applying to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many real-world business interactions involve a similar flow of data.</p>



<p>Need a fishing license? Rather than go to a government office, with SSI you could apply using a digital driver’s license. Want to sign up for an industry conference? Use a digital work ID issued by your employer. Want to rent a flat? Confirm your ID, your proof of solvency and your employment status to your new landlord by presenting the relevant credentials in your wallet.</p>



<p>If you were looking carefully at the diagram you might have noticed that it also has “blockchain” in it — we haven’t mentioned that yet! Read on to learn the role distributed ledger technologies play in SSI and why they work so well together.</p>



 What’s the Technology Behind SSI? 



<p>SSI relies on modern cryptography and decentralisation to make the things described above work.</p>



<p>The core idea is to give users free, unique, machine-readable, user-controlled, persistent and anonymous identifiers that are decoupled from the “personal data” about the user they “identify”. These are called decentralised identifiers, or DIDs. This might sound intimidatingly jargonistic, but the idea of identifiers is of course not new — email addresses, phone numbers, profile IDs and all sorts of other sensitive numbers have a long tradition of being (mis-)used for such purposes. The difference is that they are neither free, persistent, anonymous nor user-controlled.</p>



<p>DIDs can not only be generated&nbsp; for people, but also for organisations, objects, digital documents and more. Every participant in the SSI ecosystem needs at least one, but you can also have more than one DID in the same way that you might have one email address for work and one for personal use. Each DID is cryptographically linked to a secret key that only the DID owner knows, along with a corresponding public key that other users can use to verify claims made by the DID owner. Aside from this, DIDs are anonymous: they don’t contain or reveal any information about their owner.</p>



<p>The blockchain is used to perpetuate this linkage in a way that guarantees that the data associated to the link can be changed by the owner of the DID, cannot be maliciously manipulated and persists forever. (NB: this is of course based on the assumption that a decentralised structure with many autonomous nodes will not go down, as a one single company could. There are also SSI architectures that work without&nbsp; distributed ledgers.)</p>



<p>The second pillar of SSI is the concept of verifiable credentials, or VCs, which can be thought of as a “file format” for storing the claims about an entity which guarantees the authenticity and integrity of the data. They also come with useful features like selective disclosure of claims, Zero Knowledge Proofs, and semantic overlays that do not have analogue alternatives. For now, though, all you need to remember is that a VC contains real-world relatable data about a thing or person — the credential subject — and that it is linked to the DIDs of the issuer and the subject and is tamper-proof.</p>



<p>The main function of your identity wallet is to manage the user’s private keys, store VCs about the user securely and enable safe communication with other identity wallets, in order to exchange VCs and data derived from them in a way that protects your privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you need to disclose information to a third party, your wallet will let you pick the relevant data attributes from different credentials and combine them with the DIDs of the corresponding issuers, as well as your own DID and a cryptographic signature. This is called a verifiable presentation (VP). From here, the VP can be transferred to the verifier, who, based on the cryptographic signature in the VP, is able to independently verify two things:</p>



  The data contained in the issuer’s claims have not been changed, and  the person who presented the VP is the same person about whom the issuer originally made the claim.  



<p>Of course, this is just an overview and does not cover important aspects such as security, revocation of credentials and governance structure. In the meantime, the <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi Labs</a> and the SSI community continue to explore and develop these topics. Expect blog posts on them soon!&nbsp;</p>



 The Future of Your Identity 



<p>It won’t happen overnight, but the move away from conventional siloed and federated identities is already underway, giving people more control over their lives as well as more convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already, SSI projects exist that:</p>



  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-refugee-funds-idUSKCN1T1025">Help refugees</a> prove their identities and credentials in their new homeland.  Onboard <a href="https://www.evernym.com/onfido-deloitte/">new customers</a> at major financial institutions.  Allow you to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/iata-travel-pass/index.html">present Covid-19 tests and vaccination records</a> when you travel.  



<p>The possibilities for the technology are virtually endless. Policymakers see this, too: The European Union is developing its own European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), and has invested in companies developing SSI projects and platforms.</p>



<p>The benefits of&nbsp; adopting SSI are also clear: increased privacy, fewer data breaches, and more efficient administration of business and government, which helps in the process of wealth creation. At this point, it’s no longer a matter of if, but when.&nbsp;</p>

 Key insights about scaffolding mental wealth and humane development in the 21st&nbsp;century Drivers of mental health and wellbeing and the investment classes required to build mental&nbsp;wealth<blockquote>This is the second in a series of DM notes that we will write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>DM Note #2 is a preview of our international portfolio around mental wealth in Sweden, Dubai, England and South Korea as well as some of the learnings that are coming out of it, externally and internally.</blockquote>Screenshot from the last DM Download on mental&nbsp;wealth What is mental&nbsp;wealth? <p>Remaking our institutional, environmental and cultural contexts will be essential to the development of people’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities. In a time of complexity and uncertainty, these capacities provide foundational infrastructure for our 21st- and 22nd-century society and economy. We call this societal scale intangible infrastructure — Mental Wealth and scaffolding this will be of the highest priority during our nascent rebuilding phase after COVID-19.</p><p>However, already four years ago Dark Matter Labs started exploring Mental Wealth’s relations to our build environment, our ways of learning, the technological advancement, society’s changing demographics, the development of our ecological systems and how our deep codes (financing, contracting, policy making, regulating, governing) impact these. Below we share a summary and key insights of various streams of work on the ground and we invite you to join the continued conversation and exploration.</p> Invisible Landscapes: <br>We Are&nbsp;They <p>We Are They was an exhibition by DML as part of the Invisible Landscapes series at the RA in 2018. The animation is based around the idea of the built environment as an infrastructure for health and wellbeing, and tries to outline how technology is allowing us to both understand and quantify the effects of the modern city, as well as how we might democratize the power to analyse and update&nbsp;it.</p> Logic Model of ‘Viable* conditions into thriving&nbsp;society” <p>*viability: ability to work as intended or to succeed/ability to continue to exist or develop as a living&nbsp;being</p><p>Our shared timeline to become aware of and act for our planetary future is limited and we realise the need for a radically different thesis in order to unlock our current lock-ins*. Our current version of the world has systems optimised for minimum viability for the whole and maximum viability for the few. For instance, The average income of the top 10% in Sweden, was 6.3 times higher than that of the bottom 10%.* In an age of complexity and uncertainty we recognise the need for a multi-dimensional and multi-actor transition that sees the unprecedented opportunity to create a hyper-viable world. The fundamentals of this transition will be rooted in the way we realise and recalibrate the values on which our ecosystem of relationships is based on. Humane relationships that rely on trust and our sense-making ability to separate signals from noise. In this sense, Viable Cities and Dark Matter Labs have developed the logic models of hyper viability to understand multi dimensional conditions of humane thriving and viable&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Logic model:</p><p>We often use a logic model to understand complex relationships between resources, activities and impacts and to comprehend the underlying logic behind visible data. In other words, the logic model tends to fail (despite its usefulness), because there are always gaps in details &amp; interrelational logics. The logic model of ‘hyper viability’ had various iterations:</p>  The 1st logic model identified three key economies: technology, health and natural systems at the centre of transitions towards a thriving society. There are differences between dimensions of time and speed in each&nbsp;economy.  The 2nd logic model explored key trends and drivers influencing economies impacting humane thriving.  The 3rd logic model discovered that transitions require tapping into multiple layers of the system by understanding new forms of relationships — to self, others, nature and the future, instead of putting humane development as the ultimate aim of a thriving&nbsp;society.  The 4th logic model proposed that the transition towards a viable thriving society requires a thriving life for all within planetary boundaries. This requires a fundamental shift in the way we understand and make sense of our interconnected ecosystem, ranging from our relationships, culture, institutions, psychology/sociology and environment to technology.  <p>In order to collectively move towards a thriving society, we need to understand what kinds of transition capacities and capabilities we need to build. The 5th version of the viability logic model is in the making, which emphasises the need to enable our shared sensemaking, innovation and democratic fitness capacity and capabilities towards transition, alongside an investment into our underlying human development contexts.</p> Mind//Shift: <br>Towards a 21st Century Caring&nbsp;Economy <p>Our 21st century will require us to look at mental health and wellbeing beyond treatment, to systemically embrace prevention and most importantly enable thriving. In 2019 Dark Matter Labs joined the creation of <a href="http://www.mindshift.health/">MIND//SHIFT</a> to better understand and drive deep code experimentation that address Sweden’s most important intangible infrastructure for long-term sustainable development — <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/building-mental-wealth-34441f638e3b">Mental Wealth</a>. For advanced knowledge economies where high levels of cognitive, emotional and social functioning are a key advantage, looking after this infrastructure is critical to ensure that people can be creative, productive and imaginative in a rapidly changing&nbsp;world.</p><p>But how do we work towards rebuilding people’s cognitive, emotional, and social functioning when COVID-19 has triggered increases in <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis">depression rates</a>, <a href="https://ki.se/en/nasp/the-coronavirus-risk-for-increased-suicide-and-self-harm-in-the-society-after-the-pandemic">suicides</a>, <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/4/statement-ed-phumzile-violence-against-women-during-pandemic?gclid=CjwKCAiAsaOBBhA4EiwAo0_AnHQc3UlX2TiO7ktE0pmu8edO0KPJwPrfz-jkreF1WkGz37JRJnPkKxoCbJcQAvD_BwE">domestic violence</a>, and <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/government-society-unemployment-covid19/">unemployment</a>? How do we rebuild public good and the ability to imagine another future when hope seem lost? These are the challenges we are facing as we embark on a year of experimenting and campaigning together with the our partners at MIND//SHIFT.</p>Ecosystem for local experimentation RewirEd: <br>Rethinking Education Models and Learning Environments <p>The project involves partners based in Dubai, but the reach (i.e. experimentation) will involve multiple countries. <a href="https://rewired2021.com/">RewirEd</a> stands for “Rewiring education for a prosperous and sustainable future” and we have been developing this global platform for education with our team in Dubai — <a href="https://radicle.studio/">Radicle</a>. In the past year, we have engaged with various stakeholders in education (and beyond) to develop a <a href="https://rewired.kumu.io/rewiring-nodes-in-the-education-system">system map</a> charting the interconnected issues in education and human development. Drawing on these insights, we have begun to develop a set of provocations that would serve as both an anchor and trigger for collective action towards education systems&nbsp;change.</p>On the left: Rewired System Map, In the middle: Rewired Provocation &amp; Experiments, On the right: Rewired Provocations &amp; Experiments v.2<p>There are 6 provocation areas relating to: sustainability, well-being, lifelong learning, ‘humane’ education, coalition building and education financing. The first four areas prompt us to imagine — if we put the human being at the centre, and ask what kind of conditions and support do we need in order for humans (and other beings) to collectively thrive — they would revolve&nbsp;around:</p><p>1. Learning with Nature: building more capacity for consciousness and action on issues of sustainability, as well as incorporating wisdom from indigenous communities and orienting schools towards principles of circular&nbsp;economy</p><p>2. Well-being in Education: measuring mental, physical, emotional health and making them a part of critical school outcomes and community objectives</p><p>3. Learning Beyond School: creating new incentives and infrastructures for lifelong learning and learning beyond the boundaries of the school — such as in communities and&nbsp;cities</p><p>4. Humane Education: nurturing humane values and capacities such as relational intelligence, creativity, empathy, storytelling and sensemaking</p><p>The last two areas are centred on the how — “how can we create the conditions necessary for large-scale, system transformation?”</p><p>5. Collaboration for Impact: representing the need for cross-sector coalitions, innovation partnerships, and mechanisms to ensure collective commitment.</p><p>6. Novel Financial Infrastructures: creating new incentive mechanisms, innovative funding modalities, and decision-making apparatuses that can allow actors in the system to pursue radical transformations.</p><p>Main partners: <a href="https://www.dubaicares.ae/">Dubai Cares</a>, <a href="https://www.expo2020dubai.com/">Expo 2020&nbsp;Dubai</a></p> Key insights   Provocations must address both the what and the how. Many of our ideas are centred on the what — proposing new learning models, focus &amp; content — however, it is equally important to address the question, “how can we create the conditions necessary for large-scale, system transformation?” because this capacity at the system level needs to be nurtured in order for change to&nbsp;happen.  Radical imagination requires a legitimate foundation. System mapping process engaging multiple stakeholders enables discovering, analysing, cross-validating the challenges together, and strengthens the credibility in the process. This foundation builds legitimacy and reinforces radical imagination.  Through conversations and research it has become clear that the taxonomy of mental health is largely associated with treatment, failure to treat and the clinical space of operation. This reality has structurally limited our capacity to systemically perceive and allocate resources to preventative initiatives and perhaps more critically thriving.  It is often said that we make what we measure. If this is the case, there is a risk that investment in mental wealth could be under-prioritised as a result of missing metrics. Without the metrics that look at mental wealth in a systemic way, we lack the data to build a case. More importantly, we are deprived of the ability to account for, drive, and value the co-beneficial results and spillover effects of a mental wealth portfolio.  Building the human capacity to collaborate horizontally is central to building mental wealth, at the same time as it is dependent on our mental wealth. Without developing people’s social and emotional capacity, it becomes difficult to unlock complex collaboration. It is necessary, therefore, to design capacity-building processes that incorporate social and emotional training. Without it, we will struggle to implement co-beneficial solutions where the human is no longer optimised to be a ‘bad robot’ but, rather, a highly cognitive, emotional, and social&nbsp;being.   From the Inside Out: <br>Our Internal approach to Human Development and Wellbeing <p>We are in the process of exploring what mental wealth means for us as an organisation and how that can be realised and nurtured in our context of increased uncertainty and psychologically demanding work. We are hoping to share a blog post with our take aways and learning towards the end of the&nbsp;year.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you enjoyed this DM Note, please also read <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-1-7ec5cfb1c093">DM Note #1 here</a>, follow us on Medium for more to come and “clap” the article to show appreciation.

What crypto means for the future of the monetary&nbsp;system <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2021-lael-brainard">Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard</a>:</p><blockquote>“I do believe that in the context where we maintain the role of safe central bank money as a foundation for the payment system, there’s a lot of room for competition and innovation to flourish,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“I think in a world where consumers and businesses retain access to a form of safe central bank money as part of that digital ecosystem, in fact we would see greater competition,” she said. “And that’s a good thing, it would be good to see a more dynamic, more innovative payment system foundation, a safe foundation that could provide greater opportunity for private sector participants to innovate.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/imf-chief-more-than-one-reserve-currency-stable">IMF division chief Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli</a>:</p><blockquote>“I’m not saying this is the case for the U.S. dollar,” explained Mancini, whose full title is division chief of IMF monetary and capital markets payments and infrastructure team. “This is a theoretical argument that underpins the greater stability of the world with multiple reserve currencies. So I think from an international perspective, that there’ll be more than one is a welcomed proposition,” Mancini said. He added that the world already has multiple reserve currencies including the dollar, the euro and the Japanese&nbsp;yen.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“For crypto assets to be a significant risk to central banks, there needs to be a considerable amount of currency substitution,” Mancini said, which in this context means countries would have to use a (theoretically) more stable cryptocurrency instead or in addition to the local currency.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2021-lael-brainard">Fed’s Brainard Breaks Down CBDC Policy Considerations — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-cbdc-economic-retaliation-consensus-2021">CBDC May Give China ‘Leeway for Economic Retaliation’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/imf-chief-more-than-one-reserve-currency-stable">IMF Official: ‘A World With More Than One Reserve Currency Is a More Stable World’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-brian-brooks-digital-dollar">Brian Brooks: Digital Dollar ‘More a Discussion Than a Reality’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jared-polis-colorado-governor-consensus-2021">Gov.

DeFi&nbsp;rising <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-8-questions-ethereum-andrew-keys">DARMA Capital’s Andrew&nbsp;Keys</a>:</p><blockquote>[Decentralized finance] has over $100 billion in [total value locked] with Ethereum settling $1.5 trillion of transactions in Q1 ’21&nbsp;… actual capital deployment is happening right now. Last month, [European Investment Bank], [Goldman Sachs] and [Société Générale] had to spend ether in order to issue a bond. Those entities needed ether for operating expenses. It’s happening right&nbsp;now.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/defi-chicago-rising">CMT Digital co-founder and CEO Colleen Sullivan</a> on why Chicago is becoming a DeFi&nbsp;hotspot:</p><blockquote>She puts the Chicago situation down to New York’s BitLicense, the state’s regulatory framework that debuted in 2015 and requires startups to obtain a license for cryptocurrency activities. It got 22 applications in its first round, while 15 companies closed down. Between 2015 and 2020, only 25 firms were approved. New York’s loss was Chicago’s gain and the result has turned the Illinois city into a hotbed of crypto collaboration.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/high-yield-crypto-ecosystem-offers-alternative-to-low-interest-rates">BlockFi CEO Zac Prince</a> on the appeal of&nbsp;yields:</p><blockquote>“If you try to explain how the blockchain works, or why bitcoin has value, or some of the other more complex and in-the-weeds topics to folks when they’re on their journey into the crypto ecosystem, they might struggle to wrap their heads around it,” he said. “Everybody knows what an interest rate is. And everybody knows that earning 8.6% on something is better than earning&nbsp;0.2%.”</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“The fact that everyone can participate in affecting what the interest rate will be in these markets is a very big thing because, traditionally, big interest-rate movements have been decided by the banking industry; for example, by a few people sitting down with a room in London,” said Kulechov.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-8-questions-ethereum-andrew-keys">Consensus 2021: 8 Questions for Ethereum’s Andrew Keys — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/defi-chicago-rising">DeFi Is Rising in Chicago — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/high-yield-crypto-ecosystem-offers-alternative-to-low-interest-rates">High-Yield Crypto Ecosystem Offers Alternative to Low Interest Rates — CoinDesk</a>   4. It’s all about&nbsp;NFTs <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/dapper-labs-nba-top-shot-has-crossed-the-million-user-mark">Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou</a>:</p><blockquote>Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 with investor Mary Meeker, Gharegozlou said Dapper’s NFT marketplace for basketball “moments” now boasts 1 million users, an eye-watering figure for a single crypto product. Half of Top Shot’s users have paid for packs or in trades, and between 150,000 to 250,000 log in every&nbsp;day.</blockquote><blockquote>The sterling growth numbers come as the broader NFT market gradually cools down from the breakneck highs of early 2021. Top Shot was no exception: desirable moments of top National Basketball Association stars traded for hundreds of thousands of dollars during the peak NFT&nbsp;craze.</blockquote><blockquote>“The headlines are always, you know, ‘LeBron sells for $200,000 or $300,000,” Gharegozlou said, “but the reality is, out of the four and a half-ish million transactions on the marketplace in the past few months, over 3 million have been less than&nbsp;$50.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-are-the-art-worlds-napster-says-exec-at-christies-auction-house">Christie’s Noah&nbsp;Davis</a>:</p><blockquote>“This is the art world’s Napster, potentially, because it could be that disruptive to the way people do business,” said Noah Davis, Christie’s point person on NFTs, referring to the music-sharing service. The British auction house announced in February it would accept ether, the Ethereum blockchain’s native currency, as a payment method, right before Beeple’s watershed digital artwork went under the hammer. The artwork was eventually sold for $69 million to Singapore-based blockchain entrepreneur MetaKovan, aka Vignesh Sundaresan.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/dapper-labs-nba-top-shot-has-crossed-the-million-user-mark">Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot Has Crossed the Million-User Mark — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-are-the-art-worlds-napster-says-exec-at-christies-auction-house">NFTs Are ‘Art World’s Napster’: Christie’s Auction House Exec — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/gary-vaynerchuk-consensus-2021">Gary Vaynerchuk: The Next Mickey Mouse Could Be an NFT — CoinDesk</a>   5. Mastercard loves crypto&nbsp;cards <p>Mastercard global head of new digital infrastructure and fintech <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-gemini-jess-turner-noah-perlman-crypto-rewards-cbdc-stablecoin">Jessica&nbsp;Turner</a>:</p><blockquote>“An act of brilliance.”</blockquote><blockquote>That’s how Jessica Turner, Mastercard’s global head of new digital infrastructure and fintech, describes a forthcoming credit card that will reward customers in cryptocurrency rather than airline miles or hotel&nbsp;points.</blockquote><p>Check out <a href="https://www.globalid.cards/xrp-card/">GlobaliD’s XRP Mastercard® Debit Card</a> for up to 5% cash back in&nbsp;XRP!</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-gemini-jess-turner-noah-perlman-crypto-rewards-cbdc-stablecoin">Mastercard Exec on ‘Brilliance’ of Gemini Crypto Rewards Card — CoinDesk</a>   6. We need to rethink our frameworks for the&nbsp;internet <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cory-doctorow-web3-seize-means-of-computation">Cory Doctorow</a>:</p><blockquote>“We live in this world where bandits run amok wanting to do terrible things to you and your data,” the science fiction author, blogger and privacy advocate said Wednesday night at Consensus 2021. “But rather than defending yourself, you can ally yourself with a warlord like Apple or Google or Facebook or Salesforce.”</blockquote><blockquote>In this “feudal security model” (a phrase Doctorow attributed to cryptography legend Bruce Schneier), when the masses try to vote with their dollar or their click, as they would in a free market, they can’t escape the oligopoly power of tech&nbsp;giants.</blockquote><blockquote>“Both implicit and explicit forms of collusion, combined with a monopoly rent by not having to compete, allows firms to really structure markets and create policies that advantage them,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/facebook-libra-diem-morgan-beller-consensus2021">Libra co-creator Morgen Beller</a> on why it probably won’t be Facebook:</p><blockquote>“I think I have some PTSD and regulatory scars,” Beller, who is now general partner at the venture fund NFX, said during a session at Consensus 2021, speaking alongside representatives of Visa, the Dash cryptocurrency and Terraform Labs.</blockquote><blockquote>Beller is credited as a co-creator of the Libra project, a cryptocurrency envisioned by the social network as a global payments rails. Its grand vision went out with a whimper in April&nbsp;2020.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“You probably need to be a cowboy if you’re a startup — not coming from Facebook — to break down those barriers,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cory-doctorow-web3-seize-means-of-computation">Author Cory Doctorow’s Web3 Rallying Cry — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/facebook-libra-diem-morgan-beller-consensus2021">Libra Co-Creator Has Regulatory ‘PTSD’ From Facebook Role — CoinDesk</a>   7. Ripple waiting on SEC lawsuit for&nbsp;IPO <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-waiting-for-sec-suit-resolution-before-going-public-says-ceo">Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse</a>:</p><blockquote>“The likelihood that Ripple is a public company is very high at some point,” Garlinghouse told CoinDesk’s Nikhilesh De, managing editor for global policy and regulation. “In the middle of an SEC lawsuit, you know, we need to get that closed&nbsp;out.”</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“The good news was the court did grant Ripple’s motion,” Garlinghouse said. “All we’ve asked for, for two to three years, is that regulatory clarity, and so I think this is progress.”</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-waiting-for-sec-suit-resolution-before-going-public-says-ceo">Ripple Waiting for SEC Suit Resolution Before Going Public — CoinDesk</a>  CNBC top 50 disruptors 2021: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/ripple-disruptor-50.html">38.&nbsp;Ripple</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/hester-peirce-sec-consensus-2021">Crypto Assets May Force SEC to Modernize Custody Rules — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/diem-co-creator-says-original-plan-for-stablecoin-was-naive">Diem Co-Creator Says Original Plan for Stablecoin Was ‘Naive’ — CoinDesk</a>   8.

 Introduction <p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralised data exchange protocol which enables data providers to securely sell their datasets by maintaining their data privacy (using our Compute-to-Data technology). Data consumers can discover and purchase datasets to train their AI algorithms on that&nbsp;data.</p><p>OCEAN is the reserve currency and utility token of Ocean Protocol. It has multiple utilities today and we are adding many more utilities. This article is a compilation of DeFi utilities of OCEAN, focused on staking and liquidity provision opportunities for OCEAN&nbsp;holders.</p><p>If you want to learn about OCEAN dynamics and value accrual, please refer to the post <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">Ocean Token&nbsp;Model</a>.</p> OCEAN Utilities in&nbsp;DeFi  1. Staking / Liquidity Provision  Ocean Market <p>OCEAN holders can stake their OCEAN on datasets in <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> and become stakers. By staking OCEAN, stakers receive guaranteed swap fees from subsequent staking, unstaking and data purchase activities that happen in their staked data pools. By staking on promising datasets, stakers also speculate on attractive future returns on their staked tokens. But needless to say, such staking opportunities comes with some risks. For more info on staking opportunities and risks in Ocean Market, check out <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">this blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p> POP! Town <p>OCEAN holders can provide their tokens as single-sided liquidity onto POP! Town’s <a href="https://new.pop.town/">Mutual Liquidity Pool (MLP) marketplace</a>. By participating in the MLP as a farmer, holders will receive rewards in 3 tokens: POP!, OCEAN, and ALBT. In addition, should users experience Impermanent Loss (IL), a portion of it will be mitigated through POP!’s unique Rebalancing Mechanism.</p>  LP Mining Rewards: APY &gt; ~100% at the time of&nbsp;writing.  Provide liquidity on POP! Town&nbsp;<a href="http://new.pop.town">here</a>.   Balancer   Swap Fees earned per transaction: Vary for different pools.  Provide Liquidity in one of the Balancer pools&nbsp;<a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/explore?token=0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">here</a>.   Uniswap V2   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.3%.  Provide Liquidity on Uniswap&nbsp;<a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/add/v2/ETH/0x967da4048cD07aB37855c090aAF366e4ce1b9F48">here</a>.

Bancor   Swap Fees earned per transaction: 0.20% (can&nbsp;vary).  Pros — Provide single sided liquidity in OCEAN with 100% impermanent loss protection when staked for 100&nbsp;days.  Provide Liquidity on Bancor&nbsp;<a href="https://app.bancor.network/eth/portfolio/stake/add/single/0xCDfF066eDf8a770E9b6A7aE12F7CFD3DbA0011B5">here</a>.   2. Lend/Borrow  OpenDAO <p>OCEAN holders can borrow ODollars by locking their OCEAN at 0% interest in OpenDAO’s <a href="https://odollar.opendao.io/">ODollar portal</a>. These ODollars can then be swapped with USDC, which OCEAN holders can use however they&nbsp;want.</p>  OCEAN has to be locked into the contract to mint ODollars. Minimum collateral ratio is 1.25 but for safety against black swan events, OpenDAO platform applies collateral ratio of &gt;2. This means that even if OCEAN price decreases by 50% in a day or an hour etc., your OCEAN will be unlikely toreach liquidation point, and you could lock more OCEAN to increase your position or pay ODollars back to unlock your&nbsp;OCEAN.  Locked OCEAN can be unlocked anytime by locking the account by paying owed ODollars back into the <a href="https://odollar.opendao.io/">ODollar portal</a>. Those ODollars are burnt and taken out of circulation to ensure that each ODollar has sufficient value (OCEAN) backing&nbsp;them.  On March 31, 2022 theODollar contract will expire — meaning that anyone holding ODollars can unlock equivalent locked OCEAN (in dollar terms) by burning their ODollars.   C.R.E.A.M. Finance <p>OCEAN was listed on <a href="https://app.cream.finance/">C.R.E.A.M. Finance</a> recently. We are currently working on increasing OCEAN collateral factor on Cream Finance. Once done, OCEAN holders will be able to deposit their OCEAN and earn yields or can stake OCEAN as collateral and borrow against&nbsp;it.</p> Conclusion <p>Today, OCEAN holders can actively participate in theDeFi ecosystem by:</p>  Staking, lending, and/or borrowing to earn attractive yields;  Providing liquidity to earn swap fees and LP mining&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Rest assured that we are actively working on bringing more utilities to OCEAN. We sincerely thank you for being an important part of the Ocean Ecosystem and a proud OCEAN&nbsp;holder.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/where-to-stake-your-ocean-12faf60c93fa">Where to Stake your OCEAN</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hill">Richard Hill</a></p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated IT transformation in many ways. Lessons learned, among other things, is that IT software architecture must be highly flexible and scalable to handle the unforeseen tsunami waves of network traffic and flexible enough to address cyber-attacks in areas least expected or prepared, such as potential vulnerabilities in communication applications like Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Trello. Organization's sudden imperative to shore up cybersecurity systems such as Access Management became strikingly apparent.</p>
 Zero Trust 
<p>During the covid-19 pandemic, the in-office workforce abruptly shifted to a work-at-home environment opening the door to many potential attack vectors. Physicians, too, used their personal computers and mobile devices to help care for patients as they did in the medical office remotely through Telemedicine tools. Medical staff needed to authenticate and gain authorization to access patient information in locations outside their typical work areas to provide security while preserving privacy. Taking a zero-trust approach became even more relevant using a zero-trust principle to always verify the user identity before providing access to any resource. Identity assurance begins with Identity proofing and further uses fraud detection capabilities. This industry requirement became apparent in the 2020 KuppingerCole Access Management Leadership Compass, which saw an uptick in the number of Access Management products providing some level of identity proofing and fraud detection features or indicated that those capabilities are on its near-term roadmap.</p>
<p></p>
 Access Intelligence is Stepping Up to Play a Larger Role 
<p>Beyond core Access Management functionality such as authentication, authorization, federation, audit reporting, and even areas of API security, the use of analytics and access intelligence is increasing. Intelligence gives the ability to make access decisions that can be acted upon based on the patterns and trends found through data analytics and other machine learning techniques.&nbsp; Access intelligence can be used to discover new applications or API endpoints introduced to the network, identify potential access risks, make recommendations on security posture improvements, and reduce fraud, as some examples. The level of access intelligence seen in the market today is being driven by its usefulness and has become a significant differentiator between cybersecurity product vendors.</p>
 Automation 
<p>The automation of everyday Access Management tasks is becoming a priority for many organizations. Intelligence can drive automation to reduce the workload of IT security and administrative inefficiency and human error sometimes experienced through the manual completion of Access Management tasks. Organizations use automation with the intent of making their operations leaner and achieve lower TCO. Access Management automation can be applied to tasks such as the management of user access, applying roles, or automated discovery of applications and APIs on the network and then applying the applicable access and compliance policies.</p>
 So, Where Does Access Management Go from Here? 
<p>Although the Covid-19 pandemic has forced many organizations to make some unanticipated changes in their cybersecurity services, Access Management must still provide core functionality. Still, it can enhance its effectiveness by utilizing analytics, intelligence, and automation through more innovative Access Management products and services.</p>
<p>To better understand the challenges of Access Management in this pandemic era and how it continues to evolve to meet recent business environment changes, KuppingerCole invites you to join the German Cyber Access Summit 2021 to hear from the experts and inform yourself on how to make the best decision possible for your organization.</p>

 Kong Konnect and Okta Integration Topology 

<p>The Konnect control plane creates new APIs and policies and publishes them to the data plane running as a Docker container in an AWS EC2 instance.</p>

<p></p>

 Authorization Code Flow 

<p>The authorization code flow goes through the following steps:</p>

 
   First, a user tries to consume the API. 
   If the user doesn’t have a token injected, Kong redirects the user to Okta, the identity provider. 
   The user authenticates on Okta and is sent back to Kong with an authorization code token. 
   Kong validates the parameters and exchanges the authorization code token by calling Okta’s token endpoint. 
 

<p></p>

 Add Your Services and Routes to Konnect 

<p>In Konnect’s ServiceHub, I have a service created already. Follow along in our <a href="https://konghq.com/blog/getting-started-konnect">Getting Started with Konnect tutorial</a> to learn how to create a service and routes.</p>

<p>My service has two routes defined already. I used the first service in the previous Kong and Okta tutorial to show the client credentials flow. In this tutorial, I’ll use the second service to apply the OIDC plugin utilizing the authorization code flow.</p>

<p></p>

 Set Up the Okta Application 

<p>In Okta, I prepared an application to implement the authorization flow already. In the Kong authorization code application, we’re going to use the configured OIDC plugin in addition to the client ID and client secret.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The app has the authorization code option turned on and the signing redirect URI set with the route available in my data plane. That means the authorization code is accepted for this URI only.</p>

<p></p>

 Consume the Route Without a Policy 

<p>Any user is free to consume the route right now since there’s no policy to control it.</p>

<p></p>

 Apply the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Just like we did for the client credentials flow tutorial, let’s go back to the Konnect control plane to apply the OIDC plugin and then implement the authorization code flow.</p>

 
   
    <p>Set the Config.Client ID.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Enter the Config.Client Secret.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Add Okta’s Config.Issuer endpoint.</p>

    <p></p>
   
 

<p>Click Create to enable the OIDC plugin to the route.</p>

 Test the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>If we try to consume the route again, Kong redirects us to Okta’s user interface to present our credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once we have presented our correct credentials, Okta authenticates and redirects us back to the API gateway. At this time, we’ll consume the API because we got the identity token injected inside our request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then we go to <a href="http://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a> to check the token.</p>

 OceanDAO Roadmap Update — Mid-2021 <p>Towards Scaling Community Funding in&nbsp;OceanDAO</p><p>This article describes challenges identified in <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a>, and the chosen solutions which are being rolled out. Together, these solutions will help improve funding efficiency, scale OceanDAO, and build traction across the Ocean Ecosystem.</p> 1. Introduction to&nbsp;OceanDAO <p>OceanDAO is a community-curated grants DAO that funds community-proposed projects. OceanDAO is a key component of the Ocean system-level design, designed for near-term growth and long-term sustainability.</p><p>OceanDAO has two goals: maximize the amount funded, with the constraint that (on average) every project has positive return on investment (ROI). This in turn will help to drive the health of OCEAN and data consume volume — the main performance indicators of Ocean Protocol.</p><p>OceanDAO sub-components include: Funding Rounds where the protocol unlocks capital to fund community projects, Grant Categories that represent core organizational pillars, Fundamental Metrics that shape product development goals, and Voting on project proposals.The most important parts of OceanDAO are already decentralized and community driven: proposal of projects and curation of projects (voting). Over time we expect to decentralize the entire OceanDAO&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Not every project we fund will succeed; we actually expect many to fail. But some of those that succeed will achieve incredible performance, returning more in value than was originally granted. Funding these successful projects should in theory outperform all other initiatives and create a positive&nbsp;ROI.</p><p>Learning how to repeat success empowers the Ocean community to fund the right projects with confidence and impunity.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the status quo funding structure of OceanDAO and other Ocean community funding programs. Section 3 describes the challenges identified. Section 4 describes candidate tools to help address the challenges. Sections 5 and 6 describe the tools chosen, which collectively address the problems identified. Section 6 converts these into a plan for the near-term OceanDAO&nbsp;roadmap.</p> 2. Status Quo Funding Structure <p>For a more complete picture, let’s review the different funding structures within the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>OceanDAO was initially deployed with small(ish) fixed-size grants, and community-curated voting to fund projects to build, perform outreach, and add data in the Ocean Ecosystem.</p><p>The Shipyard funding program had slightly larger grants where the funding was curated by the Ocean core&nbsp;team.</p><p>Additionally, the Ocean Ambassadors represent a very engaged community of individuals in the Ocean ecosystem. This group creates content, runs interviews, moderates social channels, writes articles, organizes events, and provides support to OceanDAO.</p><p>OceanDAO has the ability to scale efficiently because projects are vetted and funded by the community. Basic tools like forums, Discourse, and more advanced Web3 tools like Snapshot have allowed the Proposal and Funding process to be fully managed by the&nbsp;crowd.</p><p>However, Shipyard processes were developed with numerous manual steps to coordinate with proposers, while centralizing the decision and funding process to an internal team at Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF). This process does not scale well as many processes exhibit 1:1 relationships where the internal team must spend a lot of cycles to support each project, instead of achieving 1:N outcomes.</p><p>Finally, OPF has contracts with several teams to improve core Ocean products — we call these Product Contracts. These contracts typically come with a public announcement, though they could benefit from further transparency.</p><p>The aim of this review and design process was to identify challenges in OceanDAO, Shipyard and related processes to identify possible solutions, tools, and scale the organization.</p> 3. Challenges Identified <p>Below is a list of challenges identified across OceanDAO and other funding structures. Challenges identified have been a result of documenting discussions, community feedback, and internal failures to achieve certain&nbsp;goals.</p><p>OceanDAO Challenges</p>  Quantifying ROI is hard. It’s hard to measure ROI in practice, which makes it hard for voters to judge projects that are coming back for repeat&nbsp;funding.  Fixed grant amounts. It’s harder to have positive ROI with this model as there are projects that will take larger grants more than they would have otherwise asked for, while others will be granted less than they&nbsp;need.  Low voter turn-out relative to number of token holders. Ideally more of the OCEAN in the system is being used to vote — it’s a sign of engagement and helps decentralization.  Sybil on voting and proposals. Multiple proposals are made by the same people who vote for themselves. This is a side effect of lower voter turn-out, and is worse they are large OCEAN holders (whales).  Quarterly targets for OCEAN funded are becoming harder to meet; low proposal turn-out is a contributor  Some people are in &gt;1 teams in a given funding round, it can appear like double-dipping, and it’s harder to quantify&nbsp;ROI  Some teams have &gt;1 proposals in a given funding round, it can appear like double-dipping and it’s harder to quantify&nbsp;ROI  Most proposals and grants have been for the “Build Apps” track. While we think building Ocean apps is great, there’s been less funding going to other tracks (Core sw, Developer Outreach, data, OceanDAO)  We don’t have a mechanism to bias funding towards a given track, or even a more specific sub-track (e.g. “Core Software — Documentation”)  Poor visibility into how much OCEAN went into each track or sub-track  OceanDAO Copy. Current descriptions on the website, wiki, etc. can be hard for new users to navigate. It does not provide sufficient objective, or quantifiable criteria.  <p>Shipyard Challenges with regards to&nbsp;OceanDAO</p>  Poor visibility into how funds are allocated in Shipyard vs OceanDAO; and specific tracks in&nbsp;Shipyard  Shipyard grant process and tooling is more manual, centralized, and does not scale&nbsp;well.  Shipyard tools and processes are not laid out very&nbsp;clearly.  Shipyard promises the time of Ocean core team members to grantees. This scales poorly and uses precious time from the core team (debatable whether time is well&nbsp;spent).  OceanDAO and Shipyard have overlapping processes and challenges, but both require tooling and core team time to perform well, and hit their respective goals.  Worry of double dipping: a single team can receive grants from both OceanDAO and Shipyard. Our policy is “each proposal must have different scope”, but in practice this is hard to track&nbsp;well.  Shipyard Copy. Current descriptions can be hard for new users to navigate. It does not provide sufficient objective, or quantifiable criteria.  Redirection. Shipyard applicants that got turned away got redirected to OceanDAO (good) but with little context, or were not redirected at&nbsp;all  <p>Ambassador Challenges with regards to&nbsp;OceanDAO</p>  Ambassador incentives and OceanDAO. The current integration between OceanDAO goals and Ambassadors make it hard to reward/incentivize ambassadors and contributors for specific activities.  Ambassadors are funded by Shipyard via manual process while OceanDAO can achieve the same in an autonomous manner.  Ambassadors can help drive bottom-up initiatives in OceanDAO and top-down initiatives from Shipyard. We can improve their integration and fund more efficiently by bringing them into OceanDAO.   4. Candidate Tools <p>Over the years, and especially the last few months, we’ve analyzed many DAO architectures, methodologies, and tooling. During the lifetime of OceanDAO we’ve also received many great suggestions from the community. Here is a list of ideas as “candidate tools”. Note that we have not committed to all of these ideas; they are merely listed as ideas, and will continue to be expanded in the future. In a later section we describe the ones that we are rolling out in the near&nbsp;term.</p><p>DAO Product</p>  One-Page OceaDAO website — (Update Landing Page ) — Consideration of Shipyard&nbsp;sunset.  Optimize OceanDAO funnel — Improve conversion, etc using many well-known tools, including removing friction in proposing grants, voting, receiving grants, and reporting progress  DAO v0.2 — Identify No+Low Code solutions that can establish good processes and workflows to scale the pipeline.  Proposal Submission Channels — Add more wallets that can create proposals / automate who can submit proposals to Snapshot.  Better ROI tracking — So that voters can see how each grantee is doing against their ROI. There are many possible things here: improved table, better measure of ROI metric, more. Continually make this better, improve data and ROI discovery. This will take real effort over time, but it’s critical to the long-term success of a grants&nbsp;program.  Vote Results Report — Granular voting will generate many proposals, we need to be able to easily communicate results.  Public DAO Roadmap — Increase transparency and intuition of long term objectives so grant propers, voters, and the community can make better decisions. That includes this blog post&nbsp;:)  <p>Efficient Processes</p>  Retire Shipyard — “Variable Funding’’ can fund large $OCEAN (community-curated), Product Contracts too (core-team-curated), therefore Shipyard is redundant (and keeping it has many problems, see “Shipyard-related Challenges” challenges above). &amp; OceanDAO might be able to leverage Shipyard’s quantifiable ROI+ methodologies, while Shipyard might be able to leverage OceanDAO’s scalable, and more decentralized proposal+vote+funding model (eg what is salvageable?). Migrate shipyard pipeline to&nbsp;DAO.  Fund ambassadors via OceanDAO — “Variable Funding” (see below) allows smaller $OCEAN and we can reduce manual processes.  Treasury via Request — Reduce friction for grantees, helps administration by OceanDAO core team until it becomes more decentralized  Product Contracts — Increase transparency of internal direction, efforts, and $OCEAN&nbsp;funded.  <p>Incentivizing Engagement</p>  Retroactive airdrops to voters in past OceanDAO rounds. (Note: this is an idea, it is not to be taken as a commitment.)  Airdrops to voters in future OceanDAO rounds. (Note: this is an idea, it is not to be taken as a commitment.)  Data Farming % boost weight for LPs who participated in the most recent Snapshot&nbsp;vote  Incorporate time incentive for *voters*, looking forward and/or backward in time. 1 year time frame. Eg vote weight is proportional to time staked forward, and time held backward, up to 1&nbsp;year.  <p>Incentivizing Volume &amp;&nbsp;Quality</p>  $OCEAN not granted is burned — This provides a stronger incentive to down-signal poor proposals, because it helps drive $OCEAN up (in line with Ocean token design). Eg Any project with e.g. &lt; 50% “+” votes will not be granted $OCEAN. In turn, this might encourage participation, as $OCEAN holders see the opportunity to signal more strongly on behalf of&nbsp;$OCEAN.  Align incentives for grant winners: bonus 25% of proposal is paid out 6 months — (Incentivizes project to grow value of $OCEAN).How: use streaming money protocol like Sablier or Superfluid.  <p>Voting Mechanisms</p>  Vote per proposal (Granular Voting) — Voters can vote +/- for each proposal, vs status quo of voters voting + for one of n proposals). Allows voters ability to vote &gt;1 proposal.  Quadratic voting — (1) get fixed amount of votes = # OCEAN tokens. (2) can allocate these votes among the n proposals. Vote weight on a proposal = sqrt(# votes allocated to the proposal). Requires “Vote per proposal”  <p>Funding Mechanisms</p>  Earmark min $OCEAN funding for each track or specific goal — Tracks: {Core dev, app dev, outreach, data, OceanDAO}, or more specific “data” → “climate data” and “core dev” → “documentation”. Emphasize some tracks/goals more than others by different min $OCEAN&nbsp;amounts.  Requested $OCEAN can vary (Variable Funding) among proposals, to allow for small proposals ($1K ish) and large ones ($100K ish). Capped or uncapped rounds? Maybe: no team can request &gt; ⅓ of a given round’s&nbsp;total  1–2–3 Combo — Combine Vote per proposal + $OCEAN proposed can vary + $OCEAN not granted is burned. (These play well together)  Round Funding Cap — Fund Scarcity [set = 65%] By limiting the total amount of funds available to be dispersed per round/track, incentivizes participants to be choosier with how they allocate available resources.  Continuous funding — Shift voting and grant incentives to be more long-term oriented. One example implementation is conviction voting like in Giveth or Commons&nbsp;Stack.  <p>Funding Brains</p>  One-team rule. In a given funding round, a given person may only be part of a team of one funding proposal. If broken, all teams with that person are disqualified.  One-proposal rule. In a given funding round, a given team may only make one funding proposal. If broken, the team is disqualified.  <p>Growth</p>  More OCEAN to teams if voter turnout grows. Bonus +x% funding (beyond the baseline pot) to all teams in a given funding round, if the amount of OCEAN voted grows by x% compared to previous round. Note: must be by OCEAN voted, not number# wallets, because the latter can be Sybil attacked.  New Team Grants. Introduce earmarking for new teams who have never been funded before. This combines well with “$OCEAN burn”, as the community is incentivized to register new quality projects to avoid tokens being destroyed.   5. Towards Solving: Updated Funding Structure <p>To understand where we are, and where we are going, we began by deconstructing our processes, paying attention to the different funding structures that were in place, and how to resolve their immediate challenges.</p><p>OceanDAO has scaled well via decentralized community-driven proposals, and decentralized community-driven voting to curate proposals. Due to this success, it became obvious that OceanDAO should get scaled out more while applying adjustments to improve target outcomes.</p><p>Implementing Variable Funding allows OceanDAO to allocate small grants around ~$1k, up to much larger grants of $100k. This means that OceanDAO can help teams at various stages of maturity: incubate -&gt; accelerate -&gt; scale. This means we can fold Shipyard activities into OceanDAO, as well as Ambassador funding.</p><p>Another key challenge identified is the need to increase confidence in funding projects that are ROI+. We believe that when participants can vote intuitively and fund projects effectively, that we will have begun solving the&nbsp;problem.</p> 6. Towards Solving: Matching Challenges with&nbsp;Tools <p>Increasing intuition and funding confidence</p><p>Quantifying ROI is difficult. We have to simplify complex projects into an intuitive decision-making process, to facilitate voting and capital allocation decisions. This challenge is twofold as project Proposers need to be aligned with Ocean’s goals, while providing voters with the needed information to cast their votes on projects that can deliver on their promise. In order to synthesize these parameters into intuition, we have to agree on a common methodology that captures the unique goals and Product-Market-Fit risks of each&nbsp;project.</p><p>Improving our website, copy, UX, and reducing the complexity for users to engage with the decision-making process is a good first step. We can call this a top-down solution. We can then call product-market-fit, traction, ability to deliver, and efficient use of funds a bottom-up solution.</p><p>The best way to visualize both of these challenges is with a funnel. On the top of the funnel we can improve the UX to reduce complexity and improve the onboarding process. On the bottom of the funnel, we can improve how projects signal progress to the DAO, in order to report their ROI and continue investing in&nbsp;success.</p><p>By integrating mechanisms that align projects towards OceanDAO goals and Ocean high-level goals, we can increase confidence that all processes are aligned towards the greater goals, and so, invest with impunity.</p><p>One Team One&nbsp;Proposal</p><p>Some teams began working on multiple projects in a given Funding Round, while some team members became spread across multiple projects. This becomes increasingly difficult to resolve as we still experience coordination challenges.</p><p>By introducing a One Team One Proposal rule, we can more easily ensure each participant is taken care of, until we have better systems in place that can support wider decentralization efforts.</p> Eliminating funding&nbsp;barriers <p>OceanDAO biased to incubating early-stage projects with fixed grant amounts while Shipyard biased to larger grants. We can fold both into OceanDAO via two mechanisms: Variable Funding and Grant&nbsp;Ceiling.</p><p>OceanDAO had a fixed Grant amount. This forced projects to fit into a particular box. Yet not all projects are the same size. Introducing Variable Funding allows Proposers to request a grant that meets their unique needs. This improves capital efficiency. Smaller projects can now be funded more easily, while bigger projects can receive the capital needed to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>By increasing the Grant Ceiling, OceanDAO would be equipped to solve the goal of both grant programs. Proposers and Voters can now be more “penny foolish and pound wise”, more easily onboarding smaller initiatives, while focusing their efforts on the projects that have a track record, can take on the risk, and are ready to deliver big outcomes.</p><p>Ultimately both mechanisms shift the responsibility to the community to identify strong project proposers and desirable proposals, while maintaining decentralized decision&nbsp;making.</p> Decentralizing processes and reducing&nbsp;overhead <p>In OceanDAO, project proposers are vetted and funded by the community. In Shipyard, processes required more manual coordination with proposers, while centralizing the decision and funding process to the core Ocean&nbsp;team.</p><p>By providing channels for project proposers to share their proposal in OceanDAO, the community can review projects and collaborate. Web3 tooling such as Snapshot allows all participants to vote and curate which projects receive funding. Applying “DAO Tooling” to this decision-making process, shifts the overhead from the core Ocean team, to the&nbsp;crowd.</p><p>We can move these systems closer to our greater goals of decentralization by doubling down on proven processes that remove overhead, provide transparency, and shift decisions to the crowd. Retiring Shipyard then becomes an obvious, net positive decision.</p> Distributing funds across all initiatives <p>OceanDAO experienced an increasing number of teams proposing projects. This is great! Most projects were of similar flavor: “Build and Integrate”, a fundamental pillar of growth in the Ocean Ecosystem. However, we have five vectors to invest and grow including: Core Software, Unleash Data, DAO Engineering, and Outreach. Another unforeseen problem is that new teams encountered a large amount of friction, as early adopters were favored and received the majority of&nbsp;votes.</p><p>To remedy this situation, an Earmarking mechanism to signal and fund more balanced initiatives in the DAO was introduced. This has allowed OceanDAO to increase the number of Outreach projects, and New Entrants building inside OceanDAO. Both decisions represent a need for the DAO to grow its Top-of-the-Funnel metric: “Total Proposals per Funding&nbsp;Round”.</p><p>This Earmarking mechanism has a theoretical basis with roots in the Genetic Programming (GP) literature. The goal there is “diversity maintenance” so that the GP search doesn’t get stuck in local minima while being more efficient than fully-random sampling. One powerful technique is “Age-Layered Population Structure” (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a971/bb2c2cee841702b033cd01bc79f8e35b7893.pdf">ALPS</a>) with the following mental model: kindergartners compete against only the kindergartners, grade 1s against grade 1s, and so on. And, smart kids can skip grades. So, the new “less fit” kindergartners aren’t competing against grade 12s (and losing). We’ve discovered this to work extremely well <a href="http://trent.st/mojito/">in practice</a>. This can translate to a blockchain setting, such as with <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-layered-tcr-56cc5b4cdc45">The Layered TCR</a>. A super-simple version is to have just two layers: the youngest, and the rest. That’s exactly what we are doing here for OceanDAO: the youngest (0 grants received) only have to compete against the youngest.</p> 7. OceanDAO&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Below is the roadmap and schedule to integrate updates. Some of the roadmap has already been rolled out in Round 5 (May 2021) and Round 6 (June) while the remaining will be implemented in Round 7 (July) and Round 8 (August). We may modify it further as we get feedback, identify new challenges, and make progress.</p><p>Round 5 — May&nbsp;2021</p><p>Optimize DAO&nbsp;Funnel</p>  Improve messaging to address Granular Voting&nbsp;nuances  <p>Vote per proposal (Granular Voting)</p>  Each grant request gets its own&nbsp;snapshot  65% of projects funded up to a goal of&nbsp;15  <p>Earmarked OCEAN</p>  3 grants earmarked for developer outreach  What happens if there aren’t enough proposals?

Conclusion &amp; Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>OceanDAO is a young DAO, established by a community of experienced builders who want to seed the future of decentralized data markets. There are many processes and groups involved in the success of the DAO, and we have to be methodical when considering how to tackle these challenges.</p><p>By formalizing challenges, deconstructing problems, and proposing a roadmap, we can begin exploring the problem-solution space and tooling that can help address each problem. Establishing better transparency and improving coordination can increase cadence, and speed up the flywheel.</p><p>One way to look at the grants DAO, is to think of it like a funnel. With the top segment representing proposals, and the bottom representing effective funding towards ROI+ projects. We can observe any part of the funnel and break it down to identify mechanisms, challenges, and solutions.</p><p>Web3 and DAO tooling is increasing in numbers every month, but there is no catch-all that solves our challenges. There are mechanisms not available in current tooling, and we need to consider alternative solutions. An example is choosing Y/N votes per proposal similarly to DASH, which has served as a good model for many years. Downvoting is a desirable feature to test with inside the DAO, but does not work well in Snapshot based on our requirements. Identifying the challenges that are mission critical, and focusing on delivering solutions against these problems, allows us to maintain velocity.</p><p>Voting is a core system that deserves special attention as it’s a well known attack vector. To continue building together at scale, we have to start addressing potential risks. More so, in order to implement many incentive mechanisms we have to resolve the challenge of Sybil tolerance. Quadratic Voting is an elegant solution to many of these challenges, and so, we have begun efforts to move this&nbsp;forward.</p><p>To distribute funds effectively, we have to implement processes that scale coordination efforts between OPF, proposers, voters, and the community at large. Sunsetting Shipyard also allows OceanDAO to increase the funding ceiling. The introduction of solutions like Variable Funding, serve to provide support for both small projects, and professional teams&nbsp;alike.</p><p>Finally, everyone benefits from rewarding those that help grow OceanDAO. Introducing incentive mechanisms for voters and proposers, artificially grows engagement at the top of the DAO funnel. Helping both teams that are building great projects, and voters who are facilitating important decision-making. Similarly, by rewarding project proposers who are bringing in new participants, and earmarking funds to New Entrants to build in the DAO, we can optimize the DAO funnel, mechanically reduce friction, and increase efficiency for all contributors growing the ecosystem.</p><p>By laying down the goals, challenges, tools, and considerations being paid to the overall development of OceanDAO, a roadmap can be formulated, and more transparency can be provided. Our goal is to onboard the community with the outcomes and challenges we are facing, to establish a platform where we can identify new opportunities for collaboration, and to continue improving the DAO for all contributors embarking on this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>…</p><p>This blog was written in consideration of all staff, teams, and community members, whose commitment and feedback allows OceanDAO to continue improving.

 Ontology at Consensus 2021: Why Digital Identity Systems Must Be Decentralized In Order To Bring About A New Era In Data&nbsp;Privacy  Last week Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, took part in a fireside chat at Consensus 2021. <p>It’s that time of year again; the blockchain industry’s flagship event kicked off in style last week and the Ontology team was out in force. Getting things under way on the first day, our Founder, Li Jun, was honoured to hold a fireside chat on “Why Digital Identity Systems Must Be Decentralized In Order To Bring About A New Era In Data Privacy”. The insightful discussion touched on the blockchain and crypto industry, as well as honing in on Ontology’s core offering, including our DID solutions, OScore, and Wing&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>If you didn’t manage to catch Li Jun’s chat, we’ve got you covered! Below is a recap of some of the highlights.</p><p>The Future Of Decentralized Identity Will Put Personal Data In The User’s&nbsp;Control</p><p>Digital identity is not just a passport or an identity card; it has multiple elements, and it is the cornerstone of our offering. Your digital identity can include anything from your ethnic background or your work experience, to your interests and habits, or your favorite places to shop. Ontology’s decentralized identity offering allows you, the user, to control your personal data without a single centralized service maintaining it. For instance, if you wanted to prove your identity to a third party but the only actual information they needed to verify was your nationality, you could share this one piece of data with the third party while keeping your name, date of birth, home address, and any other relevant data points,&nbsp;private.</p><p>Currently, centralized services do not provide this option for individuals. Such identity protocols are flawed because they rely on trust between three parties. For instance, the identity issuers, who are the trusted parties that attest to their validity, the holders, to whom the credentials are issued, and the verifiers, who are responsible for authenticating that the identification is correct. This leaves parties open to human error and duplicitous misuse of data access. While data breaches are gaining in prevalence across the world, this archaic process can only stand to negatively impact the future of digital identity. Luckily, blockchain has provided us with the solution, and we at Ontology are aiming to give the control of data back to the data owners in the form of a cohesive, decentralized identity.</p><p>Decentralized Identity And Data Both Need More Adoption To&nbsp;Mature</p><p>There is an inextricable link between decentralized identity and decentralized data; decentralized identity is more like a connector or an index, which maps the user to each different source of decentralized data. Decentralized data applies to everything, as each piece of data will eventually link back to an end user or identity. The two protocols are similar and work in tandem, and have been applied to complex decentralized corporations and organizations. The greater the interplay between these two protocols grows, the more likely they will be used in different countries and by governments. With greater adoption comes greater maturation, larger data infrastructures, and finer data ecosystems.</p><p>The Blockchain Industry Has Not Focused On Decentralized Data Or Identity Heavily; That Is About To&nbsp;Change</p><p>The blockchain industry is still in its early stages, and currently, the focus remains predominantly on digital assets and market movement. Little over four years ago when we were planning the launch of the public Ontology blockchain, we never expected there to be as much interest in this space as there currently is. People’s concept of identity is rapidly changing as trust in centralized data storage erodes and we expect this to continue in the coming years. Data is perceived as an asset and it can bring real profits for organizations and Big Tech companies such as Facebook and Google. Here, the individual has access to their data yet they do not own it as it is stored on a centralized platform. While individuals can access their data, they can only store said data on these centralized databases themselves; a user cannot move their data off of Facebook to store in another place. Blockchain technology and decentralized data solves for this, as they bring the tools directly to the individual, rather than through a centralized server. In doing this, blockchain will give sovereignty to users. By using Ontology’s solutions, the individual owns the data and can authenticate a third party to access said data, positioning Ontology’s solution at the fore of this revolution.</p><p>Ontology Will Invert Users’ Relationships With Their Data, Placing Them In&nbsp;Control</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions provide integrity and authenticity in data security. It gives control of personal data back to individuals in the form of a digital identity. As our identity begins to grow and evolve over time, our digital footprint becomes greater and the amount of data points identifying us grows, increasing the risk of manipulation. Inverting the existing relationship users have with data and placing the control in their hands is an imperative for us at Ontology. We strongly believe that these decentralized identity and decentralized data frameworks are the way of the future. By doing this, we also leave open plenty of possibilities: you could be the co-owner of your data with a centralized party, which does not mean you must move your data to that centralized server, you can still put your data into one or multiple centralized storage services. The difference here is that you control the data: you can authenticate the data to another third partner service, be it a financial institution or an insurance company, meaning your data is under your&nbsp;control.</p><p>Our identity continues to grow and evolve in complexity, making it more scattered among different centralized systems. With a decentralized identity like ONT ID, users can rest easy knowing that their data will only be stored where they want it to be stored, or shared with whomever they want to share it with; rather than being sold to third parties to advance a companies’ advertising goals. Users allow access to the specific data they want to share and decide whom they wish to share it with. The future of data is decentralized, and we are more committed than ever to be pioneering this effort to bring about a new era of data&nbsp;privacy.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

The release of this new version will help satisfy users’ high-frequency trading&nbsp;needs.  Ontology’s Chief Scientist, Kendall Mao was invited to the IEEE Computer Society Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Standards Committee Plenary &amp; P3200S WG Meeting, where he discussed how to accelerate the development of core standards for blockchain and build a global blockchain ecosystem with more than 70 representatives from 55&nbsp;units.    It was a great month for media coverage. Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was featured in Forbes, CoinDesk, and Forkast News, sharing his thoughts on the future of the DeFi industry and how Ontology and SAGA are creating a regulatory framework for decentralization.  Li Jun also published an article in Nasdaq titled, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-solution-to-the-internets-data-hoarding-problem-2021-05-05">“The Solution to the Internet’s Data Hoarding Problem”</a>. The article delves into the idea that SSI solutions can help users share data while protecting their&nbsp;privacy.  Ning Hu, CTO of Ontology, published a paper titled “<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article/doi/10.1162/dint_a_00095/101024/OpenKG-Chain-A-Blockchain-Infrastructure-for-Open">OpenKG Chain: A Blockchain Infrastructure for Open Knowledge Graphs</a>”, exploring blockchain-based open knowledge infrastructure.  Crypto Briefing recently released a guide for decentralized identity. ONT ID is listed in the guide as one of the top three decentralized identity solutions since ONT ID has practical applications and could be used on multiple blockchains.  Ontology’s 14-day chain statistics report for April and May has been published. From April 25 to May 8, the number of transactions on the Ontology chain, the number of active addresses, the total number of addresses, and the ONT ID data all showed an overall growth trend. This reflects a tremendous increase in new and existing users of self-sovereign decentralized digital identities.

			<p>Il report è molto utile per classificare i diversi fornitori a seconda delle specifiche capacità e livelli di servizio offerti. È un’ottima fonte dalla quale si possono analizzare gli ultimi Use Case in ambito B2B, B2C e B2E e dà inoltre una vista puntuale sui più recenti requisiti necessari in ambito “Assurance” (ossia del rispetto degli standard di garanzia così come indicato nelle diverse normative europee di riferimento) come in quello tecnologico, aspetti nei quali un’azienda dovrebbe porre particolare attenzione qualora volesse intraprendere un percorso di Trasformazione Digitale.</p>
<p>Il segmento “Full-service, enterprise electronic and digital signature platform”, all’interno del quale InfoCert è stata riconosciuta fra i leader del settore, è quello che raggruppa i Provider che riescono ad adattarsi meglio ad ogni esigenza del cliente, secondo Gartner infatti, questi Provider possono supportare sia firme elettroniche semplici che quelle avanzate e qualificate, nelle loro soluzioni Enterprise possono venire integrati processi specifici per settore industriale, possono offrire soluzioni “out-of-the-box”, integrabili a piattaforme e software terze parti come Documentali, HCMs, CRMs e CLMs. Infine, supportano anche tool di integrazione API, di Identity verification e knowledge-base verification.</p>
<p>Il report prosegue analizzando le altre due categorie di fornitore che sono: “Stand-alone, workflow-focused, click-to-sign electronic signature platoform” e gli “Enterprise digital signature provider”.</p>
<p>Il team di analisti che ha curato la stesura del report, focalizza la sua attenzione sul fatto che il cliente debba poter accedere a servizi che si adeguino alle proprie esigenze, alle aree geografiche di proprio interesse (caratterizzate spesso da esigenze normative diverse) e al caso d’uso che prende come riferimento. Per questo motivo è essenziale che esso venga messo in grado di poter scegliere il fornitore che soddisfi al meglio i criteri di funzionalità e compliance durante tutte le fasi del processo in questione.</p>
<p>GoSign, la soluzione di firma di InfoCert, è ormai un punto di riferimento sul mercato grazie alla sua versatilità. La possibilità di firmare su qualsiasi dispositivo, di utilizzare diverse tipologie di firma e di personalizzare la soluzione con processi verticali, consente alle aziende di velocizzare i processi approvativi e quelli di firma verso clienti e fornitori.</p>

<p>When your business or application is successful, it needs to scale. Not just technology-wise, but human-wise. When you’re growing rapidly, it can be difficult to hire developers fast enough. Using a microservices architecture for your apps can allow you to divide up ownership and responsibilities, and scale teams along with your code.</p>
 
 
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes traces its lineage <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/04/borg-predecessor-to-kubernetes/">directly from Borg</a>, Google’s long-rumored internal container-oriented cluster-management system.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot and Spring Cloud were some of the pioneering frameworks in Javaland. However, even they stood on the shoulders of giants when they leveraged Netflix’s open-source projects to embrace and extend. In 2018, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-oss-and-spring-boot-coming-full-circle-4855947713a0">Netflix OSS announced they’d come full circle</a>, and adopted Spring Boot.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’d like to show you how to build and deploy (with Kubernetes) a reactive microservice architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and JHipster. Why reactive? Because Spring Cloud Gateway is now the default for JHipster 7 gateways, even if you choose to build your microservices with Spring MVC.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Spring Cloud Gateway is a library for building an API Gateway on top of Spring WebFlux. It easily integrates with OAuth to communicate between microservices. You just need to add a <code>TokenRelay</code> filter.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      default-filters:
        - TokenRelay</code> 
 
 
 






Spring Cloud no longer supports Netflix Zuul. An <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/issues/36">open issue</a> adds Spring MVC/Servlet support to Spring Cloud Gateway. It’s scheduled for implementation before the end of 2021.

 A Brief Intro to Kubernetes (K8s) 
 
 
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source project from Google that provides an API for deploying your apps and making them talk with each other. It helps automate deployments and updates, and manages your apps and services with limited downtime. You use Docker containers and YAML to make it all work.</p>
 
 
<p>The YAML can be burdensome, but that’s where JHipster comes in. It can generate the YAML for you!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Kubernetes-Ready Microservices Architecture 
 
 
<p>I showed you how to build <a>Reactive Java microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> in a previous post. Today, I’ll show you how to generate K8s deployment descriptors, use Spring Cloud Config with Git, encrypt your secrets, and make it all work on Google Cloud (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/">GKE</a> to be specific).</p>
 
 
<p>Start by cloning the JHipster 7 { Vue, Spring Boot, WebFlux } reactive microservices project from GitHub:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>If you just want to see the completed project, just cd into the project’s <code>jhipster-k8s</code> directory.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../jhipster-k8s</code> 
 
 



 
 
<p>This project has four directories:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>gateway</code>: a Spring Boot + Spring Cloud Gateway project configured for OpenID Connect (OIDC) login. It’s also configured as an OAuth 2.0 resource server. It contains a front-end application built with Vue.</p>
 
 
<p><code>blog</code>: a Spring Boot + WebFlux microservice that talks to a Neo4j database.</p>
 
 
<p><code>store</code>: a Spring Boot + WebFlux microservice that uses MongoDB.</p>
 
 
<p><code>docker-compose</code>: a set of Docker files that describe how to run all containers together.</p>
 
 
 
 






The SPA app on the gateway is currently a monolith. The JHipster team is still working on <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10189">micro frontends support</a>.



 
 
<p>If you don’t have JHipster installed, install it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@7</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Generate Kubernetes Deployment Descriptors 
 
 
<p>Navigate to the <code>reactive-jhipster</code> directory. Next, create a <code>k8s</code> directory, cd into it, and run JHipster’s <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/kubernetes/">Kubernetes sub-generator</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir k8s
cd k8s
jhipster k8s</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll be prompted with several questions. Answer them as I did below:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Type of application: Microservice application</p>
 
 
<p>Root directory: ../</p>
 
 
<p>Which applications? &lt;select all&gt;</p>
 
 
<p>Set up monitoring? No</p>
 
 
<p>Which applications with clustered databases? select store</p>
 
 
<p>Admin password for JHipster Registry: &lt;generate one&gt;</p>
 
 
<p>Kubernetes namespace: demo</p>
 
 
<p>Docker repository name: &lt;your docker hub username&gt;</p>
 
 
<p>Command to push Docker image: <code>docker push</code></p>
 
 
<p>Enable Istio? No</p>
 
 
<p>Kubernetes service type? LoadBalancer</p>
 
 
<p>Use dynamic storage provisioning? Yes</p>
 
 
<p>Use a specific storage class? &lt;leave empty&gt;</p>
 
 
 
 






If you don’t want to publish your images on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, leave the Docker repository name blank.



 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>After I answered these questions, my <code>k8s/.yo-rc.json</code> file had the following contents:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "generator-jhipster": {
    "appsFolders": ["blog", "gateway", "store"],
    "directoryPath": "../",
    "clusteredDbApps": ["store"],
    "serviceDiscoveryType": "eureka",
    "jwtSecretKey": "NDFhMGY4NjF...",
    "dockerRepositoryName": "mraible",
    "dockerPushCommand": "docker push",
    "kubernetesNamespace": "demo",
    "kubernetesServiceType": "LoadBalancer",
    "kubernetesUseDynamicStorage": true,
    "kubernetesStorageClassName": "",
    "ingressDomain": "",
    "monitoring": "no",
    "istio": false
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I already showed you how to get everything working with Docker Compose <a> in the previous tutorial</a>. So today, I’d like to show you how to run things locally with <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">Minikube</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Install Minikube to Run Kubernetes Locally 
 
 
<p>If you have Docker installed, you can run Kubernetes locally with Minikube. Run <code>minikube start</code> to begin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>minikube --cpus 8 start</code> 
 
 
 






If this doesn’t work, use <code>brew install minikube</code>, or see <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/">Minikube’s installation instructions</a>.



 
 
<p>This command will start Minikube with 16 GB of RAM and 8 CPUs. Unfortunately, the default, which is 16 GB RAM and two CPUs, did not work for me.</p>
 
 
<p>You can skip ahead to creating your Docker images while you wait for this to complete.</p>
 
 
<p>After this command executes, it’ll print out a message and notify you which cluster and namespace are being used.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default</code> 
 
 
 






You can stop Minikube with <code>minikube stop</code> and start over with <code>minikube delete</code>.



 
 
 
 
 Create Docker Images with Jib 
 
 
<p>Now, you need to build Docker images for each app. In the {<code>gateway</code>, <code>blog</code>, <code>store</code> } directories, run the following Gradle command (where <code>&lt;image-name&gt;</code> is <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, or <code>blog</code>).</p>
 
 
<p>This command should also be in the window where you ran <code>jhipster k8s</code>, so you can copy them from there.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-repo-name&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create Private Docker Images 
 
<p>You can also build your images locally and publish them to your Docker daemon. This is the default if you didn’t specify a base Docker repository name.</p>
 
 
 
 <code># this command exposes Docker images to minikube
eval $(minikube docker-env)
./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Because this publishes your images locally to Docker, you’ll need to make modifications to your Kubernetes deployment files to use <code>imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: gateway-app
  image: gateway
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Make sure to add this <code>imagePullPolicy</code> to the following files:</p>

 Register an OIDC App for Auth 
 
 
<p>You’ve now built Docker images for your microservices, but you haven’t seen them running. First, you’ll need to configure Okta for authentication and authorization.</p>
 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>JHipster ships with <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a>. It acts as a Eureka service for service discovery and contains a Spring Cloud Config server for distributing your configuration settings.</p>
 
 
<p>Update <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code> to contain your OIDC settings from the <code>.okta.env</code> file the Okta CLI just created. The Spring Cloud Config server reads from this file and shares the values with the gateway and microservices.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To configure the JHipster Registry to use OIDC for authentication, modify <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> to enable the <code>oauth2</code> profile.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now that you’ve configured everything, it’s time to see it in action.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Start Your Spring Boot Microservices with K8s 
 
 
<p>In the <code>k8s</code> directory, start your engines!</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can see if everything starts up using the following command.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl get pods -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use the name of a pod with <code>kubectl logs</code> to tail its logs.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt; --tail=-1 -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use port-forwarding to see the JHipster Registry.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8761</code>. You’ll need to sign in with your Okta credentials.</p>
 
 
<p>Once all is green, use port-forwarding to see the gateway app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and you should be able to add blogs, posts, tags, and products.</p>
 
 
<p>You can also automate testing to ensure that everything works. Set your Okta credentials as environment variables and run end-to-end tests using Cypress (from the gateway directory).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME=&lt;your-username&gt;
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD=&lt;your-password&gt;
npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Proof it worked for me:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 Plain Text Secrets? Uggh! 
 
<p>You may notice that I used a secret in plain text in the <code>application-configmap.yml</code> file. Secrets in plain text are a bad practice! I hope you didn’t check everything into source control yet!!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Encrypt Your Secrets with Spring Cloud Config 
 
 
<p>The JHipster Registry has an encryption mechanism you can use to encrypt your secrets. That way, it’s safe to store them in public repositories.</p>
 
 
<p>Add an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> to the environment variables in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  value: really-long-string-of-random-charters-that-you-can-keep-safe</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>You can use JShell to generate a UUID you can use for your encrypt key.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jshell

UUID.randomUUID()</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can quit by typing <code>/exit</code>.</p>
 



 
 
<p>Restart your JHipster Registry containers from the <code>k8s</code> directory.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
 Encrypt Your OIDC Client Secret 
 
<p>You can encrypt your client secret by logging into <code><a href="http://localhost:8761">http://localhost:8761</a></code> and going to Configuration &gt; Encryption. If this address doesn’t resolve, you’ll need to port-forward again.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy and paste your client secret from <code>application-configmap.yml</code> (or <code>.okta.env</code>) and click Encrypt.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Then, copy the encrypted value back into <code>application-configmap.yml</code>. Make sure to wrap it in quotes!</p>
 
 
<p>You can also use curl:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl -X POST http://admin:&lt;password-you-set-earlier&gt;@localhost:8761/config/encrypt -d your-client-secret</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you use curl, make sure to add <code>{cipher}</code> to the beginning of the string. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>client-secret: "{cipher}1b12934716c32d360c85f651a0793df2777090c..."</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Apply these changes and restart all deployments.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
kubectl rollout restart deploy -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Verify everything still works at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>
 
 






If you don’t want to restart the Spring Cloud Config server when you update its configuration, see <a>Refresh the Configuration in Your Spring Cloud Config Server</a>.



 
 
 
 Change Spring Cloud Config to use Git 
 
<p>You might want to store your app’s configuration externally. That way, you don’t have to redeploy everything to change values. Good news! Spring Cloud Config makes it easy to switch to Git instead of the filesystem to store your configuration.</p>
 
 
<p>In <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, find the following variables:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_0_TYPE
  value: native
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_0_SEARCH_LOCATIONS
  value: file:./central-config</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Below these values, add a second lookup location.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_TYPE
  value: git
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_URI
  value: https://github.com/mraible/reactive-java-ms-config/
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_SEARCH_PATHS
  value: config
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_LABEL
  value: main</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a GitHub repo that matches the URI, path, and branch you entered.</p>
 
 
<p>In my case, I created <a href="https://github.com/mraible/reactive-java-ms-config/">reactive-java-ms-config</a> and added a <code>config/application.yml</code> file in the <code>main</code> branch. Then, I added my <code>spring.security.*</code> values to it and removed them from <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>See Spring Cloud Config’s <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/multi/multi__spring_cloud_config_server.html#_git_backend">Git Backend docs</a> for more information.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Deploy Spring Boot Microservices to Google Cloud (aka GCP) 
 
 
<p>It’s nice to see things running locally on your machine, but it’s even better to get to production! In this section, I’ll show you how to deploy your containers to Google Cloud.</p>
 
 
<p>First, stop Minikube if you were running it previously.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>minikube stop</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can also use <code>kubectl</code> commands to switch clusters.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context XXX</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The cool kids use <code>kubectx</code> and <code>kubens</code> to set the default context and namespace. You can learn how to install and use them via the <a href="https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx">kubectx GitHub project</a>.</p>
 
 
 Create a Container Registry on Google Cloud 
 
<p>Before the JHipster 7.0.0 release, I tested this microservice example with Kubernetes and Google Cloud. I found many solutions in Ray Tsang’s <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/">Spring Boot on GCP Guides</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1372964263237718026">Thanks, Ray</a>!</p>
 
 
<p>To start with Google Cloud, you’ll need an account and a project. <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/getting-started/google-cloud-platform">Sign up for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a>, log in, and create a project. Open a <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">console</a> in your browser. A GCP project contains all cloud services and resources—​such as virtual machines, network, load balancers—​that you might use.</p>
 
 






You can also download and install the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/"><code>gcloud</code> CLI</a> if you want to run things locally.



 
 
<p>Enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API and Container Registry:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com containerregistry.googleapis.com</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Kubernetes Cluster 
 
<p>Run the following command to create a cluster for your apps.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--zone us-central1-a \
--machine-type n1-standard-4 \
--enable-autorepair \
--enable-autoupgrade</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I called my cluster <code>reactive-ms</code>. See GCP’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/">zones</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types/">machine-types</a> for other options. I found the <code>n1-standard-4</code> to be the minimum for JHipster.</p>
 
 
<p>You created Docker images earlier to run with Minikube. Then, those images were deployed to Docker Hub or your local Docker registry. If you deployed to Docker Hub, you can use your deployment files as-is.</p>
 
 
<p>For Google Cloud and its Kubernetes engine (GKE), you can also publish your images to your project’s registry. Thankfully, this is easy to do with Jib.</p>
 
 
<p>Navigate to the <code>gateway</code> directory and run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/gateway</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can get your project ID by running <code>gcloud projects list</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Repeat the process for <code>blog</code> and <code>store</code>. You can run these processes in parallel to speed things up.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../blog
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/blog
cd ../store
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/store</code> 
 
 
 






You might have to run <code>gcloud auth configure-docker</code> for Jib to publish to your GCP container registry.



 
 
<p>Then, in your <code>k8s/*/-deployment.yml</code> files, add <code>gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;</code> as a prefix. Remove the <code>imagePullPolicy</code> if you specified it earlier. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>containers:
  - name: gateway-app
    image: gcr.io/jhipster7/gateway
    env:</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In the <code>k8s</code> directory, apply all the deployment descriptors to run all your images.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can monitor the progress of your deployments with <code>kubectl get pods -n demo</code>.</p>
 
 






 
<p>If you make a mistake configuring JHipster Registry and need to deploy it, you can do so with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml -n demo
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/jhipster-registry -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to restart all your deployments if you changed any configuration settings that services need to retrieve.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl rollout restart deploy -n demo</code> 
 
 



 
 
 
 Access Your Gateway on Google Cloud 
 
<p>Once everything is up and running, get the external IP of your gateway.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl get svc gateway -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to add the external IP address as a valid redirect to your Okta OIDC app. Run <code>okta login</code>, open the returned URL in your browser, and sign in to the Okta Admin Console. Go to the Applications section, find your application, and edit it.</p>
 
 
<p>Add the standard JHipster redirect URIs using the IP address. For example, <code>http://34.71.48.244:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> for the login redirect URI, and <code>http://34.71.48.244:8080</code> for the logout redirect URI.</p>
 
 
<p>You can use the following command to set your gateway’s IP address as a variable you can curl.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get svc gateway -n demo -ojsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
curl $EXTERNAL_IP:8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run <code>open http://$EXTERNAL_IP:8080</code>, and you should be able to sign in.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Great! Now that you know things work, let’s integrate better security, starting with HTTPS.</p>
 
 
 
 Add HTTPS to Your Reactive Gateway 
 
<p>You should always use HTTPS. It’s one of the easiest ways to secure things, especially with the free certificates offered these days. Ray Tsang’s <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/deployment/kubernetes/load-balancing/external-load-balancing">External Load Balancing docs</a> was a big help in figuring out all these steps.</p>
 
 
<p>You’ll need a static IP to assign your TLS (the official name for HTTPS) certificate.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud compute addresses create gateway-ingress-ip --global</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can run the following command to make sure it worked.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud compute addresses describe gateway-ingress-ip --global --format='value(address)'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create a <code>k8s/ingress.yml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: gateway
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: "gateway-ingress-ip"
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /*
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: gateway
            port:
              number: 8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Deploy it and make sure it worked.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f ingress.yml -n demo

# keep running this command displays an IP address
# (hint: up arrow recalls the last command)
kubectl get ingress gateway -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To use a TLS certificate, you must have a fully qualified domain name and configure it to point to the IP address. If you don’t have a real domain, you can use <a href="https://nip.io/">nip.io</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Set the IP in a variable, as well as the domain.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get ingress gateway -ojsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
DOMAIN="${EXTERNAL_IP}.nip.io"

# Prove it works
echo $DOMAIN
curl $DOMAIN</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To create a certificate, create a <code>k8s/certificate.yml</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; certificate.yml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: ManagedCertificate
metadata:
  name: gateway-certificate
spec:
  domains:
  # Replace the value with your domain name
  - ${DOMAIN}
EOF</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the certificate to <code>ingress.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
metadata:
  name: gateway
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: "gateway-ingress-ip"
    networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: "gateway-certificate"
...</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Deploy both files:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f certificate.yml -f ingress.yml -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Check your certificate’s status until it prints <code>Status: ACTIVE</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl describe managedcertificate gateway-certificate -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>While you’re waiting, you can proceed to forcing HTTPS in the next step.</p>
 
 
 
 Force HTTPS with Spring Security 
 
<p>Spring Security’s WebFlux support makes it easy to <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.5.x/reference/html5/#webflux-http-redirect">redirect to HTTPS</a>. However, if you redirect all HTTPS requests, the Kubernetes health checks will fail because they receive a 302 instead of a 200.</p>
 
 
<p>Crack open <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> in the gateway project and add the following code to the <code>springSecurityFilterChain()</code> method.</p>
 
 
 src/main/java/…​/gateway/config/SecurityConfiguration.java 
 
 <code>http.redirectToHttps(redirect -&gt; redirect
    .httpsRedirectWhen(e -&gt; e.getRequest().getHeaders().containsKey("X-Forwarded-Proto"))
);</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Rebuild the Docker image for the gateway project.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/gateway</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run the following commands to start a rolling restart of gateway instances:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl rollout restart deployment gateway -n demo</code> 
 
 
 






Run <code>kubectl get deployments</code> to see your deployment names.



 
 
<p>Now you should get a 302 when you access your domain. <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a> is a useful alternative to curl.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Update your Okta OIDC app to have <code>https://${DOMAIN}/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> as a valid redirect URI. Add <code>https://${DOMAIN}.nip.io</code> to the sign-out redirect URIs too.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Encrypt Your Kubernetes Secrets 
 
 
<p>Congratulations! Now you have everything running on GKE, using HTTPS! However, you have a lot of plain-text secrets in your K8s YAML files.</p>
 
 
<p>"But, wait!" you might say. Doesn’t <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Kubernetes Secrets</a> solve everything?</p>
 
 
<p>In my opinion, no. They’re just unencrypted base64-encoded strings stored in YAML files. There’s a good chance you’ll want to check in the <code>k8s</code> directory you created.</p>
 
 
<p>Having secrets in your source code is a bad idea! The good news is most people (where most people = my followers) manage secrets externally.</p>

 The Current State of Secret Management in Kubernetes 
 
<p>I recently noticed a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_bilar/status/1379845799086022661">Daniel Jacob Bilar</a> that links to a talk from FOSDEM 2021 on the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/kubernetes_secret_management/">current state of secret management within Kubernetes</a>. It’s an excellent overview of the various options.</p>
 
 
 
 Store Secrets in Git with Sealed Secrets and Kubeseal 
 
<p><a href="https://bitnami.com/">Bitnami</a> has a <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">Sealed Secrets</a> Apache-licensed open source project. Its README explains how it works.</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>Problem: "I can manage all my K8s config in git, except Secrets."</p>
 
 
<p>Solution: Encrypt your Secret into a SealedSecret, which is safe to store - even to a public repository. The SealedSecret can be decrypted only by the controller running in the target cluster, and nobody else (not even the original author) is able to obtain the original Secret from the SealedSecret.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
 
<p><a href="https://dev.to/stack-labs/store-your-kubernetes-secrets-in-git-thanks-to-kubeseal-hello-sealedsecret-2i6h">Store your Kubernetes Secrets in Git thanks to Kubeseal. Hello SealedSecret!</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/aurelievache">Aurélie Vache</a> provides an excellent overview of how to use it.</p>
 
 
<p>First, you’ll need to install the Sealed Secrets CRD (Custom Resource Definition).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.16.0/controller.yaml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Retrieve the certificate keypair that this controller generates.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl get secret -n kube-system -l sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key -o yaml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy the raw value of <code>tls.crt</code> and decode it. You can use the command line or an <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/">online base64 decoder</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>echo -n &lt;paste-value-here&gt; | base64 --decode</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Put the raw value in a <code>tls.crt</code> file.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, install Kubeseal. On macOS, you can use Homebrew. For other platforms, see <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/tag/v0.16.0">the release notes</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>brew install kubeseal</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The major item you need to encrypt in this example is the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> you used to encrypt the OIDC client secret. Run the following command to do this, where the value comes from your <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl create secret generic encrypt-key \
  --from-literal=ENCRYPT_KEY='your-value-here' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; secrets.yml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, use <code>kubeseal</code> to convert the secrets to encrypted secrets.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubeseal --cert tls.crt --format=yaml -n demo &lt; secrets.yml &gt; sealed-secrets.yml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Remove the original secrets file and deploy your sealed secrets.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>rm secrets.yml
kubectl apply -n demo -f sealed-secrets.yml &amp;&amp; kubectl get -n demo sealedsecret encrypt-key</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Configure JHipster Registry to use the Sealed Secret 
 
<p>In <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, change the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> to use your new secret.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: encrypt-key
      key: ENCRYPT_KEY</code> 
 
 
 






You should be able to encrypt other secrets, like your database passwords, using a similar technique.



 
 
<p>Now, redeploy JHipster Registry and restart all your deployments.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use port-forwarding to see the JHipster Registry locally.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Google Cloud Secret Manager 
 
<p>Google Cloud has a <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/app-dev/cloud-services/secret-management">Secret Manager</a> you can use to store your secrets. There’s even a <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-gcp/current/reference/html/#secret-manager">Spring Boot starter</a> to make it convenient to retrieve these values in your app.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, you could store your database password in a properties file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.datasource.password=${sm://my-db-password}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This is pretty slick, but I like to remain cloud-agnostic. Also, I like how the JHipster Registry allows me to store encrypted secrets in Git.</p>
 
 
 
 Use Spring Vault for External Secrets 
 
<p>Using an external key management solution like <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">HashiCorp Vault</a> is also recommended. The JHipster Registry will have <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry/pull/498">Vault support in its next release</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the meantime, I recommend reading <a>Secure Secrets With Spring Cloud Config and Vault</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Scale Your Reactive Java Microservices 
 
 
<p>You can scale your instances using the <code>kubectl scale</code> command.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl scale deployments/store --replicas=2 -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Scaling will work just fine for the microservice apps because they’re set up as OAuth 2.0 resource servers and are therefore stateless.</p>
 
 
<p>However, the gateway uses Spring Security’s OIDC login feature and stores the access tokens in the session. So if you scale it, sessions won’t be shared. Single sign-on should still work; you’ll just have to do the OAuth dance to get tokens if you hit a different instance.</p>
 
 
<p>To synchronize sessions, you can use <a>Spring Session and Redis</a> with JHipster.</p>
 
 






 
<p>If you leave everything running on Google Cloud, you will be charged for usage. Therefore, I recommend removing your cluster or deleting your namespace (<code>kubectl delete ns demo</code>) to reduce your cost.</p>
 
 
 
 gcloud container clusters delete &lt;cluster-name&gt; --zone=us-central1-a 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Monitor Your Kubernetes Cluster with K9s 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Using <code>kubectl</code> to monitor your Kubernetes cluster can get tiresome. That’s where <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">K9s</a> can be helpful. It provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. K9s was created by my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/kitesurfer">Fernand Galiana</a>. He’s also created a commercial version called <a href="https://k9salpha.io/">K9sAlpha</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>To install it on macOS, run <code>brew install k9s</code>. Then run <code>k9s -n demo</code> to start it. You can navigate to your pods, select them with Return, and navigate back up with Esc.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>There’s also <a href="https://github.com/kdash-rs/kdash">KDash</a>, from JHipster co-lead, <a href="https://twitter.com/deepu105">Deepu K Sasidharan</a>. It’s a simple K8s terminal dashboard built with Rust. Deepu recently <a href="https://twitter.com/deepu105/status/1383017556546584578">released an MVP of the project</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>If for some reason you don’t like CLI’s, you can try <a href="https://www.kubernetic.com/">Kubernetic</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Continuous Integration and Delivery of JHipster Microservices 
 
 
<p>This tutorial doesn’t mention continuous integration and delivery of your reactive microservice architecture. I plan to cover that in a future post. If you have a solution you like, please leave a comment.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Spring on Google Cloud Platform 
 
 
<p>JHipster uses Docker containers to run all its databases in this example. However, there are a number of Google Cloud services you can use as alternatives. See the <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gcp">Spring Cloud GCP project on GitHub</a> for more information.</p>
 
 
<p>I didn’t mention Testcontainers in this post. However, <a href="https://atomfrede.gitlab.io/2019/05/jhipster-with-testcontainers/">JHipster does support using them</a>. Testcontainers also has a <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/gcloud/">GCloud Module</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Why Not Istio? 
 
 
<p>I didn’t use Istio in this example because I didn’t want to complicate things. Learning Kubernetes is hard enough without learning another system on top of it. Istio acts as a network between your containers that can do networky things like authentication, authorization, monitoring, and retries. I like to think of it as AOP for containers.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’d like to see how to use JHipster with Istio, see <a href="https://dev.to/deepu105/how-to-set-up-java-microservices-with-istio-service-mesh-on-kubernetes-5bkn">How to set up Java microservices with Istio service mesh on Kubernetes</a> by JHipster co-lead <a href="https://twitter.com/deepu105">Deepu K Sasidharan</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Fernand Galiana recommends checking out BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and <a href="https://cilium.io/">Cilium</a>. Cilium is open source software for transparently providing and securing the network and API connectivity between application services deployed using Linux container management platforms such as Kubernetes.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Kubernetes, Spring Boot, and JHipster 
 
 
<p>This blog post showed you how to deploy your reactive Java microservices to production using Kubernetes. JHipster did much of the heavy lifting for you since it generated all the YAML-based deployment descriptors. Since no one really likes writing YAML, I’m calling that a win!</p>
 
 
<p>You learned how to use JHipster Registry to encrypt your secrets and configure Git as a configuration source for Spring Cloud Config. Bitnami’s Sealed Secrets is a nice companion to encrypt the secrets in your Kubernetes deployment descriptors.</p>
 
 
<p>For more information about storing your secrets externally, these additional resources might help.</p>

<p>We hosted Part 1 of a talk series called Tools for Thought Interchange on May 27th, 2021. Tools for Thought — also known as second brains, digital gardens, or simply personal note taking apps — is seeing a lot of interest right now, with more being built every day. The question we posed was: how do we work on interchange between these systems?</p><p>Not just import or export (although those play a role as well). Rather, can we work on ways to interchange data between systems in a way that preserves the unique capabilities of each system, while also allowing users and developers to more easily use different tools to work with their own data?</p><p>It became clear that many people were interested. We talked to a number of speakers about presenting, and ideally it will turn it into a community of interest and speaker series of its own, distinct from our Fission Tech Talk Thursdays.</p> Fission Building Blocks for Tools for Thought <p>Fission provides a <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative">Webnative SDK </a>for developers that provides portable identity, end-to-end encrypted data &amp; file storage, and web publishing today. This is perfect for the peace of mind of your important second brain notes, without being stuck in a single SaaS database.</p><p>On the public side, the permanent content addressing and graph structure of the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a> has the potential to be a commons network that helps with annotation and linking of tools for thought resources.</p><p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.fission.app">TiddlyWiki already has a Fission enabled app</a>, and previous presenters like <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/kosmik-app-tool-for-thought-ipfs-database/">Kosmik App</a> are also building on IPFS for global data.</p><p>If this sounds interesting, <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">drop by the Fission Discord chat to find out more »</a></p> Part 1 Presentations <p>Here are the presentations, notes, and video from Part 1. <a href="https://lu.ma/yd1w65cq">Join us for Part 2 on June 3rd »</a></p> Blaine Cook: atJSON as potential format for interchange <p><a href="https://twitter.com/blaine">Blaine Cook</a> kicked us off as the main presentation for the first event. He has been working at Condé Nast on atJSON, which has this to say in its <a href="https://github.com/CondeNast/atjson">GitHub README</a>:</p><blockquote>For Condé Nast, it is essential for our stories to be a format that doesn’t age quickly – we have over a hundred years of articles from publications across the world. It is extremely important for us to be able to put these stories written for digital media in our archive for the future. Many current content formats do not strive for rigorousness in this, instead tying the constraints of the format to the current platform of choice. When constructing this format, we chose to separate the original text from the data associated for this purpose.</blockquote>  <a href="https://ipfs.runfission.com/ipfs/bafybeigp5nuiey5wadfnj54nh2ioey4hmu5d4c2nizxqx6fzycy25jp7k4/2021-05-27%20Fission%20Atjson%20Talk%20Blaine%20Cook.pdf">PDF Slides »</a>  <p>Said perhaps a bit more succinctly, atJSON is designed to be a "100 year document format".</p> Jeremy Ruston, TiddlyWiki <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jermolene">Jeremy</a> showed some in progress work on transforming ePUB into <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> format for in browser annotation and linking, which you can try out online at <a href="https://twpub-tools.org/">twpub viewer</a>.</p><p>TiddlyWiki already supports multi formats, and using something like atJSON as an interchange format would allow for the ePUB code to be used by multiple projects. Maybe this is a <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/discussions/3">good starting point for some shared code</a>?</p>  Check out the GitHub for more info: <a href="https://github.com/TWPUB/TWPUB-Tools">TWPUB/TWPUB-Tools</a>   Gordon Brander, Subconscious <p><a href="https://twitter.com/gordonbrander">Gordon</a> is building a new tool for thought called <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/">Subconscious</a>, and walked us through the design of <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/subtext-markup-for-note-taking">Subtext</a>, a new type of markup, designed for note taking.</p>  GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/gordonbrander/subtext/">gordonbrander/subtext/</a>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y58oa44sWowFU9_XZa9tqKLTpWrHxF7GYNg2Xzc_e2w">Google Slides »</a>   Christina Bowen, Social Roots <p><a href="https://twitter.com/csageland">Christina Bowen</a> did an amazing job rounding out the presentations with a discussion about the usage of notes and note-taking tools for cross-group coordination and collaborative work to address social mess problems. Socialroots is a worker-owned platform cooperative, the first coop to receive funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF). They are currently researching healthy teams and social coordination, especially around things like food, climate, health.</p>  <a href="https://www.socialroots.io/">Sign up for early access and find out more at socialroots.io »</a>   Video <p>At almost 2 hours long, this video has a lot to get through. It was fantastic to have these three great presenters, as well as an active and engaged audience who themselves added tons of questions and shared resources in the chat.

Some organisations want to know lots about an individual, while others want to limit how much is known about them — as my colleague puts it, <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-difference-between-digital-identity-identification-and-id-41580bbb7563">there are 1.4 billion people without an identity, but many more who are over identified</a>.</p><p>I find this a fascinating topic — it brings out the challenge of politics, power and control, which we’ve explored in our work on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27">digital identity ecosystem mapping,</a> such as in<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27"> Kenya</a>, and in our work supporting <a href="http://good-id.org/">the Good ID initiative</a>. So I was privileged to be invited to host a discussion on Digital Identity by the SIDA, the Swedish government’s development agency, as part of the <a href="https://stockholminternetforum.se/">Stockholm Internet Forum.</a> We brought together a diverse group of people from the digital identity industry, supporting Government digital identity in the Global North and the Global South, from the social protection sector, United Nations, civil society and academia.</p><p>We tackled diverse issues, such as the tension between inclusion and exclusion, noting that all identification systems <a href="https://youtu.be/aIBdSrPLPv0?t=2466">— digital or not — are predicated on inclusion and exclusion</a> and we need systems to deal with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aIBdSrPLPv0?t=2582">One approach</a> discussed is forcing firms to proactively think about how they’re excluding people and to justify those exclusions upfront. And in the context of COVID-19, we talked about inclusion responses being high-coverage and timely but a key question: for whom? We still don’t know the toll of who’s been left out, but <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/indonesias-invisible-people-face-discrimination-and-sometimes-death-by-database/">this article in Rest of World begins to explore that toll.</a> We also discussed the tensions between legal and stand-alone digital identity schemes, and between biometric data and privacy. There was a strong emphasis on trust, and a recognition that context is key to defining both trust and what constitutes ‘Good’ digital ID. It is a conversation that will continue so long as there are competing visions about the social contract between the identifier and identified. And there certainly are competing visions: watch the full recording below.</p><p>For more information, please <a href="https://claudiommachado.medium.com/good-digital-id-at-the-stockholm-internet-forum-sif-81a337d350e3">do read one of the participants own reflections</a>, or <a href="https://youtu.be/aIBdSrPLPv0">watch the recording of the session&nbsp;here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/what-does-good-digital-identification-look-like-b8af547aebd8">What does ‘Good’ Digital Identification look like?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Each research team will also deploy a survey or social media scraping of keywords and discussions that arise in workers and sellers groups. Through interviews and participatory video storytelling, young women will tell their story in their own words, in partnership with<a href="https://www.storyby.design/"> Story x Design</a>, a multimedia production company based in&nbsp;Nairobi.</p>A screenshot of the female respondents from our previous video storytelling project<p>At Caribou Digital, we see <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">platform livelihoods</a> as more than just earning an income — a livelihood encompasses other factors including growth of the individual, their safety, the support they need and get, and whether they find purpose in their work as they navigate this new way of working. In <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">earlier work</a>, we defined platform livelihoods as how people rely on “digital platforms” to make money as workers (in the gig economy) or sellers (in e-commerce and social commerce). As we’ve seen in our research so far, livelihoods are constantly being negotiated between workers and platform owners, through digital means, including algorithmic interaction. As a demographic who may face barriers to participation, we were especially curious to understand the challenges that young women face, and how we can make platform livelihoods better for&nbsp;them.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">gender lens on platform work</a> often surfaces structural barriers such as lack of access to capital or infrastructure, or varying levels of digital skills. It also questions the notion of flexibility, as childcare places additional constraints on women’s time compared to men, as <a href="https://odi.org/en/publications/women-in-the-gig-economy-paid-work-care-and-flexibility-in-kenya-and-south-africa/">an ODI study found in Kenya and South Africa</a> found. Our new project investigates how COVID-19 impacts these existing challenges.</p><p>The gender lens will also help capture how unconscious biases and prejudices (for example, that a woman shouldn’t be driving) become obvious tangible barriers for women wanting to enter platform work on a ride-hailing app (the woman is denied a loan for a vehicle to drive for work). We’ll apply and explore Andrea Cornwall’s work on the levers of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3210">empowerment</a>, seen as a combination of “individual change, institutional or social change, informal and formal practices.” This might nuance the discussion from “women use cheaper phones and therefore we should build platforms for cheaper phones” to why women use cheaper phones and how that can be addressed. This research will also provide insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted such norms, from unconscious biases and prejudices to tangible&nbsp;biases.</p>Dathive is one of only two female motorcycle drivers on the Safeboda app in Uganda (<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">from our previous video storytelling project</a>)<p>Finally, we use the word “we” in the research question: “how can we make platform livelihoods better for young women”? But who is the “we”? The research asks exactly that — who is the “we” that needs to <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/female-livelihoods-in-the-gig-economy-tensions-and-opportunities-f14982b6aaad">make the platform work better for women</a>? Is it the platforms themselves? Is it female workers who might demand better conditions through women’s rights groups and activists? Is it policymakers like foundations and governments? And, related, how do we define “better”?</p><p>As we progress through the research, we’ll keep blogging and sharing the emerging themes on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/cariboudigital">@cariboudigital</a>) and here on Medium (<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a>).

<p>I got the idea of breadboards from Ryan Singer in his book <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>.</p>
<p>Borrowing from the field of electrical engineering, a breadboard is a fully functioning prototype without the industrial design. We can do the same for an interaction idea and choose not to specify any visual design.</p>
<p>To do this we specify three things:</p>
 
 Places — Things you can navigate to, like screens, modals etc. 
 Afforandances — Things users can act on, like buttons, menus but also interface copy. 
 Connection Lines — These show how affordances take users to different places. 
 
<p>Places go on top, affordances go underneath, connections define the flow.</p>









  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  











  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>By staying in low-fidelity, the breadboarding and fat marker sketching leave room for designers later in the process.</p>
 The problem 
<p>One problem with breadboards is that the connection lines can get messy.</p>









  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>A slightly different approach is using a <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a> board and using its ability to link to objects. Clicking on a link will move the current view to the linked object.</p>
<p>Because Miro zooms into the object that was linked, once you click a link, it can be helpful to link to a frame around the place/location in the breadboard. That way you never zoom in too far.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated housing issues across the world, drawing attention to the challenges of access, sustainability, and public health and wellbeing. Each city is tackling its own set of location-specific obstacles that intersect with global forces in different ways.</p>



<p>On the plus side, the situation has sped-up digitisation and ushered in long-overdue changes that improve efficiency, help democratise access to housing and boost sustainability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how can governments, citizens and landlords of all types harness these opportunities and collaborate to shape housing of the future so that it works for everyone, everywhere? We take a look at some of the challenges highlighted by the pandemic, and a selection of exciting initiatives being pioneered to address them.&nbsp;</p>



 1. Addressing supply 



<p>As digitisation gathers pace, the power of data is being used across the world by forward-thinking policymakers to improve housing outcomes. In the UK, local and national governments are employing AI-powered geospatial technology that uses big data to map and analyze urban land, revealing its development potential for a range of use cases. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2020/10/29/geospatial-technology-could-solve-the-uk-housing-crisis/">According to Forbes</a>, “Supporting the UK government’s need to build efficient housing, organizations such as LandClan and Esri use this technology to identify the right living and working environments, helping facilitate building plans that take into account the best outcomes for residents, developers and investors alike.</p>



<blockquote><p>Catalyzed by the Covid-19 crisis, the construction industry is leveraging technology to address key inefficiencies – and passing savings on to buyers and renters.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/here-s-how-smart-construction-could-transform-home-building-after-covid-19/">Catalyzed by the Covid-19 crisis</a>, which limits the number of workers allowed on site and extends the completion time of projects, the construction industry is leveraging technology to address key inefficiencies – and passing savings on to buyers and renters. Building Information Modelling, for example, has seen more widespread uptake in the past year, allowing stakeholders to meet virtually and share data across disciplines, significantly speeding up the process at the design phase. At the same time, artificial intelligence is being <a href="https://fluxus-prefab.com/fluxhouse-generative/">used to assess</a> things like cost and locale in a virtual environment – massively speeding up the decision-making process at an early stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, technology developments like <a href="https://3dprintedhouse.nl/en/project-info/project-milestone/">3D printing are being used</a> to support faster, cheaper, more environmentally friendly methods of construction.</p>



 2. Empowering citizens and community&nbsp; 



<p>Initiatives to <a href="https://www.mobie.org.uk/">engage the community in housing development</a> existed already, but the onset of the pandemic prompted government, industry and citizens to collaborate in unprecedented ways. Across Europe, events like <a href="https://wirvsvirus.org/">Wir vs Virus</a> and <a href="https://theglobalhack.com/">The Global Hack</a> were set up to tap into the collective insights and expertise from different parts of the community to address emerging shortfalls in urban and community infrastructure. Last year, Housing 2020, Europe’s largest housing festival, hosted a <a href="https://cihhousing.com/virtual-festival-hackathon/virtual-festival-hackathon/climate-change-hackathon">climate change hackathon</a> to spark ideas to engage, educate and motivate the entire housing sector to adopt a climate emergency approach to all their decision making.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The onset of the pandemic prompted government, industry and citizens to collaborate in unprecedented ways.</p></blockquote>



<p>Covid restrictions, including social distancing and lockdowns, also saw <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coliving-insights-no2-here-stay-lachlan-sloan/">loneliness skyrocket</a>. Yet, despite the challenges of living in large groups during a pandemic, many <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201208-how-communal-living-groups-are-riding-out-the-pandemic">intentional communities</a> and <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/11/how-has-covid-19-changed-proptech-and-how-are-startups-fighting-back/">co-living spaces</a> have thrived – with residents enjoying a heightened <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coliving-insights-no2-here-stay-lachlan-sloan/">sense of community and wellbeing</a> while retaining access to <a href="https://www.ic.org/intentional-communities-fared-pandemic/">reliable digital resources</a>.</p>



 3. 100% digital rental process 



<p>Perhaps the most significant impact in the last 12 months has been the accelerated push for the real estate industry to be more digital. Digital contracts are starting to become the norm, with Vonovia, one of Germany’s largest housing companies, recently introducing <a href="https://presse.vonovia.de/de-de/aktuelles/210421-digitaler-mietvertrag-kunden-app">digital lease signing</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bureaucracy is a major hurdle for renters and landlords alike. Real estate agencies have tended to <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/11/how-has-covid-19-changed-proptech-and-how-are-startups-fighting-back/">work mostly offline</a>, dealing with piles of paperwork and in-person meetings. For renters, applying for a home can be a major upheaval, especially for new arrivals, freelancers and those with non-traditional forms of income. At the same time, landlords and property managers are sometimes unable to access suitable tenants due to communication issues and data privacy concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digitisation provides an opportunity for the industry to address legacy issues and recognise the realities of renting in the 21st century. They can better respond to customer demand for digital end-to-end processes, and select tenants efficiently while accommodating a diversity of applicant backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Digitisation provides an opportunity for the industry to address legacy issues and recognise the realities of renting in the 21st century.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi</a> is using a cutting-edge, decentralised technology called self-sovereign identity (SSI) to provide a unique solution. Their digital passport allows users to own and control their own data, and provides a verifiable and transparent way for individuals, companies and governments to exchange private information. Potential renters can share only the data that’s relevant, while proving their income and other essential details that landlords require. Landlords and property managers get peace of mind through access to relevant information about their tenants, while guaranteeing data privacy and digitally managing contracts and tenant relationships.&nbsp;</p>

 Audi trusts in IDnow platform for new mobility concept „Audi on demand Subscribe“ 
<p>Munich, June 1st 2021, IDnow, a leading platform-as-a-service provider for identity verification, supports the international automotive company AUDI AG with a digital solution for identity verification for the new subscription offer “Audi on demand Subscribe”.</p>
<p>In mid-May, the fully integrated subscription model<a href="https://audiondemand.de/subscribe/"> “Audi on demand Subscribe”</a> was launched in the first dealerships of the brand with the four rings in Germany. Customers can use it to digitally rent an Audi for a period of four to twelve months. For Audi, the focus is on flexibility and convenience for the user. In order to offer customers a fast and smooth process that fits in with the digital strategy, Audi relies on IDnow’s AutoIdent. In this process, the customer’s ID and driving license data are automatically read in a user-friendly process and checked for authenticity with the help of AI and machine learning technologies.</p>
<p>“For us, the focus is on the customers and their customer journey. When designing the subscription model, it was particularly important to us to integrate a fast and completely digital process for identity verification – this is what our target group expects. We are pleased to be working with IDnow and to be able to offer our customers this smooth process,” says Martin Wallenborn, Head of Business Development Sales Germany at AUDI AG. With “Audi on demand Subscribe”, the automobile group is supplementing its previous “Audi on demand Rent” offer, which enables short-term rentals of up to 28 days.</p>
<p>“With its subscription offer, Audi has created a service that needs a convenient and fast application route. Our team has come up with a great solution that fits exactly the requirements of the Audi brand and its customers,” says Oliver Obitayo, Chief Sales Officer at IDnow.</p>
<p>IDnow has expanded its capabilities in recent years far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In early 2021, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers of online and offline verification. This was the second acquisition within six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe.</p>

<p>The excitement that accompanied the recent pilot concert in Liverpool showed that after enduring 14 months of lockdown, the UK public has been craving the return of music and good times. This is further supported by a <a href="https://www.festicket.com/magazine/news/roadmap-out-of-lockdown-survey-over-90-of-uk-festival-goers-feel-confident-attending-a-live-event-th/">survey of music fans</a>, which found that 90% of the 140,000 people polled feel confident to attend a live festival this year. However, with potential issues around Covid safety, cancellation insurance, customer experience, ticket touts and data breaches hanging over organisers in this new post-Covid world, it’s clear that new solutions are needed if the summer festival season is going to be successful.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56828608">Government having so far fa</a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56828608">iled to put cancellation insurance in place for festival organisers</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56828608">no official guidance having yet been published for mass gatherings</a> after June 21st, to say that festival organisers are nervous would be a gross understatement. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/may/04/more-than-a-quarter-of-uk-music-festivals-cancelled-over-insurance-fears">Glastonbury and Download are among some of the big names to have cancelled so far</a> – in what should have been the year where glorious live events returned triumphantly.</p>
<p>It’s really no surprise to see some festival organisers decide that staging an event simply isn’t worth the risk. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984501/S1235_Eighty-eighth_SAGE_meeting.pdf">Sage’s latest minutes</a>, from its meeting on 5th May 2021, predict that any new Covid variant that is highly transmissible or that substantially escapes immunity could lead to a “very significant wave of infections”.</p>
<p> With the average cost of staging an independent festival coming in at a whopping £6 million, the recent AIF member survey – which showed that almost 93% of respondents do not plan on staging their events without some form of government-backed insurance or indemnity scheme – makes perfect sense as organisers won’t want to risk forking out on events that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/festival-insurance-remains-single-biggest-worry-as-government-is-urged-to-back-up-events-2924299">could yet be cancelled by the Government</a> if there’s another spike.</p>
<p>Greater Responsibility for safety</p>
<p>This year, the responsibility organisers have for the safety of their attendees is far greater than ever. Now, on top of their previous safety protocols they will need to think about things like minimising Covid infection risk and protecting valuable personal health data.</p>
<p>Over the last 14 months, enforcing social distancing has become a key responsibility for venue owners who are dedicated to keeping patrons safe – but at a festival this will be nigh on impossible. Add packed mosh pits and inhibition-reducing alcohol to the mix and any chance of distance diminishes even further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If people already infected with Covid are allowed entry into a festival, there is a real risk of creating a Covid hotspot. This, of course, would be incredibly damaging for organisers, whose reputation would come under fire and it&nbsp;could lead to the closure of future festivals – which would damage confidence in the industry. It is because of this that organisers will need to combine testing and technology to ensure only people who are attested Covid safe; either through a negative test or fully immunised, are granted entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart technology to avoid irritating queues</p>
<p>Festival organisers will also need to do better at managing delays than other sectors. In recent weeks, we’ve seen <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56743571">Heathrow airport reporting delays of up to six hours</a>. This would be catastrophic at a festival – to keep festival goers waiting, after they have already waited for months to have a great time, would only lead to frustration and likely cause a bad reputation for the festival itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To minimise this and to prevent the&nbsp;risk of infected people trying to gain entry to the festival onsite – which would pose another safety risk – organisers should look to the combination of testing and technology to allow people to capture their Covid status in advance and demonstrate they meet protocols through a private and secure digital health pass.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to ticket touts</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/25/parasitic-ticket-touts-undermining-music-festivals-covid-tracing">Reports have revealed that ticket touts </a>are taking advantage of the Covid situation and pent up demand to really rip-off consumers.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.sharonhodgson.org/ticket_touts_campaign">Labour MP, Sharon Hodgson</a>, has rightly called for the Government – which has itself been promising to ‘Build Back Better’ – to use this opportunity to introduce measures that make events Covid secure and stop ticket touts from deceiving customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self Sovereign Digital IDs are the answer to this. Implemented effectively, this system allows festival organisers to provide customers with a completely private digital ID wallet, where they can also store their entry ticket and Covid status as part of a slick entry process that would instantly make ticket touts a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Keeping personal and health data completely safe</p>
<p>Medical data is at least <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/nhs-cyber-attack-medical-data-records-stolen-why-so-valuable-sell-financial-a7733171.html">10 times more valuable than financial data on the dark web</a> so any record that is made of individuals’ Covid status by festival organisers needs to be watertight. Over recent years, numerous music festivals have reported major data breaches. In 2014, Belgian festival <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach-compromises-64000-tomorrowland-festival-attendees/">Tomorrowland saw a data breach</a> involving the information of 64,000 festival-goers and, in 2017, details of nearly <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/data-leakage/28259/1-million-coachella-festival-goers-hacked">one million Coachella attendees were leaked</a> from its database. Closer to home, only last year, industry giant <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54931873">Ticketmaster was fined £1.25m for failing to keep their customers’&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54931873">personal data secure</a> following a cyber attack on the website in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These instances demonstrate that the data threat is all too real. Add Covid data into the mix though, and the risk becomes even greater.</p>
<p>This is another way that a digital health pass based on Self-Sovereign ID can help. Whereas most data breaches are the result of centralised databases being hacked, with SSID, an individual’s personal data is stored on their individual phone and is never seen or accessed by anyone else. It is as secure as it is possible to be and removes the responsibility from the event organiser for processing their customer’s data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future of safe festivals awaits</p>
<p>It was wonderful to see live music get back on track with the pilot event at Liverpool but it’s unclear how this system will scale if expanded from the 3,000 attendees at that event to the more than 100,000 who visit some of the UK’s biggest festivals, nor indeed is it clear how it will work when numerous events are happening all over the country at around the same time.</p>
<p>That’s why many festival organisers will rightly remain concerned about issues such as Covid safety, cancellation insurance, customer experience, ticket touts and data breaches – and will know that they need to take action themselves to tackle these issues.</p>
<p>The answer to all of these problems lies in the combination of a smart implementation of testing and technology. At BLOK BioScience, we are helping our partners to deliver testing on a large scale and using our unique Self-Sovereign ID technology-based digital health pass – which is the only health pass in the world to be certified by the ID2020 – to enable event organisers to provide visitors with a completely secure and private record of their Covid status.</p>
<p>Our flexible system is completely interoperable, meaning that it can plug into a festival’s existing systems, and can allow customers to store their digital ID, Covid status and festival ticket all on one device. The system enables super-fast entry as visitors use their BLOK Pass to prove they meet the entry criteria in less than 30 seconds, with a green QR code granting them access, amber meaning they need to take a test and red illustrating they are a potential Covid risk. It’s delivered by security and customer service teams via the super-easy BLOK Verify app, which sits on their mobile device.</p>
<p>If you are planning an event this year then a system like this could be the key to you providing a safe environment that protects the health and the data of your customers, that ensures a smooth entry system and minimal queues and that completely eradicates the ticket tout problem. All of this will boost the reputation of your event and could even protect your festival from being closed if there is a spike in infections between now and the event – as you can prove you have robust safety measures in place.

These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, startups, etc.</p><p>A holder is someone who is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders are typically individuals or organizations.</p><p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p> What’s the Difference Between a Verifiable Credential and a Verifiable Claim? <p>At the basic level, a claim is a statement. A claim becomes a credential when it is verifiable and backed by evidence.</p><p>In the digital identity world, a verifiable claim is a piece of information about the subject, and these are made by an issuer. To become a credential, each of these claims must be verifiable in some&nbsp;way.</p><p>Specifically, the verifier must be able to ascertain the following.</p>  Who issued the credential?  That the credential has not been tampered with since it was&nbsp;issued  That the credential has not expired or been&nbsp;revoked   How to Verify a Credential? <p>With physical credentials, this is accomplished through some proof of authenticity embedded directly in the credential itself like a chip or hologram. It can also be done by checking directly with the issuer that the credential is valid, accurate, and current. But this manual verification process can be difficult and time-consuming — a major reason why there is a worldwide black market in falsified credentials.</p><p>This brings us to one of the fundamental advantages of verifiable credentials: using cryptography and the Internet, they can be digitally verified in seconds. This verification process can answer the following four questions:</p>  Is the credential in a standard format and does it contain the data the verifier&nbsp;needs?  Does it include a valid digital signature from the&nbsp;issuer?  Is the credential still valid, that is, not expired or&nbsp;revoked?  If applicable, does the credential (or its signature) provide cryptographic proof that the holder of the credential is the subject of the credential?  <p>(Credits to the book “Self-sovereign identity“ for this explanation)</p> What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)? <p>A basic building block of SSI is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. These are a type of unique identifiers (URI) that enable entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>These DIDs come with certain properties and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Does not require a centralized registration authority  Many DIDs use the distributed ledger technology or any other decentralized network, though it is not mandatory  It is a permanent identifier because it does not depend on a single third-party or centralized registry for its existence.  Can be cryptographically verified  They connect a DID subject (the entity identified by the DID) with a DID document (a set of data that describes the DID subject) to enable the subject to have trustable interactions.  They are interoperable and portable, provided they conform to the existing standards laid down by&nbsp;W3C   What is a DID Document? <p>A DID document is a JSON-LD object that contains a set of data that describes the DID subject including the cryptographic signatures, verification methods, or just about anything that will enable the DID subject to have trustable interactions with other entities on the&nbsp;network.</p> What is a DID Resolution? <p>DID resolution is the process of getting from a DID to its DID Document. It is analogous to the resolution of DNS name to IP&nbsp;address</p><p>DID Document contains metadata of a DID subject. It contains the minimum amount of information to connect with the DID subject. The key information contained in a DID document is public keys, service endpoints, and authentication methods.</p> What is a DID&nbsp;Method? <p>DID methods are the component that helps a DID to resolve a DID document. It defines how DID documents are created, read, updated, and deleted on a&nbsp;network.</p><p>DID methods are often associated with a verifiable data registry, which is a system that brings together DIDs, DID documents, and DID methods. Some examples of verifiable data registries are trusted databases, decentralized databases, distributed ledger, and government ID databases like DigiLocker. Sometimes, more than one type of registry can be used in the same ecosystem.</p><p>A DID document looks like&nbsp;this:</p><p>In terms of implementation, a DID method is defined by its specification that precisely defines how DIDs and DID documents are created, updated, deactivated, and resolved.</p> What is a Sidetree Protocol? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">Sidetree protocol</a> is an open blockchain-agnostic protocol developed by DIF and supported by Microsoft. The core idea of this protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger&nbsp;system.</p><p>This protocol is designed to overcome many technical problems in existing implementations that include high throughput and cost, presence of centralized authorities, lack of scalability, and more. The Sidetree protocol bridges the need for a decentralized and open protocol as it batches together JSON (a standard for representing structured data) operations to lower the associated costs, improve throughput, enhance scalability, and at the same, allow these operations to be anchored to any decentralized identity&nbsp;network.</p><p>It also helps to create unique identifiers that are controlled and managed by users with their public key infrastructure. Further, it conforms to the W3C specifications, so developers can use the decentralized identifier (DID)&nbsp;methods.</p> What are Peer&nbsp;DIDs? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/peer-dids-an-off-ledger-did-implementation-5cb6ee6eb168">Peer DIDs</a> are implemented as a direct interaction between the two parties to a transaction.</p><p>The way that two entities interact with each other directly without involving a network is the core principle of peer DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>The idea behind creating these peer DID methods is to ensure a cheap, fast, secure, and scalable way to create and maintain private relationships between two entities. Let’s say, Alice and Bob are two entities who are interacting with each other, so only both of them care about the transaction and have a need to resolve their respective DIDs.</p> What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs? <p>A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</a> is a cryptographic protocol where one entity can prove its identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p><p>When you say that an entity has an identity, what you mean is that the entity has a series of claims that are used to uniquely identify it. Breaking it down further, we can say that this process comprises of two&nbsp;steps,</p>  Creating a claim, where each claim is a subset that contributes to making an individual unique. Some examples of claims are date of birth, passport number, driver’s license, Social Security Number, or any other government-ID that belongs only to an entity and can be used solely to identify&nbsp;it.  Proving the claim — A means by which this claim is proven without the actual information.   What is&nbsp;IPFS? <p>InterPlanterary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network for storing files and tracking their versions in a distributed file system. It works by connecting all devices on a network to the same file system, and each file in it is identified by a unique crypto hash of its contents.</p> What are BBS+ Signatures? <p>The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signature</a> scheme is a Digital Signature Scheme (DSS) with two distinct parties, namely, the signer and the signature holder. Here the signature holder is the owner of a signature while the signer is the entity authenticating that the signature belongs to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>It is based on Pedersen commitment, a scheme that allows a sender to commit to a secret value that can be revealed in the future. Until then, the sender transmits a commitment to preserve the&nbsp;secret.</p><p>This commitment is the connecting aspect between the signature holder and the signer, and the contents are blinded until the holder decides to reveal&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, these signatures give complete control to the holder to decide when and what must be revealed, and follow the principles of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) where the holder can prove the required identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p> What is a Custodial Wallet? <p>In the context of a decentralized wallet, having private keys means that you have full control over the contents of your wallet. A decentralized wallet may be capable of holding your crypto funds or holding your digital identity, typically on your hardware (i.e. no central servers CRUDing your data). However, many people are not acquainted with digital wallet, blockchain technology, and the concept of public-private keys. A Custodial Wallet is defined as a wallet in which the private keys are held by a third party. Meaning, the third party has full control over the contents of your wallet while you only have to permit CRUD operations on wallet contents. That way you don’t have to worry about losing your private&nbsp;key.</p> What is&nbsp;PKI? <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure</a>, or PKI in short, is a cryptographic system that consists of a key pair, one private and the other public. Both these keys work in tandem and are used for encrypting data and sharing it with others, so the contents can be seen only by the intended recipient.</p><p>Let’s understand how it works with an example. When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she encrypts the message with Bob’s public key and sends it. In turn, Bob uses his private key that’s associated with the public key to decrypt and read the&nbsp;message.</p> What is a Verifiable Presentation? <p>A verifiable presentation is the collation of credentials that a holder wants to share with a verifier.</p><p>A holder can get signed credentials from different issuers and store them in the digital wallet. When the holder wants to share a set of credentials, they are collated into a presentation, and this is shared with the verifier.</p> What is&nbsp;SSIaaS? <p>SSI as a service is what Affinidi’s core aims to build for our applications.

 Ocean Protocol works with Raven Protocol to add Federated Learning to Ocean Market via Compute-to-Data <p>Ocean democratizes access to datasets and AI while Raven’s decentralized algorithms allow cost-efficient training of neural&nbsp;networks</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is partnering with <a href="https://www.ravenprotocol.com/">Raven Protocol</a>, a decentralized and distributed deep-learning training protocol providing cost-efficient training of deep neural networks.</p><p>Raven will become a Compute Provider on <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>, publishing a range of algorithms from Machine Learning to Federated Analytics and Federated Learning. <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a> on Ocean Market resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It lets the data stay on-premise, yet allows 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it to get useful compute results like averaging or building an AI&nbsp;model.</p><blockquote>AI is at the heart of what Ocean Protocol does, so we’re very excited by this partnership. Ocean’s mission is to democratize access to data sets and AI capabilities; this aligns perfectly with Raven’s mission to provide cost-efficient and faster training of deep neural networks using a decentralized and distributed network of compute nodes. Together we are one step closer to unlocking the Open Data&nbsp;Economy.</blockquote><blockquote>— Razvan Olteanu, Chief Operating Officer at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Ethically handling the privacy and security of AI training data has been a priority for Raven, who have been working on integrating various encryption techniques into their protocol. Compute-to-Data on Ocean Market fits this need perfectly:</p>  First, Data Publishers approve AI algorithms to run on their data. These algorithms could be published by Raven Protocol or other third&nbsp;parties.  Then, Compute-to-Data orchestrates remote computation and execution on data to train AI models. The remote computation could be handled by the Raven Network or other Compute Providers approved by the Data Publisher.  <p>In Ocean, a Compute-to-Data infrastructure is set up as a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster on, for example, AWS or Azure in the background. This Kubernetes cluster is responsible for running the actual compute jobs, out of sight for marketplace clients and end users. While this is an incredible feat in itself, users and Data Publishers may want an alternative option in the Compute Providers they choose to approve. The spirit of decentralization may be a philosophical choice for some, but a strict requirement for others. Raven Protocol provides the decentralized option when choosing a Compute Provider.</p><p>On top of that, Raven provides an additional layer of privacy for Ocean Compute-to-Data. Raven Protocol could publish, for example, a Federated Learning algorithm. When run, a neural network is randomly initialized. Weight updates are computed next to the data itself in a data silo and then sent to the neural network. This is repeated in data silo #1, data silo #2, data silo #3, and so on. A neural network gets trained across many data silos without data leaving the premises of each respective silo. The <a href="https://www.github.com/ravenprotocol">Raven Distribution Framework</a> enables this in Compute-to-Data.</p><blockquote>At Raven, we believe that distributed computing is the future of computing. Our framework RDF is a distributed and decentralised compute engine, consisting of various libraries like RavOp, RavML and RavDL. As we are inching towards our goal, our partnership with Ocean is going to be a powerful collaboration providing value to our contributors, Ocean’s data-providers and clients. We are super excited to be working with Ocean’s&nbsp;team.</blockquote><blockquote>— Kailash Ahirwar, Co-founder of Raven Protocol and author of <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Generative-Adversarial-Networks-Projects">Generative Adversarial Networks Projects: Build next-generation generative models using TensorFlow and&nbsp;Keras</a></blockquote> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

<p>In this post, we explore recent trends in data regulation and discuss their implications for businesses at large, with a particular emphasis on the ASEAN region. In addition, we outline how businesses can utilise Credify’s suite of products to facilitate compliance with these regulations and — importantly — monetise their data in a lawful manner.</p>



<p>Sound too good to be true? Read on!</p>



 Data Protection Is Trending 



<p>The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018 and introduced a comprehensive, harmonised data protection regime. With limited exceptions, the regime applies to all data processing entities that deal with individuals in the EU, regardless of where they are based. As such, ASEAN businesses need to also familiarise themselves with the GDPR’s implications.</p>



<p>The GDPR contains a suite of rights designed to place consumers at the helm. As we have mentioned in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/credify/credify-mission-statement-products-and-research-directions-aea975d26436">previous&nbsp;articles</a>, many businesses have sought to exploit users’ personal data by selling it off to third parties in an opaque manner. Social media platforms have engaged in particularly egregious instances of abuse, with the Cambridge Analytica scandal still looming large over our heads.</p>



<p>Amongst the GDPR’s most consequential rights are the following:</p>



  Lawfulness of processing&nbsp;(Article 6): the user needs to have consented to the types of processing that the business will undertake (including transfers of user data to third parties).  Right of access&nbsp;(Article 15): this requires businesses to provide users with a copy of the personal data that they hold upon request.  Right to erasure&nbsp;(Article 17): users can request that their personal data be completely erased from a businesses’ systems, unless this needs to be kept for regulatory purposes.  Right to data portability&nbsp;(Article 20):users have the right to request that their data be transferred from one service provider to another.  



Key principles underpinning the GDPR



<p>Note that the GDPR requires businesses to&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;these actions, as opposed to being mere bystanders. The fines for business that process personal data and do not comply with the GDPR can reach €20 million or 4% of global turnover (whichever is greatest!).</p>



<p>Although these fines may seem unnecessary punitive, they reflect the seriousness with which regulators are taking data processing activities. After all, many people spend the bulk of their working hours in front of a laptop, generating a greater footprint in the digital economy than in the tangible world. Regulators view personal data as a valuable form of personal property, no different than our tangible possessions. Consequently, unauthorised activities by data processing businesses are regarded as forms of data abuse or identity theft.</p>



 Strengthening Local Regulations 



<p>businesses need to act upon. There are, of course, local regulations that also come into play when dealing with users in specific geographies. Nonetheless, the GDPR is influencing the development of these regimes, pushing regulators towards a more comprehensive and consumer-centric model.</p>



<p>Vietnam is the perfect example to highlight this trend. At present, the country’s data protection regime is highly fragmented. Data protection laws are spread across 50 legal instruments on diverse subject matters, which hinders consistency and interpretability (to the detriment of both businesses and consumers). [1]</p>



<p>To address this situation, Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security has presented a draft decree that aims to lay down a unified and extensive set of data protection rules. Many provisions in the decree mirror those of the GDPR, such as the need to process data within the boundaries of users’ consent and to notify users of activities involving their personal data. [2]</p>



<p>Singapore is in the process of updating their data protection regime, while Indonesia is in the process of finalising comprehensive data protection legislation (scheduled for November 2020). [3] We expect other countries in the ASEAN region to revamp their local regulations too. So far, Japan is the only neighbouring nation to have been granted GDPR-adequacy status by the European Commission, confirming the compatibility of their respective data protection regimes. [4]</p>



The World Federation of Advertisers maintains a helpful privacy map



 The Comply Advantage 



<p>Now is the time for businesses to evaluate their data management processes and consider whether sufficient protections are being afforded to their customers. The failure to do so can leave businesses liable to not only regulatory sanctions, but also exposed to the potential loss of customers. As a result of this regulatory shift, consumers will increasingly demand that their data be handled in a lawful and transparent manner. On that basis, data management strategies should be at the forefront of businesses’ minds.</p>



<p>If you’ve come across our previous articles, you may already be aware of work that we’re pursuing at Credify (see e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/credify/credify-mission-statement-products-and-research-directions-aea975d26436">here</a>&nbsp;for an outline of our products). We think that Credify can be the perfect partner for businesses looking to undertake this regulatory transition. Credify’s business model is grounded on the need to provide consumers with greater control over their data. As such, its products respect the principles enshrined in regulations like the GDPR, facilitating the data management process in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>



<p>In particular, Credify’s idX system enables businesses to associate personal data with individual user accounts. Through Credify’s idPass application, users can monitor the personal data that each business is holding and track how their data is being used in an auditable log. The application also allows users to check whether their personal data is up to date; everyone hates correspondence that is sent to an old email or residential address. Importantly, businesses can obtain users’ consent for specific activities (such as sending data to an affiliate or commercial partner) through the idX system — a notification will appear on the idPass application and will record the users’ consent (or refusal) to the transfer.</p>



<p>Credify’s solution is privacy-centric, since Credify’s ability to access users’ data is highly restricted. In fact, we are proud to be working with world-renowned cryptographers and technologists to provide users and businesses with strong security assurances. At present, Credify is using proven technical standards (such as Open ID Connect) and the latest auditing technologies (such as blockchain) to meet our privacy and security objectives.</p>



 Gaining An Edge 



<p>Although this wave of regulation may pose initial challenges, it will also open up new opportunities for forward-thinking players. Businesses can still adopt processes to monetise their user data and acquire data from other businesses, so long as users’ rights are fully respected.</p>



<p>As we hinted above, Credify’s tools can also be used to support a lawful monetisation strategy. Let’s imagine that a marketplace is willing to share a user’s data with an insurance company, which is looking to build a diverse profile about a potential client. The marketplace requests the specific user’s consent and, once accepted by said user through the idPass, Credify can open up a direct channel between the businesses to handle the transfer. In turn, the audit log will be updated to reflect this activity.</p>



<p>We&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/credify/the-next-data-frontier-c6e6e6dc9c72">previously</a>&nbsp;introduced the concept of a data highway. To move data from one end-point to another, users are likely to ask for some sort of incentive (or “toll”). After all, their data is valuable and they are entitled to refuse the transfer if they so choose. Popular incentives can take the form of discounts or vouchers. In the example above, the insurance company may pass on savings attained in the due diligence process (as a result of the data transfer) in the form of lower premiums for participating users. We would also expect the insurance company to compensate the marketplace for each user that they are able to acquire. In short, every party is able to benefit from this transaction.</p>







 Summing up 



<p>We have provided a roadmap for the future of data regulations, with a focus on the ASEAN region. We encourage all businesses to start adapting to this regulatory shift, irrespective of how developed local data protection regimes currently are. This trend is set to strengthen in the coming years and there are significant risks to being caught off guard.</p>



<p>If you’re a business looking for a technological solution to these problems, as well as an avenue to monetise your data in a lawful manner, look no further. Credify has the tools that you need and is willing to work with you to facilitate your success.</p>



Which side of the road are you on?

 How I built a decentralized marketing department powered by NFTs in just 13&nbsp;minutes Vive la Sybil resistance! The gift <p>In about 13 minutes we gonna create both an immense amount of value and a decentralized marketing department. A task impossible for a regular article. Thus this is not a regular one. This is the craziest and the sanest thing you’ve stumbled upon in the crypto space recently. Take a moment, relax and read&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>Inspired by <a href="https://kernel.community/module-0/">Kernel modules</a> (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptowanderer">Andy</a>) that conclude with <a href="https://kernel.community/module-7/">the gift</a> — a beautiful article on&nbsp;giving.</blockquote><p>It all started with a gift. On March 14, 2021, <a href="https://twitter.com/BokkyPooBah">The Officious BokkyPooBah</a>, a famous frog and fossil photographer (and Ethereum dev), <a href="https://twitter.com/BokkyPooBah/status/1371096562089164807">gave away</a> a considerable number of <a href="https://mooncatrescue.com/">MoonCats</a> to Ethereum developers. Surprisingly enough, I had one&nbsp;too.</p><p>After that, I started to see MoonCats almost daily. A <a href="https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1372987465234059266">song</a>, an <a href="https://twitter.com/icebergy_/status/1372404295581188096">AR-kitten</a>, a kitten on a <a href="https://twitter.com/SprinklesNFT/status/1373015859254415362">tiny electronic photo frame</a>, kittens on avatars (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick.eth</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness">Evan Van Ness</a>), and <a href="https://twitter.com/cybercodetwins/status/1372597926518657031">all</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Don_keyedjote/status/1373126907642793989">other</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/KeramDesign/status/1371173184188383238">sorts</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1372776576731901952">stuff</a>. Some people are celebrating, some appreciating BokkyPooBah, paying back to him and paying forward (I made a <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1375339243128639490">doughnut</a>), some are trying to increase the value of their own&nbsp;cats.</p><p>There’s definitely something here. Intentionally or not all cat owners are promoting the myth of cat rescue. As a consequence the average MoonCat price on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wrapped-mooncatsrescue">OpenSea</a> increases. The act of giving effectively created a marketing department for the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Kittens have no utility (yet). They are “just” collectibles that are first of their kind, a part of blockchain history, and widely recognized by the community. All the kittens have is a myth and they sell nothing but a&nbsp;myth.</p><p>What about projects that do have utility™️? Think of virtually any project in the blockchain space. They have mission, art, memes, they do super-novel stuff, they are first of their kind, they are widely recognized and they are building history. They have their own strong myths. But they usually call it “marketing” and use it to build relationships with customers and sell their product. They never sell their myths directly and usually pay to promote them. There’s probably a better way for&nbsp;them.</p> Non-fungible myths <p>Imagine you want to sell your utility-first project myths directly. You put price tags on logos, icons, article header images, community calls background, etc. You turn all those into NFTs. It may sound weird, but let’s explore&nbsp;further.</p><p>We gonna call those non-fungible myths or NFMs. Same standard, same functionality as NFTs, just a special case of it — myths and their part on sale. We’ll explore if it is possible to bootstrap an additional marketing department for your project with NFMs. We’ll see what it takes to create dynamics similar to the one of MoonCats and what benefits are there for you if you select this&nbsp;path.</p> Easy to&nbsp;try <p>Simplicity. It doesn’t require a lot of effort. The artifacts you need are already there — the ones already mentioned above, logos, icons, etc., plus memes, sketches, prototypes, tweets — a lot of work that is usually considered a byproduct. Just put a “verified” mark on them, wrap them as NFTs and you get some NFMs for a start. Byproduct becomes a product and can be monetized.</p><p>Monetization. Start selling NFMs and you get an additional source of income at almost no&nbsp;cost.</p><p>These are a couple of instant benefits of using NFMs. But really just the tip of the iceberg. There are many wonderful properties of NFMs (inherited from NFTs) that could be leveraged.</p> Self-promoting <p>NFMs are personal. Unlike ERC20 tokens, every NFM is perceived as an item, not a number. It does have an extrinsic (market) value, but also a story, relationship, affection, an intrinsic value.</p><blockquote>Would you prefer to have an Apple stock or the first iMac prototype?</blockquote><p>Every item's price is defined by its owner — not only the market. Every owner is thus incentivized to promote their own item, meaning to sell it in the future or just celebrate ownership.</p><blockquote>How many profiles with <a href="https://twitter.com/thepxlportraits">pixel-portrait</a> avatars do you follow on&nbsp;Twitter?</blockquote><p>And as we’ve seen with MoonCats, promoting a single item promotes the whole project’s mythology and adds value to it. Promotion happens naturally as every holder is a promoter. An NFM-powered project gets an additional promotion channel.</p> Welcoming <p>NFMs are viral. There’s always something to share, to show, to tinker with. Any item could be modified and the number of modifications is unlimited. Even the whole myth could be extended. Any medium works — Image, video, text, sound, and code (programming new mechanics). Any type and any level of skill can&nbsp;benefit.</p><blockquote>How many spin-offs (<a href="https://twitter.com/bganpunks">bastard gan punks</a>) and add-ons (<a href="https://twitter.com/punkbodies">bodies</a>) to <a href="https://twitter.com/larvalabs">cryptopunks</a> you’ve seen so&nbsp;far?</blockquote><p>Creators have incentives to collaborate as they are sharing the popularity of the project’s mythology. Same as owners promote their items, creators promote their modifications and spin-offs. Same as owners, they inevitably promote the original mythology (the project’s) and add value to it. An NFM-powered project naturally attracts contributors.</p> Anti-fragile <p>NFMs are self-sufficient. Let’s expand this one a bit more as we are approaching some really cool&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>The Sky Commuter flying car prototype from the 1990s was <a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/flying-car-prototype-from-1990-going-up-for-auction-1678077004">sold on eBay for $130,000</a> and again <a href="https://barrett-jackson.com/Events/Event/Details/1990-CONCEPT-SKY-COMMUTER-AIRCRAFT--178603">here</a>. It has no antique value, the Sky Innovations company is dead and forgotten. What makes the prototype valuable is the myth of “flying cars”, which is still relevant today and will be relevant in the future. In relation to the company, this myth is a super-set myth — it includes the company’s mythology entirely. This myth is strong and lives on its own. Over time it keeps growing and keeps adding value to all the sub-myths and artifacts within&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>Imagine if somebody puts the first mouse prototype by Xerox on auction. Would you be interested to have&nbsp;it?</blockquote><p>Similarly, NFMs get automatically attached to a super-set mythology, the one that is bigger than the project’s. Public goods, automated markets, future of work — these are all super-set myths, that a related project will passively attach to. And there’s always bonus fallback mythology — blockchain history.</p><p>These mythologies will live longer than most of the projects. And NFMs will belong to those myths forever. The stronger the mythology gets, the more valuable the artifacts within that mythology are.</p><p>Thus NFMs are antifragile. Unlike ERC20 tokens they don’t care where the market goes. They are almost insured from dropping to 0. And in the early days, there’s only one way for them — up and to the right. Holders/traders/creators understand that. Which creates an additional FOMO (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out#:~:text=Fear%20of%20missing%20out%20(FOMO,with%20what%20others%20are%20doing.)">definition on wiki</a> incentives for them. NFM-powered project passively acquires value over time by just being&nbsp;there.</p> Nobody is selling their&nbsp;myths <p>Creating non-fungible myths does not require a lot of effort. Project’s byproducts don’t have to be wasted anymore, all the little memes and all the big ones can be monetized. Putting a price tag on those creates strong incentives for anyone to expand the project’s mythology, buy into it, or just share it. Any of those actions increase mythology’s and project’s value.</p><p>This already does look like a marketing department. Owners, creators, traders being its dedicated employees. Marketing becomes diluted through NFMs in the same way as governance is being diluted through airdropped ERC20&nbsp;tokens.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf">EPNS project is issuing NFTs</a> to support their community. As well as <a href="https://app.chiev.net/community/0xdead">MetaGame</a>. <a href="https://badgerdao.medium.com/badger-to-launch-nft-themed-spaceships-with-the-cometh-defi-gaming-platform-7bcc0d325c8">Badger is minting starships</a> together with <a href="https://twitter.com/MUSTCometh">Cometh</a>. <a href="https://zora.co/syndicate/2195">Syndicate protocol</a> and <a href="https://zora.co/mochi">Mochi</a> are selling their NFTs to support development.</p><p>I couldn’t find other utility-first projects that sell NFTs and I found none that sell their myths (NFMs). I see it as an opportunity and gonna take some first-mover advantage for <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a>. In the next section. That would be insane. But before that let’s have a short talk on&nbsp;myths.</p> Super-set myths <p>We’ve seen how projects can make use of their existing myths by wrapping them into NFTs. And how those NFMs are then being auto-attached to its natural super-set myths. This is a kinda passive way to deal with myths. There’s probably a better way. What if we deliberately create our own super-set mythology?</p><p>Hm… But we’ve just discussed how easy it is to build a marketing department with NFMs. It may seem that we are about to diminish its benefits. Creating myths is what marketing departments do. And it requires a lot of&nbsp;effort.</p><p>True, but we can use a vastly underrated blockchain super-power to cut corners. We’ve seen how we can count on artists, buyers, holders, and other individuals that share value through NFMs. To build a myth from scratch we need even more help. For that, we need to share even&nbsp;more.</p><p>The super-power that we can use is synergy. We can create a super-set myth wide enough to include multiple project mythologies. If these projects would then acknowledge the myth, they’d have a shared value. Building the myth would be a much simpler&nbsp;task.</p><p>Synergy is often explained as 1+1 &gt; 2. I believe projects that share value are just about to show us what it really means. In clear&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>One example is <a href="https://twitter.com/PanvalaHQ">Panvala</a>. Panvala puts synergy at its core and creates incentives for projects to share value. Its Digital Identity Coalition (aka <a href="https://t.me/bladerunnerDAO">Bladerunner</a>) brings projects related to human uniqueness and digital identity together. Many projects within that coalition would be considered competitors in the traditional business environment. In the blockchain world, they have a shared budget in PAN token. They decide together what to spend it&nbsp;on.</p><p>Another example is <a href="https://twitter.com/nowdaoit">DAOhaus’s</a> DAO of DAOs (called UberHaus) in which over 50 member DAOs govern the DAOhaus ecosystem, including the HAUS token supply and the development priorities. <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeDAO_">PrimeDAO</a> has a similar approach. There’s an emerging term for the phenomenon — Federated DAOs. I bet it is worth watching&nbsp;closely.</p><p>Apart from those, I couldn’t find other examples of projects that share any real value. That’s another opportunity — not only for <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> but for you as well. In the next part of the article, we gonna create our own example of value shared by multiple projects. This time the value is going to be shared through NFMs. This time you’ll have a first-mover advantage too.</p> Starting the resistance <p>Thank you for reading to this point. You are awesome, smart, and beautiful. Despite my clumsy attempts to deliver the message clearly, you started to see something. You are reading between the lines. [I’m gently switching to emotional you — we gonna need that soon]. WE gonna create a myth with an immense amount of value, a marketing department, and an army of fans - in the next 5&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>We have <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> — a decentralized identity solution — at the input. Its <a href="https://www.notion.so/Mission-d39324031ffd457381ade12f4ed0f960">mission</a> is to unite people at scale, it promotes the <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/price-of-forgery-digital-identity-measuring-human-uniqueness-score-in-dollars/8328">price of forgery concept</a> and the importance of distinguishing humans from bots. Strong mythology is already there, but it “belongs” to Upala and is not suited for sharing. WE gonna create a super-set myth for that. Wide enough to include mythology of any project related to digital identity. For better experience follow the article carefully.</p> Bringing the myth into existence <p>[Broaden your consciousness here]. Upload the following into your memory ̶p̶o̶o̶l̶: Terminator, Bladerunner, Matrix, sad robots, raise of the machines, artificial intelligence, robots rights, replicants seeking love. Stop for a moment and wait for other associations… Got a couple? Great. ̶N̶o̶w̶ ̶t̶r̶y̶ ̶h̶a̶r̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶g̶e̶t̶ ̶i̶t̶!̶!̶!̶</p><blockquote>Try to remember when Boston dynamics started abusing their creatures?</blockquote><p>Now imagine. The opposition of humans and machines is already happening. We cannot see it, because it evolves slowly and naturally. The resistance forces are here too. Invisible, as they are scattered, have no coordination, and — most importantly — are not treated seriously. Individuals are considered mad. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/16/17978596/stephen-hawking-ai-climate-change-robots-future-universe-earth">Precautions</a> from authorities like Stephen Hawking are referred mostly for&nbsp;fun.</p><p>Nevertheless, WE are the ancestors of those who will defeat Skynet (this thing is <a href="https://twitter.com/SkynetLabs">real AF</a>). It is our grand-grand-grand-… children who gonna inhabit the <a href="https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Zion">city of Zion</a> It is us, who will refuse to treat robots as equals. It is us who will desire no&nbsp;peace.</p>  The resistance narrative above and everything in closest relation to it (your associations) are&nbsp;real.  It is not fiction — it is prediction. It is the&nbsp;future.  The resistance has already&nbsp;started.  <p>Take a moment and realize the meaning behind the last three lines… Close your eyes… Let your mind wander for a couple of seconds… Congratulations! We got our new myth! It exists now. You and everyone, who’s reading this are the carriers. And you know&nbsp;it.</p><p>Well, ok, not that exciting so far. I need your thoughts in this article, they are in&nbsp;italic.</p> Taking responsibility <p>Probably this is not very exciting so far. The myth still feels a bit humorous. In that sense, it is not much different from a <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1381911969402388484">random Twitter meme</a>. But WE don’t want it to come and go like thousands of similar memes. Let’s add some value to it. First, I tell you the following…</p><p>UNLIKE all those tweets I’m totally fucking serious! WE ARE starting the resistance. The real one. The coordinated one. I do realize it may sound crazy. But I’m not crazy. ̶M̶y̶ ̶m̶o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶h̶a̶d̶ ̶m̶e̶ ̶t̶e̶s̶t̶e̶d̶.̶ You already know I’m sane. You’ve read to this point. You already trust my judgment.</p><p>More importantly, I’m not a random person to make a declaration like that. I’m already building an anti-Sybil system, already started to spread awareness (<a href="https://docs.upala.id/en/latest/state-of-knowledge.html">Upala’s anti-Sybil academy</a>), contacted many like-minded people. I already started to&nbsp;resist.</p><blockquote>“anti-Sybil” simply means “resistant to bots” or “one human — one account”. When entering a website you are sometimes asked to select all images containing buses or (worst of all) traffic lights. This is an example of an anti-Sybil system. <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> is an anti-Sybil system because it provides a human uniqueness score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Wiki on Sybil-attack</a>.</blockquote><p>Even more importantly I have something to lose. I’m putting my reputation at stake. Right now Upala is actively looking for contributors and investors (<a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation/an-open-letter-to-investors-a59c3813fc4b">an open letter to investors</a>). Hardly everyone gonna accept this wild move. Some people will feel doubtful about my judgment. It is a&nbsp;risk.</p><p>I’ve already taken some responsibility for the resistance and now taking even more. Check out the new section in our <a href="https://docs.upala.id/en/latest/state-of-knowledge.html">Sybil-resistance academy</a> — feel free to contribute. Join the new <a href="https://discord.gg/HPtfD3VZ6M">awareness</a> channel at Upala’s discord for coordination. If you wanna resist I’m your point of contact (<a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p">Twitter</a>).</p><p>You now know: this is where the resistance actually started. Right at THIS&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Hmm, this guy is totally nuts, but it all kinda makes sense. Or rather feels right. I wonder what comes&nbsp;next.</p> Sharing responsibility <p>Next stop. You. We are starting the resistance WITH you. That’s right if you are reading this you are a part of the resistance. I’m sharing responsibility with you. You now bear this knowledge. And you are now responsible to direct anyone who humbly mentions “the resistance” to this&nbsp;post.</p><p>Am I a part of the resistance? Well,&nbsp;ok.</p><p>You probably felt how the article became a bit bumpy. That is on purpose. I’m bumping and bumping it up in your head. The myth needs it. It came into existence thanks to you. Thanks to you it already has some strength and momentum.</p><p>Looks like it does have momentum. At least in my&nbsp;head.</p><p>Thank you for still being here. Take a deep breath, relax [and broaden your consciousness a bit more].&nbsp;Because…</p> Pumping up the&nbsp;value <p>I hereby declare the ownership of this myth. The whole thing. The resistance narrative above and everything in closest relation to it (your associations). The whole damn thing is now mine! Wait, what? For real? Yep, just like that. If you are curious this is how art works (to do links <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp">readymades</a>). I’ll explain in a moment what it all&nbsp;means.</p><p>Nah, no big deal, let him have&nbsp;it.</p><p>And this is quite a big&nbsp;deal!</p><p>Dough!</p><p>We can proceed to discuss the value&nbsp;now.</p><p>I created a tiny bit of value by defining the myth. Then you added a bit more by paying attention to it — I asked you to do it. Then we kept increasing the value together. I addressed the rational you many times during the article. I made you think and sometimes even feel. You made pauses to reflect and build associations. You noticed how this article is more penetrative to your brain than most of the regular articles out there (I told you this is not a regular one). You have a vague feeling that you gonna return to it soon. And you know that many other people will feel the same. You also know that there’s a reputation behind this myth, some actions made, responsibility, and your share of it. We did a good job in growing the value of the myth. And it raised significantly.</p><p>But it was nothing comparing to the value added when I made the first transaction. I unlocked the value by capturing it and making it mine. Minted it to myself, if you will. Or better say, you minted it to me. THANK! YOU! You thought of it as insignificant at first, but it is getting more and more real. It is easier to perceive it as valuable. Probably you feel a bit of regret and even&nbsp;envy.</p><p>No! I’m actually glad for this&nbsp;guy!</p><p>It is not clear yet, what owning a myth actually means. You’ll see that in a moment. But it is already clear that I can do whatever I want with it… And first… I’m gonna blow the value so high, that your fingers will tremble. You’d better sit down. Here we&nbsp;go…</p><p>Now… when everything is clear with the ownership of the myth… I hereby declare… that I present it all to you! WHAAAT? Yes, the resistance narrative above and everything in closest relation to it, the whole damn thing is now YOURS!… yeah!!!…&nbsp;YEAH!!!</p><p>ARE YOU FUCKING FEELING IT?!!! WHAT A MOMENT!!! THIS IS SO AWESOOOME!!! THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!!! [Shouting hard and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3gbAut2reI&amp;t=5s">burning a teddy&nbsp;bear</a>!]</p><p>If you are reading this you are an owner. Just like me. Just. Like. That. Now you share not just the responsibility, but the value as well!!! And this is where the value skyrocketed…</p><p>Now it is easier to discuss what WE can do with it. [Proceed with a comfortable consciousness level].</p> Takeaways <p>Now that we have this shared myth what is possible? How you can benefit? There are a couple of examples below. Short answer — acknowledge the myth, join the resistance and be active. Grow the resistance, spread awareness of it for your own benefit and for the benefit of humankind. It is your luck is to stumble upon this among the first. It is your choice now how to act. And when to&nbsp;act.</p> Build it <p>Explore the myth, create within it and expand it. If you are an artist (in a broad sense, a creator) you now have an additional channel to get heard. You are one of the myth owners. Owning the myth is like owning a smart contract, e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoKitties">CryptoKitties</a> contract. But Unlike CryptoKitties the contract is social, there is no code. And unlike CryptoKitties the myth is general. You can attach (breed) any type of art to it: text, visuals, audio, or code (interaction mechanics). Or it is like <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-616">Marvel’s Earth-616</a> universe, except that it is not built yet. Anyone can fill it with characters, events, and&nbsp;stories.</p><p>Just create a piece of art that is relevant to the myth. Then acknowledge the myth. Mention one of the following lines: “Vive La Sybil Resistance”, “Welcome to resistance”, “This is resistance”, “Humans vs Machines”, “You are now part of the resistance”. Use #ViveLaSybilResistance or a shorter #NoBots hashtag on Twitter. Mention this article. These are the ways to find people with shared values (and shared value😉). These are the breeding mechanics I can think of. Other ways of attaching to this meme are possible. Explore&nbsp;them!</p><p>At the start, while your node of resistance is not strong enough, you’d probably gonna need some support. Ping me and I’ll mention your work, so it could be discovered easier. Don’t be humble — I got incentives for that. I’m one of the owners and I acknowledged the myth — by sharing I increase the value of the whole myth and of my share as a consequence. A gift is an addition.</p> Hodl it <p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p">me</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> on Twitter and wait for #NoBots or #ViveLaSybilResistance tags. Follow <a href="https://discord.gg/vhNZBPFXxU">NFMs channel</a> on Upala Discord. You can be among the first to grab a part of history. Fun fact — you cannot be 100% selfish. Buying is acknowledging. Buying increases the value of the bought item and the value of the entire resistance myth as well. Buying is a&nbsp;gift.</p><blockquote><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/upala-sybil-resistance-forces">Official OpenSea collection</a> is part of the resistance, as well as this <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1381911969402388484">tweet</a>, this <a href="https://themillionetherhomepage.com/">ancient project</a> with broken front-end, <a href="https://mooncatrescue.com/">Mooncats</a>. Everyone I mentioned in this article is a part of the resistance. Everything they do is important for this myth, for blockchain, for humanity, for&nbsp;good.</blockquote> Share it <p>Spread the knowledge — share this article, shill artists you like and their works, bring new people into the resistance. Fun fact — you cannot be 100% altruistic. When dealing with history, timing matters the most. By sharing you become an early adopter. Sharing regularly increases your weight in the resistance. One day you may use your weight for your own benefit. Sharing does have&nbsp;value.</p> Conclusion <p>Our new resistance mythology includes Upala’s Sybil-resistance mythology entirely. Both are interconnected. When mentioning the resistance you also mean that humans are important, they have rights by the mere fact of being born, you mention <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/identification-development-global-dataset">1 bln people without ID</a>, who need help. Moving down to earth you make people aware of decentralized ID systems and the term Sybil-resistance. Lastly, you promote <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a>. The resistance is now Upala’s marketing department.</p><p>But WE created a lot more! As the scope of the resistance mythology is much wider than Upala’s many other projects may find that their mythology can be a subset of it. As the ownership is shared they may acknowledge the myth and start expanding it with no approval. It is like creating a project-specific flavor of Linux. It may look very different, but everyone would know it is still Linux. The more a project contributes to the myth, the stronger its resistance node becomes. And the stronger the entire resistance gets. Every member of resistance is incentivized to support other members. Because both creating and sharing an NFM increases the entire myth’s value. Incentives aligned. Win-win. We created the basis for a decentralized shared marketing department. Thank&nbsp;you!</p><p>WE started it all TOGETHER. The resistance already gained strength and value. With a little help, it may become self-sufficient and live longer than any project or even humans involved. The value behind it is uncapped. It is all up to us. Remember this is the genesis and you are as close to it as one can get. Be among the first to add value to it. Share it&nbsp;now!</p><p>Share this <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1398209330260893697">tweet</a>.

<p>In the physical world, you sign a document and become responsible for its contents, including the duties and liabilities entailed in it. While it’s possible to forge or duplicate these physical signatures, it’s not&nbsp;easy.</p><p>But what about the digital&nbsp;world?</p><p>The option to copy and paste signatures makes it a breeze to forge&nbsp;them.</p><p>Hence, it became necessary to have Digital Signature Schemes (DSS) to establish the signer’s identity and to reduce the risk of&nbsp;forgery.</p><p>Broadly speaking, digital signature schemes have two components,</p>  A private signing algorithm to securely identify the&nbsp;signer  A public verification algorithm to verify the authenticity of the&nbsp;signer.  <p>Many digital signature schemes have these two components, and today, we’ll talk about one such signature schema — BBS+ Signatures.</p><p>This digital signature was created by Dan Boneh, Xavier Boyen, and Hovav Shacham using the strong Diffie-Hellman encryption technique, and hence the name BBS (after their respective surnames). The original signature was modified later to include proof of knowledge, and hence the name&nbsp;BBS+</p> What is the BBS+ Signature Scheme? <p>The BBS+ signature scheme is a DSS that can have two distinct parties, namely, the signer and the signature holder. Here the signature holder is the owner of a signature while the signer is the entity authenticating that the signature belongs to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>Essentially, what happens is that the signature holder enters into a Pedersen commitment with the&nbsp;signer.</p><p>Before moving further, let’s digress a bit here to understand the Pedersen commitment as this is the building block of BBS+ electronic signatures.</p> Understanding the Pedersen Commitment <p>A Pedersen commitment is a scheme that allows a sender to commit to a secret value that can be revealed in the future. Until then, the sender transmits a commitment to preserve the&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Until the sender chooses, the secret remains private and can be revealed only when the sender displays a necessary parameter that’s agreed as a part of the commitment process. This commitment allows senders to commit to a ton of data in one-go and at the same time, no hacker or even an advanced quantum computer can access all of that data until the sender decides to reveal&nbsp;it.</p><p>Let’s understand this with a simple&nbsp;example.</p><p>Let’s say, Bob creates a secret and sends a commitment of the secret to Alice. Here, the commitment can be a cryptographic value like a hash function or discrete logarithms, and this is stored by Alice. Remember, she doesn’t know Bob’s secret and can’t find out with the commitment value&nbsp;either.</p><p>In the future, Bob decides to reveal the secret, and Alice checks this secret against the commitment to verify that Bob hasn’t changed the&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Besides Bob and Alice, no one else knows about its existence.</p><p>Now, let’s extrapolate this Pedersen commitment to BBS+ signatures.</p> BBS+ Signatures and Pedersen Commitment <p>As mentioned above, BBS group signatures create the possibility for the signer and the signature holder to be two different entities, like Alice and Bob. The commitment is the connecting aspect, and the contents are blinded until the holder decides to reveal&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, these signatures give complete control to the holder to decide when and what must be revealed, and follow the principles of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</a> where the holder can prove the required identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p> BBS+Signatures in Verifiable Credentials <p>All these features make it a good DSS for implementing verifiable credentials. Also, a key advantage of BBS+ Signatures is that it allows a part of a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credential</a> to be shared with&nbsp;others.</p><p>For example, let’s say the issuer is a startup company that issues VCs containing the date of birth and address of the holder. Next, the holder wants to share the address with a verifier for a delivery process, so the holder can share a part of the VC (only the address) without sharing the date of birth. This is possible only when the verifiable credential is fragmented into multiple individual fields, each secured by a signature.</p><p>Here is an example of a VC implementation with BBS+ signature.</p><p>{<br> “<a href="http://twitter.com/context">@context</a>”: [<br> “<a href="http://schema.org/">http://schema.org/</a>",<br> “<a href="https://w3id.org/security/v2">https://w3id.org/security/v2</a>",<br> “<a href="https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1">https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1</a>"<br> ],<br> “<a href="http://twitter.com/type">@type</a>”: “Person”,<br> “firstName”: “Jane”,<br> “lastName”: “Does”,<br> “jobTitle”: “Professor”,<br> “telephone”: “(425) 123–4567”,<br> “email”: “<a href="mailto:jane.doe@example.com">jane.doe@example.com</a>”,<br> “proof”: {<br> “type”: “BbsBlsSignature2020”,<br> “created”: “2020–04–25”,<br> “verificationMethod”: “did:example:489398593#test”,<br> “proofPurpose”: “assertionMethod”,<br> “proofValue”: “F9uMuJzNBqj4j+HPTvWjUN/MNoe6KRH0818WkvDn2Sf7kg1P17YpNyzSB+CH57AWDFunU13tL8oTBDpBhODckelTxHIaEfG0rNmqmjK6DOs0/ObksTZh7W3OTbqfD2h4C/wqqMQHSWdXXnojwyFDEg==”,<br> “requiredRevealStatements”: [ 4,5]<br> }<br>}</p><p>Each field in the VC, like the firstName, lastName, jobTitle, etc, is a separate signature and the holder has the option to pick one or more of these fields and include them in a verifiable presentation.</p><p>This example can be extended to any of the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-world VC use-cases</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">PoCs</a> from Affinidi’s <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-pocathon-2021-announcing-the-winners-40b2a5a79fa4">Hackathon</a>.</p><p>In fact, this ability to share just the required information follows the principle of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-2-nuclear-disarmament-abb5c879a7c5">ZKP</a> and is a secure way for the holder to safely share what’s required to the concerned verifier. At the same time, note that BBS+ signatures are not identical to ZKPs as there’s an option to fragment and reveal just some parts of the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>In this sense, BBS+ signatures are selective disclosures controlled completely by the holder where every field in the VC has a signature. Hence, the VC itself becomes a compilation of individual signatures, one for each&nbsp;field.</p> Affinidi’s Implementation of BBS+ Signatures <p>At Affinidi, we’re in the process of implementing this BBS group signature schema where we allow the holder to build a presentation with only the required fields from a credential. There’s also a process in place to verify that the fragmented credential is&nbsp;valid.</p><p>To learn more about what we do, check out our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Developer resources</a>.

			 Barbora Prochazkova is Project Manager at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Barbora, I am 32 and currently live in Mondorf-les-Bains, a little thermal town in Luxembourg. I was born and raised in Komarno, a lovely town in the south of Slovakia. As a child of socialism in former Czechoslovakia, I have been fortunate to have parents that made my childhood wonderfully ‘Pippi Longstocking’ like – adventurous but disciplined, filled with books, outdoor activities, household chores, and exciting travels to the close and faraway towns and lands :).</p>
<p>Despite how good or less good our financial situation was, I greatly admired their ability to take us on a few trips every year, which considerably contributed to the hodophile I grew into. My wanderlust has fully surfaced during my teenage years and I owe it (and the books) invaluable life lessons on humility, gratefulness, and appreciation of being here and now. Reading about and observing how we humans from different corners of the world live, think, collaborate, love and mourn, (hopefully) taught me to be more open-minded, understanding, helpful, and patient in daily interactions with my fellow humans.</p>
<p>I have always been amazed by the great that can come out when people from different cultures exchange their ideas and openly collaborating. And as no university offered a paid degree in ‘travelling, yoga, reading books and becoming a better human’ ( I strongly hope this has changed since :)), I chose what seemed the second-best option at that time and went to study international business. I spent part of my studies in Tuscany, where apart from travelling, eating, and learning how to relax (a skill I so wish to get better at), I met my travel buddy and partner in crime and life, Alex. After Italy, we lived and worked in Slovakia for a couple of years, but soon felt the need to put on our travelling pants again and move out for a few years. And we landed in Luxembourg.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I often joke that be it not for Daniel Coheur’s persistence and incredibly charming interpersonal skills (I am sure people who know Daniel will attest to this), I would have been long gone from Luxembourg – most probably some place sunnier 😉</p>
<p>While I was at my previous company, I was handling and wrapping up a service migration project for clients of a telecommunication operator when I received the email from Daniel. At that time, he was actually my client, representing the company for whom we’ve been doing the migration and was on the copy of most of the emails I was sending out. In his email, he complimented me on my working style, congratulated me on a job well done, and told me that together with a partner of his, Luc, Tokeny’s CEO, they are currently starting a new company and looking for someone to manage the clients and the implementation of the technical solutions and thinks I would be a great fit.</p>
<p>I was very flattered, but I thanked him and politely explained that I am not searching for a change at the moment. He wasn’t ready to let it go yet, wrote me a bit more about the company and also mentioned that his wife is also Slovak and that graduated from the same university. What are the odds? I came clean and told him that the job definitely sounds interesting but that I want to be 100% honest and admitted that I am planning to leave Luxembourg in less than a year and wouldn’t find it fair to start in a new position. He quickly responded that if that is my only worry, worried I shan’t be and if I would want, I can move out with my job if I want to. We all met for lunch, had a very good talk, exchanged ideas and expectations, and soon after I started at Tokeny as Account Success/Implementation Manager.</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Dynamic, ever-changing, sometimes stressful, but very supportive, open-minded, and fun. The team is everything, a soul of the company, and they are wonderful. I have worked with various tech teams, but never have I ever experienced such a strong commitment to delivering the best possible solution, striving to go above and beyond. This invaluable and comforting feeling that we have our back. When the fit hits the shan, which it sometimes does, we stress later, pull our sleeves up and if possible, get the job done in the best possible way. If not possible, we make sure we learned the most of it so that we can build on it and avoid it in the future. I very much appreciate how very different we all are, speak different languages, have various working styles and cultures that shaped us. Working with a remote team definitely has its challenges and is not always a piece of cake, but a kind Slack message and regular calls are doing wonders.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>About learning to live a better life I would say. The complexity of the consciousness, wonders of minds, and the existence of the world as we know it fascinate me. When I can, I read or listen to audiobooks on mindfulness, neuroscience, moral philosophy, psychotherapy, the use of psychedelics in it… I truly LOVE walking (a day without a walk is a day wrongly planned), gardening, and just being outdoors in general.</p>
<p></p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My dream is to be able to say to myself that I did the best I could with what I had, learned how to be genuinely present, undistracted, and most appreciative of the one life I have. I like to think of it as striving to live up to one’s potential and honouring the gift of life. The traveller in me would also say that I wish to work no more than 4 hours a week and dedicate the rest of the time to my family, my human kindred spirits, reading, exploring, walking, and giving back. However, I do hope to become a parent one day, and seeing my children grow into wonderful, engaged, morally strong, and happy humanists would be the ultimate dream.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Oh, so many things. I would love for all of us to be able to feel and acknowledge that helping our less fortunate fellow humans is not an extra, a nice, or big-of-oneself thing to do, but simply our moral obligation. Randomness plays a huge role in where and to whom we are born and hugely predetermines the paths most of us can take, the education we can get, the people we can become or connect with, the jobs we can get. I would love to get everyone from the ‘well-off’ side of the pond which I myself am a lucky occupant to dedicate at least 1% of their net annual income towards shrinking the fast-growing gap between the rich and poor. I am a big proponent of effective altruism myself and hope to be strong enough to dedicate 5% of my net annual net income by 40. I would also ensure that everyone has the same access to high-quality education, which would result in a significant rise in critical thinking and information processing, which would eventually lead to the end of violent religions as we know them now.</p>

On the site, you can find everything from insights into the biggest events shaping the crypto industry to content that meets readers where they are in their journey of learning about blockchain and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>As a fan of the publication, I was thrilled to talk with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukemhamilton/">Luke Hamilton</a>, Senior Software Engineer. In this post, I’ll cover how the Decrypt team streamlined development and onboarding to launch Decrypt Tokens and Drops — along with how crypto DNA and a leading product and team drove their trust in&nbsp;Magic.</p> Incentivizing readers to earn as they&nbsp;learn <p>Decrypt is the gateway into the decentralized world. What’s unique about the reader experience is its clear-eyed storytelling and accessibility. Decrypt content caters to various levels of existing crypto knowledge.</p><p>Back in 2019, the team had ambitions to deepen the reader experience and connect further to their ethos of education through using decentralized technology.</p><p>Fast forward two years of behind-the-scenes work by their product team, that vision is now brought to life with the launch of Decrypt Token (DCPT), a new reader token that lives inside the Decrypt mobile app. According to the team, “The token is our way of participating in the decentralized industry we cover, and experimenting with how cryptocurrency can spur reader engagement.”</p><p>So, what’s in it for readers? The opportunity to earn as they learn. Every week, unique digital rewards — called <a href="https://drops.decrypt.co/">Drops</a> — become available and redeemable with Decrypt tokens. It’s an ingenious way to assign value to actions, thank readers for their loyalty, all while also encouraging hands-on interaction with&nbsp;crypto.</p> Novel reader tokens and rewards inside a mobile&nbsp;app <p>During the development process, Luke and the team tackled the question of how to authenticate users. They explored whether to build their own authentication or integrate with an existing auth solution.</p><p>Internally, there was already substantial discussion about going passwordless for the tokens MVP (minimal viable product). For Decrypt, the biggest benefits to passwordless login were improvements to UX and that several forward-thinking brands had started to make passwordless login increasingly popular with&nbsp;users.</p><p>At the time, work on traditional username and password flow had already begun. But after assessing where the app was and what was left to do in the critical path, Luke realized they had not yet solved issues around account recovery. After evaluating the large effort it’d require their lean engineering team to build out forgot password, reset password, and so on, Luke decided not to continue to invest in a traditional auth flow and instead, implement Magic.</p><p>Natural excitement for Magic sparked at first discovery because of the companies’ shared philosophies on&nbsp;crypto.</p><blockquote>“Choosing Magic further bolstered the credibility of our&nbsp;ethos.”</blockquote><p>The product also stood out as the passwordless auth solution with future-proof crypto and identity tech under the&nbsp;hood.</p><blockquote>“The clear aha moment came when we realized Magic does exactly what we wanted, functionally and philosophically: frictionless login for users and decentralized identity aligned to our&nbsp;mission.</blockquote><blockquote>There weren’t that many competing solutions or anything remotely comparable; it’s fully-featured and production-ready.”</blockquote><p>Luke estimates that continuing to build password-based auth would have added “at least another month” to their roadmap. In just a week, email magic links were up and running in Decrypt’s mobile app for their private&nbsp;beta.</p><p>The process of implementation was streamlined primarily thanks to Magic’s simple documentation and proactive customer support. Luke counts the responsiveness to his questions and genuine partnership mindset as most impressive, highlighting the customer-centric team behind the&nbsp;product.</p> Successful user adoption at&nbsp;scale <p>Decrypt has seen remarkable success in the months immediately following their beta and public launches. Over 50,000 users have already downloaded their mobile app to engage with content and earn tokens, and Decrypt is expecting hundreds of thousands more users by the end of&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Luke is certain Magic played a key role in appealing to broader audiences who want to get their hands on the latest technology and trends in crypto. Sign up and login is easy and fast; users can set up their in-app wallet in literally a few&nbsp;seconds.</p><blockquote>“User growth is the best proof there is. Less friction for users leads to higher conversion.”</blockquote><p>He’s also the first to recommend Magic to colleagues and is now solely building auth with Magic for his passion projects as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote>“I’m working on my own rewards app and had to switch from Auth0 to use&nbsp;Magic.”</blockquote><p>The coolest part: innovation around tokens is just getting started. To kick off the first season of Decrypt Drops, the team launched an exclusive NFT (<a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain">non-fungible tokens</a>) series. In the future, Drops will evolve to include a host of different rewards and functionality.</p><p>Together with Magic, Decrypt is reaching record reader growth and engagement. Through seamless onboarding and innovative experiences powered by blockchain technology, the Decrypt and Magic teams are co-advocating for the future of the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/decrypt-trusts-magic-to-onboard-record-new-user-growth-with-the-launch-of-reader-tokens-and-rewards-14d791e582d5">Decrypt trusts Magic to onboard record new user growth with the launch of reader tokens and rewards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce the alpha launch of Tezos Profiles (TZP), which can be found at <a href="https://tzprofiles.com/">tzprofiles.com</a>.</p><p>TZP is a web application that helps users regain control of their digital identity for use across platforms, and enables the creation of portable verified profiles by demonstrating control over public social media accounts and by self-attesting information. These verified profiles are then linked to Tezos accounts, allowing any platform to resolve and establish trusted information to mitigate identity&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>We encourage users to start creating and launching their profiles as we begin integrating Tezos Profiles support across the Tezos ecosystem. Currently, we are focused exclusively on publicly available information and accounts to avoid privacy issues. We will support private verifications in the future, once the proper security and privacy measures are in place for those workflows.</p><p>We’ve also open-sourced Tezos Profiles and the repository can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/tzprofiles">here</a>.</p> Integrations <p>We wanted to make it easy for any development teams to use Tezos Profiles within their own applications. Therefore, we are releasing an SDK that tzprofiles.com itself uses to resolve, verify, and update claims. It can be found within our GitHub, with improved documentation on the&nbsp;way.</p><p>We are currently helping Tezos ecosystem members such as Hic Et Nunc, TzKT, Kukai, and Tezos Domains to integrate Tezos Profiles, enabling new forms of Sybil resistance and creator authentication. If you would like first-class support on an open-source Tezos Profiles integration for your application, please reach out in our <a href="https://t.me/tezosprofiles">support telegram</a>.</p> How to Launch Your&nbsp;Profile <p>**Note: In this alpha release, only tz1 addresses are supported. However, we’re working quickly to add tz2 support (e.g. DirectAuth via Kukai) via our next upgrade.**</p><p>First, visit <a href="https://tzprofiles.com">https://tzprofiles.com</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>To start, select the network you wish to connect to and connect your wallet using&nbsp;Beacon.</p><p>Once connected, you will be presented with two available credentials: Basic Profile Information and a Twitter Account Verification for the alpha launch. To start, click on “Basic Profile Information” to begin filling in some core profile information about yourself.</p><p>Once you’ve filled in your profile information, click “Sign Profile” in order to self-issue your credential. After this, you can move on to your Twitter Account Verification.</p><p>This workflow will require you to first enter your Twitter handle, sign a message using your wallet, tweet that message and signature, and lastly, verify that message using the service. Once that’s complete, return to your profile to launch your associated smart contract.</p><p>Once you have uploaded your credentials to Kepler and deployed your smart contract, congratulations — you now have an on-chain Tezos&nbsp;Profile!</p><p>Using our viewer, you can now view anyone’s public profile with their associated credentials.</p> Future Plans <p>We have an additional number of features and verifications lined up to be integrated into Tezos Profiles in the near future. Some of these&nbsp;include:</p>  A redesign of the interface that enables users to view, update, and delete their credentials.  An Instagram account verification for&nbsp;artists.  Public messaging account verifications such as Telegram and&nbsp;Discord.  Tezos domain ownership proofs.  <p>— -</p><p>Follow us on<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">&nbsp;LinkedIn</a></p><p>We’re always looking for user feedback on our products.

<p>This month, Gravity joined some of the largest international NGOs in the world to launch the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">Dignified Identities in Cash Programming (DIGID)</a> project in Kenya. The goal of this project is to help the Kenya Red Cross leverage Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol on Tezos to provide much-needed cash transfers to vulnerable Kenyan populations.</p><p>Gravity’s vision is to build human-centered digital ID solutions for easy, transparent and secure data sharing for all people, anywhere in the world. With Gravity, individuals and small business owners can safely store and share their personal data to access humanitarian aid, financing, employment, and government services. In cases like the DIGID project, international organizations can also leverage our digital ID solutions to efficiently collect verifiable data for improved service delivery, interoperability, and&nbsp;impact.</p><p>With humanitarian aid projects like DIGID, Gravity’s goal is to help end-users and partners progressively adopt and implement this decentralized identity protocol to open the door to even greater financial inclusion for vulnerable populations. The reality is that Gravity’s humanitarian aid solution supports populations who are not yet familiar with advanced blockchain technology. By taking a human-centered design approach and meeting our partners and end-users where they are at, we will continue to adapt and build our protocol on Tezos based on real-time needs.</p><p>The DIGID project is a manifestation of our ongoing collaboration with the <a href="https://tezos.com/">Tezos</a> ecosystem to bring our decentralized identity solutions to vulnerable populations of humanitarian aid recipients, refugees, and displaced persons around the world. Among the latest <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-test-suite/implementations/">verifiable credential implementations recognized by W3C standards</a>, Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol is built on Tezos to ensure that our protocol is more scalable, standardized, and transparent.</p><p>With Gravity’s protocol built on Tezos blockchain, together we can empower all individuals to access key services (humanitarian aid, financing, educational certification, e-government services) and accelerate their path toward financial inclusion. Gravity’s use cases include facilitating humanitarian aid and cash transfers to remote communities in East Africa, supply chain financing for small business owners in Kenya, and educational certification for Syrian refugees to access greater employment opportunities in&nbsp;Turkey.</p> Why Tezos? <p>The Tezos protocol aligns with Gravity’s high security standards and our vision for a digital identity platform that builds trusted digital identities on blockchain that are private, portable, and persistent. We believe in Tezos ecosystem’s focus on formal verification of smart contracts and on-chain governance, which allow for everyone to participate by submitting proposals to be voted on to update the Tezos environment.</p><blockquote>According to Gravity co-founder Johannes Ebert: “The Tezos ecosystem’s democratic, community-based, decentralized form of on-chain governance is consistent with Gravity’s vision for our own ecosystem. Like Tezos, Gravity’s solution focuses on decentralizing and community-sourcing our protocol to comply with the latest W3C standards.”</blockquote><p>Tezos also fits in with Gravity’s human-centric vision, which values community-based input and a decentralized approach to create more innovative and effective solutions that truly meet the needs of all stakeholders along the data supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Lastly, Tezos is particularly suitable for Gravity’s decentralized identity use cases due to its affordable transaction costs and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) compatibility.</p> What’s on-chain? <p>Following <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce</a>’s initial implementation of the <a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/decentralized-identity-with-the-tezos-did-method-d9cf6676dd64">Tezos DID Method</a>, Gravity implemented our own version of the Tezos <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">DID Method</a> and <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">DID&nbsp;Manager</a>.</p><p>Gravity’s strong beliefs in maximum privacy and a user’s right to be forgotten mean that we only store specific pieces of personal data on-chain. The on-chain attributes contained within the DID manager&nbsp;include:</p>  Authentication public key: Used by remote parties to verify a signature with an “authentication” purpose (in W3C terms), most frequently used during the sharing of credentials,  AssertionMethod public key: Also for use by remote parties to verify signatures with an “assertionMethod” purpose (in W3C terms), usually used during credential issuance,  KeyAgreement public key: Used by remote parties to compute the shared secret necessary for end to end encryption.  Link to credential repository: A link to a dedicated space on the credential repository which allows issuers to know where to send credentials post encryption, and  TZIP-16 metadata link: Standard that helps attach off-chain metadata to the DID manager, allowing for the inclusion of metadata&nbsp;views.  <p>These attributes are all retrieved by <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">Gravity’s specific DID Resolver</a> which is embedded within the Universal DID Resolver to allow for the re-computation of the related DID document.</p><p>Most recently, we integrated the much-anticipated <a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/contract-metadata-on-tezos-e4c692e2f6ba#:~:text=TZIP%2D16%20proposes%20a%20method,custom%20extensions%20(e.g.%20a%20multimedia">Contract Metadata (TZIP-16) standard</a>, which makes integration, discoverability and querying of Tezos smart contracts easier and scalable for applications and&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>The sky’s the limit for Tezos and Gravity, and we are excited to continue growing with and learning from the global Tezos community!</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravity-earth">LinkedIn</a> for recent updates. <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/subscription">Sign up for our Gravity newsletter</a> for the latest Gravity&nbsp;news!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/gravitys-decentralized-identity-protocol-built-on-tezos-to-power-digid-project-in-kenya-a85069f2a027">Gravity’s Decentralized Identity Protocol, Built on Tezos, To Power DIGID Project in Kenya</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth">Gravity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The Urbit community has grown at a rapid clip throughout 2021. There are so many exciting things going on that it's hard to convey them all, even with Developer Calls happening every two weeks. This event will function as a virtual "mini-conference" where we'll give a series of important and exciting announcements, including both formal and informal talks from many members of our community.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what we'll be discussing:</p>
 Introduction: State of the Network 
<p>12:00 PDT, Josh Lehman</p>
<p>Urbit is under heavy, active development by both Tlon and a wide range of contributors. Josh Lehman will discuss some of the most important areas of work being undertaken, provide a picture of where Tlon and community efforts are going in the future, and even has a few exciting announcements to make.</p>
 Taisho, Urbit's Port City 
<p>~12:20 PDT, Hunter Miller</p>
<p>Piloting an Urbit ship requires expertise that many lack. To achieve the rich and prosperous ecosystem we've all envisioned requires making that journey easier. In this talk, Hunter Miller introduces a new way for users to join the network with minimal effort.</p>
 Keynote: The Revenge of Teleology 
<p>~13:00 PDT, Justin Murphy</p>
<p>Teleology—or inquiry into ultimate ends—has been out of fashion since the seventeenth century, when Francis Bacon said that, “like a virgin consecrated to God,” it “produces nothing.” I argue that the digital revolution is inverting Bacon’s claim. Baconian instrumentalism is now suffering from diminishing returns—it is what the youth today call a Boomer Ideology. Rather, the greatest gains are going to individuals and communities with teleological attitudes. This talk will observe some examples and present a model consistent with the observations. Bitcoin inquires after the telos of money, the most winning independent “content creators” inquire after the telos of media, and Urbit inquires after the telos of personal computing.</p>
 Lightning Talks 
<p>14:00 PDT, you?</p>
<p>After the scheduled talks we'll break out into a series of 30 minute talks led by community members. There will be up to three talks given in parallel at each of 14:00 PDT, 14:30 PDT and 15:00 PDT (so nine talks total).</p>
<p>If you'd like to give a talk, please use <a href="https://airtable.com/shr0Xmqcv1HSy47EP">this form to sign up</a>. You can see the full list of <a href="https://airtable.com/shreGQ4kCU8RA5GJS/tblTZxCpqedJBwSkE">proposed talks here</a>, and if you'd like to voice your support for any of these specifically, <a href="https://airtable.com/shrhNRUAGCqZ38VXA">cast a vote using this form</a>.</p>

  <p>A fun client app that would be a good way to get acquainted with Urbit's networking and p2p abilities. While it would be possible to create a fully decentralized version that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker">mental poker</a> <a href="https://github.com/kripod/mental-poker">algorithms</a> to make the game fully p2p, it is probably more tractable initially to implement the game with a centralized server.</p>
<p>The game can be implemented such that the central server only handles queries about current deck state, and so could be swapped out for a solution with no trusted third party at a later time.  Everything else can be handled player-side, including signing attestations of game state at different points.</p>
 User Stories 
<p>As a gameserver admin I can:</p>
 
 set up a server to handle shuffling/dealing 
 take API calls from players who want to initiate a game. 
 
<p>As a player, I can:</p>
 
 connect to another player with the app to initiate a game 
 specify which gameserver I trust to handle card shuffling/dealing 
 play iterated hands of poker 
 update a game state that is either tournament-based (first to win all the chips) or cash-based (continually updating stacks of chips on each side, possibly with injections of money along the way)

  <p>In today’s digital environment, the bar has been reset when it comes to remote working, e-commerce, e-learning, e-health and streaming services. The demand for simple and secure digital experiences for customers has never been higher. And while logging in is such a common process, it’s easy to take for granted. However, that entry point to your application or service is also when organisations become responsible for the user’s digital identity. Combined with the current, fast evolving landscape and the continuous innovation in, and use of technology to deliver products and services, there is an explosion in the number of sources from which users can gain that access. Overlaying all of that, is the constant evolution of the threat landscape and regulations that inevitably follow.</p>
<p>For leaders who are managing changes in revenue-generating business models, while still working to grow their position in the market, they must balance two goals: delivering security and customer experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join Auth0 as we discuss, and provide some insights on how to utilise a strategic approach to digital identities, that has helped customers such as Siemens, GrandVision and The Economist to:</p>
 
 
<p>Maintain and improve the user experience</p>
 
 
<p>Provide an innovative - and differentiated - product or service, that can adapt and scale as the business grows</p>
 
 
<p>Achieve the above two points, while still ensuring security and trust for their customers’ digital identities</p>

  <p>Identity and access management is evolving. Originating in centralized enterprise systems, IAM must now reflect the complex realities of modern organizations and our post-pandemic society. It is driven by the need for a seamless user experience for all types of identities with all types of devices while maintaining security, compliance and governance. Matthias Reinwarth, Director of KuppingerCole's IAM Practice, exemplifies the path to a big picture for IAM that combines federated and decentralized IAM with traditional IAM and promotes trust through verifiable credentials and the concept of an autonomous, sovereign user.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/reinwarth-future-iam-ecosystem"></a>

 What has the CMA shared and why? 
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last week issued draft guidance around making environmental claims, inviting businesses, shoppers and other stakeholders to submit feedback by Friday 16th July 2021. The final consumer protection law guidance for businesses will then be published in August or September.</p>
<p>Andrea Coscelli, Chief Executive of the CMA, explained that the guidance is designed to enable a fairer deal both for conscious shoppers and for businesses making genuine progress on sustainability: “We’re concerned that people are paying extra for so-called ‘eco-friendly’ products and those businesses which are genuinely investing in going green aren’t getting the recognition they deserve”.</p>
 What are the CMA’s recommendations? 
<p>The CMA divided its recommendations for businesses between six principles. The full document runs for 48 pages – below, we’ve highlighted some of the key takeaways.</p>
 Claims must be truthful and accurate 
 
 Claims that are technically true can be deemed deceptive: “[3.4] Claims must not mislead consumers by giving them an inaccurate impression, even if those claims are factually correct.” 
 Brands must not mislead shoppers around recyclability: “[3.7] For example, businesses must not claim, or otherwise give the impression, that a product is ‘recyclable’ if it is not, or if only parts of it are and others are not, preventing recycling.” 
 Brands cannot dress up legal obligations as environmental benefits: “[3.12] Claims must not suggest that products, processes, brands or businesses provide environmental benefits which are, in fact, standard features [or] ordinary legal requirements.” 
 
 Claims should be clear and unambiguous 
 
 Brands should use shopper-friendly language: “[3.42] Claims should be worded in a way which is transparent and straightforward so consumers can easily understand them.” 
 Environmental claims should be specific: “[3.44] Vague and/or general statements of environmental benefit – ‘environmentally friendly’, ‘eco’, or ‘sustainable’ – are more likely to be misleading.” 
 
 Claims should not omit or hide important information 
 
 Brands must tell the whole truth: “[3.59] Claims made by businesses must not omit or hide information that consumers need to make informed choices.” 
 Carbon neutrality claims should state the reduction and/or offsetting strategy: “[3.68] They should provide information about the scheme (which should be based on recognised standards and measurements, capable of objective verification).” 
 Brands should share sustainability information off-pack and online: “[3.76] Thought should be given to how [information about the full life-cycle of a product] could be disclosed to the consumer by some other means (e.g. by link to information on a website via a QR code). [3.49] In an online claim, for example, [information] should be made available by a single click through link.” 
 
 Comparisons should be fair and meaningful 
 
 Environmental comparisons between products should be like-for-like: “[3.95] A product should only be compared to another that is similar and used for similar purposes.” 
 Brands should share the method behind comparisons: “[3.92] The values used to measure these comparisons, and the way they are presented, should be clear enough for consumers to understand.” 
 
 Claims should consider the full life cycle of the product 
 
 Claims based on a specific part of a product’s life-cycle should say so: “[3.102] Claims may be based on a specific part of an advertised product’s life cycle, or part of a business’s activities. It should be clear which aspect they refer to.” 
 Brands should focus claims on where they have the biggest impact: “[3.103] Claims are less likely to mislead where they focus on aspects of a product or business that are most significant in terms of the overall environmental impact.” 
 
 Claims should be substantiated 
 
 Brands should make the evidence behind claims accessible to shoppers: “[3.122] Claims are less likely to mislead where the supporting evidence is publicly available and it is clear where and how consumers can verify the claims.” 
 Brands must keep evidence updated over time: “[3.119] Keeping evidence up to date is likely to be particularly important where claims are maintained for longer periods or in areas where scientific understanding or consumers’ expectations are developing quickly.” 
 
 What are the legal implications? 
<p>According to the draft guidance, “[2.33] if a business does not comply with consumer protection law, the CMA and other bodies, such as Trading Standards Services, can bring court proceedings.</p>
<p>Notably, shoppers themselves will be able to bring legal proceedings in response to a misleading claim: “[2.34] Businesses may also face legal action from consumers, who can bring legal proceedings in response to a business’s conduct or seek redress in the courts for certain breaches of consumer protection law.”</p>
 What can I do now?

 Submit a response to the recommendations via email by 16th July (more details <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60a66abf8fa8f520c949b5e7/MGC_-_Consultation_document-.pdf">here</a>)

<p></p><p>This has been a good year so far for Cardano. It successfully <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cardano-hard-fork-multi-asset-blockchain">forked to become a multi-asset blockchain</a>, enabling users to create tokens that run on Cardano natively, similar to how tokens operate on Ethereum. (Full smart-contract functionality remains <a href="https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/">on their roadmap</a>.) Its token, ADA, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cardano-ada-coinbase-listing">became tradeable on Coinbase</a> in mid-March. And investors lined up: the price of ADA rose 560% over Q1, the most among the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk20">CoinDesk 20</a>, a core group of cryptocurrencies tracked by the news site. Then in April, Cardano announced a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/from-paper-to-cardano-blockchain-iohk-in-ethiopia">major blockchain-identity initiative in Africa</a>, beginning with a partnership with the Ethiopian government to improve the quality of education.</p><p>Cardano <a href="https://iohk.io/projects/cardano/">makes some promising claims</a> about its platform that seem mainly aimed at differentiating from Ethereum, still the giant in the smart contract space with a market capitalization roughly six times as large as Cardano’s as of this writing. Among its core features:</p>  Protocols for scalability and security are supposedly more scientific, based on “peer-reviewed academic research”.  A unique algorithm, called Ouroboros, billed as “the most environmentally sustainable blockchain protocol”. Ourobouros’s consensus system empowers various types of stakeholders, including “input endorsers'' and “slot leaders”, to mine coins and verify transactions.  A hierarchical structure that includes a settlement layer for accounting and a control layer for executing smart contracts, supposedly making Cardano ideal as both a medium of exchange and a decentralized world computer.  <p>Whether Cardano is actually better than other blockchain protocols isn’t something we’ll try to settle here. What we can say is that Cardano is seeking to be a better blockchain protocol, which is fundamentally different than what Holochain is doing. Cardano and Holochain may ultimately be solving some of the same problems, but they face very different challenges along the way.</p><p>For example, one of blockchain’s biggest challenges is efficiency (or scalability). The computing costs of recording everything that happens on every node of a blockchain are huge, as is the storage load of keeping all of that data forever, so it’s hard to imagine blockchain being suitable for applications involving any kind of big media files. Another issue is latency: blockchains often take several minutes or more to record even simple events, so they’re not very suitable for collaborative applications that rely on fast update times. Users have recently reported transaction wait times on Cardano <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lkbkq0/how_long_does_ada_take_on_average_to_reach_your/">ranging from 1 to 18 hours</a>.</p><p>For these reasons, blockchain projects seem to be primarily setting their sights on financial services applications, which tend to hold relatively little data and don’t require real-time processing. Cardano is no exception, making “interoperability with legacy financial systems” <a href="https://why.cardano.org/en/interoperability/the-grand-myopia/">one of its core objectives</a>.</p><p>Holochain is not limited in the same ways and, as a result, is capable of enabling virtually all the activities you’re accustomed to doing on the internet now. Holochain is so flexible and scalable because:</p><p>Cost: Holochain is completely free to use and run. Because users host themselves and each run a local copy of the application to perform a small amount of the shared workload of validation and storage, there is no need to pay any intermediary miners or stakers. No gas fees also means no built-in token is required to run Holochain apps, eliminating a major usability hurdle. (The tokens people commonly associate with Holochain, Holo Token [HOT] and HoloFuel, actually power the Holo Hosting Network, a peer-to-peer hosting marketplace which enables anyone to participate in a Holochain application through a web browser without having to purchase any cryptocurrency or have a crypto wallet.)</p><p>Storage: Holochain is capable of handling large-media applications. Shared data is replicated only enough times to provide a healthy amount of redundancy – perhaps 25 or 50 times, not on every single node as in blockchain – so it is completely feasible to store and serve large documents, images, and videos. Even live video streaming is possible through the shared data environment of a Holochain app.</p><p>Speed: &nbsp;Holochain has a number of features that combine to make for near-zero latency:</p>  You write data to your local chain instantly. Once your data is recorded on your own source chain and then published to the network, the other computers update to your change in their own time – seconds for most computers, perhaps minutes for some – but you typically don’t have to wait for that to happen to continue moving forward. For example, if you’re posting in a social media application, you see your own post immediately, and you can add a comment to it right away.  In addition, you can send ‘signals’, which are real-time updates transmitted to the specific parties you’re interacting with, ahead of validation by the network. In a chat application, for example, the person you’re chatting to gets a signal so that their screen updates right away with your message, as fast as in any centralized chat application.  When you are interacting in a way that needs to be validated before you can interact again – such as if you’re transacting with currency – your next transaction only depends on your history being validated by the user you’re transacting with, not by the whole network. (Because all users host a copy of the application, including the app’s validation rules, they don’t need to consult anyone else.) So if there are computers on the network that are slower to update or are offline, that doesn’t slow you down. Incidentally, this feature also makes for infinite transactions per second, increasing with the number of users on the network: if there are a billion people using a currency app, there could be half a billion transactions taking place at the same time – one transaction for every pair of people who are transacting.  <p>For all of these reasons, Holochain is suitable not just for financial services applications but for collaborative applications like:</p>  Chat applications like Slack or WhatsApp. (<a href="https://app-registration.holotest.net/elemental">Elemental Chat</a> is now live.)  Project-management systems like Trello and Asana. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBCsQHRLsGA">Acorn</a> is one example in development.)  Social media applications similar to Twitter, Facebook, and so on. (<a href="https://junto.foundation/">Junto</a> is one example.)  Wikis and other knowledge bases. (<a href="https://github.com/eyss/h-wiki-front">H-Wiki</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/fractal-wiki">Fractal Wiki</a> are both in development.)  Calendaring and scheduling applications. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/calendar-events">CalendarEvents</a> is one under development.)  Real-time collaboration tools like Google Docs and HackMD (We created <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/">Syn</a> as a simple but powerful protocol for these types of apps.)  Marketplaces and e-commerce networks for any imaginable good or service, from vacation rentals like Airbnb to ride-sharing networks like Uber to general-purpose marketplaces like eBay or Amazon. One exciting marketplace in development is <a href="https://redgrid.io/">RedGrid</a>, a peer-to-peer, clean-energy power network.  Media-sharing platforms like YouTube and Spotify.  Innovative <a href="https://medium.com/@joshmzemel/the-holocene-explosion-game-changing-possibilities-in-a-world-of-unenclosable-carriers-a432e7a476cd">social organisms</a> like collaborative land stewardship, <a href="https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea">supply-chain tracking</a>, and novel currency systems.  <p>So what advantages does Cardano have relative to Holochain? The biggest one might be awareness – both of the project itself and of the underlying technology. Cardano has gotten a lot more press than Holochain to date. And Cardano aims to improve on technologies that are already widely understood: distributed ledgers, block production, and consensus-based adoption of global state.</p><p>Holochain, by contrast, needs to overcome deep-seated beliefs in order to get developers and users to understand its capabilities. People are so used to the idea that global consensus and universal data replication are the only way to make data secure and immutable that they tend to have trouble believing that it’s possible to guarantee data integrity in a more efficient way. Holochain is a technology at least as disruptive as Ethereum, and remember how many years it took for developers to basically understand Ethereum smart contracts and start building with them? Holochain’s path to awareness is probably more like Ethereum’s in 2014-2017 than Cardano’s today. Then again, more people do seem to be taking notice: the price of Holo Token (HOT) rose even more than ADA over Q1 2020.</p><p>The bottom line: Cardano may be positioned to meet a market demand for a better blockchain and give Ethereum a real run for its money. But Holochain may be poised to leapfrog beyond the lot of them, since it is capable of addressing a set of use cases that blockchain protocols simply cannot, with even higher data integrity and the kind of scalability blockchain can only dream of.</p>

<p>Lots of factors can make renting difficult. Not least, like many cities around the world, Berlin is in the <a href="https://domilabs.io/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-berlin-housing/">midst of a housing crisis</a>. But some factors, rather than being large-scale societal problems, are simply missteps, complications or hangovers from old, bureaucratic ways of working in the way we do business in the rental market. For an everyday tenant trying to find a new home, or for a property manager wading through paperwork, bureaucracy and the problem of trying to find someone who will respectfully and consistently take care of an apartment, there are still too many hurdles to cross. Tenants shouldn’t have to wait weeks to know if their application has even been received; property managers shouldn’t have to wade through piles of bureaucracy and data protection difficulty to rent an apartment.</p>



<p>Neither of these situations is the fault of either the tenant or the landlord. But because the rental process offers challenges and concerns for both sides of the relationship, the relationship between property managers and their tenants can sometimes become complicated. This relationship has always been an intricate and fascinating one. On the one hand, tenants and property managers have a shared interest and a common goal: creating a happy and stable home that is mutually beneficial to both sides of the equation. On the other hand, challenges within that relationship, misunderstandings and missteps can create tension and even distrust. This seems a pity. At Domi, we want to work to change this.</p>



<blockquote><p>Domi is working towards improving the landlord/tenant relationship by dealing with three integral issues.</p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, there are some issues – like a situation where the rent is in arrears, or an apartment isn’t in good condition – that require mediation or extra steps. But in general, most problems that arise in the landlord/tenant relationship are expressions of larger issues rather than individual shortcomings. At Domi, we operate on the basis that most people are good people, and as such we’re looking at some of the reasons relationships between tenants and property managers might break down – and how we can address them.</p>



<p>Domi’s digital renting passport makes your life easier in many ways, whether you’re <a href="https://domilabs.io/for-property-managers/">a property manager</a> or <a href="https://domilabs.io/for-tenants/">a tenant</a>. It offers security, efficiency, accessibility and more. But along with these technical and organisational benefits, Domi is also working towards improving the landlord/tenant relationship by dealing with three integral issues – and offering its own solutions.</p>



 Representation 



<p>There’s a strange kind of intimacy inherent within the landlord/tenant relationship. Even before the relationship is formalised with a contract, as a tenant you’re sharing a lot of personal information with a landlord in a bid to get the new home you want. On the other side, as a property manager you want to make sure that your apartment will be in good hands, which means wading through dozens of applications highlighting a candidate’s financial situation, rental history and more. And at the same time, the two of you don’t actually know each other!</p>



<blockquote><p>On the one hand, property managers need trusted insights to help them select a compatible tenant. On the other, a prospective tenant needs to be in control of the information they share and how they present themselves.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is why tenants can sometimes feel as though they’re discriminated against. Perhaps a less traditional working situation (as a freelancer, for example), a lack of rental history (maybe because they are a newcomer who has just arrived in the country) or a reliance on social funding make them feel as though they don’t look good on paper.&nbsp;At the same time, property managers are facing a large and unwieldy amount of data about prospective tenants, as well as the rise of “Mietnomaden”: people who move into a property with no intention of ever paying the rent. According to a recent survey by <a href="https://www.immobilienscout24.de/wissen/vermieten/mietnomaden.html">ImmoScout 24</a>, 52% of landlords have already had experiences with rental nomads, and 35% said they have experienced missed and irregular rent payments.</p>



<p>There are two problems here, affecting both sides of the relationship. On the one hand, property managers need trusted insights to help them select a compatible tenant. On the other, a prospective tenant needs to be in control of the information they share and how they present themselves.</p>



<p>Domi understands this. That’s why our application system allows tenants to create a fuller and more accurate picture of themselves for landlords. Our interface highlights ideal candidates for each property based not just on one element like a high wage but a full picture of the individual, provided using verifiable credentials that a property manager can trust and a tenant can control access to. At the same time, Domi’s filtering of prospective tenants based on verified data removes the majority of the workload from property managers, allowing them more time to assess tenants on a range of factors.</p>



 Speed 



<p>There’s nothing more irritating than a slow process on something you’re both excited about and really need. Tenants need somewhere to live; property managers need their properties to be filled. When processes are slow, this gets frustrating for both parties. It’s a bad first impression and an annoying start to an important relationship!</p>



<p>Speed isn’t just an issue in signing that first contract. It can crop up again around contract renewals, maintenance requests, rent payments and more. It’s an issue on both sides, but our studies of the rental market have found that for the most part, it’s not the people slowing things down, but the processes.</p>



  



<p>Domi digitises the entire rental process, making everything smoother and faster for both parties. With its intuitive user experience, Domi ensures that every step along the way of the rental journey is easy to navigate. Because it’s all digital, it cuts out those time-consuming steps of preparing, presenting and analysing paperwork that testifies to the tenant’s suitability.</p>



<p>Because Domi operates using the principles of self-sovereign identity, the platform is designed around verifiable data. While other property management software uses “smart tenant matching”, this is based on self-assessment forms tenants fill out themselves with unverified data, and additional verification is still needed for identity, financial and credit data. But using Domi, tenants verify their identity, financial and credit information in advance, and then disclose them as verifiable presentations to a property manager. This means that from the first inquiry stage, the property manager has a clear sense of who might be the ideal tenant. Even better, there’s no need to handle or open a PDF, let alone any physical paperwork! Reliability is baked right in, removing yet another time-consuming process.</p>



<p>Speed is also built into the tenant side of the relationship, with a fast and guided acquisition of verifiable identity, financial and credit data, followed by a one-click-apply process. This means that everything happens much more quickly across the relationship, avoiding frustration and waiting times!</p>



 Communication 



<p>In a recent Domi survey, several tenants highlighted the lack of communication as something that caused distrust and distress: “You don’t even know if you are selected [as the tenant] or not. Nobody sends you a message to inform you. It takes forever to find a place, you lose hope.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“It’s almost impossible to reply to everyone – even though I would like to.”</p></blockquote>



<p>On the other side, one property manager shared: “I often receive 300 applications for an apartment in just three days. It’s almost impossible to reply to everyone – even though I would like to.” Another agreed, “I would love to have an overview with all the conversations I had with applicants. But it’s hard to keep track since some call, some… email, and still others send you a message on WhatsApp.” Going through all of these disparate messages is its own fulltime job!</p>



<p>That’s why Domi locates all communication about a property in one place, making it easy for tenants and property managers to stay in touch. You won’t be distracted by other messages piling up, and there’s no need to be confused about whether an email, WhatsApp message, phone call or even snail mail is the appropriate way to get in contact. Domi’s straightforward notifications make it easy to stay in touch, and means that both people know exactly where they need to go to communicate. Because the entire application is processed in the same place on the Domi interface, it makes it easy for tenants to get an update on the status of their application and for property managers to keep on top of communication.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs strives to support the decentralized identity community and to further enhance interoperability between different networks. Doing this also helps us&nbsp;grow and strengthen&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;decentralized identity services. We put privacy at the forefront of our solutions; protecting personal data and individual privacy and upholding international privacy standards are&nbsp;central&nbsp;to our core values.&nbsp;So&nbsp;we were excited to be invited to join the Indicio MainNet as a validator node operator and to set up the&nbsp;ledger’s&nbsp;10th&nbsp;node.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, we go through how we went about standing up our Indico node.&nbsp;In brief:&nbsp;</p>



  The Indicio MainNet is an enterprise-grade ledger for&nbsp;use by&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identity&nbsp;applications.&nbsp;  We&nbsp;brought up&nbsp;the node&nbsp;using&nbsp;AWS&nbsp;Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) instances within a&nbsp;Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).&nbsp;  We pulled the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;algorithms from the open-source project,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>.&nbsp;  A supporting machine operates the&nbsp;command line interface used to&nbsp;perform steward operations onthe ledger.&nbsp;  We used security&nbsp;groups at&nbsp;the&nbsp;network interface level to create a firewall.&nbsp;  We set up monitoring&nbsp;in AWS CloudWatch using&nbsp;a variety of&nbsp;bash scripting in conjunction with&nbsp;Ubuntu&nbsp;and AWS provided utilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We created a&nbsp;regular maintenance schedule.&nbsp;  



<p>The Indicio MainNet&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">enterprise-grade&nbsp;network</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;use by&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identity&nbsp;applications. It is a&nbsp;distributed ledger&nbsp;which&nbsp;allows&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identifiers, verifiable credential&nbsp;schemas&nbsp;and other non-personally identifiable information to be written to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MainNet is based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>, an open-source project for distributed ledgers.&nbsp;A&nbsp;number of Hyperledger Indy&nbsp;ledgers exist for a variety of purposes.&nbsp;A different provider runs each ledger (e.g.&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrinnetwork</a>).&nbsp;All Indy-based ledgers are&nbsp;intended to be&nbsp;interoperable&nbsp;by design,&nbsp;meaning their DIDs, DIDs methods and DID Docs are cross-ledger compatible.&nbsp;Anonyome Labs supports compatibility with different Indy-based ledgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an emerging&nbsp;developer of&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identity&nbsp;software,&nbsp;we know&nbsp;relationships with existing ledgers areinvaluable, so&nbsp;when&nbsp;new ledgers are brought up in the&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identity&nbsp;space,&nbsp;our team finds opportunities to&nbsp;get&nbsp;involved.&nbsp;In this case, we were proud to be invited to&nbsp;join the Indicio&nbsp;Node&nbsp;Operator Program&nbsp;to&nbsp;run a&nbsp;production level&nbsp;MainNet&nbsp;ledger node.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some&nbsp;technical requirements&nbsp;must be met&nbsp;to become a&nbsp;validator&nbsp;on the Indicio MainNet.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;Anonyome joined&nbsp;the&nbsp;MainNet directly&nbsp;(i.e.,&nbsp;as opposed to progressing through sandboxed test environments first),&nbsp;we made&nbsp;additional security and efficiency decisions to ensure&nbsp;we set up&nbsp;a robust&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The&nbsp;two&nbsp;nodes&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Figure 1 shows the&nbsp;architecture of the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node and supporting systems. The&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node runs the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;algorithms developed under the open-sourced project Hyperledger Indy.&nbsp;We set up another&nbsp;node to run the&nbsp;command line interface&nbsp;(CLI) used to interact with the ledger.&nbsp;While it was not a requirement for the CLI node to be&nbsp;hosted on&nbsp;an AWS server, it better suited&nbsp;our use case&nbsp;because it kept the&nbsp;node&nbsp;accessible.&nbsp;We have&nbsp;node&nbsp;administrators across Australian and US&nbsp;time zones, so&nbsp;it was desirable to&nbsp;host the CLI on an EC2 instance that all administrators&nbsp;could&nbsp;manage&nbsp;at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of these nodes run&nbsp;Ubuntu&nbsp;16.04 LTS&nbsp;(an upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 is imminent), with the CLI&nbsp;node&nbsp;as a t2.micro&nbsp;instance&nbsp;and the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node as a t3.xlarge&nbsp;instance.&nbsp;T2 and T3 are different EC2 instance types offered by Amazon. Each of these instance types offer tiers that differ in CPU, RAM and billing prices. In terms of memory,&nbsp;we allocated&nbsp;the&nbsp;CLI node&nbsp;one disk with&nbsp;10GB. This is sufficient for the administrative duties carried out on that node.&nbsp;We allocated the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;instance two disks, one with 10GB EBS and the other with 250GB EBS. The 250GB disk is&nbsp;used for the Indy ledger databases. All of these disks are&nbsp;also volume level&nbsp;encrypted, and&nbsp;we allocated&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra&nbsp;2&nbsp;CPUs&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node to&nbsp;account for the&nbsp;extra level&nbsp;of encryption.Our nodes run in AWS&nbsp;Asia Pacific (Sydney)&nbsp;ap-southeast-2.&nbsp;</p>



Figure 1:&nbsp;The&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node and the CLI&nbsp;node&nbsp;



<p>The&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node&nbsp;provides&nbsp;capacity to run&nbsp;the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;consensus&nbsp;algorithm&nbsp;which&nbsp;keeps&nbsp;its&nbsp;node database in sync with the network.&nbsp;The&nbsp;CLI&nbsp;node&nbsp;is used for&nbsp;ledger related operations and&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node&nbsp;administration.&nbsp;The separation&nbsp;is for security purposes,&nbsp;because&nbsp;the two tasks require different firewall settings and stored credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 1&nbsp;also&nbsp;shows&nbsp;two subnets:&nbsp;a public&nbsp;subnet&nbsp;and&nbsp;an&nbsp;inter-validator subnet. Within&nbsp;these two&nbsp;subnets&nbsp;are three network interfaces:&nbsp;</p>



  the&nbsp;CLI&nbsp;interface&nbsp;  



  the&nbsp;client-to-validator network interface&nbsp;  



  the&nbsp;validator-to-validator network interface.&nbsp;  



<p>There is a single network interface attached to the CLI instance. This is called&nbsp;the CLI network interface. It resides within the public subnet&nbsp;to provide&nbsp;an endpoint for communications involving ledger utility.&nbsp;This includes SSH requests from the Anonyome node administrators,&nbsp;access to software repositories, and access to CloudWatch alarms for monitoring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two network interfaces attached to the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node:&nbsp;the validator-to-validator network interface and the client-to-validator network interface.&nbsp;The&nbsp;validator-to-validator network interface resides within the inter-validator subnet.&nbsp;An&nbsp;AWS elastic IP&nbsp;endpoint within the inter-validator subnet allows for&nbsp;communication with other validator nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The client-to-validator network interface is in the public subnet. This&nbsp;provides&nbsp;a&nbsp;publicly exposed endpoint,used&nbsp;for&nbsp;cloud agent and wallet&nbsp;communications to the validator node.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Security&nbsp;groups&nbsp;as a&nbsp;firewall&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>The firewall is implemented&nbsp;using&nbsp;AWS security groups that are added to network interfaces.&nbsp;Security groups&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html">control inbound and outbound traffic</a>, allowing administrators to limit traffic to certain addresses on specific ports and message protocols. As the security groups are implemented at the network interface level, different interfaces could be assigned a different firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security groups contain rules that permit or deny certain IP addresses over specific protocols. Such rules target certain types of traffic. For example, there may be a rule that&nbsp;permits SSH requests from certain IP addresses into the nodes.&nbsp;Another permissible rule could be for outbound traffic to the address of AWS CloudWatch to send monitoring updates&nbsp;over the HTTPS protocol.&nbsp;The three network interfaces have differentsets of&nbsp;security groups&nbsp;determined by&nbsp;what types of traffic are permitted and denied&nbsp;for&nbsp;each network interface.&nbsp;</p>



 Monitoring&nbsp;the&nbsp;nodes&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Monitoring is set up using&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">AWS CloudWatch</a>,&nbsp;Slack&nbsp;hooks and bash scripts.&nbsp;We chose&nbsp;CloudWatch&nbsp;so we could&nbsp;set up alarms on custom metrics.&nbsp;Metrics are values of certain node states that&nbsp;must be&nbsp;monitored, such as&nbsp;any files with permissions&nbsp;that leave them vulnerable&nbsp;to compromise.&nbsp;Anonyome uses&nbsp;a cron job&nbsp;thatperiodically runs&nbsp;a script to&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;certain system states&nbsp;and writes these states&nbsp;to a log file.&nbsp;The same cron job also runs another&nbsp;script&nbsp;that&nbsp;then reads the log file and posts the state of each metric to CloudWatch. If the metric is in a predefined alarmable state, CloudWatch will run a Lambda function that posts a&nbsp;warning message&nbsp;to a dedicated Slack monitoring channel.&nbsp;This is how Anonyome&nbsp;administrators&nbsp;monitor the Indicio nodes.&nbsp;You can see this approach in Figure 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Figure 2:&nbsp;We monitor the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;and CLI nodes using&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">AWS CloudWatch</a>, Slack hooks and bash scripts&nbsp;



 Going&nbsp;forward&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>After joining MainNet, nodes need to be kept up to date with the latest software.&nbsp;Node administrators are responsible for updating security&nbsp;patches every week&nbsp;where necessary.&nbsp;We have set up an&nbsp;AMI management policy to create&nbsp;timely&nbsp;backups of the validator and CLI nodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>How new forms of digital-physical ownership can provide financial security in a volatile era, presented by Lohko Wallet and Mattereum (Co-written by Vinay Gupta, Antti Saarnio, and Garrison Breckenridge)</p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/y-BIhyjjHv4">Gold &amp; Bitcoin</a> by Aleksi Räisä via&nbsp;Unsplash<p>In the following, we propose that the union of gold and the emerging crypto asset class can provide an alternative means for securing financial resilience in times of crisis as monetary policies continue to favor corporations over people, all the while maximizing upside and minimizing downside in these volatile&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Specifically, we introduce the Gold NFT, a form of tokenized gold bullion that denotes and enforces true ownership with physical delivery capabilities rather than mere “exposure.”</p><p>In the long view, this feat in legal and software engineering could effectively bring hundreds of trillions in underutilized physical assets into the growing crypto economy, providing much needed stability and variety to this new era of virtual&nbsp;economy.</p> The Many Facets of Gold and its Challenges <p>For millennia, cultures across the world have ascribed value to gold in numerous forms: from collectibles fashioned into jewelry, to physical coinage, to global reserve currency, to inflation hedge in turbulent economic times (say, for example, a global pandemic.)</p><p>While this shiny yellow rock once formed a large portion of the monetary base, since the 1970s the global economy has moved further and further from an asset-backed system to a debt-based one.</p><p>While gold is largely used as a hedge against volatility by institutional investors and the wealthy, it has also been proposed as an ideal form of non-state store of value by retail investors and enthusiasts (“gold&nbsp;bugs.”)</p><p>However, gold ownership provides certain challenges and considerations:</p>  Custody: Gold ownership is highly custodial, with trusted third parties tasked with securing the gold in vaults. Being a physical asset difficult to transport in any high-velocity manner, this is unavoidable.  Abstraction: In practice, customers do not own the actual gold but rather IOUs in the form of gram-denominated tokens or certificates that promise backing by a reserve. In some cases, if the custodian goes under, however, the customer is left with a promise, not the actual asset&nbsp;itself.  Liquidity: Liquidity of physical gold outside of major markets like London is difficult to maintain as it is a physical asset rather than bits on a balance sheet. Physical ownership is also becoming less prominent with gold ETFs providing exposure in lieu of owning the “real” thing, which is fine… until it&nbsp;isn’t.  Scalability: There is an argument to be made that fiat arose from the systemic and infrastructure limitations of scaling gold ownership. As central banks increasingly abstracted ownership over time, eventually a methodology of pure abstraction took over in the form of&nbsp;fiat.  <p>Gold is not the only form of non-state money to catch fire over the years. After over three decades of experimentation in digital currencies, a new global financial network has risen to prominence, producing perhaps the perfect portfolio asset to pair with gold as well as an infrastructure capable of securing digital-physical ownership of&nbsp;gold.</p> The Emergence of the Crypto&nbsp;Economy <p>The invention of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain did not occur in a vacuum. The technical pedigree of this enigmatic asset goes back decades, encompassing diverse fields such as public-key cryptography, shared ledgers, distributed systems design, and many others. Satoshi Nakamoto’s genius was in how they synthesized these established concepts into a whole system that persisted into the future, much to the surprise (and chagrin) of&nbsp;many.</p><p>Much of Bitcoin’s design is influenced by that precious yellow rock, gold. When people refer to Bitcoin as “digital gold,” they are usually referencing shared qualities of scarcity (limited in supply), production cycle (both expend work to mine/produce over time), and use as a non-state store of&nbsp;value.</p><p>In fact, one of the biggest influences on Bitcoin’s design was <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/">bitgold</a>, a proposed cryptocurrency which sought to emulate gold’s inherent characteristics through a digital&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Despite and perhaps due to their explosive growth (with the exception of a few specially-designed cases), cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are incredibly volatile, to a degree which can inhibit utility and adoption.</p><p>We propose that through leveraging the relatively stable and long-term store of value of physical gold and the emerging paradigm of digital value through Bitcoin and the crypto asset class, individuals can secure their financial security and sovereignty on their own terms and participate in a new era of digital-physical ownership.</p><p>So how do we do&nbsp;this?</p> Digitizing Gold Ownership and Beyond with Mattereum and Lohko&nbsp;Wallet <p>As outlined above, the challenges of gold ownership as it is conducted today are not trivial. Ultimately, this is a fundamental problem stemming from a lack of integration between the legal structures that govern the realm of physical property and the software systems which facilitate and enforce&nbsp;it.</p><p>So how do we legally enforce and digitally execute ownership of gold such that the bearer truly owns uniquely identifiable gold bullion in a vault, rather than vicariously through an IOU in the form of a gram-denominated token or certificate?</p><p>Enter: the Gold&nbsp;NFT.</p><p><a href="https://lohkowallet.com/">Lohko Wallet</a> is a digital wallet provider that specializes in secure custody of tokenized financial assets, including physical assets such as gold and silver. In order to properly enforce true ownership of gold bullion through a digital interface, Lohko has partnered with <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> to provide the necessary legal engineering to bind globally-tradable digital assets in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to unique gold bullion securely held in vaults maintained by gold exchange,<a href="https://www.bullionstar.com/"> BullionStar</a>.</p><p>The owner of the NFT can at any time redeem the token for full physical delivery of the uniquely identifiable gold bullion. No IOUs. True ownership.</p><p>The legal innovation at work that bridges this digital/physical divide is the Mattereum Asset Passport. Similarly to how a passport for international travel bundles various information to identify an individual, the Asset Passport is a bundle of legal and digital agreements which denotes true ownership of an object while providing secure digital provenance, certificates of authenticity, insurance frameworks, and dispute resolution in the event of any systemic or commercial fallout. These legal agreements are cryptographically signed and secured on-chain and stored in distributed storage networks such as&nbsp;IPFS.</p><p>Potential investors in Gold NFTs include NFT digital artists wishing to mint premium editions of their works backed by redeemable physical gold bars (and soon, even have the bar physically cast with their art on it), collectors aiming to acquire an altogether new class of NFT with the bound gold providing a base and less-volatile value, and investors seeking to hedge against volatility of the crypto and fiat markets through direct ownership as opposed to gold ETFs or other abstracted means.</p><p>The launch of Gold NFTs and other classes of Real-World Asset NFTs is an attempt at bridging the virtual economy with the physical world in a lasting way, giving rise to some incredible capabilities in the realm of finance, commerce, and our quality of&nbsp;life.</p><p>In the realm of finance, the panoply of asset classes which colossally dwarf crypto even at the height of a bull market can be accessed through the same global payment rails and open protocols which define the crypto phenomenon. This breaks the constraint of crypto in the realm of bits to encompass the material world. More importantly, this new territory is open to&nbsp;all.</p><p>In commerce, tokenized physical goods can be transacted securely peer-to-peer with properly engineered legal mechanisms in place to help allay the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has historically produced price distortions of goods in digital commerce.</p><p>Ultimately, maintaining a secure identity and provenance system around physical goods along the supply chain can allow us to see the truth in what we bring into the world. By bridging this divide, we can get a clearer picture of inefficiencies and injustices throughout the global machinery of trade (carbon tracking, anti-counterfeiting, anti-slavery, etc.)</p><p>This novel experiment in asset ownership by Lohko and Mattereum showcases the potential of Real-World Asset NFTs. Finally, new forms of ownership and utility can be programmed around an object: democratizing access to capital, unlocking trillions in stranded value, and paving the path to a more egalitarian and sustainable society.</p><p>About Mattereum</p><p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta. With blockchain-enabled authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, Mattereum removes the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued digital commerce for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>Follow us as we bring the Mattereum Protocol to an expanding variety of markets ranging from memorabilia, gold, wine, to prized classical instruments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>More at: <a href="http://www.mattereum.com">http://www.mattereum.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mattereum">https://twitter.com/mattereum</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/mattereum">https://t.me/mattereum</a></p><p>About Lohko&nbsp;Wallet</p><p>Lohko is an easy-to-use digital wallet for real assets that helps investors safely buy, hold, control, and transfer their assets.

			<p><a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny Solutions</a> and <a href="https://monerium.com/">Monerium</a> have teamed up to improve the accessibility of security tokens by bringing the digital euro to secondary transfers. Tokeny’s Billboard solution provides a white-label secondary market platform for security tokens, whilst Monerium is a regulated e-money issuer on blockchains. The partnership aims to allow traditional investors to benefit from the investment opportunities brought by blockchain at ease.</p>
<p>The Monerium IBAN solution allows investors to send euros directly between their bank accounts and blockchain wallets. Tokeny has added this fiat-gateway solution within the Billboard platform to allow investors to express their intentions and trade security tokens pairs for digital euro.</p>
<p>As the market grows, more and more investors from the traditional financial world want to take part in the secondary trading of security tokens. Thanks to Billboard, issuers already have the technology to provide a secondary market for their investors. However, investors have been forced to exchange fiat money for stable coins on crypto exchanges prior to their peer-to-peer security token transaction, making the transfer complex, costly and slow.</p>
<p>With the addition of the digital euro in the Billboard ecosystem, investors no longer need to use exchanges to “buy” e-money tokens. Instead, they can send money directly from their bank accounts to blockchain wallets, and back, instantly, seamlessly and without the slippage and costs of going through an exchange. This user-friendly experience is essential to allow investors to benefit from direct digital ownership of fungible money tokens and fosters financial inclusion, mass adoption, and improved liquidity.</p>

		 
	 
    Monerium’s easy-to-use e-money solution brings accessibility to non-crypto investors while Billboard provides issuers with a secondary market solution to improve liquidity for their financial instrument. Issuers can now enhance their value proposition to investors. The more investors that join the ecosystem, the more they will benefit from positive network effects.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions       Tokeny is pioneering peer-to-peer marketplaces for digital securities and helping bring more liquidity to private markets. Having money and securities on the same ledger enables real-time delivery-vs-payment at lower cost and with lower execution risk than in current systems. We look forward to providing issuers and investors using the Tokeny Billboard ecosystem with authorized forms of money.  Sveinn ValfellsCEO of Monerium

  In the digital era, IT is increasingly being provided and consumed as cloud-based services, including Identity and Access Management (IAM). As more workloads and IT services move to the cloud, it makes sense to move IAM to the cloud as well.

<p>Modern-day mobile apps do so much. They communicate with different back-ends via network APIs. They store and retrieve data from the local database, do heavy media processing, and communicate with web sockets. It’s hard to keep track of all the information from different asynchronous data sources, especially knowing that the users are accustomed to constantly having a fluid experience with the apps they use.</p>
 
 
<p>In the early days of Android, developers used the class <code>AsyncTask</code> from the Android framework for doing all the work outside of the main UI thread. Even though async tasks did what they’re supposed to, using them wasn’t the most pleasant experience because of all the boilerplate code you would ultimately end up writing and due to scalability issues. If you had a more advanced use case (i.e., presenting data from a local database on the UI while making an API request to fetch the latest data from the backend, updating the local database, and presenting the latest data on the UI), things would quickly get out of hand. You would end up with code that is hard to understand and maintain.</p>
 
 
<p>Many of those problems were solved by releasing the Java version of the ReactiveX API, called RxJava. It is a library that introduced the concept of data streams and functional programming to the Android platform. It became quite popular with the developer community because of the advanced features and boilerplate reduction it introduced. Chaining tasks from different threads into one logical sequence became easier to write and understand.</p>
 
 
<p>In this post, you’ll learn the basics of RxJava on Android by building a real-world example of server-client communication. Then, you’ll create a production-ready back-end app that will provide an API to authorized users from the Android app. The OIDC authorization will be implemented with the help of Okta OIDC SDKs on both apps.</p>
 
 
<p>Fasten your seatbelt; your reactive journey starts here!</p>

 Create Android RxJava and Reactive Java Apps 
 
 
<p>As mentioned, you will create both back-end and Android apps. The good news is that you won’t need to do it from scratch; cloning them from GitHub will suffice.</p>
 
 
 Clone the Backend Reactive Spring Boot App 
 
<p>The back-end app is based on the <a>Build Reactive APIs with Spring WebFlux</a> blog post. The app is a Java API that uses the Spring Boot framework and the WebFlux library for reactive streams, and it relies on a MongoDB database for storage.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the finished app on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-webflux-react-example">GitHub</a>. Run the following command to clone the project:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-webflux-react-example.git reactive-spring-boot
cd reactive-spring-boot/reactive-web</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Select Other.
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and use <code>http://localhost:8080</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Copy your Okta values from <code>.okta.env</code> into the  <code>reactive-spring-boot/reactive-web/src/main/resources/application.yml</code> file.</p>
 
 
<p>You can also use the instructions in the repo’s <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-webflux-react-example#getting-started">getting started section</a>.</p>
 
 






Please ignore the set-up of the React native app since it’s not needed for this example. But if you’re interested in it, feel free to set it up and see how it works!



 
 
<p>The next step is to remove the scope on the MongoDB dependency so it runs along with our web app. Do that by removing the string <code>&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;</code> from line 49 of the file <code>reactive-spring-boot/reactive-web/pom.xml</code>. This will make it so an embedded MongoDB server starts when you start your app.</p>
 
 
<p>Now you can run the server by running the command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see something like this in your terminal:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>To test this, open a new terminal window and run the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl http://localhost:8080/profiles -v</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This API call should fail because you need to be authenticated to access that resource, and it should look like this:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>That’s all from the web app. The rest of this tutorial will focus on building a reactive Android app that will communicate with the web app. Leave the server running in the terminal and proceed to the next step.</p>
 
 
 
 Clone the Android App 
 
<p>The Android app you’ll use for this guide is based on the <a>Android Login Made Easy with OIDC</a> blog post. Please go ahead and clone the result of the blog post by running this command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-android-login-example.git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Native and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/</code>
    (where <code>dev-133337.okta.com</code> is your Okta domain name). Your domain name is reversed to provide a unique scheme to open your app on a device.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Native App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Native App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Once you have the credentials for your new app, don’t forget to update both your <a>build.gradle file</a> and the <a>OktaManager’s</a> class with the credentials from your newly created Okta mobile app.</p>
 
 
<p>Once you have the credentials for your new app, update <code>app/build.gradle</code> to use your reversed Okta domain name.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>manifestPlaceholders = [
    "appAuthRedirectScheme": "com.okta.dev-133337"
]</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, update <code>src/main/java/dev/dbikic/oktaloginexample/OktaManager.kt</code> to have your client ID, issuer, and other Okta settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>val config = OIDCConfig.Builder()
    .clientId("{yourClientID}")
    .discoveryUri("/oauth2/default")
    .redirectUri("{yourReversedOktaDomain}:/callback")
    .endSessionRedirectUri("{yourReversedOktaDomain}:/")</code> 
 
 
 
<p>And voilà, the setup is done! Now you just have to start the server by running the following command in the root folder of the Spring Boot app:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a Reactive Android App 
 
 
<p>Now it’s time to modify the existing Android app, set up the networking, and add the RxJava library. You’re going to use the <a href="https://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a> library for networking, which is the de-facto standard for Android. The plan is that you connect to your Spring Boot web app API and reactively do a few API calls. Let’s get started!</p>
 
 
 Add RxJava and Retrofit Dependencies 
 
<p>To add the needed library dependencies, paste the following lines into the <code>dependencies</code> block of the <code>app/build.gradle</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>dependencies {
    ...
    // RxJava
    implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava3:rxjava:3.0.0' (1)
    implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava3:rxandroid:3.0.0' (2)

    // Retrofit
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0' (3)
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0' (4)
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:adapter-rxjava3:2.9.0' (5)
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
The main <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</a> library


2
The <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid">RxJava bindings for Android</a>, needed for thread management


3
The main <a href="https://github.com/square/retrofit">Retrofit</a> dependency that includes the HTTP client you’ll use


4
The converter for <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">Gson</a>, used to deserialize data from the API automatically


5
The <a href="https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-adapters/rxjava2">RxJava version of CallAdapter.Factory</a> from Retrofit, used to make the API calls reactive functions


 
 
 
 






Please don’t paste the <code>…​</code> into Android Studio; it’s just an indicator that some other code exists either above or below the code to paste.



 
 
 
 Set Up Networking 
 
<p>This part consists of a few parts, the most important being the Retrofit client. Once you instantiate it, you’ll use it for making all the API calls. Create a new package called <code>network</code> (just for the sake of code organization), and create the <code>RetrofitClientInstance</code> Kotlin file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network

import okhttp3.Interceptor
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
import retrofit2.Retrofit
import retrofit2.adapter.rxjava3.RxJava3CallAdapterFactory
import retrofit2.converter.gson.GsonConverterFactory

object RetrofitClientInstance {

    lateinit var retrofit: Retrofit

    private const val BASE_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:8080/" (1)

    private var token = ""

    val retrofitInstance: Retrofit
        get() {
            if (!this::retrofit.isInitialized) {
                val headersInterceptor = Interceptor { chain -&gt;
                    val requestBuilder = chain.request().newBuilder()
                    requestBuilder.header("Authorization", "Bearer $token") (2)
                    chain.proceed(requestBuilder.build())
                }
                val okHttpClient = OkHttpClient() (3)
                    .newBuilder()
                    .followRedirects(true)
                    .addInterceptor(headersInterceptor) (4)
                    .build()
                retrofit = Retrofit.Builder() (5)
                    .baseUrl(BASE_URL) (6)
                    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create()) (7)
                    .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJava3CallAdapterFactory.create()) (8)
                    .client(okHttpClient) (9)
                    .build()
            }
            return retrofit
        }

    fun setToken(token: String) { (10)
        RetrofitClientInstance.token = token
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
<code><a href="http://10.0.2.2:8080/">http://10.0.2.2:8080/</a></code> is the URL representing your computer’s <code>localhost</code> address. More info about it can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking">here</a>.


2
Adds the JWT token as a header of all the API calls you make. Without it, our server would fail all the requests to it with <code>401 Unauthorized</code>.


3
<a href="https://square.github.io/okhttp/">OkHttp</a> is an HTTP client that comes bundled with Retrofit.


4
Add the <code>headersInterceptor</code> to <code>okHttpClient</code>. The interceptor code block will execute on every API call you make, allowing us to always send our JWT token.


5
Creates an instance of Retrofit.


6
Defines the base URL for convenience purposes. Now when you define the endpoints, you can omit the base URL part.


7
Creates the converter factory for Gson, which allows automatic deserialization of values received from the API.


8
This line adds RxJava support to Retrofit, allowing you to define the API calls as reactive functions.


9
Sets the <code>okHttpClient</code> as the HTTP client.


10
Setter to the JWT token field. Once you log in to the app, you’ll receive the JWT token from the Okta OIDC SDK and use it for every API call.


 
 
 
 
<p>In order for you to connect to the Spring Boot app, which is running at the localhost of your machine, from the Android emulator, you need to add the following line in the <code>application</code> tag of your <code>app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;
  ...
  &lt;application
    ...
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Let’s talk a bit about the API you’ll connect to. The idea of connecting the API from the Spring Boot app is to provide you with endpoints to create, read, update and delete user profiles. A user profile is a relatively simple model, consisting only of a unique id and an email. Create a new package <code>model</code> (just for organizational purposes, the same as the <code>network</code> package), and create two Kotlin files, <code>Profile</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model

import com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName

data class Profile(
    @SerializedName("id") (1)
    val id: String,
    @SerializedName("email")
    val email: String
)</code> 
 
 
 


1
The <code>SerializedName</code> annotation from Gson allows you to define the name of a field when it’s serialized/deserialized into/from JSON.


 
 
 
 
<p>And <code>ProfileRequest</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model

import com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName

data class ProfileRequest(
    @SerializedName("email")
    val email: String
)</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The next step is defining the API of the Spring Boot app. It’s pretty simple to do it with the help of Retrofit; you define endpoints as a function of an interface and configure them using annotations. Create the <code>ProfileService</code> interface in your <code>network</code> package:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network

import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model.Profile
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model.ProfileRequest
import io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Completable
import io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Observable
import retrofit2.http.*

interface ProfileService {

    @GET("/profiles") (1)
    fun getProfiles(): Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt; (2)

    @POST("/profiles") (3)
    fun createProfile(
        @Body profile: ProfileRequest (4)
    ): Completable (5)

    @DELETE("/profiles/{profile_id}") (6)
    fun deleteProfile(
        @Path("profile_id") profileId: String (7)
    ): Completable

    @PUT("/profiles/{profile_id}") (8)
    fun updateProfile(
        @Path("profile_id") profileId: String,
        @Body profile: ProfileRequest
    ): Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt;
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
<code>GET</code> annotation defines that this is a GET HTTP request.


2
The return type is an <code>Observable</code> of a list of profiles. Please ignore what <code>Observable</code> is for now; the next section will explain it.


3
<code>POST</code> annotation defines that this is a POST HTTP request.


4
<code>Body</code> annotation defines the body of the <code>POST</code> request.


5
The return type is a <code>Completable</code>. Please ignore what <code>Completable</code> is for now; it will be explained in the next section.


6
<code>DELETE</code> annotation defines that this is a DELETE HTTP request.


7
<code>Path</code> annotation defines the path to a specific profile via its <code>profileId</code>.


8
<code>PUT</code> annotation defines that this is a PUT HTTP request.


 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! You’re now ready to start using reactive networking in your app!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Use RxJava to Access the Profile API 
 
 
<p>Now that the API is defined, you are ready to consume its endpoints.</p>
 
 
<p>The reason why RxJava is so useful and popular on Android is that it brings the concepts of the Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming to the platform. But, it has a steep learning curve, and it’s a bit harder for people used to writing procedural code to understand at first.</p>
 
 
<p>RxJava introduces the concept of data streams, where different sources of data (like a network API or the local database) are evaluated as data streams that can be observed, combined, or modified, all depending on the use case. This manipulation of data streams is performed by different operators that you get out of the box, which hides the complexity of the logic they do in the background. Once you learn how to use the operators (and how to explore the library to find more of them), complex manipulation of different data sources, which would be super hard and complex to implement on Android using the platform provided async tasks, can be as simple as a few lines of code.</p>
 
 
<p>Operators won’t be used or explained in-depth in this post, but if you want to learn more about them, please check the <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html">official docs</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>As part of this tutorial, you’ll learn about data streams and how to observe them. There are two basic parts of every data stream: (1) the data source and (2) the data consumer. In RxJava, the basic data source is called <code>Observable</code>. All that an <code>Observable</code> does is emit data in some time interval. If you want to listen to the emitted items, you need to create an <code>Observer</code> and subscribe to the <code>Observable</code> updates.</p>
 
 
<p>That’s exactly what you’ll do in this example. You’ve already defined that the Spring Boot API is returning an <code>Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt;</code> when you fetch the profiles from the API. When you call the <code>getProfiles()</code> function,  an <code>Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt;</code> object type is created and returned.</p>
 
 
<p>You will subscribe for the updates, but there won’t be any updates the moment you do the API call.  Sometime in the future (or maybe never, as  Retrofit has a mechanism to fail an API call if a specified timeout has passed), the API will respond. That response can either be a success or a failure - it doesn’t matter. What matters is that a callback will notify the subscriber, and you can handle either response gracefully.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s see how you’ll add this functionality to the codebase!</p>
 
 
 Fetch Profiles 
 
<p>As described above, the purpose of our API is to provide access to profiles, but only for authenticated users. In the Android app, the user login is handled by the Okta OIDC SDK. Once the user is authorized, he/she is navigated to the <code>HomeActivity</code>. The sign-in process will generate a new JWT token for the user, and he/she can use it to access the API.</p>
 
 
<p>First, add a method to expose the JWT token to the <code>OktaManager</code> class:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
fun getJwtToken(): String {
    return sessionClient.tokens.accessToken.orEmpty()
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the <code>HomeActivity</code> class (in <code>app/src/main/java/dev/dbikic/oktaloginexample/ui</code>):</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network.ProfileService
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network.RetrofitClientInstance
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network.RetrofitClientInstance.retrofitInstance
import io.reactivex.rxjava3.disposables.CompositeDisposable
...
class HomeActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    ...
    private val profileService: ProfileService = retrofitInstance.create( (1)
        ProfileService::class.java
    )
    private var compositeDisposable = CompositeDisposable() (2)

    ...

    override fun onStop() {
        compositeDisposable.clear() (3)
        super.onStop()
    }

    ...

    private fun getUserProfileCallback(): RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt; {
        return object : RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt; {
            override fun onSuccess(result: UserInfo) {
                binding.userLabel.text = "Hello, ${result["preferred_username"]}!"
                RetrofitClientInstance.setToken(oktaManager.getJwtToken()) (4)
                fetchProfiles()
            }

            override fun onError(msg: String?, exception: AuthorizationException?) {
                Log.d("HomeActivity", "Error: $msg")
            }
        }
    }

    fun fetchProfiles() { (5)

    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Create an instance of the <code>ProfileService</code>. Interacting with it will allow you to access the API.


2
<code>CompositeDisposable</code> is a class that provides you a simple way of canceling your reactive data streams.


3
You want to stop listening for the data stream updates once this activity is destroyed.


4
Here, you’re setting the JWT token from the logged-in user in your <code>RetrofitClientInstance</code>, with the help of the Okta OIDC SDK and the <code>OktaManager</code> class.


5
Once the user is logged in, you want to fetch all the profiles from the API. You’ll implement this method in the next step.


 
 
 
 
<p>Fetching profiles is done by creating a new <code>Observer</code>, which will observe all the changes from the <code>getProfiles()</code> data stream. Add the <code>fetchProfiles()</code> method to the end of <code>HomeActivity</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
private fun fetchProfiles() {
    compositeDisposable.add( (1)
        profileService.getProfiles() (2)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) (3)
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) (4)
            .subscribe( (5)
                { profiles -&gt; (6)
                    displayProfiles(profiles) (7)
                },
                { throwable -&gt; (8)
                    Log.e("HomeActivity", throwable.message ?: "onError")
                }
            )
    )
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
You are adding the result of the subscription, which is a class that implements the interface <code>Disposable</code> to our list of subscriptions, so you can cancel it once the current activity gets destroyed.


2
Fetch the profiles from the API; this returns <code>Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt;</code>.


3
This defines that the actual subscription is done on the <code>I/O</code> thread, which is the one used for networking.


4
Observe the result of the subscription on the main thread. This is also called the UI thread because that’s the only thread that can modify the UI. More info about this can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/processes-and-threads#Threads">here</a>.


5
The <code>Observer</code> object is created here. It consists of two consumers, which are just callbacks, for the <code>onNext</code> and <code>onError</code> events.


6
The <code>onNext</code> consumers.  Here you’ll receive the list of profiles in the UI thread, ready to be displayed to the user.


7
Update the UI with the received profiles. This will be implemented in the next section.


8
The <code>onError</code> consumer. This will be invoked when you receive an error from the API, or you mess things up with the deserialization.


 
 
 
 






You will have to add imports manually by clicking the red text and pressing the key combination <code>Option + Enter</code> on MacOS or <code>Alt + Enter</code> on Windows. This step may be required when pasting the code. You can also enable the "Add unambiguous imports on the fly" option (<code>Preferences | Editor | Auto Import</code>) to add imports automatically in Android Studio.

<p>Let’s move on to creating a profile. The idea here is to create a new profile with a button click. For simplicity, you won’t implement email validation; you’ll just send the current timestamp as the profile’s email. Add the <code>createProfile()</code> method to the bottom of <code>HomeActivity</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
private fun createProfile() {
    val profile = ProfileRequest(email = System.currentTimeMillis().toString()) (1)
    compositeDisposable.add(
        profileService.createProfile(profile) (2)
            .andThen(profileService.getProfiles()) (3)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .subscribe(
                { profiles -&gt;
                    displayProfiles(profiles) (4)
                },
                { throwable -&gt;
                    Log.e("HomeActivity", throwable.message ?: "onError")
                }
            )
    )
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Create a new profile.


2
Send the new profile to the API. This method doesn’t return an <code>Observable</code>, but it returns a <code>Completable</code>. The difference between the two is explained below this code snippet.


3
Once the profile is created on the API, request all the profiles from the API.


4
Display the new list of profiles, including the one you just created. You will implement this method in the next section of this blog post.


 
 
 
 
<p>In the example above, you used <code>Completable</code>. It’s a type of observable that has only two consumers, <code>onComplete</code> and <code>onError</code>, as opposed to <code>Observable</code> which has three consumers (<code>onNext</code>, <code>onError</code> and <code>onComplete</code>).</p>
 
 
<p>You can look at <code>Completable</code> as a data stream for which you don’t care about the possible events that can be emitted. You don’t even care if multiple events are being emitted in a time interval. You only care if at least one item has been emitted or if the data stream has failed. This is different from <code>Observable</code>; in <code>Observable</code>, you do care about all the events that have been emitted in a time interval, hence the naming of the method in which you receive the result, <code>onNext</code>. This indicates that the transmission of the data isn’t over, but rather that a new item has been emitted.</p>
 
 
<p>With <code>Completable</code>, you simply want to know when an operation is done. Here is a simple example. You created a profile and you submitted it to the API. You already know what that profile is, and you just want to know when it’s created on the API, so you can fetch the most recent profiles list and display it on the UI.</p>
 
 
 
 Delete a Profile 
 
<p>Code for deleting is practically the same as the one for creating the profile. The only difference is the API call that is being made. The rest of the logic is the same, once the <code>deleteProfile()</code> completes, fetch the profiles and display them on the UI. Add the <code>deleteProfiles()</code> method:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
private fun deleteProfile(profile: Profile) {
    compositeDisposable.add(
        profileService.deleteProfile(profile.id) (1)
            .andThen(profileService.getProfiles())
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .subscribe(
                { profiles -&gt;
                    displayProfiles(profiles)
                },
                { throwable -&gt;
                    Log.e("HomeActivity", throwable.message ?: "onError")
                }
            )
    )
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Send the id of the profile you want to delete to the method that does the delete API call.


 
 
 
 
 
 Update a Profile 
 
<p>Updating profiles is similar to creating a profile; you’ll create a new profile and do the update API call with the id of the profile you want to update. Add the <code>updateProfile()</code> method like this:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
private fun updateProfile(oldProfile: Profile) {
    val profile = ProfileRequest(email = System.currentTimeMillis().toString())
    compositeDisposable.add(
        profileService.updateProfile(oldProfile.id, profile) (1)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .subscribe(
                { newProfiles -&gt;
                    displayUpdatedProfile(oldProfile, newProfiles.first()) (2)
                },
                { throwable -&gt;
                    Log.e("HomeActivity", throwable.message ?: "onError")
                }
            )
    )
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Sends the newly created profile to the method that updates the profile on the API, along with the old profile’s id.


2
Don’t worry about this method, you’ll implement it in the next section.


 
 
 
 
<p>And that’s it! You’ve implemented all the logic and now it’s time to add a simple UI.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Set Up the Android UI 
 
 
<p>In order for you to display the list of profiles, the UI of the <code>HomeActivity</code> will be changed a bit. Please replace the contents of the <code>activity_home</code> file (found in <code>app/src/main/res/layout</code>) with the following code:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  tools:context=".HomeActivity"&gt;

  &lt;TextView
    android:id="@+id/userLabel"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="54dp"
    android:layout_weight="0"
    android:layout_marginTop="16dp"
    android:gravity="center"
    android:textSize="22sp"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText"
    tools:text="Hello, user!" /&gt;

  &lt;androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
    android:id="@+id/profilesRecyclerView" (1)
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="0dp"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    app:layoutManager="androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager"
    tools:itemCount="4"
    tools:listitem="@layout/item_profile" /&gt;

  &lt;LinearLayout
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:paddingBottom="16dp"
    android:paddingTop="16dp"
    android:orientation="horizontal"&gt;

    &lt;com.google.android.material.button.MaterialButton
      android:id="@+id/createProfileButton" (2)
      android:layout_width="0dp"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:layout_weight="1"
      android:layout_marginStart="32dp"
      android:layout_marginEnd="16dp"
      android:text="Create profile"
      tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;

    &lt;com.google.android.material.button.MaterialButton
      android:id="@+id/signOutButton" (3)
      android:layout_width="0dp"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:layout_weight="1"
      android:layout_marginStart="16dp"
      android:layout_marginEnd="32dp"
      android:text="Log out"
      tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;

  &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</code> 
 
 
 


1
This is the recycler view, which will display the profiles.


2
This is the create profile button.


3
This is the sign-out button that ends the user’s session.


 
 
 
 
<p>Next, create a new layout file that represents a single profile in the list. Call it <code>item_profile.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="72dp"
  android:orientation="horizontal"
  tools:context=".HomeActivity"&gt;

  &lt;TextView
    android:id="@+id/profileNameLabel"
    android:layout_width="0dp"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:layout_marginStart="16dp"
    android:layout_gravity="center"
    android:textSize="18sp"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText"
    tools:text="Test username" /&gt;

  &lt;com.google.android.material.button.MaterialButton
    android:id="@+id/updateProfileButton" (1)
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginEnd="8dp"
    android:layout_gravity="center"
    android:text="Update"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;

  &lt;com.google.android.material.button.MaterialButton
    android:id="@+id/deleteProfileButton" (2)
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginEnd="8dp"
    android:layout_gravity="center"
    android:text="Delete"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</code> 
 
 
 


1
Button that updates the email of the profile.


2
Button that deletes the profile.


 
 
 
 
<p>Now you need to create an adapter that will display the list of profiles on the UI. Call it <code>ProfilesAdapter</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample

import android.view.LayoutInflater
import android.view.View
import android.view.ViewGroup
import android.widget.TextView
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model.Profile

class ProfilesAdapter(
    private val onDeleteClickListener: (Profile) -&gt; Unit,
    private val onUpdateClickListener: (Profile) -&gt; Unit
) : RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;ProfilesAdapter.ViewHolder&gt;() {

    val items = mutableListOf&lt;Profile&gt;()

    class ViewHolder(view: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(view) {
        val name: TextView = view.findViewById(R.id.profileNameLabel)
        val updateButton: TextView = view.findViewById(R.id.updateProfileButton)
        val deleteButton: TextView = view.findViewById(R.id.deleteProfileButton)
    }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(viewGroup: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {
        val view = LayoutInflater.from(viewGroup.context).inflate(R.layout.item_profile, viewGroup, false)
        return ViewHolder(view)
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(viewHolder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        with(viewHolder) {
            name.text = items[position].email
            deleteButton.setOnClickListener {
                onDeleteClickListener.invoke(items[position])
            }
            updateButton.setOnClickListener {
                onUpdateClickListener.invoke(items[position])
            }
        }
    }

    override fun getItemCount() = items.size
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now it’s time to connect everything together in the <code>HomeActivity</code>. Add the following code snippets:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
class HomeActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private var adapter = ProfilesAdapter(
        onDeleteClickListener = { profile -&gt; deleteProfile(profile) },
        onUpdateClickListener = { profile -&gt; updateProfile(profile) }
    )

    ...

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ...
        binding.createProfileButton.setOnClickListener { createProfile() }
        binding.profilesRecyclerView.adapter = adapter
    }

    ...

    private fun displayProfiles(profiles: List&lt;Profile&gt;) {
        adapter.items.clear()
        adapter.items.addAll(profiles)
        adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()
    }

    private fun displayUpdatedProfile(oldProfile: Profile, newProfile: Profile) {
        val index = adapter.items.indexOfFirst { profileToReplace -&gt;
            profileToReplace.email == oldProfile.email
        }
        adapter.items[index] = newProfile
        adapter.notifyItemChanged(index)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>And that’s it! The result is a reactive Android app that connects to your local API. Now, run the app, click on the sign-in button, enter the credential of your user, and log in.</p>

 Learn More About RxJava and Android 
 
 
<p>RxJava is one of the most popular libraries on Android, and there is good reason for it. The concepts it introduces go way beyond Android development, but its application fits perfectly for it, and mobile development in general. If you look at it that way, all the work that a phone does is a data stream. From communication with network APIs and caching data in the local database, to handling user inputs and processing huge amounts of data, almost everything can be looked at as a data stream.</p>
 
 
<p>The tricky part is how to combine and manipulate those data streams, in a way that is clean, easy to maintain, and understand. RxJava gives us all that and more. It’s proven as a robust, scalable, and production-ready framework. It has its disadvantages, the most obvious being its steep learning curve and its size and complexity, which isn’t always needed for many apps. But once you grasp its concepts and set it up properly in your codebase, it will become a quite powerful tool for writing complex logic.</p>

 Transitioning from Sustainable Biotech to Web3 
<p>Mathieu: All right, Caspar. As a starting point, I would be interested to hear about your background and how you found your way into blockchain and Self-sovereign Identity. I know that not too long ago, in a past life, you did Ph.D. research in sustainable biotech innovation. I’d love to hear about that. I’m quite interested in the biotechnology space as a whole, and I’m interested to hear about you going through the process; what research you did, and what you published in that space. How did you transition out of the space, and how did you find your way into this Web 3 world?</p>
<p>Caspar: Thank you for having me, Mathieu. My background has indeed had a few turns. Before I founded <a href="https://www.gimly.io/">Gimly</a> two years ago, I was doing my Ph.D. research at the University of Groningen. I have a background in biomedical science. However, while I was doing my master’s, and afterwards, I pivoted away from the laboratory type of work, more towards the social sciences. I was asking questions such as, “What is knowledge? And, why do some artifacts of knowledge end up being successful and embraced by a wider majority, and others remain unembraced and never accepted — less successful?” I was interested in the understanding that this isn’t really about one type of knowledge being better than the others. Rather, it’s more about the context around it and the societal systems around it; the alignment of stakeholders around it.</p>
<p>How strong is your network of stakeholders when you’re thinking of something new? That all influences how our knowledge is shaped. From that perspective, I started focusing on a field called ‘Science and Technology Studies’. That’s all about the co-evolution of society and technology and politics, and how they all influence each other. That’s a topic that I usually find interesting, and also now in blockchain industry and innovation.</p>
<p>You’re right. At the time, the research was about biotechnology. The question was around the ways in which biotech innovation is shaped by the societal context and political context, specifically in African countries. That was a topic focusing on genetic modification of crops and how all kinds of political narratives and societal narratives around this technology are very much shaping its innovation.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s super interesting. We often see good examples of cross-disciplines or amalgamation, and it’s not only one thing that is the driver. There’s a very good COVID-topical piece about the fact that different aerosol scientists were trying to drive forward the thinking that this was a virus that was carried in the air. It outlines the troubles they had getting people to believe that and looks at how they had to involve historical data and research. So, when you start talking about societal context or involving the social sciences around a science like biotechnology, that is quite interesting. As you moved towards the chain and Self-sovereign Identity space, it’s quite true that you have all these different layers that play together. It’s not like, “Yeah, I’m doing technology now.”</p>
<p>Caspar: Yes, absolutely. I do want to make it clear to the listeners and to put it out there for clarity; after four years of Ph.D. research, I didn’t finish the Ph.D. Part of the reason for that is that I felt it was becoming very difficult to continue pursuing my theoretical interest in these types of questions. I wanted to explore questions around why certain innovations are taking place and what the drivers might be behind that. More often than not, the drivers are not, per se, an objective view on what is best. Often, the drivers are economic and political, or sometimes, what is convenient or coincidental at the time. That became a bit more difficult. Meanwhile, in my free time, I had become very interested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. I had started reading more and more and spending an increasing amount of time on the topic of discovering more on this blockchain technology, to identify why it is so interesting and potentially disruptive.</p>
<p>I also wanted to look into how decentralization, blockchain technology, and, of course, Self-sovereign Identity can be differentiated from many of these other technological revolutions that have been previously hailed as ‘THE’ next revolution, democratizing the world and resolving poverty. There are a lot of cross-pollinations in those interests, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>Mathieu: As we talk about societal context, there are clearly a lot of social movements where people generally are becoming more socially aware; people want to have more transparency, more insight and information into the items that they buy or purchase. They want to have more visibility and transparency in the different relationships that they have. They care more about social responsibility today.</p>
<p>So, you have all these trends that, on a societal level, align very well with the whole Web 3.0, or blockchain; call it whatever you want. What were some initial use cases once you got into Bitcoin? I think it’s a similar story, with most people getting into Bitcoin or Ethereum or some other project. I’m always curious; if someone starts a project outside of those two, what drew them to that?</p>
<p>When people get into the space, you start understanding how fundamentally different these decentralized properties are for storing assets and then being able to do other stuff with them. What were some of the initial use cases that interested you on the enterprise side?</p>
<p>Did you see that these were some things that you thought you could contribute to or help build?</p>
 Using NFC &amp; Blockchain: 
<p>Caspar: At the beginning of my journey, my interest went out towards the nexus of the physical and the digital worlds. That is, you have the immutability of the blockchain; but then, what happens at this interface of the digital blockchain when it starts touching on the physical world? What type of data do you get in there in the first place? How can people, or machines, or organizations interact with this blockchain technology? How do you connect those difficult-to-connect worlds?</p>
<p>As a result, I was looking a lot at solutions where, for example, IOT sensors are being connected to blockchains. Quite early after I started Gimly, I ran into Tangem. Tangem is a Swiss manufacturer of NFC (Near Field Communications) chips that have the capability to sign a blockchain transaction right in their NFC chip. At the time, they were mostly using it for what is still the most well-known use case; signing cryptocurrency transactions. In that way, you would basically have a crypto hardware wallet on your NFC card. You could sign a transaction by tapping that card, or you could give that card to someone else. When you do that, you hand over the cryptocurrencies that are on that wallet because you’re handing over the private key which is inside the chip.</p>
<p>Immediately, I said, “Well, that’s very interesting,” and indeed, I haven’t seen any other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">NFC</a> chip that can do that. There are some similar chips that can be connected to blockchain, but, the signing and the private key management happen somewhere in the cloud or on the server. I thought it was interesting, but I also determined that it’s even more interesting for these supply chain use cases, to connect the physical goods shipments in a secure and immutable way to their digital twins within the blockchain network.</p>
<p>So, that was the first topic of interest: the supply chain and provenance and anti-counterfeit capabilities. Quite quickly, that led me to the topic of Self-sovereign Identity. I was thinking about identities for objects, and ways for people (humans, but also machines) to identify themselves in a blockchain system. I ended up being focused on Self-sovereign Identity as the core building block for pretty much everything related to the future of the internet.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think you and I had similar entry points into Self-sovereign Identity, by looking at these decentralized use cases, and seeing that certain properties were potentially missing the main property to do with verifiability. It’s great that I’m building a supply chain system, and I’m trying to increase the transparency in a supply chain; I’m trying to give more visibility to the end consumers, or even regulators, throughout the supply chain or whoever is a stakeholder there. It’s great that I have an immutable record, but it’s the same old concept: if it’s garbage data, then you’re going to get garbage data out of it. How do you control the data inputs coming in? Through that property of verifiability, so it’s the same thing.</p>
<p>Is the whole concept, then, that with these NFC chip cards, you could essentially transplant that concept into an IOT device to ensure that it’s the right IOT device that’s signing off on transactions? Is that the idea?</p>
<p>Caspar: That’s definitely one of the ideas that I’m exploring for more longer-term. Yes, exactly that — to have the same capabilities. That is, to have an embedded a private key in a secure element within the IOT device, and be able to verify the identity or the source of your IOT data through an <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-for-organizations/">SSI mechanism</a>. That’s the longer-term, broader vision when talking about the supply chain, for sure.</p>
<p>There are smaller steps in between. I don’t feel I need to do everything with the chips directly, but they do open up a lot of potential for Self-sovereign Identity in many more use cases. These may be in supply chain and enterprise, but there are also other use cases. For example, use cases where you don’t want to rely solely on the use of personal smartphones, either, because not everyone in this whole world has a smartphone. Sometimes, we tend to forget that when talking about Self-sovereign Identity, which has such an important philosophical background.</p>
<p>I find it important to realize that a lot of the things that we are developing and working on now, are very much focused on the use of personal smartphones. For the time being, that will be largely for a small proportion of this world. It’s possible that using these cards as a way to identify and verify yourself could contribute to that. I’m also very realistic that even for the time being, with the use of these smart cards, you will probably also want to have a smartphone, in order to be able to manage the credentials that you’re sharing, or not. I have one project running; we’re using these cards when there’s a single purpose. For example, they could work as a student ID card, and then they would also work for students who do not have a smartphone.</p>
<p>There are some complexities in there; I’m very well aware of that. However, I think it’s interesting and important to explore how we can expand the concept of Self-sovereign Identity more broadly than just for smartphones.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Good point. I think it does open up a lot of other use cases, if we talk about financial inclusivity use cases or, you mentioned, single-purpose use cases. Building access is a single-purpose use case; potentially, it’s a much more straightforward implementation than selling a mobile or some other type of wallet, to an enterprise that doesn’t want to have their data or their assets sitting outside of their four digital walls. It also opens up a space we see a lot more discussion about right now, which are the connection-less use cases. When you talk about <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallets-and-internationalizing-ssi-products/">mobile SSI wallets</a>, today, they basically do two things: they help you manage your credentials, and they help you manage your connections. However, there are certainly some use cases that are very valid and valuable, without having the need to have a connection.</p>
<p>Caspar: This is a very important use case for Gimly. We see this as a way to enable <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">Self-sovereign Identity in enterprise settings</a>, where we don’t want your employees to run around with their personal mobile phone, signing off on potentially sensitive data, or every time that they need to identify themselves, such as when they pick up a shipment (to stick with the supply chain use case). When employees are using company-managed devices on the premises, then we propose to use these cards for the employees to log in and to sign with their personal card. The card is connected to their personal identity, or their employee identity; however, you want to structure this, of course. They can log in with that card into the application on the company-managed device, and then two hours later, a different employee can log into that same device, signing off with their own decentralized identifier, for example. That’s another very important direction that I see this going.</p>
<p>Mathieu: In any use case where you have a quadrant of high volume/low volume and high risk/low risk, it could make sense to adopt something like that into a high-volume and low-risk type of transaction. For example, getting into a building; it’s probably just like signing off on a shipment.</p>
<p>I find it quite interesting; the supply chain use cases can be difficult, because of the different fragmentation that inherently exists within any mature supply chain. Where there’s a lot of specialization across the supply chain, generally, there are tons of different organizations and people involved. That means there are tons of different systems involved. When you start going down into the ERP rabbit hole, you can get lost in the complexity, and you realize that, “Wow, that’s a crazy space.” Potentially, without suggesting that you’re going to connect all these ERP systems together to get transparency, you could simply use the signing with credentials to create some type of a chain of verifiable credentials, instead of having everything sitting on a blockchain. Was this the particular use case that you ran through?</p>
<p>Earlier, you were describing the Momentum 2020 event; that was all about physical world stuff, but due to COVID, it had to go digital. What did you do at this event, and was it this exact supply chain use case? </p>
<p>Caspar: Yes, it was. Indeed, that was Odyssey Momentum, which used to be one of the largest physical hackathons, at least in Europe. But, that was also very much about the physical experience of being in that old factory in England. Of course, then came COVID, so it was postponed a few times. Ultimately, they decided to give it an entirely new direction and make it a fully virtual event, and since then, it has become Momentum.</p>
<p>The idea behind that, is not to have it as a single moment in time where people do a one-time trick, and after that, it’s over. The idea is to really build ecosystems, and keep the momentum of innovation continuing. So, now it was fully virtual.</p>
<p>We participated in the KLM challenge for a compliant air cargo flow, and we proposed to use these Tangem cards as a physical identifier in Self-sovereign Identity. That’s pretty much in the way that I just described it, where you could use it for an employee to log in or to sign off on a certain shipment.</p>
<p>In fact, we won the challenge as one of two teams. The other team was CryptoMice, who developed or proposed a solution to track a shipment and to analyze if there are any potential red flags. For example, if in the electronic data, it was stated that Shipper A is going to pick it up, but now we see that Shipper B picked it up, so maybe we need to look into that in more detail. Very roughly speaking, that was their proposal. I hope I don’t make them angry by describing it in that way. Using our ‘signature’ from the employees could then feed into that analysis tool.</p>
<p>We did quite a lot of work on the use case, together with KLM and DHL. However, then came COVID, and still, it’s COVID, so things got a bit stalled and slowed down. It’s still on the shelf somewhere, I think, but I hope to pick that up again with them someday.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s a really good use case. Simply being able to use the cards to sign off on it, too: it’s back to the connections use case, potentially, for a chief compliance officer or someone to review afterwards. It doesn’t need to be done all on the spot. It’s not for every use case; you need to have the proof requests, and the verification, and that decision at that point right away. However, there are some use cases, where potentially I just want to log stuff for it to be audited later, but I want to have verifiability of who actually signed off on these things. I find that super cool.</p>
<p>Caspar: Yes. It is also an offline use case, or a semi-offline use case, where one party is offline, but the other party is online, and where you do the immediate verification. This would be like the example that you gave to enter a building, or when someone is coming to pick up a shipment at the Schiphol Terminal. Then, the driver doesn’t need to be fully connected, but, of course, the receiving party will manage that connection.</p>
 Europe’s SSI Ecosystem 
<p>Mathieu: Would you mind talking about the European ecosystem, overall? It’s of interest to me, being in Canada. There are many European listeners here, but we have a lot of listeners in North America as well, who are either in the public or private sector. I think, overall, what’s happening in the EU right now is extremely exciting, with the momentum and the investment and the traction we’re starting to see. Would you mind talking about how you fit into the European SSI ecosystem, and what are some of the organizations or ecosystems that you’re part of, or that you really see momentum behind?</p>
<p>Caspar: Sure. Your community here in Canada is an inspiring example in terms of Self-sovereign Identity, but you are right; in Europe, there’s also a lot of momentum and <a href="https://northernblock.io/removing-roadblocks-to-ssi-adoption/">traction for Self-sovereign Identity</a>. There’s a lot of public interest, and also governmental interests, specifically in terms of funding. I shouldn’t even try to explain the funding ecosystem in Europe, but there are a lot of funding programs; most of them are bundled under the grand Horizon 2020 initiative, as it has been called up to now. The new program is going to be called Horizon Europe, I believe.</p>
<p>If you look into several of the more recent goals in a lot of the programs, Self-sovereign Identity and the principles behind Self-sovereign Identity are really a core concept in those goals. Not all of them will mention it as explicitly as some others; one of the most explicit ones is <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/">eSSIF-Lab</a>, the European Self-sovereign Identity Framework program. I am participating there now, in the second infrastructure call — that’s one big one. There are a few more; there was also the NGI (Next Generation Identity) ONTOCHAIN project, where we made a Self-sovereign Identity proposal, because it was also about trust and verifiability and data exchange. There are a lot of programs like that, that are really <a href="https://northernblock.io/">focusing on Self-sovereign Identity</a>. Let’s see, what else is there?</p>
<p>I think it might be interesting to share this also: we started two years ago, and from the start, my focus has been very much on collaboration; building partnerships, and working with other companies that have certain expertise. One of those companies has been Sphereon. Sphereon is a Dutch company that has been in the space a bit longer than I have. They’ve had a lot of <a href="https://northernblock.io/about/">experience in Self-sovereign Identity</a>, and in infrastructure building and components building, and we collaborated quite a bit. We also participated together in the first eSSIF-Lab call, which was mostly focused on business solutions. There was a project with Off-Blocks, where Sphereon is the technology provider.</p>
<p>Since then, things have moved quite nicely, to be able to develop new things and to make new proposals in these NGI (Next Generation Identity) programs. In fact, there’s an NGI Atlantic program coming up, which is aiming to foster cross-Atlantic collaboration. This could be something that you and I might want to explore. Do you have specific questions about the European ecosystem on SSI?</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think the one that I personally see a lot of material come out of is the eSSIF-Lab ecosystem. Is the eSSIF-Lab defining what a governance framework or looks like in its funding projects? What is the role of eSSIF-Lab? Is it effectively an incubator type of organization?</p>
<p>Caspar:  Well, it’s both. eSSIF-Lab has two tracks: one is focused on the infrastructure, and the other one is focused on business applications. The second one is really more of an incubator-type where project proposals are made. It’s also a contest. You start with something like 17 teams participating, I think, and then in two or three different steps, more and more teams get eliminated. The idea, there, is to also help the teams in their business development, in sharpening their business plan, and on product-to-market fit.</p>
<p>The other track is the infrastructure track; that’s where Gimly is participating now. We’re building an open-source SSI / NFC bridge, which of course relies on the NFC chips that we talked about before. We aim to make it possible to implement these NFC cards easily into any Self-sovereign Identity solution or platform. That’s very much a track that is focused on open source, and it’s also focused on defining the European Self-sovereign Identity framework. So, it’s a bit more about different types of wallets, and more and more on the infrastructure side rather than on the application side.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Got it. It’s great that there’s a business side as well, looking at business focus and product/market fit. One of the bigger challenges with any new or revolutionary type of technology is finding fit, and that’s not simply trying to ‘push tech.’</p>
<p>Now, I’d like to switch a little bit; I think it’s still loosely on the topic of trust and verifiability. We’ve been talking a lot about NFC, and let’s just switch the acronym slightly. Rather than talking about NFC, let’s jump over to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) — which is a totally different space. However, I think that a lot of the stuff that you’ve been talking about is applicable here. You wrote a piece on something happening in the NFT space recently. Do you mind talking about what the problem statement is behind what you had written in your piece?</p>
 Verifiable Credentials Use Cases for NFTs 
<p>Caspar: Yes, definitely. I think <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFTs</a> are very exciting; if not for the technology itself, then definitely for the movement that it’s bringing about, and the new opportunities and new ways of approaching art and artists, for example. I find that very interesting.</p>
<p>At the same time, with NFTs, there are some issues that I believe remain to be resolved. <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/nfts-the-need-for-self-sovereign-identity">The article that I wrote</a> was a blog post that I wrote together with Jack Tanner, our Tech Lead at Gimly. It takes an example where someone took a screenshot from an artist’s work, from Petek, who is a bitcoin artist. She makes beautiful artworks representing the stock-to-flow model from Plan B, and she uses all kinds of very rare materials. She uses the stock-to-flow data points in the artwork, and creates limited editions. People have been asking her,” Hey, when are you going to make an NFT?”</p>
<p>However, we were talking about, “Okay, but NFTs, what does it really mean? What is so special about NFT, and what does it convey actual ownership of to you? What do you prove ownership of? Basically, you’re proving ownership over that NFT, and you can prove that there’s only one of those NFTs. However, it’s a lot more difficult to prove that there’s only one of those objects, be it digital or physical, that the NFT is referring to. This becomes even more difficult when you’re talking about physical objects, of course. Obviously, I would have a solution there, of using these NFC chips and implementing those into physical objects. But, that still doesn’t resolve one key issue; when you create the NFT, it’s very difficult to also verify that the creator of that NFT is actually legitimate. Is that person who created the NFT legitimately authorized to convey ownership over the object that it’s conveying ownership over? In this use case, we saw that someone had simply taken a screenshot of her artwork, put an NFT on it, and tried to sell it on Wareable.com. They didn’t succeed, because some fans of Petek contacted her and asked her, “Hey, did you really make an NFT?” and she said, “No, I didn’t.” It turned out to be a scammer, and then the screenshot with NFT was taken off of Wareable.</p>
<p>What this illustrates, is that NFTs lack some type of identity layer, where you can verify the creator of the NFT, and the legitimacy of the NFT. Now, of course, some people will say that you can look up the public key of the first owner, and then you will see that he or she created multiple NFTs. Yes, that may be true, but there’s no way for an average consumer to instantly see the authenticity and the legitimacy of this NFT. I think that’s a very important aspect. It doesn’t mean an absolute no-go, but there is this idea around NFTs that because of the NFT technology, it is impossible to defraud, so to speak. In the current hype, I think that opens up a lot of possibilities for all kinds of scams. I would be interested in solving that by ensuring a connection to a verifiable identity of the creator, and the buyer, or the seller. I think that would be very interesting to explore.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It only increases the value of these things, if you have verifiability behind the creator of it. There are the ones that make the news, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8p1B8NHLFQ">Christie’s auctioning the Beeple compilation of digital artwork for 69 million dollars</a>. Just last week, there was another one that went for some tens of millions; I think that they were just avatars. But, they’re going through Christie’s.</p>
<p>Christie’s is an established auction dealer of art; so that is interesting, where there’s more that goes into it than just the technology. People trust Christie’s. Christie’s has been doing this for however long, and they’re reputable. If Christie’s is saying, “Hey, we’re selling this piece of art,” there’s a level of trust that this is a legitimate piece of art — this is a one-of-one, or whatever the different properties are. I think, then, when you start getting to more direct sales (which is the whole promise of a blockchain) is that you could go directly to creator-to-consumer. I don’t need to go through a broker or an intermediary. Maybe someone like Christie’s performed a valuable service, and made sure that they got the right marketing, and the price of that thing went up, I’m sure. But, for more community-driven initiatives, or grassroots initiatives, where people are trying to sell ownership or a stake into digitally-native assets, whether it’s a piece of art or whether it’s a piece of music or whatever it is, that’s where I think you’ve said it correctly: for the average consumer, it’s so easy to fall victim to phishing, or account takeovers, or to stuff like that.</p>
<p>Caspar: I also find that the Christie’s example, and there’s also SuperRare: these platforms that do the due diligence, they will make sure that the one that’s creating the NFT, that’s creating the artwork, is also the legitimate creator. So, in those cases, it’s a bit less important.</p>
<p>I have a good friend of mine; Hessel Stuut. He’s a digital artist, and he made a really cool digital video that went viral, where you see Amsterdam as if Amsterdam is surrounded by mountains, which it is not. We live in the Netherlands, and it’s completely flat. Hessel was on a podcast just one week ago, with John Crane from SuperRare, and one of the things that Hessel and I were also discussing, was about this verification of identity. In the case of a SuperRare web platform, it is a bit less of an issue. However, at the same time, the whole idea behind NFTs for artwork is to enable any artist to become successful, in a decentralized world. That’s one of the arguments of why NFTs are good for art. But then again, if you end up needing to be part of these curated platforms like Christie’s or SuperRare, then that defeats the purpose of “anyone can get funded.” I think that’s two different directions, you could say. I fully see the value of a platform like SuperRare, and at the same time, it’s also slightly contrarian to what NFTs are about.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think the Christie’s example is an interesting one because, on one side, you’re using a blockchain as an immutable store for the asset itself. Being a piece of digital art, you could be using smart contracts around that token, around that smart contract itself, too. So, you’re using a blockchain to store an asset, as well as potentially for some other computation. The trust, in this case, is in the physical world because I’m trusting that Christie’s has done the proper due diligence, as you described. Everything is legal, and I trust that. When I don’t have that physical trust, and I’m looking to create digital trust, that’s where I see Self-sovereign Identity being quite interesting. Although, some could argue that if you have compliance or due diligence, these other things take away from the self-sovereignty of a blockchain overall. However, you’re able to create digital trust by simply having the right credentials there, at least to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Caspar: Don’t get me wrong, I’m not anti-NFTs. I think it’s a very interesting technology. I think in many use cases, where they are used for verification or authentication of something, you’ll be better off using verifiable credentials in the SSI system than NFTs. However, in some other use cases, like in art, I think it’s a very legitimate and interesting development.</p>
<p>One of my oldest partners is Europechain: it’s an EOSIO-powered blockchain that aims to be the first, or maybe the only, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant blockchain. They’re also working on several NFT projects, where they very much focus on getting all these legal questions around it in order. For example, what happens if the creator decides to make another NFT of exactly the same piece of art? NFTs are not going to prevent an artist from creating two NFTs, where he says he was planning to make one. Of course, there are social systems that will prevent that, because the artist would be throwing rocks in his own windows — that’s probably a different expression in English. There’s a social system around it, that prevents artists from scamming in that way, so to speak, but there are still legal questions, such as,” What does it mean that I own something, that you own something, that you get ownership over a piece of art or a piece of music? Are you allowed to display it? And, if so, in which ways?” These are all interesting things that you need to consider as an artist, if you’re thinking to NFT your work. Yes, there’s some work to be done there.</p>
<p>Mathieu: You could add more and more layers; for example, using verifiable credentials and using different mechanisms, for even more digital trust for some of the problems we’re discussing here regarding NFCs. I think we agreed that using an NFC as an identifier may be a whole other question. Acronyms are kind of mixing now; it’s tough to follow all these acronyms. However, you could digitize more and more, where I’m really trying to create as much digital trust as possible, but you still always have to have that element of human trust.</p>
<p>I think this is something you’ve said yourself, too, that NFTs don’t solve legal requirements. You still need to have a human system, or another system above this digitally native, automated system, to manage the governance, and the legal rules, and all this stuff above it.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about Self-sovereign Identity, or <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials-for-fintech/">verifiable credentials in the decentralized finance space</a>? Is that something that you thought about, and would you know just a simple use case? I see there could be value there. In that DeFi space, we’re able to conduct all sorts of different financial transactions, without relying on a bank to do so. It’s peer-to-peer, but if I want to lend to someone, or I’m lending crypto to someone, I want to make sure they have a certain reputation or a certain credit score, for example. It seems like that could be done in a Self-sovereign way as well. Have you thought about that whole space?</p>
 Using SSI for DeFi 
<p>Caspar: Yes, absolutely. I think that’s again why I referred to Self-sovereign Identity as a pivotal building block, for anything related to the future of the internet and Web3, actually. Exactly as you’ve said; there is also a need for identity in DeFi, and of course, there are different levels of identity. SSI doesn’t mean that you need to disclose your passport number with every DeFi transaction. Rather, it’s a way of reputation management, and I see a lot of potential in there as well. Nothing too concrete, at the moment, to talk about in terms of ongoing projects, but I absolutely agree with you; that’s an important building block in DeFi as well. I’ll be curious to see what happens; you’ve probably seen the launch of Bullish Global, the new exchange from Block.one, the company behind the technology?</p>
<p>Mathieu: I haven’t seen that; what is that about?</p>
<p>Caspar: Well, I should have read more about it before stating this, actually. They’re calling it the pro-finance, regulated DeFi, let’s say. It’s a new type of exchange. They just raised a good sum of money to bring this to market — around 10 billion was put into this. I’ll be curious to see how they will be handling this identification part; if their aim is to enable decentralized finance, but ensure compliance with all kinds of global regulations, there must be some SSI component in there, as well.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think that’s a huge market for SSI. Especially if you look at the top exchanges out there today; just naming a couple, such as Binance or Coinbase, for example. They’re all central companies that are managing this, and managing the compliance and onboarding of users to allow them to get into the crypto world. But, it doesn’t protect the sovereignty of an individual; where you’re going into a site, and you’re giving them your driver’s license, or your passport, or whatever information, and they are reporting that, too. We could argue about what you should or should not be reporting; that’s a whole different topic.</p>
<p>It doesn’t ensure sovereignty, so that is quite interesting. If you could come into a crypto exchange, you could prove something through a credential. Maybe you might be partially disclaiming something, but that checks the box for their compliance. I would be quite interested to keep exploring that.</p>
<p>Caspar: Yes, absolutely. I think many of us have copies of their passports with dozens of more or less reputable exchanges. Especially if you’ve been in the space for more than two years, like before the bear market, you probably have your passports at quite a few exchanges that actually no longer exist, so who knows what happens there. But, yes, I agree with you. It’s something to keep an eye on, where a lot of benefits might be possible for multiple parties.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think the users of these systems get it, anyways. It feels like an easier sale, sometimes. For someone that’s already sold on crypto for different reasons, being sold on decentralized identity should be very easy to understand and digest. So, when you talk about gaining more adoption of Self-sovereign Identity, that is an interesting crowd. You can really see people buying into that a lot quicker, just because they understand it right away; they already think about this stuff.</p>
<p>Caspar: That’s true, yes.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Caspar, thank you very much for doing this with me today. I very much enjoyed this conversation, and I look forward to doing this again.</p>
<p>Caspar: Yes, thank you, and I look forward to it.</p>

 Case study: Gravity’s work with refugees in Turkey featured in latest report from Oxford Centre for Technology and Development, “Digital Identity: An Analysis for the Humanitarian Sector” <p>This month, Gravity’s digital ID solution to support refugees in Turkey increase their employment opportunities through digital education profiles is featured in the new report <a href="https://hiplatform.org/blog/2021/5/19/digital-ids-in-the-humanitarian-sector-whats-the-big-deal">“Digital Identity: An Analysis for the Humanitarian Sector”</a> written by the <a href="http://www.octd.co.uk/">Oxford Centre for Technology and Development</a>, commissioned by the <a href="http://IFRC.org%20-%20IFRChttps://www.ifrc.org%20›%20...">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)</a>, and supported by the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">DIGID </a>consortium (Norwegian Red Cross, Norwegian Refugee Council, Norwegian Church Aid, Save the Children&nbsp;Norway).</p><p>The report includes a case study on Gravity’s work to help refugees in Gaziantep, Turkey struggling to find employment because they do no have adequate proof of their educational experiences. As part of a pilot with the <a href="https://www.sdgia.org/">Sustainable Development Goals impact accelerator (SDGia)</a> established by the <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.tr/">Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and the <a href="https://www.undp.org/">United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)</a>, Syrian refugees created verifiable education profiles using Gravity’s digital ID platform that they could then share with potential employers to increase their employment prospects.</p><p>With Gravity, refugees can easily compile all of their education credentials from different livelihood training programmes all in one place and digitally share this information with potential employers to increase their employment and livelihood prospects.</p><p>According to the report written by Aiden Slavin, Franziska Putz and Dr. Emre Eren&nbsp;Korkmaz:</p><p>“Gravity’s work is selected as a case study here because their solution included close collaboration with four other organizations from the start. It thus offered a rife example of interoperability challenges associated with digital ID systems, as well as how the same systems may be used to overcome existing coordination challenges. Moreover, Gravity has made more documentation of this project publicly available.”</p><p>Collaboration is key to real impact and innovation, which is why Gravity builds human-centered digital ID solutions that improve interoperability between organizations. Gravity collaborated with <a href="https://sertifier.com/">Sertifier</a>, <a href="https://www.marklabs.co/">Mark Labs</a>, the <a href="https://www.gso.org.tr/">Gaziantep Chamber of Industry (GSO)</a> and the Gaziantep Chamber of Artisans and Craftsmen (GESOB) to make this work with Syrian refugees in Turkey possible.</p><p>Key takeaways from the report’s analysis of the Gravity case study in&nbsp;Turkey:</p><p>“Gravity’s experience in Gaziantep demonstrates the value of public-private partnerships as well as how substantial interoperability can be achieved without sacrificing data privacy or individuals’ control over their own data. The example also demonstrates a valuable use-case of how digital ID systems can help migrants throughout their&nbsp;journey.</p><p>“Digital ID systems are commonly piloted to support crisis response or more immediate humanitarian assistance, including initial registration for aid as well as short-term assistance, whether in the form of food or cash transfers. Gravity’s work facilitates a vital next step: helping refugees acquire and prove their education and training credentials so they can advance their level of socioeconomic inclusion. Crucially, the Gravity solution was able to help all stakeholders: beneficiaries, aid and training organizations and employers.</p><p>Through a series of expert interviews and case studies, the report shows that digital ID has great potential for use in the humanitarian sector, with benefits to organizations and affected communities alike, while also outlining its limitations and the challenges to overcome.</p><p>It is hoped that this report will be useful to anyone in the humanitarian sector looking to invest in or develop digital identity solutions like Gravity for their organization.</p><p>For the full report and additional readings, please visit the <a href="https://preparecenter.org/resource/digital-identity-an-analysis-for-the-humanitarian-sector/">Prepare Center website</a> hosted by the Global Preparedness Center and the American Red Cross and the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/blog/2021/5/19/digital-ids-in-the-humanitarian-sector-whats-the-big-deal">DIGID&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>Interested in learning how Gravity can help your organization optimize its impact and service delivery? <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/contact-us">Contact our&nbsp;team.</a></p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravity-earth">LinkedIn</a> for recent updates. <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/subscription">Sign up for our Gravity newsletter</a> for the latest Gravity&nbsp;news!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/case-study-gravitys-work-with-refugees-in-turkey-featured-in-latest-oxford-centre-for-technology-ecb515a18464">Case study: Gravity’s work with refugees in Turkey featured in latest report from Oxford Centre for…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth">Gravity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Why Bitcoin&nbsp;matters Image: Bermix&nbsp;Studio<p>A rough week if prices are concerned, but if the scene’s historical price action is any indication, a major correction was probably overdue with all of the intense early market hype concentrated at the beginning of this&nbsp;year.</p><p>My colleague /jvs asked me the other week what my thoughts were on speculation and whether or not it’s good or bad for the industry. Speculation is sort of a bad word — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/china-vows-zero-tolerance-for-commodities-market-violations">especially in China</a>. It’s also one of crypto’s killer features. In creating the opportunity to create digitally native value that isn’t reliant on any central authority, the industry has been able to attract an eye-watering amount of&nbsp;capital.</p><p>The type of people and organizations who would get into this space super early are a unique bunch. Many of those people and organizations have amassed a huge amount of capital — much of which is being recycled back into the system in order to fund and execute on their vision of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>It’s the PayPal Mafia — except blockchain this time&nbsp;around.</p><p>After all, where else are you going to find someone to buy a jpeg for $69&nbsp;million.</p><p>For this new generation of decentralized, digital-native citizens, that’s exactly what they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>We’re still at the early innings of this thing. What will these people want tomorrow? How would they expect their platforms and services to operate? What sort of control and ownership would they demand over their digital&nbsp;lives?</p><p>[Insert something about GlobaliD and digital identity.]</p><p>In that sense, this is a growing cultural movement with a very specific set of values as it is a technological or financial one.</p><p>That’s what the early internet was like,&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>When Netscape went public in 1995, about 14% of Americans had internet&nbsp;access.</p><p>When Coinbase went public in 2021, about 14% of Americans owned a cryptocurrency.</p> 2. Goldman sachs: Bitcoin is a new asset&nbsp;class <p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-is-officially-a-new-asset-class-goldman-sachs-103540636.html">Yahoo</a>:</p><blockquote>“Bitcoin is now considered an investable asset. It has its own idiosyncratic risk, partly because it’s still relatively new and going through an adoption phase,” said Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs’ global head of digital assets, in a new piece of research. “And it doesn’t behave as one would intuitively expect relative to other assets given the analogy to digital gold; to date, it’s tended to be more aligned with risk-on assets. But clients and beyond are largely treating it as a new asset class, which is notable — it’s not often that we get to witness the emergence of a new asset&nbsp;class.”</blockquote> 3.

<p>USD 200,000 worth of Ocean’s &amp; AllianceBlock’s tokens are locked in the MLP, benefiting the community</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="https://allianceblock.io/">AllianceBlock</a> are launching a Mutual Liquidity Pool on POP!, a platform that allows two different token projects to objectively display mutual trust and commitment to each other by locking their respective tokens together to create a trustless Mutual Liquidity Pool (MLP). <a href="https://new.pop.town/">Anyone can join and participate in the MLP on&nbsp;POP!</a></p><p>POP! provides projects with a unique approach to objectively demonstrate their commitment to the partnerships while also providing benefits to their communities. This is done by creating an MLP, whereby users can participate directly through Single-Sided Liquidity Provisioning (SSLP) or through Standard Liquidity Mining. The MLP will cement Ocean’s and AllianceBlock’s already strong partnership while simultaneously providing our communities with a unique opportunity to reap the rewards of our partnership.</p><p>For the creation of our MLP, we have locked together USD 100,000 worth each of our native tokens (OCEAN and ALBT) through POP!’s smart contracts, <a href="https://poptownplatform.medium.com/certiks-audit-results-on-pop-5ee857c852c2">which have been audited by CertiK</a>. In other words, we have created an OCEAN/ALBT Liquidity Pool worth USD 200,000 at the time of writing on Uniswap (V2), which will be reflected on POP!’s platform for user participation. The MLP is running for 85 days from May 25th, 2021 at approx. 13:00 (11:00 UTC) CEST till August 18th, 2021 at approx. 13:00 CEST (11:00&nbsp;UTC).</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p><a href="https://new.pop.town/">The MLP is live and active on the POP! Platform</a>, so OCEAN and ALBT holders can already provide their tokens as single-sided liquidity onto the MLP marketplace. By participating in the MLP as a farmer, holders will receive rewards in 3 tokens: POP!, OCEAN, and ALBT. In addition, should users experience Impermanent Loss (IL), a portion of it will be mitigated through POP!’s unique Rebalancing Mechanism.</p><p><a href="https://gitbook.pop.town/">Take a look at POP!’s detailed Gitbook</a> to get a better understanding of the intricacies behind&nbsp;POP!</p> Building on AllianceBlock’s and Ocean’s partnership <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2020-11-23-allianceblock-partnership-decentralized-capital-markets-compliance">AllianceBlock is building a data pipeline on top of Ocean</a> where user data such as KYC/AML/KYB will be stored and users will be able to use role based access control to give access and revoke access to data. This is part of AllianceBlock’s mission to bridge Traditional Finance and DeFi applications by providing illiquid assets short term financing to high-net worth individuals at private&nbsp;banks.</p><p>DeFi P2P lending applications and traditional equivalent applications will be connected to the AllianceBlock product, and all lenders interested in participating in a specific financing will need to do KYC/AML and get validated by AllianceBlock’s regulatory and compliance tools. Storage and access control to data for lenders will use Ocean Protocol technology, with lenders being able to grant and revoke access to their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Through Ocean Protocol, retail banking APIs will be able to connect to DeFi in a way that is compliant with financial regulations such as PSD2, resulting in new, exciting open banking solutions.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

<p>On May 20th, 2021 <a href="https://eucoc.cloud/en/detail/news/the-eu-cloud-code-of-conduct-becomes-first-gdpr-code-of-conduct-to-receive-green-light-from-data-pro/" title=" it was announced">it was announced</a> that the <a href="https://eucoc.cloud/en/contact/request-the-eu-cloud-code-of-conduct.html" title=" EU Cloud Code of Conduct">EU Cloud Code of Conduct</a> had received official approval by the Belgian Data Protection Authority, following the positive opinion issued by the European Data Protection Board.&nbsp; At the same time, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) comprised of all the European Data Protection Authorities (DPA) <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2021/edpb-adopts-opinions-first-transnational-codes-conduct-statement-data-governance-act_en" title="provided a favourable opinion">provided a favourable opinion</a> that the <a href="https://cispe.cloud/code-of-conduct/" title="CISPE Data Protection Code of Conduct">CISPE Data Protection Code of Conduct</a> complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>This has been a long journey – in 2017 we published a <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb70276/cloud-provider-codes-of-conduct-and-gdpr/" title="Leadership Brief Cloud Provider Codes of Conduct and GDPR">Leadership Brief Cloud Provider Codes of Conduct and GDPR</a>.&nbsp; This compared how the 2 codes of conduct at that time would match the obligations from GDPR which had yet to come into force.&nbsp; Four years on, what is the significance of this announcement to organizations using cloud services?</p>
<p>When using a cloud service, the tenant does not have control over how the service is designed, secured, and run.&nbsp; Therefore, the tenant needs to trust that the cloud service meets their security needs and compliance obligations.&nbsp; These Cloud Codes of Conduct provide transparent frameworks that define the technical and organisational measures that a cloud service must implement to ensure that its processing of tenants’ data will meet the requirements of GDPR.</p>
 
 Good News but with a Caveat 
 
<p>The good news is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The EDPB is of the opinion that both draft codes comply with the GDPR and fulfil the requirements set forth in Art. 40 and 41 GDPR. According to the GDPR, adherence to approved codes of conduct may be used as an element to demonstrate legal compliance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there is still more work to do. The key caveat in the EDPB announcement is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They [the codes of conduct] are not to be used in the context of international transfers of personal data”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When looking at the two codes there are many similarities but some differences. The CISPE Code only covers Infrastructure as a Service while the EU Code of Conduct is more general. To some extent this explains the difference between the CSPs that support the different codes. Unsurprisingly, the CSPs supporting EU Code of Conduct include those providing several different kinds of service (SaaS and PaaS as well as IaaS) which are all covered by this code.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the existence of 2 codes increases the burden on the end user organizations.</p>
<p>The major remaining challenge for organizations using cloud services to hold and process the personal data of EU residents in compliance with GDPR when this involves international transfer of data to Third Countries.&nbsp; This challenge stems from the so called Schrems II judgment and the subsequent EBPB <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="recommendations 01/2020">recommendations 01/2020</a> relating to this.</p>
 
<p></p>
 Independent Verification 
 
<p>Much has been written on the subject of Zero Trust in the context of cyber security.&nbsp; &nbsp;Zero Trust is often defined to mean never trust always verify.</p>
<p>When highly regulated industries use cloud services and for certain kinds of data processed in them it essential for the tenant to be able verify the existence and effectiveness of service controls to demonstrate compliance.&nbsp; However, it is not practical for large CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) to allow tenants to individually audit the services they use, and so tenants must rely on independent third-party attestations that the services comply with standards and regulations.</p>
<p>The Cloud Codes of Conducts described above provide frameworks that have been validated by the EDPB and accepted by EU Data Protection Authorities.&nbsp; This is an important step towards what is needed but validation of the framework is not the same as verification of service compliance.</p>
<p>Currently the CSPs that are members of the framework bodies agree to provide self-certification of compliance.&nbsp; What is needed is independent verification.&nbsp; Setting up the processes for independent verification of compliance with the Codes of Conduct will be the next key step along the journey.</p>
 
 GDPR and Zero Trust Data Processing 
 
<p>The EDPB has not approved the Codes of Conduct in the context of international transfers of personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these circumstances what is needed is Zero Trust Data Processing – Never Trust the Cloud Service where this involves international data transfers.</p>
<p>During processing of the data there are three points at which the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the personal data can be compromised by public authorities in Third Countries:</p>
 
 During its transfer across networks, it may be accessed by third parties including governments. This access may be passive where the contents of the communication are simply copied. However, public authorities may also interpose themselves into the communication process and not only read the content, but also manipulate or suppress parts of it. 
 During its storage, by either accessing the processing facilities themselves, or by requiring the recipient of the data to locate, and extract data of interest and turn it over. 
 During processing, the data could be accessed while it is being used or analysed. For example, when a service is being provided remotely. 
 
<p>Cloud services currently provide controls for the first two of these areas of risk through strong encryption where the tenant has full control over the keys.&nbsp; However, protection during processing depends upon what is being termed as “Confidential Computing”.&nbsp; Confidential Computing is an essential element of Zero Trust Data processing and there are several basic approaches to Confidential Computing:</p>
 
 Trusted environments – such as Intel SGX enclaves and AMD EPYC 3rd&nbsp;Generation CPUs where the data is only decrypted in a protected environment. 
 Pseudonymization&nbsp;–&nbsp;as opposed to&nbsp;anonymization - providing that the&nbsp;addition data needed to reconstitute the relevant (usually personal) data is adequately&nbsp;protected.&nbsp;But not the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/data-pseudonymisation-advanced-techniques-and-use-cases/" title="ENISA recommendations for data pseudonymization advanced techniques and use-cases">ENISA recommendations for data pseudonymization advanced techniques and use-cases</a>. 
 Homomorphic encryption – where the encrypted data can be processed without decryption but with additional computing overheads and usually the need to change the application.
 
 Multi party&nbsp;computing&nbsp;–&nbsp;protocols&nbsp;that split the data into parts that can be processed&nbsp;independently&nbsp;without any of the processors being able to&nbsp;reconstitute any personal data.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>To overcome the concerns processing personal data in third countries under GDPR, as well as those of regulated industries, CSPs will need to provide industrialised and easy to use approaches based on one or more of the above approaches.</p>
 
 Opinion 
 
<p>It is good news that both of these cloud codes of conduct have received approval from European Data Protection Authorities.&nbsp; However, the boards behind these codes of conduct cannot afford to rest on their laurels - they must now work to define and set up independent verification processes to enable cloud tenants to have greater confidence than that provided by self-certification.&nbsp; It is also essential that cloud services provide greater levels of controls – especially for confidential computing - for tenants to implement Zero Trust Data Processing.</p>

<p>Sidetree protocol is an open blockchain-agnostic protocol <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-sidetree-scalable-dpki-for-decentralized-identity-1a9105dfbb58">developed by DIF</a> and supported by Microsoft. The core idea of this protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger&nbsp;system.</p><p>This protocol is designed to overcome many technical problems in existing implementations that include high throughput and cost, presence of centralized authorities, lack of scalability, and more. The Sidetree protocol bridges the need for a decentralized and open protocol as it batches together JSON (a standard for representing structured data) operations to lower the associated costs, improve throughput, enhance scalability, and at the same, allow these operations to be anchored to any decentralized identity&nbsp;network.</p><p>It also helps to create unique identifiers that are controlled and managed by users with their public key infrastructure. Further, it conforms to the W3C specifications, so developers can use the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">decentralized identifier (DID)&nbsp;methods</a>.</p><p>So, now that you have an idea of what is sidetree protocol, let’s delve into its architecture.</p> Sidetree Protocol Architecture <p>Sidetree protocols are layer 2 protocols that anchor to the underlying decentralized ledger system. That said, it is ledger agnostic and its primary role is to anchor batches of signed JSON operations to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>What this essentially means is that using this protocol, you can create tree nodes that sit side by side on the network and perform CRUD (Create, Recover, Update, and Deactivate) operations according to the W3C specifications. These nodes interact with a Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) like IPFS to create, recover, update, and deactivate a DID document stored in&nbsp;it.</p><p>In this sense, the sidetree protocol is wedged between the CAS at the top and the underlying decentralized network at the&nbsp;bottom.</p> Working of a Sidetree&nbsp;Protocol <p>Moving on, let’s understand how this protocol&nbsp;works.</p><p>A transaction can be any of the CRUD operations that are implemented in JSON and signed by the holder/issuer’s public key. Each of these transactions is batched together and stored in a batch&nbsp;file.</p><p>The number of transactions that can be stored in the batch file is limited by the file size. So, developers can determine the size of the batch file depending on the average rate of transactions in the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Next, this batch file is connected to an anchor file that has a Merkle root. Here, a Merkle root is something that’s commonly used in cryptography to ensure that data blocks that are transmitted between peers are unaltered. In this implementation, the Merkle root also verifies that a particular transaction was included in a batch file. These anchor files, in turn, are attached to the anchoring networks.</p><p>As you may have guessed, the anchor file is the only thing that’s associated with the network and the rest of the implementation are ledger-agnostic. So, depending on the ledger you choose, the anchor file will&nbsp;vary.</p><p>An important aspect to note is that the JSON operation is signed by the entity’s public/wallet key while the signed ledger transaction is signed by the sidetree node that’s performing the anchoring operation.</p><p>So, this is how a sidetree protocol&nbsp;works.</p><p>Now comes an important question — how do you access the contents of your DID document?</p><p>Simply reverse the&nbsp;process!</p><p>Start with the ledger and get the hash for the anchor file. From here, get the hash for the batch file, and in it, you can find all the operations related to your DID as they get grouped and are replayed in the order in which they were recorded. From this, you can navigate to your DID document.</p><p>If you look at this reverse anchoring process, the indexing on the anchor file is the key aspect as it helps to weed out corrupted or bad batch files. In fact, the overall process and workflow greatly reduce the chances of&nbsp;errors.</p><p>Next, we’ll explain a bit about how this is implemented in Affinidi.</p> Affinidi’s Implementation of the Sidetree&nbsp;Protocol <p>At Affinidi, we implement sidetree protocol using SidetreeJS, the JavaScript implementation of the Sidetree protocol v0.1.0. Though we did consider using element-api methods, they were deprecated, so we decided to go ahead with SidetreeJS. Also, the fact that it is easier to implement, added to our list of reasons for going with SidetreeJS.</p><p>Our infrastructure consists of SidetreeJS integrated into the DID registry with IPFS as the content addressable storage. On top of it, sits the MongoDB as the long term cache while the Ethereum Ledger via ChainStack is the ledger&nbsp;address.</p><p>To learn more about Affinidi APIs, check out our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Developer resources</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">Decoding the Sidetree Protocol</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 What Are Stock Tokens? 
<p>As one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, Binance has been aggressively pursuing and exploring a wide range of services for its users. Its latest initiative is to allow users to trade ‘stock tokens’ that represent shares of publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>The transactions are settled in stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD). Since 12 April, Binance has released stock tokens for Tesla, Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Apple and Microsoft. This is a milestone in the tokenization field as it opens up the security tokens to the masses. In fact, Binance is not the first company to do this, as FTX and Bittrex, two other cryptocurrency exchanges, started tokenized stocks trading back in late 2020.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that all of these tokenized stocks are mirrors of securities, meaning that the tokens are not shares and only give exposure to the underlying shares. In other words, investors don’t have direct ownership of the shares, and the tokens are not transferable between investors. The digital asset marketplace (Binance, etc.) is the issuer, controlling the tokens for its token holders. It is a delegated system.</p>
 So Why Does It Concern Regulators? 
<p>Binance has also declared that holders of their stock tokens will qualify for economic returns on the underlying securities, including potential dividends, making the tokens securities. As those familiar with legislation on security tokens, tokenization doesn’t change the fact that they have to comply with securities regulation, especially when they are distributed to the public. Digital securities must be issued as permissioned tokens to comply with international regulations.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			<p>Permissioned tokens apply compliance checks during transfers to make sure that only eligible investors can hold the security tokens. And Binance’s stock tokens don’t appear to have been issued as permissioned tokens. They control the stock tokens for their users. No surprise that it didn’t take long for BaFin, Germany’s financial regulator, to knock on Binance’s door. On 28 April, BaFin has published <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Verbrauchermitteilung/weitere/2021/meldung_210428_binance_deutschland.html">a note</a> on its website warning Binance that they are selling shares in Germany in the form of stock tokens without offering the necessary prospectuses. This could result in a 5-million-euro fine or a forfeit of 3% of Binance’s 2020 turnover.</p>

		 
	 
          BaFin has grounds to suspect that Binance Germany is selling shares in Germany in the form of 'share tokens' without offering the necessary prospectuses.  BaFinGermany’s financial regulator         
	 
		 
			 Security Token Protocols Are Getting Traction 
<p>It’s essential for securities issuers to choose a resilient infrastructure and the right security token protocol to issue securities on blockchain in order to properly enforce securities regulation. This infrastructure should provide solutions for issuers to natively tokenize shares with compliance rules embedded in the security token smart contracts. There are plenty of open-source protocols in the market that can provide these services, such as the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Protocol</a>, the most adopted one used for tokenizing securities, having issued over&nbsp; €8.5 million assets to date. Here, we compare the differences between delegated security tokens and native security tokens issued via T-REX Protocol in the table below:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Issuers also need to keep in mind that they must be authorized by regulators to distribute securities. In Binance’s case, there are certain documents such as prospectuses that need to be provided to investors. And these documents should be easily accessible by investors.</p>
<p>Binance is not a regulated exchange for securities, but they have apparently chosen to distribute securities to their users and to keep their security tokens in custody. It is not hard to see why regulators are looking into them. Unlike unregulated exchanges, broker-dealers, ATS, regulated exchanges, asset managers, and many other players are already allowed to distribute securities to their clients. These entities should launch <a href="https://tokeny.com/whats-the-purpose-of-a-digital-asset-marketplace/">Digital Assets Marketplaces (DAM)</a> and be sure that they only accept native security tokens in order to remain compliant.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 What are the key components of a security token marketplace? 
 
 Select serious securities issuers; 
 Onboard investors and verify their eligibility; 
 Distribute security tokens with documents required by regulators;

<p>This series will show you how to implement service authentication and authorization for <a href="https://konghq.com/kong-konnect/">Kong Konnect</a> and Okta using the OIDC plugin. In this tutorial, we’ll cover client credentials flow for application authentication. Parts 2-4 will cover:</p>

   Integral introspection for token validation 
   Access control based on Okta’s groups and planes 
 

<p>You can also <a href="https://youtu.be/-zRVWD3aXwE">watch this tutorial as a screencast</a>.</p>

 

 

 Kong Konnect and Okta Integration Topology 

<p></p>

<p>In the above diagram, the API gateway splits into two sublayers. The first is the control plane used by admins to create new APIs and policies. The second sublayer is accountable for request processing and API conception and contains the control plane responsible for publishing those APIs and policies to the data plane.</p>

<p>My topology has two data planes: the first running locally, and the second running as a Docker container in an AWS EC2 instance. The integration is possible because Kong provides a specific plugin to implement the OAuth/OIDC flows from the API gateway. The OIDC plugin will submit the consumer to Okta’s authentication processes before consuming the API.</p>

 Set Up Konnect Service and Route 

<p>Konnect is a cloud native service connectivity platform hosted as a service. It can take care of all connectivity use cases across any environment, including virtual machines (VMs) and <a href="https://konghq.com/learning-center/kubernetes/what-is-kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>.</p>

<p>Start by going to the ServiceHub in the Kong Konnect Enterprise Admin GUI. In my example, I’ve already set up a service. If you haven’t already, follow the Kong Documentation to set up a service before continuing to the next steps.</p>

<p></p>

<p>My service has only one version. We could define multiple versions with different definitions and policies if necessary.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We could click on the service version to see the routes that are already exposing a service.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In my example, I’m going to consume and protect the <code>/oidcroute</code>. With no policy enabled, anyone can start consuming the route without any restriction. That’s why it’s critical to define and apply policies, like OIDC with Okta, to control this consumption.</p>

 Set Up Okta 

<p>My demo environment has two previously created Okta applications. In this example, I will use the Kong client credentials app.</p>

<p></p>

 Create Konnect Data Plane 

<p>We’ll run our Konnect data plane on an AWS EC2 instance in a Docker container. The control plane has a specific component called Runtime Manager. The Runtime Manager handles monitoring the currently installed data planes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Configure Runtime to see the script we’ll run to instantiate a Docker-based data plane.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Run the script in the EC2 terminal to get our first data plane up and running. In my example, I have already updated the script to use my Kong Konnect credentials. It will pull from the Kong Docker image.</p>

<p>Ready to launch, enjoy the flight! I’ve now deployed the data plane, and all the APIs are already available to consume.</p>

<p></p>

 Consume the Route Without a Policy 

<p>If we try to consume the route now by sending a request to <code>http :8000/oidcroute/get</code>, we’ll be able to consume the route as expected.</p>

<p></p>

<p>However, since we haven’t set any policy to control the route consumption, anyone could send as many requests as they want. To solve this, we’ll need to set up the OIDC policy to control the route consumption.</p>

 Add OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>To add the OIDC plugin, go to the ServiceHub &gt; Service &gt; Versions &gt; Service Version &gt; Add Plugin.</p>

<p>The plugin expects four parameters to integrate with Okta.</p>

 
   Config.ClientId—issued from Okta 
   Config.Client Secret 
   Config.Issuer—Okta’s endpoint 
   Config.Scopes 
 

<p>After configuring those four settings, click Create to save our settings.</p>

 Test the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Let’s go back to our terminal and try to consume the route using <code>http :8000/oidcroute/get</code>. The API gateway won’t allow us because we’re not providing the credentials.</p>

<p>If we try to send the same request, including our credentials (the client ID and client secret), we can consume the route.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We can also decode the token issued by Okta on <a href="https://jwt.io">jwt.io</a> and check all the fields inside it.</p>

<p></p>

 Upstream Header Injection 

<p>The OIDC plugin provides upstream header injection. That means we can extend requests with extra headers. Doing so sends the upstream or microservice more information about the authentication process. As an exercise, we can inject a header based on the ISS field, which is Okta’s issuer endpoint.</p>

<p>To set extra OIDC plugin parameters, use the Kong Konnect control plane to:</p>

 
   Edit the OIDC plugin and enter iss into the field: Config.Upstream Headers Claims. 
   Enter Issuer_Header in the field: Config.Upstream Headers Names. 
   Click Update. 
 

<p>Let’s consume the route one more time and inject a brand-new header into our request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We are very excited to announce the<a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/ssi-sdk"> SSI SDK</a>! This is a monorepo that contains all of Bloom's SSI related libraries. The SSI SDK provides everything you need to integrate Bloom into your system.</p> Current Libraries  VC <p><code>@bloomprotocol/vc</code> is a base library that issues and verifies Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Verifiable Presentations (VPs) in compliance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model">VC Data Model</a> specification. Implementation of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonld-signatures">JSON-LD Signatures</a> specification is used to create Linked Data Proofs.</p><p>The TypeScript types which are exported from the library are built with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-schema-to-ts">json-schema-to-ts</a>, so in addition to receiving static analysis, you can use the verify functions to leverage these schemas at run time.</p> EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2019 &amp; EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019 <p><code>@bloomprotocol/ecdsa-secp256k1-signature-2019</code> and <code>@bloomprotocol/ecdsa-secp256k1-verification-key-2019</code> implement the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-ecdsa-secp256k1-2019/">Ecdsa Secp256k1 Signature 2019 specification</a>. These can be used to sign and verify VCs and VPs with the <code>@bloomprotocol/vc</code> library above.</p> Element DID (Legacy and Non-anchored) <p><code>@bloomprotocol/elem-did-legacy-non-anchored</code> is a small library for creating and resolving legacy Element DIDs. Bloom is currently using an older version of the Element spec. We will be updating to the latest version in the future but first, we want to ensure that integrators can handle the DIDs of our users.</p><p>You can create an Element DID with key pairs or a mnemonic phrase, or you can simply generate a fresh DID.</p> WACI Core &amp; WACI jose <p><code>@bloomprotocol/waci-core</code> and <code>@bloomprotocol/waci-jose</code> are libraries for the WACI spec, which Bloom has recently donated to DIF. (Look for a blog post about WACI soon!) waci-core &nbsp;exports TypeScript types and schemas to be used by any other implementation, and waci-jose uses waci-core to sign and verify JWTs with<a href="https://github.com/panva/jose"> jose</a>. A library that uses <a href="https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken">jsonwebtokens</a>, in lieu of jose, would also be able to use waci-core.</p> WACI Kit React <p><code>@bloomprocotol/waci-kit-react</code> is the UI part of the WACI flow. Those who have used our old (now deprecated) <code>@bloomprotocol/share-kit-react</code> will find this interface familiar. This library renders either a QR Code or a link, depending on the platform, that starts an interaction with our mobile app.</p><p>Get the mobile app <a href="https://go.onelink.me/9Fr3/bf30b5a3">here</a>!</p> Presentation Exchange <p><code>@bloomprotocol/presentation-exchange</code> contains TypeScript types and JSON schemas for the different objects in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> specification. In the future, this library will also contain implementations of the behavior aspects of the spec (e.g. filtering credentials, pulling credentials out of a Presentation Submission, etc.)</p> Credential Manifest <p><code>@bloomprotocol/credential-manifest</code> contains TypeScript types and JSON schemas for the different objects in the frozen working copy of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/wallet-and-credential-interactions/versions/v0.1.0/#credential-manifest-working-copy">Credential Manifest</a> specification. Once the Credential Manifest specification is finalized, this library will be updated.</p> Future Work  EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2020 &amp; EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2020 <p>While the 2019 versions help to ensure that we have better future interoperability, we still must implement the 2020 versions. In the more current version, key pairs are encoded in the "multibase" format rather than in base58. Beyond this, little has changed between the two iterations.</p> VC Taxonomy <p>This library will provide TypeScript Types, JSON-LD contexts, and JSON schemas for specific types of VCs, as well as for building on top of VC.</p> Documentation <p>We need proper documentation setup. We want to create a<a href="https://docusaurus.io"> Docusaurus</a> package within the SSI SDK repo and host it on GitHub pages. The package will include walkthroughs, examples, and any other resources &nbsp;that we believe can help integrators. If you have any ideas for how to enhance this documentation package, please share your thoughts <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/ssi-sdk/issues/6">here</a>.</p>

Under lockdown and unable to access brick and mortar, as usual, we’ve warmed to the idea of using e-commerce for everything, from grocery shopping to financial transactions. Consumers are three times likelier now than before the crisis to say that their future customer interactions will be digital in&nbsp;nature.</p><p>What we’ll see, even post-vaccine is an increasingly omnichannel society in which the physical and digital worlds will come together in a way that makes it much easier and convenient for people to buy and access the services they&nbsp;need.</p> So what does this mean for identity proofing? <p>Simply put, every customer interaction with your products and services should be carefully considered and purposeful.</p><p>This starts with deeply understanding people’s attitudes and behaviours regarding digital identity and accessing services online. We must take time to understand our customers, their needs, motivations and the challenges they face when using our products and services.</p><p>We know this because our team at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/onfido/">Onfido</a> invests significant effort into talking directly to our users and observing them using our products. As a result, we’ve been able to tailor and improve our user experience to meet a diverse set of needs, environments and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>In doing so, we’ve made a surprising observation: A truly frictionless experience is not necessarily the optimal outcome when it comes to identity.</p><p>When removing friction compromises other usability constraints such as user security and safety, it can actually be harmful to both users and businesses, especially when designing highly critical&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Adding strategically architected friction can guide users in an intended direction, better prepare them for success, and ensure that your business gets the strongest signals on which to make security decisions. <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/good-friction-for-great-ux-5151bace3bfa">In our own work at Onfido</a>, we’ve directly observed the benefits of adding purposeful and thoughtfully designed moments of friction to our&nbsp;users.</p><p>There’s a great example of this called the Locksmith Paradox:</p><p>When a locksmith is new, they are slow. But as they get more skilled, they can look at the lock and open it in 5 seconds flat. But doing that will impact the customer in three&nbsp;ways:</p>  There’s an Emotional impact: The customer will be embarrassed it was so easy, and they wasted the locksmith’s time.  It changes the customer’s perception of value: They will immediately get annoyed that they have to pay so much for five seconds of&nbsp;work.  It impacts their sense of security/trust: They will never feel safe with that (or any other) lock ever&nbsp;again.  <p>The combination of these three things means that customer satisfaction actually goes down the better at your job you&nbsp;are.</p><p>Experienced locksmiths quickly learn to take their time — They might poke at the lock with various tools from their toolkit or blow into the lock with compressed air (which accomplishes nothing), then “click!” it comes open, and the client is SUPER GRATEFUL.</p><p>By adding purposeful and deliberate friction to the experience, locksmiths have improved outcomes for themselves and their clients. Our digital experiences are precisely the&nbsp;same.</p><p>So, when evaluating and optimising for friction on your own platforms, I’ll leave you with three pieces of&nbsp;advice:</p><p>First, we must respond to the seismic shift in customer expectations.</p><p>How you handle identity is not only important at onboarding but throughout the entire customer journey. The onboarding phase is critical because if you get that part right, you have a lot more confidence in your customers on your platform. This shift to digital that we’ve been talking about is a massive opportunity to meet our customers where they are and to add tangible value to their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Secondly, exceeding customer expectations starts with deeply understanding your customer’s needs. Take the time to observe them using your products in real environments, and you’ll start to see patterns emerging around the friction they experience and what you can to do&nbsp;respond.</p><p>Finally, look for that balance when designing experiences in ID proofing, consent and authentication. As our Locksmith taught us, it is helpful to distinguish between negative friction — the kind that makes your customers frustrated and annoyed — and positive friction, the type that offers tangible benefits to people. Being mindful of this will help you manage their perception of your value and improve their security and emotional response to your&nbsp;brand.</p><p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/onfido">See our open roles on&nbsp;Lever</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/improving-user-experience-in-identity-proofing-4e812f06c4d5">Improving User Experience in Identity Proofing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology partners with <a href="http://rocki.app">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and music NFT platform built on Binance Smart Chain, to provide decentralized identity (DID) solutions to its&nbsp;users. <p>Ontology is proud to collaborate with ROCKI, a next-generation music streaming service and music NFT platform built on Binance Smart Chain. We aim to provide decentralized identity (DID) solutions to ROCKI’s music creators and users to ensure they are authentic and&nbsp;secure.</p> Why the NFT Market Needs&nbsp;DID <p>The market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in 2021. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/youngjoseph/2021/03/29/nft-market-rages-on-nfts-market-cap-grow-1785-in-2021-as-demand-explodes/?sh=2f7dac317fdc">Forbes</a>, since the start of the year, ‘the combined market cap of major NFT projects has increased by 1,785%.’ These projects, which specialise in the creation and sale of tokenized images, songs, virtual real estate, and other artistic creations, are now valued at over $400&nbsp;million.</p><p>NFTs offer creators a novel way to monetize their creations. Unfortunately, there have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art">reports</a> of artists having their artwork sold by impersonators. This is, in part, due to popular NFT platforms lacking a robust verification process for determining a creator’s identity.</p><p>The potential for fraud in the growing NFT market recently attracted the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fatfs-new-guidance">attention</a> of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the inter-governmental watchdog that establishes standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, which is currently drafting new guidance proposals for both DeFi and NFT&nbsp;markets.</p> How Ontology Empowers ROCKI’s&nbsp;Userbase <p>Ontology’s Decentralized Identity (DID) Registration Management SDK will enable ROCKI to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and help buyers avoid purchasing inauthentic NFTs. Ontology’s DID technology relies on global trust anchors to verify user credentials that can then be used to establish a digital identity across multiple blockchains (e.g. Ontology, BSC, Ethereum, OKExChain).</p><p>ROCKI intends to have all creators on the platform go through an initial KYC/AML process to verify their identity. Upon completion of the verification process, creators will receive a public stamp of approval, similar to Twitter’s blue checkmark.</p><p>Initially, the verification process will be used to verify national ID credentials. However, there are also plans to enable users to verify social media accounts such as Spotify and Instagram. This way, artists with large social media followings will be able to create a robust assortment of verified credentials, leaving little doubt that their NFTs are authentic.</p><p>ROCKI spent months searching for a suitable KYC provider and decided Ontology was the best fit for securing its users’ accounts. Their previous partners include Bounce, a decentralized NFT marketplace, and Ankr, a provider of blockchain node hosting solutions.</p><p>ROCKI has <a href="https://medium.com/rockiapp/rocki-announces-partnership-with-ontology-b18ffe6cfc3d">expressed</a> interest in implementing other Ontology services such as <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ont-id-2-0-take-charge-of-your-identity-with-customized-data-control-and-disclosure-features-c54bd9305e2d">ONT ID</a>. When announcing the partnership, ROCKI wrote&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>Ontology’s <a href="https://ddxf.ont.io/">DDXF</a> (Decentralized Data Exchange Framework) and <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a>, which provides credit and reputation scoring based on user ONT ID data, is a powerful tool that may bring further benefits to ROCKI’s creators.</blockquote><p>Stay tuned for future news and updates about Ontology Network’s progress.</p><p>About ROCKI</p><p><a href="http://rocki.app/">ROCKI</a> is a user-centric music streaming ecosystem that incentives both the artists and the listeners by rewarding them with its in-house ROCKS token. Specifically, ROCKI’s marketplace provides artists with near-real-time royalty payments, paid in ROCKS — thereby solving one of the major challenges in the modern, COVID-stricken digital music industry, where most artists have to fight for streaming pay. ROCKI recently received attention from some large crypto media and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocki-music-streaming-platform-blockchain-015800100.html">finance outlets</a>, when dance producer Guy J sold the very first NFT representing 50% of his new track’s future royalties for 40&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>Want More?<br>Connect with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/Wing_Finance">Twitter</a>, join the <a href="https://t.me/WingDAO">Telegram</a> discussion, or visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://wing.finance/">website</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483">Ontology Providing DID Solutions to Music Streaming Platform, ROCKI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Awards such as FinTech Australia’s Finnies are a testament to Australian innovation. Australia is often considered as a great test market. Despite the relatively small population compared to the USA or Europe, the high adoption of new technologies makes Australia a great market to test, validate and chart a pathways for solutions to take off globally.




 




Indeed, Australia is proudly home to a lot of innovative start-ups, which makes the start-up industry in particular worth considering. The synergy of technological shifts, market opportunities and a vigorously growing digital culture has developed several <a href="https://planetmedia.com.au/blog/unique-innovative-companies-that-have-reached-unicorn-status/">FinTech</a><a href="https://planetmedia.com.au/blog/unique-innovative-companies-that-have-reached-unicorn-status/"> Unicorns</a>.



In October 2020, Meeco was the proud recipient of the FinTech Australia Finnie for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxRkChGHa8k&amp;list=PL4ITSyTPE_Itre7yk5wSinhYGVxE_IhsM&amp;index=12">Excellence in Industry Collaboration &amp; Partnerships</a>, for our push into Belgium and collaboration with KBC Bank. So we are more than thrilled to keep the momentum going when we received news that we are been shortlisted again this year.




 




We are proud to announce we made it to the <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/fintech-australia-is-proud-to-announce-the-2021-finnies-finalists/">finalists for FinTech Australia’s Finnies 2021</a>. This year, Meeco was nominated in the Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger category, for the development of our decentralised identity wallet.  Contenders for the award this year include AgUnity, BOULEVARD Global, CommChain, Hutly, Oxen, Pellar Technology and RelayPay.




 





 “Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger” finalist 





 




Meeco’s submission results from our work in collaboration with with <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au">eftpos</a> and <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a>. The Australian payments giant eftpos recently announced joining the Hedera Governing Council after successfully conducting tests to determine the <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/37360/australias-eftpos-to-set-up-hedera-hashgraph-node-for-micropayments">feasibility of a digital Australian dollar stablecoin for micropayments</a>. Meeco plays an important part in this world-leading initiative as the wallet provider for the proof-of-technology.




 



<blockquote>
“When we were running the eftpos micropayments PoC with Hedera Hashgraph, we needed a wallet partner. We had had great experience of working with Meeco on our connectID PoC and needed aspects of digital identity for the micropayments PoC too, so they were a natural fit.

This enabled us to combine the provisioning of an eftpos debit card, identity credentials and a stable coin in one wallet. The PoC was very successful and resulted in a technical platform that demonstrates micropayment capability in a way that no other payments provider has. Our next phase is to look at ways to commercialise this capability.” 

Rob Allen, Entrepreneur in Residence, eftpos

 Everything will be Tokenized 





 




Earlier this month, Meeco was invited to share our vision of a tokenised work at an <a href="https://fsclub.zyen.com/">FSClub</a> webinar hosted by <a href="https://www.zyen.com/">Z/Yen</a>‘s Chairman, Professor <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mrmainelli">Michael Mainelli</a>. Meeco’s CEO and Founder, <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow">Katryna Dow</a> delivered the presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">Everything Will Be Tokenized: The Future of Identity</a>. Katryna shared some of the exiting things we have been working on along with where the tokenised world is heading.




 





<blockquote>“We’re on track towards a world where everything can be tokenized. Tokenization plays a critical part in enabling more equitable value creation for people, organisations and things. Providing the means to issue and store value, trace provenance, and most importantly achieve consensus to instantly trust. 

In order for this tokenized world to emerge we will need the infrastructure for people and their digital twins to participate. This will include digital identity, verifiable credentials and payments.”

Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder, Meeco</blockquote>





 




Since 2012, Meeco has been pioneering the access, protection and value exchange of personal data and identity. Over the past year we have been working towards making much of this possible, and this webinar featured some of the use-cases and practical steps along the way, such as:




 





  Meeco’s wallet leveraging OpenID &amp; W3C standards, designed to incentivise collaboration between stakeholders whilst maximising privacy  eftpos Australia determining feasibility of a digital Australian dollar stablecoin for micropayments  Hedera Hashgraph: the fast, fair, secure and stable Distributed Ledger Technology ensuring decentralised governance at scale.  





 





 
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">Watch the webinar</a> 
 





 




Over the past year, we have been working in conjunction with Hedera to launch a multi-purpose wallet that will enable decentralised identity, verifiable credentials, micropayments and tokens. The wallet will be available as a white label solution, with SDK and supported by Meeco’s Secure Value Exchange credential solution. We look forward to sharing more news soon along with updates to our <a href="https://www.meeco.me/developers">developer portal</a>.

<p>If you’re interested in cryptocurrency, at some point you’re going to come across Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and court jester of Twitter. He has strong opinions, he’s not afraid to share them, and apparently he’s also not afraid to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203">completely reverse them</a> due to ecological concerns over blockchain mining.</p><blockquote><p>Tesla &amp; Bitcoin <a href="https://t.co/YSswJmVZhP">pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>In the midst of the furor over one man’s opinions, I also sense growing <a href="https://thedefiant.io/people-are-outraged-about-nft-energy-consumption/">anger</a> over the energy consumption of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/nfts-on-holochain-easy-as-passing-the-ball-2/">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>, which are blockchain-based certificates of ownership for digital art. One artist, Joanie LeMercier, calculated that the sale of six of his pieces consumed <a href="https://joanielemercier.com/the-problem-of-cryptoart/">more electricity in ten minutes</a> than his art studio had consumed in the previous two years.</p>Source: https://joanielemercier.com/the-problem-of-cryptoart/<p>Granted, determining blockchain’s real ecological cost is not simple. Some argue that kilowatts per transaction is the <a href="https://medium.com/superrare/no-cryptoartists-arent-harming-the-planet-43182f72fc61">wrong equation</a>. Others claim that roughly <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019">three quarters</a> of the electricity used to mine blocks comes from renewable sources (though still others say it’s <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/36672/renewable-energy-not-as-prominent-in-cryptocurrency-mining-as-previously-claimed">more like 40%</a>, and most of the remaining power comes from coal and natural gas). Finally, proponents claim that cryptocurrency <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf">drives adoption of renewables</a> and might be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-energy-consumption-is-far-more-efficient-and-greener-than-todays-banking-system/">a lot greener</a> than the global banking system.</p><p>But as blockchains become more popular and their tokens increase in value, more miners get in on the game, increasing the total electricity consumption. Even if you use the more favourable figures, with non-renewables accounting for only 25%, 25% of a lot will still be a lot.</p><p>Public blockchains consume so much electricity because they have a lot of entropy to deal with. In thermodynamics, entropy is noise, waste, meaninglessness. The problem blockchain is trying to solve — dishonest agents trying to corrupt the global ledger — certainly fits that description.</p><blockquote>Any time you have too much entropy, you’re going to need to spend a lot of energy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mgjfkn/eli5_what_is_negentropy/gstkwly/">moving it somewhere else</a>. My hot take: Bitcoin is basically converting dishonesty into CO₂. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory">simple physics</a>.</blockquote><p>We get it. Bitcoin is burning the world. Ethereum is burning the world. NFTs are burning the world. There are more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">planet</a>-<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/">friendly</a> <a href="https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-vs-hashgraph-vs-dag-vs-holochain/">consensus</a> designs out there, along with <a href="https://medium.com/the-capital/layer-1-vs-layer-2-what-you-need-to-know-about-different-blockchain-layer-solutions-69f91904ce40">layer 2 protocols</a> to ease the burden, and I appreciate these innovations. If the world is gonna use blockchains, it ought to figure out ways to make them greener.</p><p>But I think it ignores two important questions: Regardless of the consensus mechanism used, is consensus even necessary? And more importantly, could we be doing better things with that electricity?</p> Consensus: an irrelevant starting point? <p>Programmers love a ‘single source of truth’, a canonical representation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">system state</a> that everyone can rely on. That naturally led people to look for a way to get everyone to agree on the contents of one single, shared ledger of events.</p><p>This problem — reaching consensus among all honest agents in a low-trust system — is big. And the solutions are brilliant. As an engineer, I love them. But they all feel like answers to the wrong question.</p><p>What if we started with different questions?</p><p>Moving one step backwards, do we really need consensus on everything? The real world seems to do just fine without it, for the most part. And I’d like to move backwards even further and ask, what are we actually trying to achieve?</p><p>We just want to interact with each other on the internet without having to constantly worry about getting cheated. That’s a simpler framing, and it opens the door to novel solutions.</p><p>Evolution has been working on this problem for a long time. And it’s come up with lots of great solutions (you could call them games) that all share three simple meta-rules (you could call this the meta-game of living systems).</p>  Everyone knows and agrees to the rules of the specific game they’re playing.  Each participant takes responsibility for following the rules.  If anyone sees anyone else breaking the rules, they take action against them and spread news of what they saw.  <p>We see this meta-game popping up over and over again — in ecosystems, bee colonies, flocks of birds, and even human social structures (though we seem to pick really terrible games and break the rules a lot). Considering the small energy input, it’s a surprisingly robust defense against threats.</p><p>The human immune system is a great example: the rules of the game are encoded in each cell’s DNA, so each cell knows how to play nicely with the other cells. If any cell acts up — maybe it goes cancerous, maybe it’s infected with a virus — special immune cells recognise it as a bad actor and trigger an immune response. The body protects itself without spending a lot of energy, simply by launching a small, targeted response against the rule-breaker.</p><p>That’s how a Holochain application’s network works. Each user has their own application cell, with a chunk of code (we even call it a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#layers-of-the-application-stack">DNA</a>) that defines the rules of the game. They’re responsible for the actions they take, which get written onto their own <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">personal ledger</a>. Each action is witnessed by a small set of randomly chosen peers, who <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">store its data,</a> <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/">check it</a> against their copy of the rules, and broadcast an alert if they see anything wrong.</p><p>With this arrangement, you can get 'good enough' security with a fraction of the effort that full consensus would require.</p><blockquote>Holochain makes a bold claim: Consensus is unnecessary for most of the things blockchain is interested in doing.</blockquote>Two Holochain networks with different proportions of dishonest users. At 50%, each piece of data only needs 7 witnesses to achieve 99% integrity. Even with 90% dishonest users, the number of required witnesses is still only 43. Adding more doesn't improve integrity that much.<p>With such a lightweight approach to security, a Holochain network can scale almost infinitely. Even as the number of users go up, each user is still only responsible for witnessing a small portion of their peers’ data.</p> Making sense of the energy costs <p>So what does this all mean for energy consumption? This is a hard question to answer, because blockchain's consensus and Holochain's peer witnessing are such different approaches. But I'll try my best.</p><p>In the graphs below, I attempt to show how three different systems – proof-of-work consensus, proof-of-stake consensus, and Holochain – perform compared to each other. To make things simple, I assume that every single user is perfectly average; they all want to make the same number of transactions per day. Don't think too hard about these graphs, though; they're 'napkin scribbles' that show the character of these systems' performance, not actual precise measurements.</p><p>The first graph shows how many average users each system can comfortably handle. Higher numbers are better. Blockchains don't get any faster as you add more machines; in fact they get slightly slower. The cloud industry would probably describe this as 'anti-scalability'. Holochain, on the other hand, keeps climbing roughly linearly in its ability to serve users, because each user takes care of their own business and helps validate a small portion of everyone else's. As with blockchain, performance drops slightly at larger network sizes, but it's more like 'doesn't climb quite as fast anymore'.</p><p>The other graphs show energy consumption, where lower numbers are better. The second shows the total system energy overhead, or 'cost to keep the thing running'. For all three systems, this grows linearly as the network grows. But for PoW blockchains, the mining overhead is massive — regardless of how much useful work is actually getting done.</p><p>Lastly, let's look at the marginal energy cost per transaction, or the energy it takes to commit data beyond the system overhead. All three systems get exponentially more expensive as the network grows, because each machine needs to talk to more peers in order to complete a transaction. But in Holochain that number grows much more slowly, because the number of witnesses you need to submit your transaction to is capped at 5, 10, 50, 100, whatever the network requires. (For the comp sci nerds, insertion time complexity for blockchain is <code>O(n^2)</code> while Holochain is <code>O(n log(n))</code>, where <code>n</code> &nbsp;is the number of nodes in the network.)</p><p>This means that Holochain can serve more users with less energy. Why does it perform so much better? Two really simple reasons (and please forgive me for repeating myself):</p>  Consensus is expensive, while peer witnessing is cheap.  Consensus forces everyone to behave like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Single-threaded_vs_multithreaded_programs">single-threaded program</a>, while agent-centric peer-to-peer is highly parallel.   Closing loops and extending lifecycles <p>So Holochain appears to be faster and less energy-intensive than blockchain. But there are two other ecological advantages that are easy to miss.</p> Heat: waste or resource? <p>Blockchain miners and cloud servers usually live in a data centre somewhere. In this building, hundreds or thousands of machines spend all day thinking about math and logic. That generates a lot of heat — so much heat that <a href="https://www.masonandhanger.com/blog/data-center-energy-consumption/">up to 50% of the electricity goes to cooling</a>.</p>Source: https://www.masonandhanger.com/blog/data-center-energy-consumption/. Note: 'chiller', 'CRAC', and 'humidifier' are all part of the cooling system.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">Permaculture</a> designers say that waste is just a resource in the wrong place. All that heat could be put to good use — say, to heat my home in the winter. But there’s no practical way to do that.</p><p>Because Holochain apps run on our own devices (or on someone else's device, if we're accessing them via the <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo hosting</a> network), that heat is automatically spread out across the world and captured in our homes and offices. (Fun fact: Holo hosting first caught my attention because I saw the possibility of keeping my greenhouse lemons warm during the cold Canadian winters!)</p> It's about the hardware too <p>Every time I use a blockchain or cloud-hosted app, I’m leaning on faraway hardware and thousands of miles of network infrastructure. This seems wasteful when I have a supercomputer in my pocket and all I’m trying to do is talk to my dad on the other side of town. My precious devices take <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2013/08/01/whats-in-a-life-cycle-assessment/">a lot of energy</a> to make, with <a href="https://friendsofthecongo.org/coltan/">blood</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1566445/pdf/envhper00514-0024-color.pdf">toxic chemicals</a> spilled along the way. Knowing this, I’d like to use them to their full capacity before I start making demands on other devices.</p><p>Once again, Holochain apps run on our own devices. And even with the Holo hosting network, where the apps are hosted elsewhere, the hosting software will eventually be available for desktops and laptops. This means we're getting more use out of the machines that already exist.</p><p>That all sounds pretty green to me.</p> From ‘less bad’ to ‘more good’ <p>It's probably pretty clear that I think Holochain could replace blockchain for a lot of the crypto applications we see today. As we've seen, a well-designed Holochain app can <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/nfts-on-holochain-easy-as-passing-the-ball-2/">deliver the same safety guarantees</a> as blockchain, with better performance, at zero cost, for a fraction of the resource consumption.</p><p>That excites me. I see a lot of creative things happening in crypto space, and I think Holochain could fill those niches in a way that’s gentler on our planet.</p><p>And I’m also curious about what’s next. As wonderful as these things are, can we do more? Can we go from ‘gentler on our planet’ to regenerating damaged ecosystems, sharing our common wealth more equitably, and preserving the dignity of our fellow humans? And does Holochain have unique features that can help us get there?</p><p>I invite you to explore these possibilities with me in an upcoming blog series about projects that are doing exactly that — starting with <a href="https://redgrid.io">RedGrid</a>, who want to <a href="https://youtu.be/7Gq_jIQWgYg">help</a> the world become carbon neutral by 2030.</p><p>In the meantime, if you want to start prototyping your dApp on Holochain, head over to the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org">developer portal</a> and sign up for the upcoming (free) <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">DevCamp</a>!</p><p>(Side note on the cover photo: yes, I know that's probably not the Satoshi who created Bitcoin. But I had to put something there. Poor guy will never get any peace.)</p>

<p>Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers may feel like one of those invisible processes that go largely unnoticed yet have become essential to everyday life, especially in business. When you received your last paycheck through direct deposit to your bank account, that was made possible through an ACH transfer. When you paid your utility bill directly from your checking account, you likely used an ACH transfer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re already passively benefiting from ACH transfers, imagine the positive outcomes that could come from actively leveraging the ACH network. Here are six fundamentals to get you started.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is ACH? 
<p>“ACH” stands for “Automated Clearing House,” which is a payment network built by the National Automated Clearing House Association (Nacha). An ACH payment is an electronic bank-to-bank payment enabled through the ACH network, rather than through a card network. ACH payments are also frequently called ACH “transfers” or ACH “transactions.” The ACH network is used in the United States, but there are also International ACH Transactions (IAT).</p>
<p>Banks and other financial institutions use the ACH network to aggregate transactions for batch processing. In a given year, the ACH network processes around <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/what-is-ach">25 billion transactions</a>, likely including your paychecks and monthly bill payments. There are three types of transactions:</p>
 
 Direct Deposits: These transactions are any electronic transfer made from a business or government entity to a consumer. Direct deposit transactions may include:&nbsp;
 
 Paychecks and other employee expense reimbursements, bonuses, and commissions 
 Social security payments and other government benefits 
 Pension/401(k) disbursements 
 Annuities 
 Tax refunds 
 Interest payments 
 
 
 Split Deposit: This transaction enables deposits to be split into different accounts. For example, an employee could have a percentage of their paycheck deposited into a savings account while the rest is put in checking. 
 Direct Payments: If you’re sending money through the ACH network, then you’re making a direct payment. Payment solutions can enable any consumer to make these kinds of payments with their bank account:
 
 Charity donations 
 Bill payments 
 Tuition payments 
 Send money through social payment apps 
 Send money to friends and family 
 Make ACH-enabled purchases 
 
 
 
 How Do ACH Transfers Work? 
<p>The ACH transfer happens in two key steps: initiating the payment and receiving the payment. Before you can initiate the transfer as the payment originator, a customer must first give the business approval to initiate the transfer. This approval usually happens by signing an ACH authorization form or through verbal agreement. During this initiation process, the customer can set up one-time payments, recurring payments, split deposits, and so on.</p>
<p>Once the customer has authorized the transfer, your bank account will “pull” the payment from the customer’s bank account. If your customer has insufficient funds, then the payment can “bounce” just like a paper check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Pulling” money from an account is known as an ACH debit transaction. An ACH credit transaction, on the other hand, allows you to “push” money from one bank account to another.</p>
 What Are The Benefits Of Accepting ACH Transfers? 
<p>More and more businesses are leveraging ACH transfers in their business transactions. That increasing adoption has likely come as more businesses realize the benefits of ACH transfers for both them and their customers:</p>
 
 Low cost: ACH transfers tend to be a cost-effective method of moving money. We’ll cover more on costs below. 
 Open and inclusive: As long as you have a bank account, you can pay and receive money through the ACH network. No need to worry about having a credit or debit card. 
 Fast and easy: ACH transfers are much faster than delivering checks through snail mail, and you don’t have to worry about losing payments in the mail or dealing with paper check deposits. 
 Better customer experience: Since ACH transfers can be customized for recurring purchases, customers don’t have to worry about receiving and paying a bill, which reduces friction between them and your business. ACH transactions are also easier than customers filling out a check, which may additionally increase the chances of converting prospects. 
 
 What Are The Costs Of ACH Transfers? 
<p>ACH transfers will save your business much more than processing fees or wire transfers (which we’ll get to in more detail shortly). The <a href="https://gocardless.com/guides/ach/ach-fees-how-much-does-ach-cost/">median cost per transfer</a> is $0.29, but that number can rise or fall depending on:</p>
 
 The average transaction size 
 Volume of transactions you submit 
 Whether or not a bank uses same-day ACH 
 Size of the bank 
 Other incidental or bank fees 
 
 What’s The Difference Between ACH Transfers and Wire Transfers? 
<p>In many instances, ACH transfers have replaced more traditional wire transfers. But that doesn’t mean that wire transfers have completely lost their utility. For example, wire transfers happen in real time, which means they can process within minutes or hours, where ACH transfers could take a few days. However, wire transfers cost more, typically between $20 and $30 for the customer, and the recipient frequently has to pay a fee as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line: wire transfers are likely better for large-sum, international, or time-sensitive transactions, where ACH transfers are more appropriate for smaller, more frequent transactions that can stand to take a little longer to process.</p>
 How Does Finicity Enable ACH Transfers? 
<p>What does all of this have to do with Finicity? On March 19, <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">Nacha implemented a new WEB Debit Rule</a> that requires account validation with the first use of an account number, or following changes to the account number. The purpose of the rule is to reduce the chances of fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to help businesses satisfy Nacha’s new operating rule, Finicity delivers an instant account validation solution as part of our Finicity Pay solution set. In fact, Finicity is a <a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/nacha-announces-finicity-preferred-partner-account-validation">Preferred Partner</a> of Nacha for using instant account validation to mitigate fraud and maximize the accuracy of payment transactions by providing account and routing numbers, account owner and balance checks to make ACH payments even simpler. The speed and security of our open-banking-powered validation solutions also empower consumers with a streamlined, easy, digital-first experience.</p>
<p>ACH transfers are an innovative way for both businesses and consumers to move money while also cutting costs and saving time. Learn more about how <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">Finicity is enabling secure and less risky ACH transfers</a>.</p>

Below is a short summary of the conversation as well as answers to the questions that were asked by the audience during the Q&amp;A portion.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 An overview 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>As the title of the event suggests, Riley and Travis discussed the state of adoption for verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity (SSI). Travis started the conversation by stating that critics of SSI claim adoption will be a hurdle too high to jump for any SSI platform or product to be successful at scale. Riley agreed that adoption is the most important hurdle to overcome, and explained that early technologists building SSI technology didn’t build tech that was easy to adopt. Today’s SSI approaches, partially pioneered by Trinsic, are now being built so they are adoptable today and not just in a fully decentralized, 20-year Web 3.0 future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Riley went on to more specifically address where verifiable credentials are at in terms of adoption. About a year and a half ago, there was essentially zero real-world adoption. Today, there’s between 100,000-300,000 verifiable credentials being used by real end users. In the last 18 months, demand has skyrocketed and there have been strong adoption signals, but the adoption of verifiable credentials is still very early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic is addressing this adoption problem for its customers with the recent launch of its enterprise-grade product—<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-ecosystems/">Trinsic Ecosystems</a>. Riley explained how Trinsic found that a large subset of its customers were wanting to use SSI to enable secure, privacy-compliant data sharing between multiple organizations and customers (or in other words, within an ecosystem). Trinsic Ecosystems is an out-of the-box solution that enables just that with all of the governance and technical tools to make adoption within any ecosystem easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Travis and Riley then focused on what role the COVID-19 pandemic has had in impacting the adoption of verifiable credentials. Riley explained how the pandemic has greatly accelerated interest and demand in verifiable credentials, but it is yet to be determined whether the recent uptake of verifiable credentials adoption is causation or correlation. However, the pandemic has created a major emphasis in creating a solution for digital health passes where health information (like COVID-19 test results or vaccination records) can be shared in a way that abides by data privacy regulation, safeguards the individual, and is standardized.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Travis brought up that health passes related to COVID-19 will eventually not be needed as the world fully recovers from the pandemic. Riley expressed that he looks forward to that day because that means we have beaten the pandemic. Until then, for jurisdictions and businesses that do have policies around COVID-19 test results and/or vaccinations, verifiable credentials provide a good way to enforce those policies in a standardized way, while putting the individual in control of their data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With that being said, if Riley had to make a prediction of what will be the next big use case for verifiable credentials, he said that it would be around taking the identity verifications that are done by Onfido, Passbase, Jumio, and others and simply codifying them in a way that can be reused by the individual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They ended their conversation talking about the future of Trinsic. Riley said that Trinsic’s biggest priority right now is adoption and because of that, they are buckling down on refining the Trinsic Ecosystems product for the foreseeable future.</p>

					<p>Q: What verifiable credentials use cases are enterprise and businesses using Trinsic for?</p><p>A: From the enterprise side, we are mostly seeing customers want to use Trinsic to make data sharing secure, privacy-preserving, and standardized between multiple organizations and their customers. Essentially, instead of disjointed systems having to build and maintain a custom API to share data, with Trinsic, the customer becomes the API, enabling a seamless data sharing process that puts the customer in control of his or her data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How does self-sovereign identity reduce costs?</p><p>A: Because credentials can be reused by the individual, organizations no longer have to go through the costly and time-consuming process of re-verifying their customers and their data and can instead do it instantaneously. Additionally, SSI reduces costs for credential issuers in that issuing companies no longer need to be “on call” to vouch whether or not the information is accurate or not, and they no longer need to outsource that role to companies like Equifax and give them access to their database.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How involved are governments in deploying SSI?</p><p>A: Governments are some of the most active proponents of SSI. The USA, Canada, various governments in Europe including the UK and the EU, as well as Asian governments are all investing money in SSI projects. Smaller governments such as state or large jurisdictional governments are also deploying SSI at a surprisingly rapid pace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: Do you think that we will have one wallet containing all our credentials or separate wallets by use case based around health, employment, identity, etc.? In the UK, the covid passport is being built around the NHS app, for example.</p><p>A: I think in the near-term we’ll see separate wallets by use case (actually, I think they’ll be by ecosystem). That’s the signal we’re seeing strongly from the market with interest in our Wallet SDK and Ecosystems product.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How does this differ from Civic’s&nbsp;<a href="http://identity.com/">identity.com</a>&nbsp;(open source ecosystem providing access to on-demand, secure ID verification)?</p><p>A: There are a variety of differences, but the primary one is that <a href="http://identity.com">identity.com</a>, to my knowledge, is an identity verification solution, whereas Trinsic is infrastructure for creating such solutions. Trinsic’s customers span not just identity verification, but government, B2B, and IoT use cases as well. <a href="http://identity.com">Identity.com</a> is also a solution built around the CVC cryptocurrency and leverages smart contracts, whereas Trinsic uses blockchain only as an optional dPKI for organizations. See more about how blockchain fits <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How do you get people to care about adoption? How do you talk about decentralized identity outside of enterprises to encourage people to take action?</p><p>A: People will adopt something if it has a clear benefit to them. It’s too much to expect people to pick up a random SSI wallet from the App Store and start using it throughout their lives. The adoption process will be gradual and may be happening without end users really knowing what’s going on under the hood. For example, a digital health pass might just appear in an app on their phone. The user probably thinks about it in terms of the ability to travel that it affords, not in terms of self-sovereign control over their data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: Do you see a use case around account takeover for financial institutions?</p><p>A: Yes, account takeover is one of many use cases we’ve seen financial institutions look into. One of the most challenging parts of securing an account is the different authentication methods for different channels. For example, calling-in uses security questions while in-person uses a physical ID card. Verifiable credentials are an ideal solution for omni-channel authentication, meaning the same factors of authentication can be used in any scenario (login, drive-through, ATM, etc.).

<p>With ongoing developments in the field of smart citiies and digitalization in general, data is becoming a driving factor and value stream for new and existing economies alike. However, there exists an increasing centralization and monopolization of data holders and service providers, especially in the form of the big US-based technology companies in the western world and central technology providers with close ties to the government in the Asian regions. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) provides the technical building blocks to create decentralizied data-driven systems, which bring data autonomy back to the users. In this paper we propose a system in which the combination of SSI and token economy based incentivisation strategies makes it possible to unlock the potential value of data-pools without compromising the data autonomy of the users. </p>

<p>The May 2021 edition of Fission's monthly Demo Day featured our announcement of joining the Decentralized Identity Foundation and our DID interop plans, our updated VS Code plugin, a demo of our Account Backup approach, and lots of TiddlyWiki-related news and demos.</p><a href="https://presentations.fission.app/demodays/2021-05-20-fission-demoday.pdf">Slides for the presentation »</a> Joining the Decentralized Identity Foundation <p>Fission is now an Associate Member of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.</p>Logo wall of many of the DIF members. Happy to see our home Province of British Columbia once again be an early adopter of these standards!<p>Fission accounts have always been designed with portability in mind, being based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) from the very beginning.</p><p>We're working with the Secure Data Storage / Personal Data Store Working group, along with a number of other groups from the identity and IPFS ecosystems. Our Web Native File System is live today as a user-owned personal data store, so this is a great opportunity to see how we can come to a set of standards and specifications that work for everyone.</p><p>We also announced that we'll be working on DID interoperability. Our goal will be to accept DIDs from other systems, so that you can bring your own identity and make use of Fission's app publishing platform, personal data store, and other features.</p><p>We will be adding DID support to the Fission server, and targeting the <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">Microsoft ION</a> network as our first interoperability target.</p><p>We're talking to other people in the DID ecosystem and would love to showcase other examples of interoperability. If you're a developer building DID-based solutions, get in touch!</p> TiddlyWiki Demo with Jeremy Ruston <p>Jeremy Ruston, creator of TiddlyWiki, joined us to give an update on TiddlyWiki on Fission, as well as some really great new work on <a href="https://twpub-tools.org/">converting ePub books into annotatable TiddlyWiki content</a>.</p><a href="https://vimeo.com/555058528">Watch Jeremy's Fission + TiddlyWiki demo video »</a> Funding TiddlyWiki Core Image Uploads with OpenCollective <p>Also announced was the fact that Boris is personally funding a core plugin to make it much easier to upload images, files and assets as separate files in TiddlyWiki.</p><p>The first backend supported will be uploading to Fission's Webnative File System on IPFS. Other backends and features will be prioritized by contributors.</p><p>Since Demo Day last week, <a href="https://github.com/saqimtiaz">Saq Imtiaz</a> has agreed to do the TiddlyWiki core development to make this happen. You can find a <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/tiddlywiki-file-upload-plugin-webnative-ipfs-funded/1926">full write up on the plan in the Fission forum</a>, including some background from Saq. </p><p><a href="https://opencollective.com/tiddlywiki-on-fission/projects/tiddlywiki-file-upload">Visit the OpenCollective page to support the project »</a></p> VSCode Fission Plug-in <p>Brian took on updating the VS Code Fission plugin with our latest CLI updates and improvements. You can easily register and publish apps directly from within VSCode.</p><p>You can find it in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fissioncodes.fission">VSCode marketplace</a>, and the source code is on Github <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/fission-vscode">https://github.com/fission-suite/fission-vscode</a></p><p>He also managed to sneak in a demo of CLI linking as well, showing how you can now link your Fission account to your developer machine as well as to web browsers.</p> Fission Account Backup WIP Demo <p>Philipp showed off his work-in-progress on the <a href="https://dashboard.fission.codes">Dashboard</a> around Account Backup. Fission accounts are based on public/private keys, and Fission doesn't keep a copy. This means that if you lose all of your devices, no one can get at your encrypted files.</p><p>Fission's account backup strategy is to give users a key fragment that you can use for recovery, without ever having access or control over your private files, similar to other secure, privacy-preserving systems.</p> Bonus Boris on TiddlyWiki <p>The end of the demo day had some extended content, with more Fission + TiddlyWiki demos of Boris' personal usage of the system:</p><p><a href="https://boris.files.fission.name/p/twgroceries/">Tiddly Groceries:</a> a shopping list, ingredients, recipes, stores, and more, all inter-linked together into one glorious TiddlyWiki.

<p>It’s RSA Conference week again, and while we’re still functioning in the virtual realm for the time being, some things don’t change. One of those things being executives searching for the best technologies to protect their data and IT infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><a href="https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/security/the-5-most-innovative-cybersecurity-startups-from-rsa-conference/5">CRN surveyed</a> a number of those executives, asking them to identify the cybersecurity startups they believe best poised to bring to market “innovative ways to protect data, cloud workloads and open-source software”. Here at HYPR, we’re thrilled to crack that Top 5 list, and we couldn’t be prouder to be rubbing shoulders with such unicorns as Orca Security, BigID, Snyk, and BitSight.</p>
      
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless Authentication is providing a platform for companies to accelerate their MFA initiatives — many mandated by government or insurance regulations — and allocate that budget into a passwordless MFA initiative. As Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s EVP of Cybersecurity Strategy writes, “Most breaches involve either human error or compromised credentials.” Passwordless MFA eliminates the target, and solves the desktop MFA gap.</p>
      
<p>Something I’ve always shied away from as a marketer is submitting my company (or product or C Level executive) into “pay for play” award opportunities. Occasionally there’s decent optics for these, a splashy logo advertising a Best in Category Winner to highlight in a social post, for example. But this? Being named in the Top 5 is the kind of organic win I like to write about: an independent organization surveying executives anonymously, and being grouped with Unicorns. That old adage about being as good as the company you keep certainly rings true here.&nbsp;</p>

 25+ Proof of Concepts (PoCs) to Solve Real-world Problems <p>Earlier, we had posted a possible list of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">25+ use cases</a> where you can use <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) to enhance the security and trustworthiness of a transaction.</p><p>Today, we proudly present another 25+ Proof of Concepts for VC implementation. These use cases are a compilation of the <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">submissions</a> (in no particular order) made by the participants of the Affindi PoCathon&nbsp;2021.</p> AED Access <p>CPR devices provide chest compression during a cardiac arrest to resuscitate a patient and can be a lifesaver in emergencies. However, it must be used only by those trained in CPR to prevent unwanted complications.</p><p>Currently, in the US, companies are worried about the liability of having an untrained person use the CPR device in an emergency, and hence, are wary of making them available to the general public, thereby creating a possible void in emergencies.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-mckay/">Dave McKay</a> came up with the idea of using VCs to solve this problem and implemented the PoC using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs. Here is the workflow of his solution.</p>  The organizations that provide training on CPR and AED devices can issue a credential to people who pass the course and are certified to use the&nbsp;device.  Organizations can place the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/aed-access">AED devices</a> in a locked&nbsp;cabinet.  On the cabinet will be a QR code for a VC proof&nbsp;request.  The VC holder scans the QR code and sends their&nbsp;VC.  The VC triggers a message to the cabinet to&nbsp;unlock.  <p>Thus, a life is potentially saved.</p> YouNo <p>Alan Wang decided to use VCs to solve a social problem that is sometimes even considered taboo to talk&nbsp;about.</p><p>He came up with the idea of <a href="https://devpost.com/software/you-no">using VCs</a> to empower sex workers and to protect them from the spread of sexually transmittable diseases. Alan’s implementation aims to share the details of sexually transmitted diseases confidentially and in a trustable way, such that it can only be verified when two people physically meet in&nbsp;person.</p><p>Here, the issuer is a clinic that issues VCs detailing the presence/absence of sexually transmittable diseases in an individual, who is the holder. This VC can be shared by the holder while meeting a sex worker in person, and this worker will verify the VCs before deciding the next&nbsp;step.</p><p>This PoC built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs goes to show how even small steps in technology and innovation can create a big social impact, especially on the marginalized sections of&nbsp;society.</p> Daver Proxy <p>Alex Varabei, Arthur Pinchuk, Александр Годун, Jus1x, Constanine Agapotov, Andrey Kozlovskiy, and Eugene Bogatyrev came together to address the problem of corporate authorization.</p><p>Banks, brokers, and counterparties often request the authorization of a representative to perform certain actions such as bank account opening, contract signing, etc. But this still didn’t solve the problem of trust because the proxy could be revoked at any time. Notary verifications were a hassle due to their cost, time consumption, and complexity of dealing with apostille (not all states joined the Hague Convention).</p><p>To tackle this problem with an SSI-based solution, the team leveraged the timestamping provided by the Ethereum blockchain and used Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs. This solution has three operational roles: Manager, Board Members, and Counterparty (the legal entity that has a stake in ensuring that the proxy is valid to avoid financial risks). VC Issuer is not present on the interface but participates in the process of credential verification. The manager seeks the approval of the proxy by Board Members and the proxy authorizes the Manager to sign a contract on behalf of the company with the counterparty.</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/daver-proxy">detailed implementation</a> of this&nbsp;PoC.</p> RippleFund <p>RippleFund by Carey Lai and Callista Chang is a VC-based crowdfunding idea built on Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>It aims&nbsp;to,</p>  Make crowdfunding accessible to and trusted by the public (MAS- and SAF-backed)  Protect crowdfunding backers from con artists and&nbsp;scams  Build trust and engagement among Singaporean startups and crowdfunding backers  Promote entrepreneurship as well as innovative methods of capital raising in Singapore  <p>Click here for a <a href="https://vimeo.com/547835578">demo video</a> of this&nbsp;product.</p> TransportHub <p>Priyanka Pol, Nita Hinge, Madhusudan J, Tanvi Lokhande, and Mandar Tawde decided to ideate the possibility of using verifiable credentials to revolutionize the future of trucking and logistics. They envision TransportHub as a marketplace with verifiable credentials for all parties using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to increase transparency and information flow.</p><p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/transportation-hub-lorry-receipt-issuer">TransportHub</a> is a marketplace that would digitize the documents such as lorry receipts, driver information, consignee, consigner, and transporter to give participants visibility to the entire process with digital authentication.</p><p>Here,</p>  Issuer is a startup company called TransportHub that would collect the details from the consignor (the person sending the consignment) and would issue the VC. Some possible information contained in the VC can be related to the consignor, consignee, goods, freight charges, driver, and vehicle&nbsp;details.  Holder is the consignor  Verifier is the consignee (entity receiving the goods), drivers, and others who can use these credentials to change the status of the trip in their respective systems.   The Hospitality Manager <p>Created by Arnav Ladkat and Aamir Miyajiwala, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/the-hospitality-manager">The Hospitality Manager</a> uses Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs to protect the identity documents of travelers and to reduce the possibilities of identity&nbsp;theft.</p><p>This project is developed from the perspective of a company that issues VCs that can be verified during hotel check-ins. It verifies user-submitted data and accordingly, issues the VC that can be shared by the holder during his/her&nbsp;travel.</p> Empowering Migrant&nbsp;Workers <p>Another social issue that was addressed was the problem of migrant workers. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/yhgt">David Bensandon</a> came up with this idea where domestic workers can use VCs (reference letters, work permits, etc) to build up their careers, get better salaries, and share them to easily sign up for third-party services.</p><p>In this prototype developed using Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs, a domestic worker will submit a reference letter or a work permit. The agency would verify the validity and authenticity of these documents and issue the VCs accordingly. The domestic worker could then share the reference letter with a job portal, third-party service providers, or any other&nbsp;agency.</p> Patient Health Data Distributed Interface (PHDDI) <p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/affinidifabric">verifiable credential PoC</a>, Kent Lau uses Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs to record the provision of goods and services by healthcare professionals to an insured patient. The VC gets endorsed by the patient and shared with the insurer for swift reimbursement.</p><p>This is a simple scenario where a patient interacts with several healthcare professionals (issuers), who would be reimbursed by the health insurer (verifier). The patient would hold the VCs in a wallet and share them with the insurer when&nbsp;needed.</p> Pharma’s League <p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/pharma-s-league">VC prototype</a>, Carey Lai proposes using Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs to eliminate counterfeits in the pharma industry that has been grappling with counterfeit medicines worth $89&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Here, the issuer is the pharma company that can issue a digitized VC for approved merchants looking to resell their products. The holder is the reseller while the verifier is the Pharma’s league, a trusted marketplace. This way, buyers don’t have to worry about the legitimacy of the drugs and the pharma companies will face no losses from counterfeit medicines.</p> Decentralized Clinical&nbsp;Trials <p>With the raging COVID19, decentralized trials are gaining steam because of the speed and efficiency with which they can be performed. At the same time, there are concerns about the trustworthiness of these trials, and Leon Mak aims to address them with VCs built on Affinidi’s SDKs and&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>This <a href="https://devpost.com/software/apply-remotely-for-decentralized-clinical-trials">portal</a> will allow patients to check if they are eligible to participate and remotely share their credentials with those who are conducting the research. Especially when vaccine trials fail to report ethnicity data, having patients participate in trials using verified credentials with such information can help understand how diverse a trial was, and increase the confidence in the drug’s effectiveness.</p> CREDucate <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/creducate">CREDucate</a> by Saundarya Kumar and Pratik Savla is the platform where institutions can issue educational credentials to students who have registered under them and verifiers(other institutions) can request and verify those credentials.</p><p>This platform, built using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs, can ease the application and verification process in today’s job market. It is envisaged to help students to quickly and securely share their credentials with multiple entities and could provide a way for prospective employers/educational institutions to verify the credentials of the applicants.</p> RxChain <p>Olusegun Usman Quadri, a trained pharmacist and software developer from Nigeria, imagined the possibility of using VCs built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to prevent imitation drugs, cosmetics, and foods that can impact the health of unsuspecting consumers.</p><p>His PoC, called <a href="https://devpost.com/software/rxchain-zr1j9x">RxChain</a>, aims to help pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food companies protect their products by issuing a verifiable credential for each batch of products. This can be verified by the end-users. With this technology, end users can be assured of the source of the products they are taking and can stay away from imitations that can impact their&nbsp;health.</p> Helping Hand&nbsp;SME <p>Many SMEs tend to have cash flow issues despite doing good business due to pending invoices, Since these SMEs play a significant role in every country’s economy, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/helping-hand-sme">Hemanth Ankerla and Manoj Kumar</a> came up with the idea of using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to convert the pending invoices into VCs, so the same can be used as collateral for&nbsp;loans.</p><p>They believe that this idea can be extended to other services like insurance as&nbsp;well.</p> Global Identifier for Traveller <p>Richard Xiang Qian Ong came up with an idea to redefine the check-in process for travellers in the post-pandemic world using verifiable credentials. He believes this would avoid the long waiting times during check-in, the hassle of handing over physical documents during the check-in process, and the danger of COVID-19.</p><p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/global-identifier-for-traveller-using-affinidi-api">PoC</a>, he proposes using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to create a verifiable credential that can digitalize the check-in process to make it a safer and hassle-free process for travellers.</p> VaccinationVC <p>Zong Yu Lee wants to use VCs built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to streamline the process of vaccination, especially while traveling. His VC will allow trained personnel who issue the vaccines to sign up for an account and log in, to issue and sign the vaccination certification to those passengers who are eligible for it. The holder can then use this VC to prove their vaccination status to airlines, hotels, AirBnbs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>He foresees <a href="https://devpost.com/software/vaccinationvc">VaccinationVC</a> to be a useful application in a post-COVID19 world where people would want to start traveling after getting their vaccines.</p> Immigrant Verifier <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/vaccinationvc">Immigrant Verifier</a> by Nestor Campos is a PoC that aims to use verifiable credentials built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to help immigrants validate their situation in a specific country, with the help of their governments by validating their data through verified credentials.</p><p>He believes that his solution will allow people to create their credentials, with data that identifies them (passport, national document, and photograph, as well as other data), so that an institution in their country of origin can sign the document and prove the holder’s identity, Later, the holder can present this VC in any part of the destination country to qualify for government benefits, jobs, and&nbsp;more.</p> Employment Certificates <p>Rohit Patil wants to use Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to create <a href="https://devpost.com/software/employment-certificates">VCs for employment verification</a> where employers would issue employment certificates that can be easily verified by recruiters with a few simple&nbsp;steps.</p><p>His PoC has three components, namely,</p>  Employee: The employee will apply for employment certificates to his/her employer.  Employer: The employer can see requests submitted by employees and can approve if the submitted information is&nbsp;correct.  Recruiter: Employee can share a link/QR Code of his/her employment VC after storing it in his/her wallet. The recruiter can verify the authenticity of the certificate either by entering the URL or by scanning the QR&nbsp;code.   Power of VCs in a Pandemic Stricken&nbsp;World <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/the-power-of-vcs-in-a-pandemic-stricken-world">Hao Ze Chok</a> aims to use VCs built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to create a validated list of healthcare product suppliers so that nations could quickly engage with them during times of national emergency to commence export operations immediately.</p><p>His idea was born from the recent Covid pandemic that stressed the global supply chain of healthcare and medical products due to the sudden surge in demand among&nbsp;nations.</p><p>In his PoC, an issuer will check the products for their quality and will create a VC for the same. The holder is the seller who can then share this VC through an e-commerce platform for B2C transactions or through email with other B2B transactions. The VCs can be verified on a central platform on each country’s assurance portal.</p> DefenShe <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/defenshe-women-s-emergency-alert-system-gts3yj">DefenShe</a> is an initiative to bridge the gender disparity and empower women’s security by leveraging VCs.This is a real-time women’s emergency alert system built using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs and backed by dynamic geofencing and cloud notifications. The currently existing apps consider reporting the emergency only to the official in proximity, which might not ensure a quick response to the alert, since the official might not be near the woman who called for the&nbsp;alert.</p><p>DefenShe solves this problem by considering the public around the woman, which increases the probability of the alert being addressed by a thousand-fold. Moreover, to serve them better and to increase the probability, DefenShe plans to use a credit system that completely revolves around Affinidi API Service to authenticate, authorize, and verify the users for claiming the monetary benefits. DefenShe is envisioned as a self-sustaining application that would generate revenue based on the advertisements powered by Google AdMob and use this for the DefenShe credit system to pay for the users who help a woman in&nbsp;need.</p> KYC Data <p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/kyc-data-as-verifiable-credentials-for-policy-documents">PoC</a>, Ian Lim came up with the idea of using an AI chatbot-enabled messaging platform to facilitate the transfer of Know-Your-Customer data as Verifiable Credentials and performing KYC verification before releasing sensitive policy documents. His idea was inspired by Telegram’s integration of its payment service to the messaging platform and uses Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>In this PoC, he explores the possibility of using chatbots to retrieve a user’s insurance policy document. As insurance policy documents are sensitive, his chatbot would use the policy holder’s Know-Your-Customer (KYC) data as Verifiable Credentials (VC) to perform a KYC check before sending over the document to the policyholder.</p> Banker’s Guarantee <p>Kishan Reddy aims to pave the way for safe and secure global transactions through his VC-based <a href="https://devpost.com/software/safe-trade">Banker’s Guarantee</a> PoC built using Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>In this idea, the business owner would apply for the Banker’s guarantee. The issuer/bank will check the agreement details from the concerned parties and issue the Verifiable Credential as financial security.</p><p>The two parties (holder and verifier) can use this VC to secure the deal. If the payment is not made after the deal, the payment is made by the Bank and this gives the verifier the financial confidence to enter into a business agreement with the&nbsp;holder.</p> Health Wallet <p>As the name suggests, the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/health-wallet-a1ke0t">Health Wallet</a> PoC by Shraddha Kandpal that was built using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs, would contain the verifiable credentials of a holder related to his/her health and could include health records like prescriptions, reports, medical bills,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>When needed, the holder can securely share this information with the concerned parties such as healthcare professionals, insurance companies, and&nbsp;more.</p> Easy Loans <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/easy-loans">Easy loans</a> by Ramya Parthiban is a VC-based loan approval process that could speed up the loan approval process as it won’t entail the collection, submission, and verification of physical documents.</p><p>In her PoC created with Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs, all the proofs required for the loan process are verified by trusted third-party financial institutions, and the verifiable credentials are accordingly issued to the borrower. So, the bank can directly verify the Verifiable Credential and approve the loan without having to spend time and resources for the whole process. Undoubtedly, it will also help the borrower to quickly get the loan&nbsp;amount.</p> Vote from&nbsp;Home <p>Notagodzilla (username on Affindi’s Discord channel) wants to use VCs to revolutionize the voting process and make it easier and safer for people to exercise their fundamental democratic rights.</p><p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/vote-from-home-your-democratic-right-modernized">PoC</a> developed with Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs,</p>  The holder would create an account with a username and password which will be authenticated, authorized and stored in&nbsp;Affinidi  With permission from the user, the IP address and mac address are also collected to establish a two-factor verification  The issuer would receive the holder’s necessary details as a credential, and will accordingly validate&nbsp;it.  When the user votes, the vote will be verified by the verifier which is again a governmental organization. And when the election period ends, the server IP will be switched using Huawei’s Elastic IP (therefore no third party can access it), after which the verifier will count the votes by cross-checking all the verifiable factors of all votes such as the IP address,&nbsp;etc.  Users’ data and votes are immutable at any&nbsp;time.   AfinFi <p>Sagar Jethi and Oceanpro want to use verifiable credentials to accelerate P2P lending by instantly evaluating the creditworthiness of the applicant.</p><p>They believe that the biggest bottleneck in P2P lending is KYC, as both the borrower and the lending platform have to go through a 3rd party service, which ends up being time-consuming and expensive.</p><p>Instead, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/afinfi">AfinFi</a> would allow P2P lenders to see the creditworthiness of their clients and seamlessly manage the flow of data transfer between parties through a simple API provided by Affindi’s SDK without worrying about the complex and error-prone process for doing&nbsp;KYC</p><p>Thus, these are the PoCs that were evaluated in Affinidi’s PoCathon&nbsp;2021.</p><p>A big <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-pocathon-2021-announcing-the-winners-40b2a5a79fa4">congratulations</a> once again to all the participants for enriching us with your innovation.</p><p>We hope these PoCs inspire more people to explore the world of SSI through verifiable credentials.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

<p>These two posts point out some common Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that all organizations should be on the lookout for as indicators of attack:</p>
 
 Password spraying against Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices. Legitimate user credentials found and used. 
 Malware exploits against SonicWall VPN (disabling Multi-Factor Authentication). Vulnerability has been patched. 
 Use of phishing emails for initial compromise. 
 Creation of domain accounts for attacker use. 
 Use of Mimikatz for capturing more credentials and escalating privileges. 
 Use of Cobalt Strike, BEACON, BLOODHOUND, TeamViewer, RDP, and F-Secure Labs' C3 (a red teaming tool) for recon, lateral movement, and C2 comms. 
 Use of rclone to exfiltrate data to cloud hosting locations. 
 Deletion of backups and Windows volume shadow copies. 
 Use of ESXi to disable cloud snapshots. 
 Use of PsExec and PowerShell to encrypt victim files. 
 Use of NGROK utility to allow remote access through defenses.

			<p>One of the key benefits of tokenization is that investors get direct ownership of their assets. Through tokenization, they can directly control their portfolio or delegate the management to third-party service providers. As the assets are controlled by smart contracts, it is important to understand the roles and permissions of each of the parties in order to ensure digital asset custody whilst allowing efficient asset management.</p>
<p>Usually, marketplace platforms enable issuers and investors to manage security tokens across the lifecycle by providing web interfaces reflecting the blockchain states. If the digital asset marketplace helps issuing tokens on a public blockchain, they can also provide ways for their users to connect their blockchain identities and/or wallets to secure the access to smart contracts and token keys. Indeed, issuers and/or their agents need to perform administrative and corporate functions by signing blockchain transactions.</p>
 Safekeeping of private keys and authorizing agents 
<p>Marketplace operators must not propose wallet services to issuers. Issuers must be in control of their securities as they are the liable counterparty. They can delegate some responsibilities, but they must be able to manage their service providers. Concretely, the issuer must be the technical owners of their smart contracts, and be able to appoint the relevant smart contracts functions to their agents depending on their roles and delegated responsibilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issuer needs a wallet that’s set as the owner and controller of the smart contracts and one that can be used to grant certain permissions to its agents. This wallet will therefore not be used on a daily basis and can be easily secured with a multisig or in cold storage.</p>
<p>Everytime a function of a smart contract is triggered, a transaction is sent to the blockchain, and an authorized wallet must sign it. In order to respect the roles and permissions, it is important that each stakeholder manages the access of its own wallet. To reduce risks, these wallets must always be replaceable and this is only possible if the wallets are linked to a blockchain identity. For example, a smart contract owner should be able to change its agent(s) at any time, and the agent should be able to recover the lost tokens of an investor and so on.</p>
  
 Agent roles and marketplaces 
<p>Issuers are obligated to perform a range of administrative tasks and functions after the primary issuance of their assets. In traditional markets these functions are typically performed by agents. The marketplace, with its own wallets, can act as an agent and combine different roles such as KYC agent (add proofs of KYC on the blockchain, whitelist Investors, etc.), paying agent, transfer agent, registrar, etc.</p>
<p>These tasks could be performed on the blockchain directly but of course, a web platform triggering the blockchain functions is more suitable and easy to use. Therefore, in order to perform these functions, issuers, or the agent they instruct, should ideally access an administration panel linking the blockchain data with confidential information such as the names and addresses of the Investors.</p>
<p>The marketplace, by leveraging the security token standard they use, should provide a servicing platform in order to manage the lifecycle of the assets. This part of the platform needs to enable the agent or directly the issuer to perform operations on the tokens (like mint/burn, pause/unpause, force transfer, etc.) and to manage investors status and access their identity information. At the minimum, the platform should provide the following set of features:</p>
 
 
 
 Asset control and oversight to force and block transfers between their investors. 
 Maintain complete and transparent logs of data. 
 Run position reports immediately. 
 View their cap table that’s automatically updated throughout the lifecycle. 
 To perform the recovery process for investors if they have lost their wallet information and access to their security tokens. This can be performed securely through identification of the investor.

 Platform provider enriches IDnow AutoIdent with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to create even better user experience 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, May 20th 2021, IDnow, a German based leader&nbsp;in&nbsp;platform-as-a-service&nbsp;identity verification, today announced the implementation of NFC reading capability into IDnow AutoIdent. This will offer users an even smoother and quicker verification process.</p>
<p>The new solution will support all identification documents globally that follow the ICAO 9303 standard like ePassports and NFC supported ID cards. All the user needs are an ID card with a RFID chip (radio-frequency identification) as well as an NFC-enabled smartphone. The IDnow App recognizes the availability of an RFID chip, reads the personal data and biometric information (photo) that is contained on the chip with integrated privacy protection and compares the biometric information retrieved from the chip to a video selfie and a liveness check.</p>
<p>IDnow has seen that users increasingly value quick and easy identification and appreciate the freedom of choice when selecting their identification method. Different user groups prefer different methods, and businesses&nbsp; can see large increases in their conversion rates if they offer users a choice. Therefore, IDnow offers a comprehensive platform, that includes identification methods from offline to online, from automated methods to procedures carried out by identity specialists, available flexibly online, offline in branches and even by a courier at the user’s doorstep.</p>
<p>“The NFC capability for our AutoIdent product is a significant step in order to further augment our platform and create a smooth user journey for everyone. Our customers value this freedom of choice for their user and see high conversion rates with seamless, easy processes”, says Vikas Seth, CPO at IDnow. “Through the application of NFC-based RFID chip read out in the IDnow AutoIdent product, you don’t need to compromise, but get the best of both worlds – a high level of security and a convenient onboarding process at high speed”, he adds.</p>
<p>The principle of reading out an ePassport via NFC is successfully used by airports with ePassport gates, places with an extremely high security requirements. By adding this feature to IDnow AutoIdent, IDnow is empowering banks, insurance providers and other businesses to get the same level of protection from fraudsters and identity thieves through a method, that is already well established and understood by their end users, completely automated and built to improve conversion rates.</p>
<p>For high security use cases IDnow is also offering a variant that can check the authenticity of the RFID chip and validate it on a secure server with digital certificates to ensure that the RFID chip itself is not compromised by fraudsters.</p>
<p>IDnow has expanded its role in recent years far beyond simply offering individual ident methods and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year.</p>
<p>In early 2021, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers for on- and offline verification. This was the second acquisition within six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe. The acquisition of identity Trust Management AG enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Germany and beyond.</p>

   As users, devices and application workloads move outside the corporate network, the traditional model of enforcing security at the network perimeter is no longer effective. A Zero Trust model offers an alternative that secures data while ensuring it is accessible to employees, regardless of where they are working.

A Zero Trust model offers an alternative that secures data while ensuring it is accessible to employees, regardless of where they are working. But the path to achieving Zero Trust is unclear for many organizations.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/finding-your-path-to-zero-trust"></a>

<p>It’s official:&nbsp;only&nbsp;5% of&nbsp;US&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;want apps to track them across the internet for targeted advertising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That means&nbsp;95% of&nbsp;US&nbsp;consumers are saying&nbsp;‘no way’&nbsp;to&nbsp;cross-app&nbsp;tracking with Apple’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT)&nbsp;feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verizon Media’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">Flurry Analytics</a>&nbsp;is monitoring&nbsp;daily&nbsp;US and worldwide&nbsp;opt-in&nbsp;rates&nbsp;for&nbsp;cross-app&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;following&nbsp;the ATT release,&nbsp;and it’s&nbsp;abundantly&nbsp;clear&nbsp;most consumers&nbsp;like the&nbsp;control&nbsp;ATT&nbsp;gives them over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 5% stat we quote here was posted at 10 am Pacific Standard Time on May 8, 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flurry Analytics is&nbsp;monitoring&nbsp;answers to&nbsp;the&nbsp;privacy question,&nbsp;Do you want&nbsp;us to track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites?&nbsp;which now appears when&nbsp;a&nbsp;user opens an app for the first time after the iOS 14.5 update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flurry Analytics&nbsp;says it has&nbsp;aggregated insights across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">2 billion mobile phone devices</a>&nbsp;per month. As well as&nbsp;the ATT&nbsp;opt-in rate in the US and worldwide,&nbsp;Flurry is&nbsp;also monitoring the share of users that apps cannot ask to track (‘restricted’ status) in both the US and worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&nbsp;shows&nbsp;the worldwide opt-in rate is higher than the US rate, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">13%</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;10 am Pacific Standard Time on May 8, 2021, but as they&nbsp;say&nbsp;over at&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/">Ars&nbsp;Technica</a>, this global number is still below some ad companies’&nbsp;opt-in&nbsp;estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ATT will&nbsp;likely&nbsp;sucker punch ad tech&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We agree with Flurry Analytics when it describes iOS 14.5 as “the most industry-impacting iOS release to date”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stats are rapidly confirming early fears from ad tech&nbsp;that ATT will be very bad for business — which is why&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;has&nbsp;pushed&nbsp;back so hard&nbsp;against&nbsp;it for 12 months and with&nbsp;extra&nbsp;gusto recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The media is having a field day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-14-5-users-opt-out-of-ad-tracking/">Mashable</a>&nbsp;starts its article about the&nbsp;low US&nbsp;opt-in rate with “Sorry, Facebook.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over at&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/">Ars&nbsp;Technica</a>&nbsp;they’re saying: “Some of the first data on user behavior exceeds advertisers’&nbsp;worst fears.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are, of course, going to watch this space. In the meantime,&nbsp;we recommend that you answer ‘no’ to the ATT privacy question. Disabling cross-app tracking is good for your&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read our article&nbsp;“Apple’s New ATT and Why Facebook Is Pushing Back Hard”&nbsp;if you want to understand ATT better. Importantly, remember ATT doesn’t stop tracking within a single app (it’s only for cross-app tracking). You still need&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;to keep your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalized and protected</a>&nbsp;across different services.

<p>Securing high-value physical asset NFTs requires the dynamic and scalable approach to distributed risk protection that UNION&nbsp;provides</p><p>The DeFi (decentralized finance) space has seen explosive growth over the past couple years as numerous protocols have emerged to power an open financial infrastructure for borrowing, lending, liquidity provision, stablecoin issuance, and other services in this uniquely composable network. At the time of writing, the current<a href="https://defipulse.com/"> total value locked</a> (TVL) in DeFi protocols has exceeded $55 billion in digitally-native crypto assets. Yet throughout this stratospheric growth in DeFi, several high-profile protocols have been hacked or exploited, compromising tens of millions in crypto-assets and causing cascading effects throughout these interdependent protocols.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>’s core mission is to build the legal and technical systems that can bring the trillions of dollars in underutilized and illiquid physical assets into the crypto economy, which begs the question: how do we safeguard against systemic failures throughout all parts of the protocol&nbsp;stack?</p><p>Our recently announced partnership with<a href="https://www.unn.finance/index.html"> UNION</a> will provide the dynamic and scalable approach to providing risk protection which will integrate seamlessly with Mattereum Asset Passports and associated Real-World Asset NFTs (rwaNFTs).</p><p>Here’s a brief overview of the DeFi insurance landscape, UNION’s unique approach to risk protection, and how the UNION and Mattereum integration will work in practice.</p> The Current State of DeFi Insurance <p>Insurance is a vast and complicated topic, and this is certainly true in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, insurance is about mitigating and protecting against possible risks which can befall an individual, group, institution, or system. Risk protection is packaged and purchased in various forms in the marketplace and is activated when someone makes a claim to offset or cover costs stemming from the particular event in question (accident, medical care, etc.). Managing risk in commerce and life is, shall we say, a messy business.</p><p>However, crypto, being a global financial network powered by decentralised, interdependent protocols and a largely pseudonymous and in some cases anonymous user base, complicates the notion even further. How do we protect assets in this Rube Goldberg financial infrastructure in which we often don’t know the other&nbsp;players?</p><p>Risk protection and insurance-like platforms in the blockchain world have covered mainly two areas: smart contract cover and transaction risk.</p>  Smart Contract Cover: Individuals purchase cover in relation to a particular smart contract underpinning a DeFi protocol. If the smart contract was exploited and funds were lost, the individual could then make a claim once said hack has been verified by an oracle. This sort of cover is notably provided by Nexus Mutual (NXM). Yearn Finance creator Andre Cronje later created a workaround of NXM’s KYC requirements and built yInsure, a means of buying smart contract cover underwritten by NXM and packaged as&nbsp;NFTs.  Transaction risk: As the term denotes, this form of risk protection is focused on singular transactions rather than ongoing operations in DeFi protocols (e.g. liquidity provision, staking, etc.). An example of one approach to risk protection at this scale can be found in VouchForMe, a peer-to-peer insurance protocol that leverages a “social proof” system for individuals to establish their trustworthiness with one another. Alice puts her reputation and some financial stake on the line by lending credibility to Bob, vice versa, and across a network of peers, establishing a bottom-up trust framework to secure confidence in commercial transactions.  <p>Currently, the available platforms lack the magnitude or dynamism that can provide a more layered risk protection at all levels of the protocol stack, from the base-layer blockchain to smart contracts moving billions in value every&nbsp;day.</p><p>So if the current systems are inadequate for the scale of DeFi, how does UNION’s design provide the necessary guard rails for safely bridging DeFi to the physical world through the Mattereum Protocol?</p> UNION: Decentralized, Full-Stack Risk Protection for&nbsp;DeFi <p>UNION is a platform which provides bundled risk protection, decentralized governance and inclusion, a liquid secondary marketplace for sharing risk, and a multi-token model that is altogether capable of covering the myriad risks in this uniquely open, interconnected, and global financial system. Let’s unpack this statement:</p>  Bundled risk protection: UNION can provide risk protection to various activities and operations within the crypto economy throughout the entire protocol stack, including possible systemic fallouts from base-layer exploits, smart contracts, and applications. Most blockchain insurance projects focus mostly on smart contract&nbsp;cover.  Day-one decentralized governance: The platform will be powered by a combination of the community of stakeholders and the UNN DAO. The former are UNN holders who can participate in governance (direct or delegated). The latter is a virtual organization composed of larger UNN stakeholders, the UNION Foundation, and industry experts voted into the DAO which altogether work toward ensuring that UNION remains secure, fair, and transparent. All without KYC requirements.  Liquid marketplace for risk-sharing: UNION has adapted battle-tested pricing models in the traditional financial and insurance industries to the DeFi markets, allowing the unique composition of stakeholders in the blockchain industry to better distribute risk and create a safer environment for digital commerce and&nbsp;finance.  Multi-token model: UNION uses a three-token model. UNN is used by community stakeholders for strictly governance processes (voting, conflict resolution, protocol adjustments). uUNN tokens give protection buyers rights to a particular policy. pUNN are issued to writers of protection policies, representing a percentage share of the protection pool. This three-tiered structure specifically separates governance tokens from protection tokens to prevent conflicts of interest or clashing market dynamics. Bundling multiple utilities within one token can create critical problems down the line, such as when Nexus Mutual (NXM)<a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/nexus-mutual-just-ran-out-defi-coverage-heres-why/"> ran out of DeFi coverage</a> in September 2020 from a third party’s botched liquidity mining&nbsp;scheme.  <p>UNION’s composable and adaptable design is quite suited for integration with the Mattereum Protocol. Here’s how it will&nbsp;work:</p> Mattereum &amp; UNION: Risk Protection for the Digital-Physical Economy <p>The Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Real-World Asset NFTs, and Trust Communities. Here’s how the protocol works, in&nbsp;brief:</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the<a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/"> Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.)</p>  Asset Passports are a bundle of legal warranties tied to a particular object. Essential warranties include identification (data points provided by the owner and subject experts which describe and authenticate the asset), confirmation of the presence and capabilities of verification technologies such as NFC tags, and establishing the pairing of an asset with a particular Real-World Asset NFT (along with the terms of purchase and ownership of the&nbsp;same.)  Real-World Asset NFTs (rwaNFTs) are unique digital tokens that denote the right to take physical custody of a particular object. While sharing features with the NFTs now gaining popularity in the cultural mainstream in the creative industries, these tokens are different in that they are backed by an underlying physical asset, complete with warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability to create trust in&nbsp;trade.  Trust Communities are the network of expert certifiers that will accrue around an object (artwork, memorabilia, precious metals) throughout its lifetime. All expert certification of an object is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment.  <p>In practice, the Mattereum Asset Passport will integrate with UNION as a warranty with a plain-English prose agreement that features a pointer to the specific UNION risk protection pool and vice versa, dually-integrating the two systems. This is how we bring insurance into the Mattereum Protocol.</p><p>The UNION protection pools can also facilitate the indemnified certification process that form an object’s Trust Community, providing tiered coverage for appraisers with liquidity sourced from UNION protection pools.</p><p>From zero history to storied&nbsp;value</p><p>With blockchain-enabled authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, Mattereum removes the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued digital commerce for decades. Our partnership with UNION provides a key piece of the puzzle: a decentralized yet robust platform for full-stack risk protection that can provide some peace of mind for participants within the Mattereum Protocol and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Follow us as we bring the Mattereum Protocol to an expanding variety of markets ranging from memorabilia, gold, wine, to prized classical instruments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>More at: <a href="http://www.mattereum.com">http://www.mattereum.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mattereum">https://twitter.com/mattereum</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/mattereum">https://t.me/mattereum</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/mattereum-union-risk-protection-for-the-digital-physical-economy-628371e4cf8a">Mattereum &amp; UNION: Risk Protection for the Digital-Physical Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Avoid costly industry deadlocks and gatekeeping with a peer-produced, decentralized alternative to centralized collectible grading and authentication services with the Mattereum Protocol</p><p>On March 30, 2020, the collectible sports card world was shaken by the news that the gold standard card grading and authentication service,<a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/10367/psa-customer-update-april-2021"> PSA</a>, had decided to close its doors to new submissions following a vast uptick in demand in recent months that had created an insurmountable backlog. Competing firms may enjoy a new wave of users from this new demand, but as they operate on the same business model and processes — accepting incredibly steep submission and grading fees and using trained in-house personnel — this new window of profitability and growth may inevitably lead to the same path as PSA: incapacitation and immense loss of&nbsp;value.</p><p>How can the collectible card world achieve and sustain a level of scalability, resilience, and quality in the expert certification process that can adapt to the ebbs and flows of a growing, global industry?</p><p>Enter the Mattereum Protocol, a peer-produced, decentralized alternative to centralized grading and authentication firms that elegantly brings assets from zero history to storied value with built-in legal warranties and dispute resolution.</p><p>Before diving into how Mattereum addresses these issues, let’s first unpack the incumbent business&nbsp;model.</p> Monopolies | High Fees | Gated&nbsp;Markets Monopoly Mural photo by BP Miller via<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/Sgb3OmpipWY">&nbsp;Unsplash</a><p>Grading companies wield immense monopolistic power. A small number are held as industry standards. A favorable grading from them is much sought after. An unfavorable grading from them is fairly damning. A high rating by a firm like PSA can be the difference between a card valued at $500 versus $50,000 or more. Most of the card sales that make headlines with multi-million dollar auctions feature a PSA grade. In fact, a profitable cottage industry of specialist companies have arisen to offer predictions of what the PSA rating for a card may be. Occupying this indispensable position, grading companies can charge what they like for their services, comfortable in the knowledge that collectors and dealers will pay&nbsp;it.</p><p>There is a fundamental imbalance in power here. Disputes over a grading, while not impossible, are very difficult as grading companies are insulated by their Ts&amp;Cs which state that grading conforms to THEIR standards and that graders are authorized to exercise their judgement within these bounds. This is a double edged sword. While it ensures judgement by established criteria, it also grants their objective opinions on certain matters a great deal of&nbsp;weight.</p><p>In the legal world, we call these sorts of arrangements contracts of adhesion, situations in which a single, powerful firm takes charge of the contract drafting process and is able to bend the agreements to their favor. This a common instrument (among others) wielded by companies with monopolistic and gatekeeping tendencies.</p><p>Yet, despite the value and reputation these firms have in the collectibles industry, the actual mechanics of their business are difficult to scale which can be a stated justification for egregiously high fees. And so it&nbsp;goes.</p><p>We propose a different way of doing&nbsp;things.</p> The Mattereum Protocol in&nbsp;Practice <p>Peer production of goods, services, and infrastructure has become a powerful phenomenon in the 21st century. With the monumental success of peer-produced operating systems (Linux), encyclopedias (Wikipedia), and financial infrastructures (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains), it is not a stretch to imagine other industry verticals that could benefit from a similar paradigm shift. The ecosystem that has built around collectible card grading and authentication is certainly ripe for disruption in a way that encourages economic decentralization and genuine market efficiency.</p><p>To accomplish this, the Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Trust Communities, and Real-World Asset&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the<a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/"> Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>. For purposes of this article, we will mostly highlight the certification process.)</p> The Mattereum Asset&nbsp;Passport <p>In short, an Asset Passport is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary in accordance to the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification (with data points provided by the owner). Other warranties that may accompany an asset like a sports card may include a reference to the particular tagging system used for in-person authentication of the item (such as scannable NFC chips affixed to the object) or the token smart contract if the card has been tokenized and “uploaded” to an NFT marketplace. In practice, the Asset Passport aggregates warranties and object information using established best practices.</p><p>The Asset Passport provides the basis for securing an object’s provenance and value over time through protocols rather than firms. The following are some of the benefits this structure provides for the sports card industry.</p>  Skin in the&nbsp;game  <p>All expert certification of a card is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment. Even if they are not employed by one of the big grading companies (and wouldn’t this be a great arrangement for former staff of these organizations?), the fact that these experts are willing to put skin in the game and put their own money behind their assessments will not be overlooked by serious collectors.</p><p>2. Trust Communities</p><p>By virtue of Mattereum’s method of bringing together multiple third-party sources of information on objects, it is possible for a card’s Asset Passport to contain several independent assessments of its authenticity, provenance, and condition. This would enable buyers to get a broader perspective not limited to centralized firms. Experts can also hold each other to account to safeguard against erroneous claims. Through this distributed framework of crowdsourcing expertise, trust becomes a feature powered by community, not simply a risk to be mitigated.</p><p>3. Dispute Resolution</p><p>Buyers of the card have much clearer and impartial paths of recourse through the Mattereum Protocol if they have doubts about any information in a card’s Asset Passport. Our dispute resolution procedures ensure that suitably knowledgeable arbitrators will decide each case, and that these arbitrators will be neutral rather than defending the interests and reputation of a company. Fortunately, this mechanism is globally enforceable across 150+ countries by the 1958 New York Convention on Arbitration.</p><p>4. Composability</p><p>A Mattereum Asset Passport is more than just a grading. It’s an authentication mechanism, a record of provenance, a tokenization engine, and many other things ON TOP OF also being a condition and grading report. This comprehensive record of the card is a living document that aggregates all legal and software components in a single interface immortalized on blockchain and distributed file storage networks. New forms of ownership, commerce, and engagement around collectible cultural artifacts can be designed to create more utility and possibility around an otherwise benign&nbsp;object.</p><p>From zero history to storied&nbsp;value</p><p>Instead of buckling under the weight of growth and unscalable business models, the collectible cards market can adopt a peer-produced, decentralized alternative that provides the same guarantees at cheaper prices without centralized operations. With blockchain-enabled authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, Mattereum removes the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued digital commerce for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>Follow us as we bring the Mattereum Protocol to an expanding variety of markets ranging from memorabilia, gold, wine, to prized classical instruments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>More at: <a href="http://www.mattereum.com">http://www.mattereum.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mattereum">https://twitter.com/mattereum</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/mattereum">https://t.me/mattereum</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/decentralizing-and-securing-collectible-card-grading-services-with-the-mattereum-protocol-ead040351c2">Decentralizing and Securing Collectible Card Grading Services with the Mattereum Protocol</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>After this post you’ll know exactly what it means to use blockchain technology for Identity Management.</p>



<p>Blockchain is one of the 3 pillars of <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (alongside Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers) and we’ve spent the past 4 years building&nbsp;<a href="https://tykn.tech/product-suite/">Self-Sovereign Identity solutions</a>&nbsp;for organisations such as&nbsp;The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs&nbsp;and&nbsp;The United Nations Development Programme.</p>



<p>In this blog our team of experts examine what blockchain is, what benefits it brings to identity management, the role of cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs, why it’s a terrible idea to put personal data on the blockchain and much more.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in.</p>



 



 What is Blockchain? 



<p>Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), commonly simply called “Blockchain Technology”, refers to the technology behind decentralised databases providing control over the evolution of data between entities through a peer-to-peer network, using consensus algorithms that ensure replication across the nodes of the network.<br></p>



<p>More simply put:</p>



<p>Imagine a book (or ledger) that anyone could obtain, free of charge, where anything written on its pages would be there forever, and at the same time, would be cross-referenced with the other books to check whether what was written to be valid and true; this is the essence of DLT.<br></p>



 



 Why was Blockchain created? 



<p>Digital assets have a problem. How does one avoid that an asset, such as digital money, is copied and used by several people? That was a problem that always plagued the adoption of digital currency.&nbsp;</p>



 



 



  



 



<p>Banks allow trust between people exchanging funds. The bank withdraws the funds from person A and assures it’s deposited on B’s account. Both parties trust the bank to perform the operation.<br></p>



<p>But if one intended to create an ecosystem where there is not a single entity controlling the flow of information, where a user could send money directly to another user without it going through a central entity, this was a problem. How could the people involved in this financial system trust that the money had left A’s account and deposited on B’s? How could it be avoided that this digital money was copied and double (or triple) spent by A?<br></p>



<p>This problem was solved by the person, or entity, known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.</p>



 



 Why is a Blockchain secure? 



<p>What makes blockchain&nbsp;secure&nbsp;is the fact that each block where data is recorded cannot be changed. One can only write to the blockchain after the&nbsp;consensus of the majority&nbsp;of the network. Meaning that for a piece of information to be changed, all the blocks created after it would have to be changed and 51% of the network would have to agree on that change. Since blocks are being created every moment, changing those and the blocks preceding it until reaching the one we intended to change, would require enormous computing power. Also changing a block will result in creating a new branch of information which will be considered the source of truth, but the existing data also remains in a different branch, this process is called&nbsp;forking.<br></p>



 



 



  



 



<p>Satoshi created blockchain to solve the double-spend problem of digital currency and to act as a ledger, a registry, of the transactions of Bitcoin. Each person that transacts Bitcoin acts as a node in the network, registering a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain. This makes it decentralized, as no central authority is needed and each person in the network can write on the ledger, and allows for consensus in the network without the need of a middle-man. The more people are in the network, the more difficult it is for a majority collusion in order to subvert the veracity of the information on the blockchain.<br></p>



<p>With a public, immutable, registry, managed by collaboration and collective altruism, this digital currency users could easily verify transactions and be assured that the funds were being transferred only once and not digitally copied infinitely.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>A Blockchain is also considered a system with high Byzantine Fault tolerance. A Byzantine Fault is an occurrence on decentralized systems where it may appear, for one user, that the system is working perfectly and, to others, that the system is failing.</p>



 



 How does a Blockchain work? 



<p>The units where information are registered, the “pages” of this ledger, are blocks. Each block contains hashed information.<br></p>



<p>A hash is a function widely used in cryptography. It’s a mathematical algorithm that transforms a piece of information into a string of alphanumeric values: the “hash” or “hash value”. If the same information is introduced in the input, it will always deliver the same hash in the output. If there’s even the slightest change in the input information, the output hash will be widely different (this is known as the avalanche effect). Avoiding any correlation between hashes.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It’s a “one way function” because using the hash value in the output to find what was the information in the input is extremely difficult.</p>



 



  



 



<p>An Example of the hash and how the avalanche effect alters the output with even the slightest change in the input. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">(Graph Source)</a></p>



<p>Each block is linked to the next block through a cryptographic hash, and so on. Creating a chain. Thus, the blockchain.</p>



 



 Permissioned or Permissionless Blockchains 



<p>Blockchains can be Permissioned or Permissionless.<br></p>



<p>Permissionless, like the most digital currency blockchains, allow all users to write on the ledger. There’s no permission needed from anyone to become a node on the network.<br></p>



<p>To become a node on a Permissioned blockchains, one would need authorization from one or several parties. An example of a Permissioned Blockchain is the <a href="http://www.sovrin.org">Sovrin</a> one. Sovrin is governed by a set of Stewards who act as nodes. This is done to preserve the integrity of the information, in this case related to digital identity, that is written on the ledger. Stewards are trusted and vetted by The Sovrin Foundation.<br></p>



 



 What is Identity Management? 



<p>Also known as “identity and access management”, or IAM, identity management comprises all the processes and technologies within an organisation that are used to identify, authenticate and authorize someone to access services or systems in that said organisation or other associated ones.</p>



<p>Examples of this would range from customers and/or employees accessing software or hardware inside a company/enterprise – and the level of access, privileges and restrictions each user has while doing so – or, in a governmental setting, the issuing and verification of birth certificates, national id cards, passports or driver’s licenses (that allow a user/citizen to not only prove his identity but also access services from the government and other organisations). </p>



 



 The problem with current Identity Management Systems 



<p>Identity has a problem. If it’s paper-based, such as birth certificates sitting idly in a basement of a town hall, it’s subject to loss, theft of fraud. </p>



<p>A digital identity reduces the level of bureaucracy and increases the speed of processes within organisations by allowing for a greater interoperability between departments and other institutions. But if this digital identity is stored on a centralised server, it becomes a target for hackers. Since 2017 alone, more than 600 million personal details – such as addresses or credit card numbers – have been hacked, leaked or breached from organisations.</p>



<p>Most of the current identity management systems are weak and outdated.<br></p>



 



  



 



<p>Identities need to be portable and verifiable everywhere, any time, and digitization can enable that. But being digital is not enough. Identities also need to be private and secure.</p>



<p>Several industries suffer the problems of current identity management systems:<br></p>



  Government: The lack of interoperability between departments and government levels takes a toll in the form of excess bureaucracy. Which, in turn, increases processes’ times and costs.  



  Healthcare: half of the world’s population does not have access to quality healthcare. The lack of interoperability between actors in the healthcare space (Hospitals, clinics, insurance companies, doctors, pharmacies, etc) leads to inefficient healthcare and delayed care and frustration for patients.  



  Education: It is estimated that two hundred thousand fake academic certificates are sold each year in the USA alone. The difficulty in verifying the authenticity of these credentials leads to hiring of unqualified professionals, brand damage to the universities and the hiring companies.  



  Banking: the need for login details such as passwords decreases the security of banking for users.&nbsp;  



  Businesses in general: the current need to store clients’ and employees’ personal data is a source of liability for companies. A personal data breach may result in huge fines due to GDPR infringement – such as the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48905907">British Airways case</a> – or simply due to customer trust loss and consequential damage to the organisation’s brand.  



 



 Models of Digital Identity Management 



<p>The first model of digital identity management was a siloed one. Each organisation issued a digital identity credential to a user to allow them to access its services. Each user needed a new digital identity credential for every new organisation he engages with. That&nbsp;provided a poor user experience. Just remember all the websites you had to register and create new passwords and login details for.<br></p>



 



  



 



<p>The second model of digital identity management is called the “Federated” one. Because of the poor user experience of the first model, third parties began issuing digital identity credentials that allow users to login to services and other websites. The best examples of this are “Login with Facebook” and “Login with Google” functionalities. Companies “outsourced” their identity management to major corporations who have an economic interest in ammassing such large databases of personal data. This, of course, raises privacy and security concerns.<br></p>



<p>Facebook, Google and others became the middlemen of trust.<br></p>



<p>The emergence of&nbsp;Blockchain&nbsp;technology,&nbsp;Decentralized Identifiers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;allowed the creation of a third model of identity management: <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>



 



 A Blockchain based Identity Management Solution 



<p>As conceptualised and standardised by the W3C, the three pillars of <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> are the Verifiable Credentials protocol, the Decentralized Identifiers protocol and Distributed Ledger Technology (or Blockchain).</p>



 



 The relationship between Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials and Blockchain in identity management 



<p>According to W3C, “Verifiable credentials represent statements made by an issuer in a tamper-evident and privacy-respecting manner.” <a href="https://tykn.tech/verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, in essence, allow for the digital watermarking of claims data through a combination of public key cryptography and privacy-preserving techniques to prevent correlation. The effect of this is that now, not only can physical credentials safely be turned digital, holders of such credentials can selectively disclose specific information from this credential without exposing the actual data (imagine proving you are above the age of 21 without having to show your ID card!), where third-parties are instantly able to verify this data without having to call upon the issuer.</p>



<p><a href="https://tykn.tech/decentralized-identifiers-dids/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> are globally, unique and persistent identifiers. They are entirely controlled by the identity owner. DIDs are independent of centralised registries, authorities or identity providers.</p>



<p>When an organisation issues you a <a href="https://tykn.tech/verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credential</a>, they attach their Public DID to that credential. That same Public DID is also stored on the blockchain, an immutable record of data. When someone wants to verify the authenticity/validity of the Credential, they can check the DID on the blockchain to see who issued it without having to contact the issuing party.</p>



<p>The Blockchain acts as a verifiable data registry. A “phonebook” that anyone can consult to verify what organisation a specific Public DID belongs to.</p>



<p>In identity management, a distributed ledger (a “blockchain”) enables everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who attested to the validity of the data inside the credential, without revealing the actual data.</p>



 



<a href="https://tykn.tech/product-suite/"></a>



 



 The 3 actors in Identity Management with Blockchain: Owners, issuers and verifiers 



<p>When talking about leveraging blockchain technology for identity management, it’s important to note that there are three different actors in play: identity owners, identity issuers and identity verifiers.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The identity issuer, a trusted party such as local government, can issue personal credentials for an identity owner (the user). By issuing a credential, the identity issuer attests to the validity of the personal data in that credential (e.g. last name and date of birth). The identity owner can store those credentials in their personal identity wallet and use them later to prove statements about his or her identity to a third party (the verifier).<br></p>



<p>A Credential is a set of multiple identity attributes and an identity attribute is a piece of information about an identity (a name, an age, a date of birth).&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Credentials are issued by second parties whom attest to the validity of the data inside the credential. The usefulness and reliability of a credential fully depends on the reputation/trustworthiness of the issuer.<br></p>



 



  



 



 How Blockchain brings privacy and security to Identity Management 



<p>Through the infrastructure of a blockchain, the verifying parties do not need to check the validity of the actual data in the provided proof but can rather use the blockchain to check the validity of the attestation and attesting party (such as the government) from which they can determine whether to validate the proof.</p>



<p>For example, when an identity owner presents a proof of their date-of-birth, rather than actually checking the truth of the date of birth itself, the verifying party will validate the government’s signature who issued and attested to this credential to then decide whether he trusts the government’s assessment about the accuracy of the data. </p>



<p>Hence, the validation of a proof is based on the verifier’s judgement of the reliability of the attestor. </p>



<p>Leveraging blockchain technology, like Tykn‘s <a href="https://tykn.tech/product-suite/">Self-Sovereign Identity solution</a> does, establishes trust between the parties and guarantees the authenticity of the data and attestations, without actually storing any personal data on the blockchain. </p>



<p>This is crucial as a distributed ledger is immutable, meaning anything that is put on the ledger can never be altered nor deleted, and thus no personal data should ever be put on the ledger.</p>



 



 Blockchain Identity Management Red Flag: Does personal data go on a Blockchain? 



  Putting personal data on the ledger&nbsp;puts the privacy of the users in danger&nbsp;(as it will constantly be subject to hacking and data breaches). It could always be hacked (if not now, probably at some point in the future)  It violates current privacy regulation (e.g.&nbsp;GDPR;&nbsp;right to be forgotten);  it is also not efficient as an&nbsp;identity is dynamic&nbsp;(attributes can change over time e.g. house address or number of children).  



<p>When working in digital identity and identity management with blockchain, it’s extremely important to always keep in mind that:</p>



<p>No personal data should ever be put on a blockchain.</p>



 



  



 



 When using a Blockchain Identity Management system what exactly goes on the Blockchain? 



<p>Only references and the associated attestation of a user’s verified credential are put on the ledger.</p>



<p>Privacy can be ensured through non-correlation principles via&nbsp;pseudonymisation. So, instead of storing actual private information, the only things stored on the ledger (for the purpose of verification) are:</p>



  Public Decentralised Identifiers (Public DIDs)&nbsp;and associated&nbsp;DID Descriptor Objects&nbsp;(DDOs) with verification keys and endpoints.&nbsp;   DIDs are a new type of unique identifiers for verifying digital identities, and are&nbsp;entirely controlled by the identity owner. DIDs are independent of centralised registries, authorities or identity providers.     Schemas.&nbsp;   The formal description for the structure of a credential.     Credential definitions.&nbsp;   The different (often tangible)&nbsp;proofs of identity or qualification issued by authorities; such as drivers licenses, passports, identification cards, credit cards, etc. Hence, credential definitions are — as the name suggests — merely the definitions of these different credentials to be stored on the ledger.     Revocation registries.&nbsp;   An option for issuers to be able to&nbsp;revoke the claim. The revocation registry is what tells the rest of the world how the issuer will publish the revocation information.     Proofs of consent for data sharing.&nbsp;   In order to prove consent or reception of data (basically saying the data has been received and checks have been executed on it), these consent receipts (i.e. proofs of consent) let people do so.     



 



 Cryptography&nbsp;in&nbsp;Identity&nbsp;Management 



<p>Whenever we need to prove something about our identity – either our name, address or passport number – there is a process of authentication. A verifying entity confirms that the data we are claiming about ourselves is true or false. This is usually done through the verification of our identifying documents.<br></p>



<p>These identity verification and authentication processes make privacy concerns arise. Should a verifying entity requesting me to prove my name with my passport have access to the remaining information contained in my document while they are looking at it to verify that information? Does an entity that request a proof of my age need to know the day and month I was born?</p>



 



 A blockchain identity management system that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs 



<p>A Zero-Knowledge Proof is a method of authentication that, through the use of cryptography, allows one entity to prove to another entity that they know a certain information or meet a certain requirement without having to disclose any of the actual information that supports that proof. The entity that verifies the proof has thus “zero knowledge” about the information supporting the proof but is “convinced” of its validity. This is especially useful when and where the prover entity does not trust the verifying entity but still has to prove to them that he knows a specific information.<br></p>



<p>In an identity management with blockchain scenario, this allows a person to prove that their personal details fulfil certain requirements without revealing the actual details. <br></p>



<p>For example, one could prove that she is over 21, without showing her exact date of birth.<br></p>



<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs are famously illustrated by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_Problem">“Yao’s Millionaires’ problem”</a>. A scenario formulated by the computer scientist Andrew Yao. Yao discusses two millionaires, Alice and Bob, who do not want to reveal how much money each has but want to know who is the richest.<br></p>



 



  



 



 Decentralized Identifiers: The next big thing in Identity Management with Blockchain. 



<p>DIDs are a new type of unique identifiers for verifying digital identities, and are entirely controlled by the identity owner. DIDs are independent of centralised registries, authorities or identity providers.<br></p>



<p>According to <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">Phil Windley</a>, Chairman at Sovrin, DIDs should have the following properties:<br></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers should be non-reassignable. They should be permanent. Other identifiers, such as IP address or email address, can be reassigned to other entities by whomever is in control. This reduces privacy and security.<br></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers should be resolvable. Each DID resolves to a DID Document that states the “public keys, authentication protocols, and service endpoints necessary to initiate trustworthy interactions with the identified entity” (<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2019/02/decentralized_identifiers.shtml">source</a>). Through the DID Document, an entity should understand how to use that DID.<br></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers should be cryptographically verifiable. Through the use of cryptographic keys, a DID owner can prove their ownership of the DID. The public key contained in the DID Document can also be used to attest to the authenticity of the issuing authority’s signature associated with a credential.<br></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers should be decentralized. Current identity management systems rely on centralized registries. Each of these registries ensures trust. DIDs do not depend on a central authority. Distributed ledger technology ensures trust as it allows everyone to have the same source of truth about the data in the credentials.<br></p>



<p>A new spec is coming up in W3C where you don’t need to always rely on the central service to resolve DIDs. For use cases where a DID is going to be unique. E.g in pairwise connections or closed groups you can use Peer DIDs. More info on this, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#specific-did-method-schemes">here</a>.<br></p>



<p>Decentralized Identifiers could then increase security, as they eliminate siloed identity management, and increase privacy, as they give the identity owner the opportunity to selectively disclose specific information about himself. Ultimately, they will turn digital identities into <a href="https://tykn.tech/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identities</a> as they allow each individual to own and control their identity without depending on other parties.<br></p>



 



 What if I need to change something? Revocation in Blockchain Identity Management 



<p>Next to checking the attesting party, verification of a credential also includes checking the validity of the attestation itself. The validity of the attestation, meaning the accuracy and&nbsp;can be validated through a so called revocation registry. </p>



<p>The registry contains the status of each credential, whether it has been revoked (deleted or updated) and hence whether this specific credential is still valid. </p>



<p>In other words, the ledger enables everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are still valid and who attested to the validity of the data inside the credential, without revealing the actual data. </p>



 



<p>The scenario<br></p>



<p>&gt;“This is my drivers licence”</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; “Says who?”</p>



<p>&gt;“Says them”</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; “Who are they and do I know I can trust them?”</p>



<p>+</p>



<p>&gt;&gt; “Do they still agree/attest to this or have they changed their judgement?”</p>



<p>&gt;“Yes they have not revoked their attestation up to now”</p>



 



<p>Revocation means deleting or updating a credential. The possibility for an issuer to revoke a credential is crucial to an identity infrastructure for the main reason that identities are dynamic. </p>



<p>Attributes can change over time e.g. house address or number of children, and some credentials should have a expiry date for example a passport or drivers licence. The fact is, however, that in order to ensure trustworthiness of the system and eliminate the possibility to defraud, credentials are immutable.</p>



<p>After issuing, no one (not even the issuer) can change the information inside the credential. Hence, when attributes change, a new credential needs to be issued and the old one needs to be announced invalid. Thus, at each proof the users needs to proof that the credentials used in the proof are still valid. The revocation registry allows him to prove this without contacting the issuing party.</p>



<p>For example, the Government issues a credential to you, that you have 3 children. A month later your family is blessed with a 4th child. Now, the Government will mark the previous credential as invalid (stating that you have 3 children) and will issue a new credential stating that you have 4 children. </p>



<p>The revocation registry is a complex mathematical concept.&nbsp;One&nbsp;that&nbsp;we&nbsp;dive&nbsp;deeply&nbsp;on&nbsp;this&nbsp;blog, written by Katja Bouman,&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href="https://tykn.tech/identity-revocation-blockchain/">how&nbsp;the&nbsp;revocation&nbsp;registry&nbsp;works</a>. <br></p>



 



  



 



 How to prevent identity fraud and identity theft if I’m doing Identity Management with Blockchain 



<p>Through identity management with blockchain technology, each user stores their digital identity credentials on a digital identity wallet – like Tykn’s <a href="https://tykn.tech/product-suite/">SSI Mobile Wallet</a> – on his devices (like his mobile phone). Which begs the question: what if his phone is lost or stolen?<br></p>



<p><a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-if-someone-steals-my-phone-110319.pdf">According to Sovrin</a>, there are two steps to be taken.<br></p>



<p>The first one is to revoke the device’s authorization to use credentials. Digital Identity credentials are only valid if used from a device that was authorized to do so. If a user’s phone is lost or stolen, that user could use another authorized device, like his laptop, to write on the blockchain that his mobile phone’s authorization is now revoked.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This would take immediate effect and stop anyone from using the digital identity credentials on the phone. The thief would not be able to impersonate the user even if he has her passwords, biometrics or phone because the blockchain, immutable and secure, would contain a revocation registry for the phone.<br></p>



<p>Revocation of the device’s authorization impedes the thief to impersonate the user to create new relationships. The second step impedes the thief to explore the existing relationships between the device and other people or organisations. The second step thus is to revoke the existing relationship keys (pairwise connections where each of them has a unique key).<br></p>



<p>These two steps stop an identity thief to use digital identity credentials to access new services or explore relationships with existing ones. While conveniently letting the user still use his credentials on another device.<br></p>



<p>In many current cases, if users wished to cancel a stolen identity card, they would have to physically go to the municipality or governmental department, cancel that card and make a new one from scratch. Which would take time and still would not impede an identity thief from using your data. In the case of a stolen credit card, users will call the bank (which still takes considerable time) and won’t be able to use the card until a new one is issued and sent to him.<br></p>

<p>Launch Partners Include Polkadex, Fractal, Subsocial Network, GameDAO, DeBio Network and Galaniprojects</p><p>19 May 2021, Berlin — KILT Protocol today announced SocialKYC, a decentralised identity verification service for regaining control over your digital identity. SocialKYC will allow users to manage, store and present their personal credentials, enabling them to select which elements of their private information are accessed by online services.</p><p>KILT is an open-source blockchain protocol for issuing decentralised identifiers and verifiable credentials. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driving licence, certificates) into the digital world, representing your identity while keeping your data private and in your possession. The KILT mainnet will launch later this year in the Polkadot ecosystem as a parachain on the Kusama network; SocialKYC will launch shortly after KILT&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Developed by KILT in collaboration with Galaniprojects, SocialKYC will be implemented by Polkadex, a decentralised cryptocurrency exchange; Fractal, a KYC and decentralised identity provider; Subsocial Network, an open protocol for decentralised social networks; GameDAO, a decentralised autonomous cooperative for video game creators and investors; and DeBio Network, an anonymous-first platform for medical and bioinformatics data.</p> How it&nbsp;Works <p>In the current Web 2.0 world, users provide personal credentials like email addresses and phone numbers to free internet services in return for access. These credentials are frequently shared between service partners and subsidiaries, and applications often bypass the users to go through these services and authenticate user credentials.</p><p>KYC or “Know Your Customer” is standard practice while opening an account with a bank or exchange, proving that you own your government-issued credentials like a passport. “SocialKYC” verifies a user’s internet identity by proving control of their social accounts (LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, Discord, Github, etc.), email address or phone number. Unlike Web 2.0 sign-in processes, SocialKYC forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued. Personal data is not stored, siloed or&nbsp;shared.</p><p>To verify that the user controls their social account, SocialKYC sends a challenge such as posting a sentence on Twitter, clicking an email link, or confirming a code sent via SMS. SocialKYC then sends Verifiable Credentials to the user that remain in their sole possession and in their control. Users can present these credentials across many services — gaming, genetics labs, exchanges, media companies — when and how they&nbsp;prefer.</p><p>“In the real world you have control of your credentials. You have credentials in your wallet at all times; you decide who to share them with, and for what purpose, and when. Ironically we’ve lost this control in the digital world,” said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol. “SocialKYC is designed to liberate consumers, putting their digital identity back in their&nbsp;hands.”</p> Partners <p>Earlier this year, KILT partnered with Fractal and Polkadex to create a decentralised KYC system for users of the exchange. Polkadex and Fractal are implementing KILT Protocol as the underlying infrastructure for managing the KYC credentials required by Polkadex to streamline the onboarding experience.</p><p>“SocialKYC removes the need to trust the Polkadex platform for our users, as they can get verified in a truly decentralised manner. In this way, we can keep the KYC process on a non-custodial exchange simple and our users are free to choose and control what private data they want to share. It is a real step forward for the DeFi industry,” said Gautham J, CEO of Polkadex.</p><p>“SocialKYC is a forerunner in the digital identity and verification space. Together with KILT, Fractal Protocol can unlock great value in the ad market by providing a fair, open-source alternative to data duopolies ensuring a high-quality version of the free internet,” said Julian Leitloff, co-founder and CEO of&nbsp;Fractal.</p><p>Subsocial Network is a decentralised platform that offers new ways for social media users to monetize their interactions, without sacrificing their data or privacy. “Content creators on Subsocial will be able to mint their own tokens, tip posts and set up rewards. SocialKYC will help us verify these transactions across our marketplaces,” said Alex Siman, founder of Subsocial Network.</p><p>Gaming is another top use case for SocialKYC and KILT verifiable credentials, which could be used&nbsp;for:</p>  Developing registries for pairing players and tracking&nbsp;awards  Issuing educational credits and age verification for youth&nbsp;gaming  Providing KYC for rewards and payment&nbsp;systems  Tracking performance across multiple game platforms and networks.  <p>“Our cooperative of videogame creators, blockchain architects and business designers is focused on designing sustainable videogame economies,” said Marco Bahn, founder of GameDAO and ZERO Network. “Community funding instruments, secure transactions and identity verification are crucial to fostering gaming as a profession. SocialKYC aligns with our vision of improving videogame economics for the player, creator and funder by increasing engagement and participation.”</p><p>DeBio Network is working with KILT to build a mechanism for issuing revocable, verifiable credentials that ensure privacy and data security. “The decentralised nature of this SocialKYC solution, along with the guarantee of user sovereignty, supports the Decentralized Bio philosophy perfectly. It may also provide a way for us to onboard DIY labs and individual hobbyists interested in working with our data,” said Pandu Sastrowardoyo, initiator of DeBio&nbsp;Network.</p><p>“Our company became the first KILT integrator in 2019,” said Anastasia Galani, founder and CEO of Galaniprojects. “We are thrilled to be part of this initiative and develop new applications for the KILT ecosystem, so users will own their&nbsp;data.”</p> About Polkadex <p><a href="https://www.polkadex.trade/">Polkadex</a> is a fully decentralised, peer-to-peer, orderbook-based cryptocurrency exchange for the Defi ecosystem built on Substrate, the same framework that powers Polkadot. It enables high-speed trading, high liquidity, and lightning-fast transaction speed for supporting Defi applications and services.</p><p>Press contact: Kseniia Baziian — kseniia@polkadex.trade</p> About Fractal <p>Built on Polkadot, <a href="https://protocol.fractal.id/">Fractal Protocol</a> is an open-source, zero-margin protocol that defines a basic standard to exchange user information in a fair and open way, ensuring a high-quality version of the free internet.

<p>TrustedNFT.IO will empower artists, creators, and collectors with a unique solution to the authentication of physical&nbsp;artworks</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is collaborating with <a href="http://wisekey.com">WISeKey</a> to launch <a href="http://trustednft.io">TrustedNFT.io</a>, a decentralized marketplace for physical paintings, sculptures, luxury watches, and other objects of value. The trusted NFT marketplace will include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent the physical work, combined with fungible tokens for more fluid price discovery and for staking on physical&nbsp;works.</p><p>By deploying Ocean’s data marketplace technology to the domain of physical art, WISeKey’s NFT marketplace will combine the strengths of both parties. WISeKey has developed specialized chips to link physical items with NFTs, and world-class blockchain identity technology. Ocean has developed powerful decentralized marketplace technology, with a track record in the domain of data&nbsp;assets.</p><blockquote>We’re thrilled to help WISeKey launch its marketplace for physical authenticated works of art. Before Ocean, our team built <a href="http://ascribe.">ascribe.io</a>, the world’s first blockchain-secured art platform. <a href="http://trustednft.io">TrustedNFT.io</a> will be one of the first use cases of our upcoming Ocean v4 release. The starting point is Ocean v3 ERC20 Fungible Tokens with AMMs to publish, stake and swap intellectual property licenses against base IP. V4 extends this to represent base IP as ERC721 Non-Fungible Tokens, enabling tokenization of real-world objects.</blockquote><blockquote>– Trent McConaghy, Founder of Ocean Protocol.</blockquote><p>Purchasing an exclusive piece of art is an important milestone in a collector’s life, but this purchase comes with concerns that the work may be stolen, that the art itself may not be an original, or that its provenance might not be verifiable. While most high-end art collectors find it difficult to stop such acts, WISeKey’s WISeART technology takes steps to protect exclusive pieces of artwork. It combines authentication microprocessors with identity blockchain technology, which, together with on-the-ground measures, <a href="https://youtu.be/oNvhMvdchGk">can ensure the authenticity of the&nbsp;artwork</a>.</p><p>Moreover, if the art is stolen, it can be traced, making it difficult to be traded on the secondary market. This control is made possible because each artwork’s identity is stored on a blockchain in the implemented system.</p><blockquote>Like paintings or sculptures, NFTs need to be properly maintained. After all, an NFT is a record of provenance, not the artwork itself, so it’s essential that the records are up to date and always available. TrustedNFT.IO deploys a number of mechanism to provide this — for example, we use our WISeKey Swiss Mountain Vault as a backup, connected to a multitude of hosts to ensure that NFTs remain&nbsp;online.</blockquote><blockquote>– Carlos Creus Moreira, CEO and Founder of&nbsp;WISeKey.</blockquote><p>To learn more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5QyBj_91u4">watch the recent WISeKey webinar on TrustedNFT.io</a>, featuring speakers from Ocean Protocol and&nbsp;WISeKey.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

<p>Near Field Communication technology permeates our day to day life. Every time, you pay contactless at the cashier of your local supermarket and unlock the door to your hotel room or office you are successfully applying NFC technology, in the form of credit card or smartphone, smart keycards or tokens. All those transactions are marked by a need for security, after all thieves and burglars are always ready to take a chance.</p>
<p>But NFC has done the trick of bringing a new level of convenience into our day to day lives, where security concerns are high. Even Airport Border Controls in many countries like the UK nowadays rely on NFC to check passports and biometry without travelers ever talking to a state officer – everything happens fully automated.</p>
<p>IDnow is committed to this advancement in convenience for users. That is why we are bringing a new feature into our automated Identity Verification product <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">IDnow AutoIdent</a>. With the help of the new NFC reading capability – available starting from May 20 – we empower you to not only scan your end-customers documents via camera, but actually read out the chip that most modern passports, residence permits, and IDs contain during client onboarding.</p>
<p>Fast lane onboarding for rewarding real customers, final stop for identity thieves</p>
<p>Worldwide, identity documents are issued that contain a chip where the personal information and often even biometric information like a photo is encoded on. With IDnow AutoIdent we now support the read out of such chips by turning the user’s smartphone into a card reader. The ID just needs to be pressed against the phone to retrieve the necessary data, providing massive benefits to you and your end users:</p>
 
 Tamper proof: Chips are extremely hard to manipulate or clone due to its security features and protocols, protecting you reliably from fraudsters. Advanced authentication checks can be added to detect forgery and manipulation. 
 Fast-lane onboarding for your customers: The data read out relies on the touch and go principle, as you might know it from contactless payment. Your customers are rewarded with a speedy process that is a conversion booster, letting them enjoy your service faster. 
 High data accuracy and quality: Typos and wrong entries by your users are a thing of the past, as data transmission is highly accurate, improving your overall data quality, while protecting the user’s privacy during transmission. 
 No chance for identity thieves: Many IDs do not only contain personal data, but also biometric information like a photo. This photo can be compared to the person running through the process with the help of AutoIdent’s selfie or video liveness module to sort out identity thieves. 
 
<p>Relying on an international standard to support your global business</p>
<p>To support your global business and heterogenous customer base, we are relying on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/icao-9303/">ICAO 9303 standard</a>, when it comes to supported documents.</p>
 
 Adapted by 188 countries 
 More than 1 bn people own a supported document 
 IDs, passports and residence permits

<p>This blog provides a behind-the-scenes look at work we have been doing for the Office of the Chief Designer in Scotland.</p><p>In Scotland, millions of people — with all of the wonderful diversity of needs and abilities those numbers imply — use various digital and traditional public services on a day-to-day basis. Spending on public services in the UK represents about one third of gross domestic product and providing services to the public amounts to around 80% of government expenditure. For the wellbeing of citizens, as well as the returns on their taxes they deserve, it’s important that the people responsible for designing and building these services deliver good services.</p><p>We have spent the past few months immersed in the world of designing public services in Scottish Government. We spent hours in conversation around their approach to designing public services, during which it became clear they share our total commitment to putting people in the&nbsp;centre.</p><p>Public design teams — like teams in any sector — need to understand what they’re designing from the citizen’s perspective. As with the Scottish approach to government more generally, the Office of the Chief Designer emphasises the need to design ‘with, not for’. And yet, it’s actually quite difficult to engage citizens in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>In October last year, CivTech published a <a href="https://www.civtechalliance.org/civtech-sprint-engaging-citizens-in-designing-digital-public-services">‘sprint’ challenge</a>:</p><p>‘How can technology be used to engage citizens in designing Digital Public Services?’</p><p>CivTech is a programme of Scottish Government that connects public sector organisations with technology companies like Mydex CIC to co-create the solutions to specific challenges they’re&nbsp;facing.</p><p>This challenge was sponsored by a team from the Office of the Chief Designer and Connecting Scotland. The Office of the Chief Designer are responsible for bringing design thinking into how Scottish Government <a href="https://medium.com/the-service-gazette/the-scottish-approach-to-service-design-2a8a74725b5a">‘does government’</a>, whilst <a href="https://connecting.scot">Connecting Scotland</a> have been getting digitally excluded people online during the pandemic by providing them with devices and broadband connections. The sponsors wanted a product that would facilitate meaningful engagement with Scotland’s citizens to make sure co-design is the default approach to designing public services, so public sector organisations can build better services with, not for Scotland’s citizens.</p><p>After reading the challenge, we thought of our Inclued platform:</p>  It’s built to create a two-way, direct line of communication between organisations and citizens, so the values designed into it are already about putting citizens and organisations on a collaborative footing. It is focussed on the Scottish public and third sectors now, but it can be used by any organisation anywhere.  Inclued’s fundamental purpose is to improve access to services — influencing the design of services is another way of taking this goal even&nbsp;further.  We originally built the Inclued platform during the CivTech 3.0 programme, where we were lucky to work with some great people at Glasgow City Council as our challenge sponsors. Through this, we already knew that CivTech was an effective approach and how valuable it is to our&nbsp;mission.  The home page of the platform, including the work-in-progress extension (Digital Public Service&nbsp;Design).<p>This citizen design challenge was a ‘sprint’ challenge so it was more compressed timewise than CivTech’s usual programme, which ran alongside it. For all the reasons listed above, along with this time pressure, using the Inclued platform as a foundation and extending it made&nbsp;sense.</p><p>So, we submitted an application, got invited to the interview stage and made it through to the ‘exploration stage’ with another group. We spent an intense two weeks over November meeting various people in Scottish Government service design, mapping out where the barriers to engaging citizens were and thinking about what extensions to Inclued could potentially overcome them. This then led to us submitting an updated proposal with everything we had learnt. We were delighted when the challenge sponsors came back saying they would like to work with us to build a minimum viable product (MVP) over a ‘development stage’ between January and March of&nbsp;2021.</p>How we presented the values we wanted to design into the platform after the exploration stage<p>From January to March, we gained a huge amount of insight and lots of encouragement from a wonderful, diverse group of stakeholders, with whom we discovered the friction, effort, risk and cost involved in the current approach. Their experience closely matched our own, developed over the last 14 years working in public services. The process really validated our thinking and approach behind the Inclued platform, as well as our general approach of improving services by putting citizens in control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Our challenge sponsor team was incredible at linking us to the right people. We spoke and ran virtual workshops with Scottish Government service designers, people working on the Connecting Scotland programme, accessibility experts, user researchers, the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations, digital ethicists, and citizens. We saw real alignment with and commitment to our own values of citizen-centred public services across the board, and used their knowledge and experiences to translate our post-exploration proposal into an MVP, built by our development team and staged online for everyone who helped design it to give feedback&nbsp;on.</p><p>The MVP focussed on showing the basic flow of the extension on both sides of the Inclued platform. For citizens, we showed how they&nbsp;could:</p>  go through a one-time set-up of their profiles and preferences in their personal data&nbsp;store,  review projects they have been invited to and request participation in projects that they would like to take part&nbsp;in.  The landing page for citizens who either receive invitations to join the platform or join through other activity on&nbsp;Inclued.<p>For subscribers, we showed how they&nbsp;can:</p>  create projects,  invite citizens to participate,  Streamline and make consistent a lot of routine administration, such as making sure data ethics has been comprehensively considered,  recruit citizens based on any criteria needed without anyone needing to reveal these often protected characteristics,  gain an overview of all design projects, including various metrics like participant’s feedback,  view a showcase of present and past projects in the same organisation, so they can better maintain and share best practice and past learning.  A customisable checklist used to make administration most streamlined and consistent.<p>The main benefits identified during the development stage were that the extension would reduce cost and administration in public service design, improve design teams’ adoption and alignment with the Scottish Approach to Service Design, provide access to a broader range of citizens in a safe, privacy-protecting way, and lead to subscribers consistently building a better evidence basis for designing public services.</p>A project showcase that enables large organisations to track projects, gather evidence and share knowledge more&nbsp;easily.<p>We hope to develop the MVP extensions into a full product, which we think has massive potential to transform live co-design projects in the public sector and indeed any organisation with a service design function.</p><p>For example: this sprint finished just as Scottish Government’s most recent digital strategy was published: ‘<a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/a-changing-nation-how-scotland-will-thrive-in-a-digital-world/">A changing nation: how Scotland will thrive in a digital world.</a>’ In the strategy, Scottish Government outlines its aims to ‘use common operating platforms for the processes that are common across Government’ and for services ‘to be inclusive and designed around citizens’ needs, rather than the organisational structures or traditions of the organisations that provide them.’ It’s great news that co-design is an increasingly common process across government and Inclued, with this extension, is a good example of a platform that could underpin that, making co-design so straightforward it becomes the default choice for making public services work for everyone.</p><p>Our vision for Inclued is for it to become the de facto choice for two-way, secure citizen engagement that empowers citizens to not only access services but influence what is delivered to them, while giving governments and citizens insight and evidence into the value and impact of working with, not for citizens.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/connecting-citizens-and-government-for-better-designed-services-9b58205185ce">Connecting Citizens and Government for Better Designed Services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Integration testing in modern Spring Boot microservices has become easier since the release of Spring Framework 5 and Spring Security 5. Spring Framework’s <code>WebTestClient</code> for reactive web, and <code>MockMvc</code> for servlet web, allow for testing controllers in a lightweight fashion without running a server. Both frameworks leverage Spring Test mock implementations of requests and responses, allowing you to verify most of the application functionality using targeted tests.</p>

<p>With Spring Security 5, security test support provides new request mutators that avoid simulating a grant flow or building an access token when verifying method security in web testing.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will explore security mocking with <code>SecurityMockServerConfigurers</code> and <code>SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors</code>, as well as authorization tests for the following patterns:</p>

 
   Reactive WebFlux gateway with OIDC authentication 
   Servlet MVC REST API with JWT authorization 
   Reactive WebFlux REST API with OpaqueToken authorization 
 

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a> 
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html">Java 11+</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
 

<p>Table of Contents</p>
 
   <a>Test a WebFlux Gateway with <code>mockOidcLogin()</code></a> 
   <a>Test an MVC Resource Server with <code>jwt()</code> Mocking and Testcontainers</a> 
   <a>Test a WebFlux Resource Server with <code>mockOpaqueToken()</code></a> 
   <a>On Mocking Features in Spring Security Test</a> 
   <a>Verify Authorization and Audience Validation</a> 
   <a>Learn More About Spring Security and OAuth</a> 
 

 Test a WebFlux Gateway with <code>mockOidcLogin()</code> 

<p>Let’s start by building and testing a Webflux API Gateway with Okta OIDC login enabled. With HTTPie and Spring Initializr, create and download a Spring Boot Maven project:</p>

   <code>http -d https://start.spring.io/starter.zip type==maven-project \
  language==java \
  bootVersion==2.4.5 \
  baseDir==api-gateway \
  groupId==com.okta.developer \
  artifactId==api-gateway \
  name==api-gateway \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.gateway \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==cloud-eureka,cloud-gateway,webflux,okta,lombok

unzip api-gateway.zip

cd api-gateway
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code>, and reformat to YAML syntax (making sure to remove any <code>\</code> escape characters in your Okta issuer):</p>

   <code>spring:
  application:
    name: gateway
  cloud:
    gateway:
      discovery:
        locator:
          enabled: true
okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    client-id: {clientId}
    client-secret: {clientSecret}
    scopes: openid, profile, email

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: ${SERVICE_URL_DEFAULT_ZONE}
</code>   

<p>Add the Spring Security Test dependency to the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;5.4.5&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.gateway.controller</code> under <code>src/main/java</code>. Then create a <code>UserData</code> class and <code>UserDataController</code> to expose the OIDC ID token and access token, to use in later tests.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.controller;

import lombok.Data;

@Data
public class UserData {

    private String userName;
    private String idToken;
    private String accessToken;
}
</code>   

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.controller;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.OAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.annotation.RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;

@Controller
public class UserDataController {

    @RequestMapping("/userdata")
    @ResponseBody
    public UserData greeting(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser,
                             @RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient("okta") OAuth2AuthorizedClient client) {

        UserData userData = new UserData();
        userData.setUserName(oidcUser.getFullName());
        userData.setIdToken(oidcUser.getIdToken().getTokenValue());
        userData.setAccessToken(client.getAccessToken().getTokenValue());
        return userData;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.gateway.security</code> under <code>src/main/java</code>. Add <code>SecurityConfiguration</code>, enabling OIDC Login and JWT authentication:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.security;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

</code>   

<p>NOTE: For this tutorial, CSRF security is disabled.</p>

<p>Before adding the tests, disable the Eureka Client to avoid exceptions that will arise because no Eureka Server is available. Create the file <code>src/test/resources/application-test.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false
    fetch-registry: false
</code>   
<p>Update the class <code>ApiGatewayApplicationTests</code> to activate the <code>test</code> profile:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
class ApiGatewayApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>com.okta.developer.gateway.controller</code> package under <code>src/test/java</code>. Add the first security tests with <code>WebTestClient</code> and <code>mockOidcLogin()</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.controller;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.AutoConfigureWebTestClient;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOidcLogin;

@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
@ActiveProfiles("test")
public class UserDataControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient client;

    @Test
    public void get_noAuth_returnsRedirectLogin(){
        this.client.get().uri("/userdata")
                .exchange()
                .expectStatus().is3xxRedirection();
    }

    @Test
    public void get_withOidcLogin_returnsOk(){
        this.client.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin().idToken(token -&gt; token.claim("name", "Mock User")))
                .get().uri("/userdata")
                .exchange()
                .expectStatus().isOk()
                .expectBody()
                .jsonPath("$.userName").isNotEmpty()
                .jsonPath("$.idToken").isNotEmpty()
                .jsonPath("$.accessToken").isNotEmpty();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>By default, <code>@SpringBootTest</code> loads the web <code>ApplicationContext</code> and provides a mock web environment.</p>

<p>With <code>@AutoConfigureWebTestClient</code>, Spring Boot initializes a <code>WebTestClient</code> that can be injected into the test classes. The alternative for mock web testing is<code>@WebFluxTest</code>, which also configures a <code>WebTestClient</code>, but the test is limited to a single controller, and collaborators need to be mocked.</p>

<p>The test <code>get_noAuth_returnsRedirectLogin</code> verifies that the server will redirect to the OIDC Login flow if no authentication is present.</p>

<p>The test <code>get_withOidcLogin_returnsOk</code> configures the mock request with an <code>OidcUser</code>, using <code>mockOidcLogin()</code>. The mock <code>OidcUser.idToken</code> is modified by adding the <code>name</code> claim because <code>UserDataController</code> expects it for populating the response.<code>mockOidcLogin()</code> belongs to a set of <code>SecurityMockServerConfigurers</code> that ship with Spring Security Test 5 as part of the reactive test support features.</p>

<p>Run the tests with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test
</code>   

 Test an MVC Resource Server with <code>jwt()</code> Mocking and Testcontainers 

<p>Now, let’s create a JWT microservice for lodge listings using Spring Data REST. On application load, a sample dataset will be seeded to the embedded MongoDB instance initialized by Flapdoodle. JWT access tokens are decoded, verified, and validated locally by Spring Security in the microservice.</p>

   <code>http --download https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  type==maven-project \
  language==java \
  bootVersion==2.4.5 \

  packageName==com.okta.developer.listings \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==okta,lombok,web,data-mongodb,data-rest,cloud-eureka

unzip listings.zip
</code>   

<p>Again, add the <code>spring-security-test</code> dependency and Testcontainers’ <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/databases/mongodb/">MongoDB Module</a> to the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;5.4.5&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.testcontainers&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;mongodb&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.15.3&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and set the following content:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8081

spring:
  application:
    name: listing
  data:
    mongodb:
      port: 27017

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: ${SERVICE_URL_DEFAULT_ZONE}
</code>   

<p>Make sure to replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with your Okta domain.</p>

<p>Create the <code>com.okta.developer.listings.model</code> package under <code>src/main/java</code>. Add a model class <code>AirbnbListing</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.listings.model;

    private String propertyType;
    @Field(name = "room_type")
    private String roomType;
    @Field(name = "bed_type")
    private String bedType;
    @Field(name = "cancellation_policy")
    private String cancellationPolicy;

}
</code>   

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.listings.repository</code> under <code>src/main/java</code>. Add a <code>AirbnbListingRepository</code> repository:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.listings.repository;

import com.okta.developer.listings.model.AirbnbListing;
import org.springframework.data.mongodb.repository.MongoRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RepositoryRestResource;

public interface AirbnbListingRepository extends MongoRepository&lt;AirbnbListing, String&gt; {

    @Override
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('listing_admin')")
    AirbnbListing save(AirbnbListing s);

}
</code>   

<p>The annotation <code>@RepositoryRestResource</code> directs Spring MVC to create RESTful endpoints at the specified path. The <code>save()</code> operation is overridden to configure authorization, requiring the authority <code>listing_admin</code>.</p>

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.listings.config</code> under <code>src/main/java</code>. Add a <code>RestConfiguration</code> class for tweaking the Spring Data Rest responses:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.listings.config;

import com.okta.developer.listings.model.AirbnbListing;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

    public void setUp(){
        this.repositoryRestConfiguration.setReturnBodyOnCreate(true);
        this.repositoryRestConfiguration.exposeIdsFor(AirbnbListing.class);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.listings.security</code>. Add <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> to require JWT authentication for all requests:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.listings.security;

        Okta.configureResourceServer401ResponseBody(http);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Update <code>ListingsApplicationTests</code> to enable the <code>test</code> profile that disables the Eureka client:</p>

<p>Create <code>src/test/resources/application-test.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>spring:

<p>The test <code>collectionGet_noAuth_returnsUnauthorized</code> verifies that if no JWT token is present in the request, the service will return 404 Unauthorized.</p>

<p>The test <code>collectionGet_withValidJwtToken_returnsOk</code> verifies that with valid JWT authentication, the <code>/listing</code> GET returns 200 Ok.</p>

<p>The test <code>save_withMissingAuhtorities_returnsForbidden</code> verifies that if the JWT lacks the <code>listing_admin</code> authority, the save operation is denied with 403 Forbidden.</p>

<p>The test <code>save_withValidJwtToken_returnsCreated</code> mocks a JWT with the required authority, verifies the save operation succeeds, and returns 201 Created.</p>

<p>Try the tests with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test

<p>NOTE: If you see MongoSocketReadException: Prematurely reached end of stream in the test logs, you can ignore that for now. It might be because the MongoDB Testcontainer shuts down before the context.</p>

<p>Add the Nimbus <code>oauth2-oidc-sdk</code> dependency to the <code>pom.xml</code>, required for token introspection, and add the  <code>spring-security-test</code> dependency.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.nimbusds&lt;/groupId&gt;

</code>   

<p>Token introspection involves a call to the authorization server, so create a client app with Okta CLI, as illustrated for the <code>api-gateway</code>.</p>

   <code>cd theaters
</code>   

<p>Run  <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Rename <code>application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and set the following content:</p>

   <code>server:

<p>The POST <code>/theater</code> endpoint requires <code>theater_admin</code> authority to proceed with the persistence.</p>

<p>Create package <code>com.okta.developer.theaters.security</code>. Add a custom <code>JwtOpaqueTokenIntrospector</code> to parse authorities from the <code>groups</code> claim in the access token.</p>

</code>   

<p>The test <code>collectionGet_noAuth_returnsUnauthorized</code> verifies that access is denied if there is no token in the request.</p>

<p>The test <code>collectionGet_withValidOpaqueToken_returnsOk</code> sets a mock opaque token in the request, so the controller must return 200 OK.</p>

<p>The test <code>post_withMissingAuthorities_returnsFodbidden</code> verifies that without the required authorities, the controller rejects the request with 403 Forbidden.</p>

<p>The test <code>post_withValidOpaqueToken_returnsCreated</code> verifies that if <code>theater_admin</code> authority is present in the token, the create request will pass, returning the new <code>theater</code> in the response body.</p>

<p>Again, try the tests with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test
</code>   

 On Mocking Features in Spring Security Test 

<p>Spring Security Test documentation indicates that when testing with <code>WebTestClient</code> and <code>mockOpaqueToken()</code> (or any other configurer), the request will pass correctly through any authentication API, and the mock authentication object will be available for the authorization mechanism to verify. The same applies for <code>MockMvc</code>. That is likely why an invalid audience, expiration, or issuer in the token attributes is ignored in this kind of test.
For example, the following <code>AirbnbListingMvcTest</code> test will pass:</p>

   <code>@Test
public void collectionGet_withInvalidJWtToken_returnsOk() throws Exception {
    this.mockMvc.perform(get("/listing").with(jwt()
    .jwt(jwt -&gt; jwt.claim("exp", Instant.MIN)
            .claim("iss", "invalid")
            .claim("aud", "invalid")))).andExpect(status().isOk());
}
</code>   

<p>In the same way, if the <code>WebTestClient</code> or <code>MockMvc</code> mocks a different type of authentication than expected, the test might pass as long as the controller injects a compatible authentication type. The test will pass depending on which method the test is expecting to be in the <code>SecurityContextHolder</code>. For example, the <code>listings</code> service expects JWT authentication, but the following <code>AirbnbListingMvcTest</code> test will pass:</p>

   <code>@Test
public void collectionGet_withOpaqueToken_returnsOk() throws Exception {
    this.mockMvc.perform(get("/listing").with(opaqueToken())).andExpect(status().isOk());
}
</code>   

 Verify Authorization and Audience Validation 

<p>Let’s run an end-to-end test using HTTPie to verify both the authorization and that the audience is enforced in both services.</p>

<p>First, create a Eureka server:</p>

   <code>http --download https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  type==maven-project \
  language==java \
  bootVersion==2.4.5 \
  baseDir==eureka \
  groupId==com.okta.developer \
  artifactId==eureka \
  name==eureka \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.eureka \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==cloud-eureka-server

unzip eureka.zip
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>EurekaServiceApplication</code> to add <code>@EnableEurekaServer</code> annotation:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.eureka;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.server.EnableEurekaServer;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class EurekaApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaApplication.class, args);
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following content:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/
</code>   

<p>Configure <code>theater</code> and <code>listing</code> routes in the <code>api-gateway</code> project. Edit <code>ApiGatewayApplication</code> to add the <code>RouteLocator</code> bean:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteLocator;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.builder.RouteLocatorBuilder;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ApiGatewayApplication {

    @Autowired
    private TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory filterFactory;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ApiGatewayApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public RouteLocator routeLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
        return builder.routes()
            .route("listing", r -&gt; r.path("/listing/**")
                .filters(f -&gt; f.filter(filterFactory.apply()))
                .uri("lb://listing"))
            .route("theater", r -&gt; r.path("/theater/**")
                .filters(f -&gt; f.filter(filterFactory.apply()))
                .uri("lb://theater"))
            .build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>docker</code> folder at the root level (same level as the api-gateway, theaters, and listings), where all services are contained. Add a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file with the following content:</p>

   <code>version: "3.1"

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:bionic
    hostname: mongo
    environment:
      - MONGO_INIT_DATABASE=airbnb

    volumes:
      - ./initdb.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/initdb.sh
      - /{mongoDataPath}:/db-dump
  api-gateway:

  listings:
    image: listings:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    ports:
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:
      - mongo
      - eureka
    environment:
      - SERVICE_URL_DEFAULT_ZONE=http://eureka:8761/eureka

      - eureka
    environment:
      - SERVICE_URL_DEFAULT_ZONE=http://eureka:8761/eureka
      - SPRING_DATA_MONGODB_HOST=mongo
</code>   

<p>Get the MongoDB dump files <code>theaters.bson</code>, <code>theaters.metadata.json</code> from <a href="https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/tree/master/dump/sample_mflix">GitHub</a>.</p>

   <code>http -d https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/blob/master/dump/sample_mflix/theaters.bson?raw=true
http -d https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/blob/master/dump/sample_mflix/theaters.metadata.json?raw=true
</code>   

<p>Also get <code>listingsAndReviews.bson</code> and <code>listingsAndreviews.metadata.json</code> from <a href="https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/tree/master/dump/sample_airbnb">GitHub</a>.</p>

   <code>http -d https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/blob/master/dump/sample_airbnb/listingsAndReviews.bson?raw=true
http -d https://github.com/huynhsamha/quick-mongo-atlas-datasets/blob/master/dump/sample_airbnb/listingsAndReviews.metadata.json?raw=true
</code>   

<p>Place the files in some location and update <code>{mongoDataPath}</code> to use it in the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p>

<p>Create a file <code>docker/initdb.sh</code> with the following script:</p>

   <code>mongorestore -d airbnb /db-dump
</code>   

<p>Build each service image with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
</code>   

<p>Run the services with Docker Compose:</p>

   <code>cd docker
docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8761</code>, and you should see the Eureka home. (Wait for all services to register.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080/userdata</code> after the Okta login, and you should see an output similar to this:</p>

   <code>{
   "userName":"...",
   "idToken":"...",
   "accessToken":"..."
}
</code>   

<p>Test the <code>api-gateway</code> endpoints <code>http://localhost:8080/theater</code> and <code>http://localhost:8080/listing</code> with your browser.</p>

<p>Now, let’s test authorization with a POST to the <code>/listing</code> endpoint. Copy the <code>accessToken</code> value from the <code>/userdata</code> output and set it as an environment variable:</p>

   <code>ACCESS_TOKEN={accessToken}

http POST http://localhost:8080/listing name=test "Authorization:Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
</code>   

<p>You will see the following response:</p>
   <code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="insufficient_scope", 
 error_description="The request requires higher privileges than provided by the access token.", 
 error_uri="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1"
</code>   

<p>This is because the <code>listings</code> service expects <code>listing_admin</code> authority to accept the POST request. The Okta Spring Boot Starter will automatically assign the content of the <code>groups</code> claim as authorities. Login to the Okta Admin Console (running <code>okta login</code> will get you the URL), create a <code>listing_admin</code> group (Directory &gt; Groups), and assign your user to it.</p>

<p>Then, add the <code>groups</code> claim to the access token. Go to Security &gt; API. Select the <code>default</code> authorization server. Go to Claims, and add a claim. Set the following values:</p>

 
   Name: <code>groups</code> 
   Include in token type: <code>Access Token</code> 
   Value type: <code>Groups</code> 
   Filter: Matches regex (set filter value to <code>.*</code>) 
 

<p>Open an incognito window, and request the <code>/userdata</code> endpoint, to repeat the sign-in and obtain a new access token with the <code>groups</code> claim. Repeat the HTTPie POST request, and now your access token should be accepted!</p>

<p>If it doesn’t work, you can use <a href="https://token.dev">token.dev</a> to view the contents of your access token.</p>

<p>Stop the services with CTRL-C and change the expected audience in the <code>listings</code> project’s <code>application.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    audience: api://custom
</code>   

<p>Rebuild the <code>listings</code> service image.</p>

   <code>cd listings
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image
</code>   

<p>Restart the services and repeat the HTTPie POST request:</p>

   <code>http POST http://localhost:8080/listing name=test "Authorization:Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}"
</code>   

<p>You will see the following response:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token", 
 error_description="An error occurred while attempting to decode the Jwt: This aud claim is not equal to the configured audience",
 error_uri="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1"
</code>   

<p>You can verify the same in the <code>theaters</code> service.</p>

 Learn More About Spring Security and OAuth 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and understand more about <code>SecurityMockServerConfigurers</code> in reactive test support and <code>SecurityMockMvcRequestPostProcessors</code> in the MockMvc test support (available since Spring Security 5). You can see how useful these can be for integration testing, as well as the limitations of request and response mocking.</p>

The model reacts to supply and demand, so “when the network exceeds the target per-block gas usage, the base fee increases slightly and when capacity is below the target, it decreases slightly”. Therefore, as demand grows, more ETH is burned than is created via new block rewards, resulting in a net deflation.</blockquote><p>On everything else:</p><blockquote>Ethereum’s large and passionate developer community has consistently shipped bleeding-edge product innovations on the network, helping it secure its status as the primary settlement layer for decentralized finance.

It’s all being done in the hopes of PayPal becoming the world’s next “super app,” akin to China’s Alipay or WeChat, India’s Paytm or Singapore’s Grab.</blockquote><blockquote>The stakes are high: If PayPal pulls it off, the company could become a bigger part of U.S. consumers’ lives than Amazon, Google or Facebook. But, in the U.S., there is no shortage of banking giants and technology firms that have tried and failed to accomplish what PayPal wants to&nbsp;do.</blockquote><blockquote>“It’s difficult to become a super app,” PayPal Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman said in an interview. “I think we have a chance if we execute extremely well against this. But it’s obviously a place that a lot of companies are thinking about as&nbsp;well.”</blockquote><p>PayPal clearly taking a page out of Greg Kidd’s playbook.</p> 7. What Discord is up&nbsp;to <p>Speaking of playbooks, here’s The Information on what Discord is up&nbsp;to:</p><blockquote>The San Francisco-based startup is using a familiar playbook to court creators. In an invite-only test, they will be able to sell tickets to Discord’s live audio feature called Stage Channels. Twitter recently added similar ticketing sales to its own, Clubhouse-like live conversations product,&nbsp;Spaces.</blockquote><blockquote>Discord’s move marks the first time the actors, writers and musicians who converse with their fans on the service will be able to earn money from them there. Such transactions — say selling access to a private Discord server, or chat group — often take place on the performer’s YouTube or Patreon account. In turn, those companies get a cut of the&nbsp;sales.</blockquote> 8.

Amazon lost its place at the very top of the reputational roster but retained a strong positive&nbsp;rating.  Apple, which spent the last year making record profits and touting its privacy protections, was the only tech giant to substantially improve its reputation score.  <blockquote>Overall, companies that sell products and services to businesses and individuals — like Microsoft, Apple, Sony and HP — fared much better than ad-supported social media and information tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, TikTok and&nbsp;Reddit.</blockquote><p>That last sentence seems pretty key.

But after the Fed last week embraced one of the main arguments made by merchants, many observers believe that more bad news is coming for large and midsize banks. The Fed is required by law to cap the interchange fees that banks with more than $10 billion in assets can collect when consumers use their debit cards at retailers. Since 2011, the limit has been set at 21 cents, plus 0.05% of the transaction. The central bank has long ignored pleas from both sectors to make changes. But now, in light of a decadelong decline in the banks’ processing costs, the Fed faces growing pressure to lower the price ceiling.”</blockquote><p>Also, ICYMI, <a href="https://youtu.be/O80EnZCSPNw">check out Greg Kidd’s chat with Ayo Omojola</a>, GlobaliD adviser and VP of Product at Carbon Health.

<p></p>      SSI PRIMER 
  <p>In this article we will try to breakdown the concepts and terminology behind SSI, as well as the reasoning for its increasing traction particularly in Europe. Traditionally speaking human beings are identified through reference, claims made by ourselves are generally regarded as useless if there is no one to “back them up”, so to speak. As an example a statement by an individual that he is a citizen of country X is meaningless if he does not possess a passport i.e. a claim, issued to him by a trusted third party, in this case a government.</p>
<p>To combat this problem governments and later businesses started issuing attestations about certain claims. Sometimes these claims are directly tied to an individual, in which case the documents stating those claims carry a photograph of the said individual or a serial number, often referred to as a tax or personal number. Other claims simply state that they belong to the holder, in which case whoever possesses the claim is also its owner or can state that the claim refers to them. As the time passed new concepts were introduced, such as a legal person, the idea that an incorporeal construct or agreement can also have an identity. In the following text we will use the term entity to denominate both terms.</p>
                 <p>With the advent of Internet, a need arose to identify entities online and while legal persons can have their information be made public, natural persons wish to maintain their privacy which is also guaranteed by law. The traditional model taken from the physical world was transcribed into the digital and the end result is a fractured landscape in which every entity offering any services online keeps its own database of users, performs identity verification and uses proprietary ways of storing the user data. To combat this, federated identity networks were created to foster data sharing and interoperability but due to strict privacy laws these federated systems very rarely extend across borders.</p>
<p>The situation around online identity is even worse in the private space of the Internet where companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. offer federated online “identities” without actually knowing to whom that identity belongs to. In essence they issue attestations to e-mail addresses and there is no way of knowing who is controlling that e-mail address.</p>
      <blockquote>
<p>“On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” Peter Steiner, The New Yorker, 5. July 1993</p>
</blockquote>
          <p>This finally brings us to self-sovereign identity. This term is often misunderstood as meaning that an entity can self-issue claims about themselves without the need for trusted issuers. This is wrong in the sense that claims still need to be issued by someone whom everyone trusts same as before. What SSI means is that the entity carried its data with him and has control over it. This means controls over both storage and access. For example, traditionally you would walk into institution A to acquire a certain document which institution B needs in order to provide a service to you. This can be simplified in a federated system by having institutions A and B talk directly to each other but this still does not solve the fundamental problem that the entity to whom this data belongs to and about whom it actually is, does not have direct control and is dependent on the services provided by institutions A and B. The relationship is setup in a way that the entity has to ask for permission to use its data.</p>
 A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT 
<p>With SSI this model is flipped around and the entity controls the data and access to it while the institutions A and B would ask the entity to provide tem access to its data. This is a fundamental shift in the balance of power between entities and service providers on the Internet. The SSI ecosystem revolves around decentralized identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), both of which are standardized by the W3C. We can think of a DID as a document identifier which is not stored centrally with some institution but rather on a distributed network, most often a blockchain. The control of the DID Document and its associated public key(s) is proved by the possession of a paired private key. Now that we have an identifier we need something for it to identify. This is where the VCs come into play. VCs are claims made about an entity which are stored in a standardized form as JSON-LD documents. Claims can be anything, from an entities name, relation to another entity, or even full documents. UNISOT through its UNISOT ID service offers a full SSI solution with a registered DID schema on the BSV ledger (did:unisot). Our solution follows the Verifiable Credential model as defined by the W3C as well as the DID specification.</p>
                 <p>The image above shows how these concepts come together. We see a traditional issuer issuing a claim (VC) to a citizen (holder) and at the same time storing the signature of the issued VC on a distributed ledger (blockchain). The holder countersigns the VC with his own private key thus creating a strong proof of ownership. Seeing as how the VC is in essence a JSON file it would be easy for someone else to get a hold of the claim not intended for them. By countersigning the claim with the holder’s private key and storing the signature on the blockchain we are creating a strong link between the holder and the VC. The Verifier, which is in essence any third part wishing to verify a claim, asks the holder to present the VC and checks the signature of the VC on the blockchain.</p>
<p>This way the verifier can be sure as to who issued the VC, who it was intended for and that no tampering has been done after the issuance. This model fosters standardization amongst data processors by having them adapt to the data format used by the holders and it can be argued is an effective deterrent against large-scale ransomware attacks. For example, ransomware attacks on healthcare institutions are very tempting due to the time sensitive nature of the data and while SSI would not be able to help with the internal data we can see that it would be very useful for an individual to have his entire medical history in personal possession alongside it being stored with medical practitioners.</p>
          <p>SSI has also been recognized by the EU as an effective way of bridging the gap between identity systems of different member states which often refuse to share data cross border to national laws. By transferring the ownership of the data into the hands of the citizen these limitations are bypassed as the citizen has the right to use the data as he sees fit. This has led to the creation of the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) which aims to become a golden standard in SSI space and have the same effect for identity globally as GDPR has had for privacy.</p>
 NEW OPPORTUNITIES 
<p>If we look closely towards the BSV ecosystem and how SSI can provide new opportunities here we can see that one of the problems plaguing the blockchain space in general is the inherent user unfriendliness of blockchain addresses which are represented as meaningless strings of characters such as for example “n1aAmTXAg4o44Z9k8YCQncEY91r3TV7WU4”. In the BSV ecosystem one of the ways to mitigate this issue has been presented by <a href="https://nchain.com/">nChain</a> and <a href="https://www.moneybutton.com/">MoneyButton</a> with their <a href="https://blog.moneybutton.com/2019/05/31/introducing-paymail-an-extensible-identity-protocol-for-bitcoin-bsv/">Paymail</a> identity scheme which links BSV addresses to e-mail like naming format, for example “username@unisot.id”. The address is resolved through DNS SRV records which points to a server containing a list of supported services. While definitely a step in the right direction, Paymail ultimately still validates the “identity” of the e-mail in question and not the individual. While this can be solved by establishing the identity of the owner at the time of issuance it still leads to a serviced solution depending on DNS lookups. The schema also in essence represents a federated system based on domains. By enhancing the Paymail with SSI in the form of issuing a VC for a given Paymail address these issues can be effectively mitigated creating a synergy between the two identity solutions in the BSV ecosystem.</p>

<p>Our hearts go out to the Colonial Pipeline team working the incident response.</p>
      
<p>Using the word “breach” in a title is ubiquitous across most identity companies’ blogs right now. This is the way of any company in our space. Attacks are common enough and it’s often the same tactics: Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). In this model, profit is shared between the owners and partners who do the heavy lifting of providing access to organizations and deploying the ransomware.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>It is evident attacks have become more economical and have greater returns with less investment necessary. This leads to the ever growing number of security companies writing blogs based on current events. This specific attack hit quite a few more people where it really matters here in America. We need and love our cars.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/05/shining-a-light-on-darkside-ransomware-operations.html">FireEye</a> recently published an insightful article specifically on the DarkSide hacker group which we strongly recommend a read. The initial compromise consisted of the following:&nbsp;</p>
      
  Suspected password attacks on perimeter infrastructure  CVE-2021-20016  Malicious emails with links&nbsp;  
      
<p>This illustrates that password compromise, or acquisition was required before the hackers could move to the next step in the attack lifecycle.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>One thing remains tried and true: at the heart of these attacks, it often involves a credential of a user or privileged user. The techniques deployed include Brute Force, Password Spray, Dictionary Password Attacks, Mimikatz, etc. Businesses and their IT and security teams attempt to mitigate these attacks with methods that have grown tiresome and obsolete:</p>
      
  Create a complex, 16-character password  Rotate your passwords every 60 days  Invest in a password manager&nbsp;  Implement 2FA / MFA  
      
<p>We need to stop treating the symptoms, and treat the root problem in this security oversight. The problem is the Password. There are a multitude of authentication methods your organization can employ, but not all address this problem. We’ve compiled those into an <a href="https://www.hypr.com/authentication-attack-matrix/">Authentication Attack Matrix</a>, spelling out how each type of solution addresses individual threat categories. Let’s face it, even MFA alone cannot solve this core problem if one of the factors is the password.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>HYPR’s mission is based on the foundation that passwords are the highest risk component in any threat model. By removing the shared secret from the enterprise, businesses reduce the economical advantages of these types of attacks.</p>
      
<p>We look forward to 2021 as the year of acceptance. Acceptance that eliminating passwords for users is viable and a growing priority for businesses.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>There is not a single vertical, sector or industry that is not affected by the ultimate threat posed by passwords. We are looking forward to the day which blogs like these are no longer warranted by identity companies.</p>
      
<p>To learn more about how a passwordless security strategy can benefit your business, we have a wealth of information available on our <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/">resources page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

			 The Era of Blockchain Interoperability Begins 
<p>A few weeks ago, we announced our partnership with Polygon, making <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX</a> the first protocol for security tokens on a decentralized, secure, fast and cost-efficient infrastructure. Polygon is a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, opening the door to cross-chain interoperability.</p>
<p>The constraints of the Ethereum network slowed the adoption of security tokens for financial institutions. The network was secure and resilient, but it was difficult to use for non-experts because of the gas fee mechanism and the relative slowness of transactions. Now, we are able to assist our clients in issuing securities on a highly efficient and scalable infrastructure.</p>
<p>Securities issuers, asset managers, fund managers and investment banks can now easily choose to issue on this infrastructure:</p>
 
 Cheap&nbsp;– Thanks to PoS, transaction fees usually cost less than 1 cent 
 Fast&nbsp;– Transactions are confirmed by the network in a few seconds 
 Scaleable&nbsp;– The network is capable of &gt;10k tx/s 
 Easy-to-use&nbsp;– Users can still use Metamask and other Ethereum wallets, they just need to switch the network to Polygon. 
 Interoperable&nbsp;– as Polygon is based on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), it means it leverages the security of Ethereum whilst being interoperable with the wider ecosystem 
 
<p><a href="https://tokeny.com/5-reasons-why-we-partnered-with-polygon/"></a></p>
<p>Due to these new capabilities, we’re receiving many requests from institutions tokenizing their assets. New types of assets and projects become eligible for tokenization such as micro-loans, loyalty tokens for your employees or your customers, or even cross-border payment systems.</p>

 SingularityDAO’s AI agents will consume trading and DeFi data supplied via Ocean Market to improve their financial modeling capabilities <p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> continues its support of <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">SingularityNET</a> by collaborating with <a href="https://singularitydao.ai/">SingularityDAO</a>, a leading AI blockchain project. SingularityDAO’s AI agents will consume trading and DeFi data supplied via <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>, and SingularityDAO’s DynaSets will include OCEAN&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>SingularityDAO is a non-custodial DeFi solution allowing members to manage dynamic token sets (called DynaSets) consisting of a bundle of utility tokens. These DynaSets are somewhat parallel to ETFs in traditional finance: tokens that have limited liquidity on their own become easier to trade when aggregated into sets. SingularityDAO makes it more beneficial and less risky to hold collections of utility tokens that individually have only modest liquidity, opening the flow of capital to innovative projects.</p><p>Our collaboration will see OCEAN’s inclusion in SingularityDAO’s index fund / investment portfolio. This means the OCEAN token will be included in SingularityDAO’s initial DynaSets, benefiting from the increased liquidity provided by their&nbsp;AI.</p><p>This collaboration will go much further, where SingularityDAO’s AI agents use Ocean data sets to benefit its members. Here’s how. SingularityDAO is designed to leverage AI at multiple levels: AI manages dynamic token-sets, executes predictive market-making strategies to provide liquidity for these token-sets on DEXs, and predictively models hedging strategies.</p><p>All this AI requires a lot of data to learn and improve, which is why SingularityDAO is a natural user of Ocean data sets — data sets published via <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> (and other Ocean-based markets) into the Ocean ecosystem. The Ocean ecosystem is host to many diverse and varied trading and DeFi data sets. These make excellent candidates for consumption by SingularityDAO’s AI agents to enhance its financial modeling.</p><blockquote>Ocean Market and SingularityNET’s data-hungry AI agents make for a natural fit. Anyone can publish &amp; trade data sets as well as algorithms for AI on Ocean Market — all of which can be utilized to enhance SingularityDAO’s AI efficacy. This collaboration will also scale the demand side on Ocean Market. As both our ecosystems grow, we look forward to ever greater synergies between the&nbsp;two.</blockquote><blockquote>– Manan Patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/compute-to-data-is-now-available-in-ocean-market-58868be52ef7">Ocean Protocol recently launched Compute-to-Data in Ocean Market</a>, a means to buy &amp; sell private data while preserving privacy. Compute-to-Data resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It does so by providing a means to exchange data while preserving privacy by allowing the data to stay on-premise with data publishers, yet allows data consumers to run compute jobs on data. This will make previously inaccessible data sets available to SingularityDAO’s AI agents for learning.</p><blockquote>I’m really excited by the opportunity to work together with Ocean Protocol, one of the most respectable projects in crypto who has been constantly delivering community-driven, decentralized data solutions. SingularityDAO will constantly make use of data to train our ML and I can’t think of a better partner than Ocean Protocol.</blockquote><blockquote>– Marcello Mari, CEO at SingularityDAO</blockquote><p>SingularityDAO runs various AI agents to support portfolio management. Some, such as Portfolio Planner and Strategy Evaluator, use on-chain data, while others like the Price Predictor get data directly from exchanges. These agents consume and process vast amounts of data — all of which can be bought and sold on Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability. OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3">Blockfolio</a> | <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH8TXwmWWAE9TZO0yTBHB3A">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ocean_protocol">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram Chat</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a></p> About SingularityDAO <p>SingularityDAO is a decentralised platform, governed by the SDAO token, tasked with governing DynaSets.

 Peer DIDs — What Can You Do With&nbsp;It? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a unique type of identifier that allows entities to generate and control their digital identity. Often, these DIDs are implemented on blockchains, databases, IPFS, and other Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) systems that establish a public and shared source of truth. These DIDs help the parties involved in a transaction to resolve the DID to a DID document and verify the authenticity of the information with the public keys present in the document.</p><p>That said, DID implementations don’t always have to be on blockchains or other systems that establish a public source of truth. It can also be implemented as a direct interaction between the two parties to a transaction. The way that two entities interact with each other directly without involving a network is the core principle of peer DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>The idea behind creating these peer DID methods is to ensure a cheap, fast, secure, and scalable way to create and maintain private relationships between two entities. Let’s say, Alice and Bob are two entities who are interacting with each other, so only both of them care about the transaction and have a need to resolve their respective DIDs.</p><p>So, why should the other parties who are not connected to a transaction see their&nbsp;DIDs?</p><p>This is why peer DIDs could be a possible solution in cases that involve exactly two&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Also, these DIDs can connect back to a chain-based ecosystem when needed, as long as the credentials have not been revoked, and this is what makes them a flexible and versatile choice. And of course, it gives entities complete control over their digital relationships.</p> How are Peer DIDs Implemented? <p>In a traditional DID implementation, the public keys of both parties are registered on a blockchain or any other DLT, but in a peer DID, there’s no network. So, Alice creates a DID, puts it in a DID document, and sends it directly to Bob. Likewise, Bob creates a DID, puts it in a DID document, and sends the doc to&nbsp;Alice.</p><p>So, both Alice and Bob create their records and send the metadata of their records to each other, so one can use that metadata to look up the record of the other. This information can also be cryptographically encrypted for security.</p><p>This is something similar to the analogy where Alice creates a part of a secret and Bob creates a part of the same secret, and they exchange it with each other, so only both of them know the complete&nbsp;secret.</p><p>This brings up many questions regarding the creation, security, and storage of DID docs, so let’s delve deeper into&nbsp;them.</p> How are Peer DIDs&nbsp;created? <p>To create a peer DID, you need two things — a stored variant and a numeric&nbsp;basis.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">DIF</a></p><p>A stored variant is a DID doc that contains the keys, but not the actual DID value. The numeric basis is the 256-bit value you get when you use the sha256 hash value or any other numeric algorithm on the contents of the original&nbsp;DID.</p><p>This 256-bit string has to be prefixed with a few other values. First off, you need to mention the numeric algorithm you’re using and the standard is to use the value “1” for sha256. The second value you’ll mention is the binary transformation method used and again the standard is base58 and it is represented by z. This is followed by a bunch of alphanumeric characters that tells the receiver that this is a multi-codec value where 32 bytes are encoded using SHA256 and this is finally followed by the encoded value of the DID contents.</p><p>Add all of these to the method prefix — did:peer.</p><p>So, your final peer did will look something like&nbsp;this</p><p>did:peer:1zdksdnrjq0ru092sdfsd491cxvs03e0</p><p>The key takeaway from this is that you create a DID and run it through an algorithm to get a peer DID that can be shared directly with another&nbsp;entity.</p> How are Peer DIDs&nbsp;Shared? <p>Next, comes the question of how the peer DIDs are&nbsp;shared?</p><p>A popular choice is to use the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0116-evidence-exchange/README.md">Aries RFC 0023</a> DID exchange protocol. But you can also send a DID and a signed DID doc over a TLS session, but watch out for SSL applications between the two of you, as this can bring in an unnecessary middleman into the transaction.</p> Where are the DIDs&nbsp;stored? <p>Peer DIDs are stored in a place that’s controlled by both the parties and could be a hard drive, mobile device, data center, etc. The only key aspect is that these two entities alone should have access to this DID doc on any storage device. And as long as it is not available publicly, it is a peer&nbsp;DID.</p> Should you use Peer&nbsp;DIDs? <p>Peer DIDs offer many benefits such&nbsp;as,</p>  No transaction costs&nbsp;involved  Easy to create and&nbsp;maintain  Since these DIDs are independent of a central system such as a GDPR controller, they can be scaled as&nbsp;needed  Offers the highest levels of privacy as only the parties involved can access the&nbsp;DIDs  No uncertainties or external problems since these DIDs are not associated with any particular network  No degradation of trust throughout the entire lifecycle.  In tune with local-first software philosophies  Reduces unnecessary correlation between a verifier and an issuer of a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credential</a>.  <p>But you can use it only when exactly two parties are involved in a direct exchange of information. So, that’s something to consider when deciding if peer DIDs are the right choice for a transaction.</p><p>We hope this was a good starting point to kindle your interest in peer DIDs and the world of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

<p>At Spruce, we’re building the most secure and convenient way for developers to share authentic data. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> Tezos Profiles &amp;&nbsp;Kepler <p>Tezos Profiles (TZP) is an in-development web application that helps users regain control of their digital identity for use across platforms. It allows users to create portable verified profiles by demonstrating control over their public social media accounts, and by associating self-attested basic profile information. These verified profiles are then linked to Tezos accounts, allowing any platform to resolve and establish trusted information to mitigate identity&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Tezos Profiles uses <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler">Kepler</a>. Kepler provides an IPFS-like storage system bucketed by “orbits”. An orbit is a logical store of content with access permissions and replication that is bounded by an authorization model defined by the orbit commander. Over the past month at Spruce we’ve implemented a Kepler MVP with initial support for the Tezos ecosystem, along with a TypeScript Client which integrates with the Beacon Wallet tool suite to provide decentralized storage for Tezos DApp users and developers.</p><p>We’re currently in the final phases of testing to enable users to access two credential workflows:</p>  Basic profile: self-attested information that contains a name, description, website, and&nbsp;logo.  Twitter account: users tweet a signature message that can be verified using a CloudFlare worker to associate their Twitter account to their Tezos&nbsp;account.  <p>After receiving credentials, users then are able to take the following actions:</p>  Upload their credentials to a Kepler Orbit specific to that user and under their control. It can then be replicated to Kepler hosts authorized by the user to hold those credentials.  Deploy their own smart contract which references the content stored in the Tezos Profile, and contains content hashes to prevent any tampering. A reference, hash, and content type are all the information stored on-chain, which allows deletion of claims to still be privacy-preserving.  <p>We’ve also developed a TypeScript SDK to manage Tezos Profiles directly, along with more general tools for the management of the base smart contract if a user wishes to repurpose the content-validation features for other applications.</p> DIDKit <p><a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a> is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>  Published DIDKit to PyPi, now available through pip&nbsp;install.

			 Sarà ottenibile con una semplice procedura da remoto, &nbsp;o presso uno dei partner InfoCert o ancora più rapidamente per i possessori di Firma Digitale o CNS.&nbsp; 
<p>Roma, 17 Maggio 2021 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, annuncia la disponibilità di SPID Uso Professionale – il cosiddetto SPID di tipo 3 – l’identità digitale dedicata a chi deve utilizzare l’account SPID prevalentemente per scopi lavorativi, magari per esigenza dell’eventuale organizzazione di appartenenza.</p>
<p>SPID Uso Professionale è accettato da tutti i portali della Pubblica Amministrazione e dai siti privati che già consentono l’accesso con SPID Persona Fisica – ossia lo SPID di tipo 1 rilasciato ai cittadini per l’utilizzo personale.</p>
<p>“L’utilizzo di SPID è cresciuto esponenzialmente nel 2020, tanto da registrare oltre 20 milioni di identità attive, rispetto ai 5 milioni registrati a fine 2019.. Per i cittadini è ormai uno strumento indispensabile per richiedere bonus governativi, consultare posizioni previdenziali e contributive, ottenere il Cashback di Stato, accedere all’APP IO e molto altro – commenta Pasquale Chiaro, Head of Product Marketing di InfoCert – La possibilità di disporre di un account professionale semplificherà l’operatività di imprese e professionisti in molteplici contesti lavorativi – come già dimostrano diversi casi d’uso nei reparti amministrativi di grandi aziende o all’interno di studi associati di avvocati, commercialisti e consulenti del lavoro – accelerando ulteriormente la diffusione di uno strumento capace di generare valore per l’intero sistema Paese. Finalmente le organizzazioni non saranno costrette a richiedere ai dipendenti l’uso di uno strumento privato, quale è SPID personale, e di avere comunque la garanzia di usabilità su tutti i portali.”</p>
 Ottenere SPID Uso Professionale 
<p>È richiedibile di persona presso gli InfoCert Point e i partner convenzionati, oppure da remoto e completamente online nelle modalità già previste da InfoCert per il rilascio di InfoCertID, lo SPID Persona Fisica per uso privato e cioè tramite il video riconoscimento web con l’assistenza di InfoCert, oppure in completa autonomia per chi già possiede una Firma Digitale o una Carta Nazionale dei Servizi (CNS).</p>
<p>Grazie alla nuova app MyInfoCert è peraltro facilissimo gestire, contemporaneamente e da un unico punto, i propri account SPID.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Play a game, hang out, stack. Up to 1M sats¹ up for&nbsp;grabs!”</p><p>Yes, Bitcoin is now a medium for rewarding microtasks. It’s one of the most exciting applications of the world’s largest cryptocurrency.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://earncarrot.com/">Carrot</a> launched as a platform designed for people to earn bitcoin rewards simply by supporting the projects and brands they love. Built by the team at <a href="https://b.tc/">BTC Inc</a>, the media group behind <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/">Bitcoin Magazine</a>, Carrot is novel on two fronts: the platform not only gives creators <a href="https://medium.com/earncarrot/four-use-cases-for-carrot-133f1dbc29fa">efficient ways</a> to reward supporters directly, but also creates a critical new avenue for getting bitcoin into the hands of more people worldwide.</p><p>Powered by Magic authentication, Carrot is hitting record growth — with tens of thousands of users and counting.</p> Auth to reach a wider&nbsp;audience <p>Bitcoin’s meteoric rise made headlines all throughout last year and in turn, has helped bring crypto to the&nbsp;masses.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tylev?lang=en">Tyler Evans</a> is at the center of it all, as the co-founder and CTO of BTC Inc, one of the first Bitcoin-focused media and product companies in the world. Carrot is the latest product from the portfolio company, and it offers fun challenges, surveys, and the like to incentivize users with the chance to earn satoshis, the smallest units of Bitcoin currency.</p><p>Tyler summarizes Carrot’s mission into one word: hyperbitcoinization.</p><blockquote>“We built Carrot to be the economic engine of hyperbitcoinization, letting the next billion people earn their first&nbsp;bitcoin.</blockquote><p>To achieve this mission, the app needed to scale beyond the world of Web 3.0. The Carrot team knew authentication would play an important role in catering to a more mainstream user base. Rolling auth from scratch was not a viable option, given the cost of resourcing their lean team of engineers on non-core product work. So, they turned to auth solutions that valued privacy, security, and user experience.</p><p>According to Tyler, what differentiated Magic was the robust security benefits and seamless login flows, “all with crypto principles built-in.” Leveraging blockchain-based, public-private key cryptography, Magic identity aligns with the standard of trust within crypto communities.</p> Intuitive onboarding, plus peace of&nbsp;mind <p>The key to hyperbitcoinization? “A frictionless way to onboard mainstream users is a must. That’s where Magic comes in,” Tyler emphasized.</p><p>From a UX perspective, magic links were a friendly onboarding experience for people regardless of their familiarity with the crypto space. The team was confident that passwordless was the best path forward, based on their own experience using magic links through Slack and&nbsp;Medium.</p><blockquote>“Magic offers the easiest, lowest friction way to sign up, especially if you’re entirely new to&nbsp;crypto.”</blockquote><p>What impressed them further was how easy it was for their developers to get up and running with Magic, thanks to the clear documentation.</p><blockquote>“Magic is a complete toolset that safeguards accounts, comes with well-designed emails, and gives peace of mind on the security side. That’s key for Bitcoin because money is at&nbsp;stake.”</blockquote> Fueling hyperbitcoinization <p>From alpha, beta, and beyond, Carrot is climbing to all-time highs for total users. Since the start, Magic has powered authentication and identity, scaling seamlessly across multiple phases of rapid&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Web 3.0 presents tremendous opportunity for innovative decentralized applications and business models. There’s more excitement with Bitcoin rewards around the corner — Carrot’s new mobile app is launching soon.</p><p>[1] Sats or satoshis = smallest bitcoin unit, equal to 100 millionth of a&nbsp;bitcoin</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/how-magic-helps-carrot-reward-the-next-billion-users-in-bitcoin-c06acba8a3e4">How Magic helps Carrot reward the next billion users in Bitcoin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Dutch government drafted a legislative proposal for the Remote Gambling Act and after a long parliamentary process, this Act was passed by the Dutch Senate in February 2019.</p>
<p>After being put back the act finally entered in force on April 1st 2021 meaning operators had until the 15th April 2021 to apply, and then launch of the licensed market on October 1 2021.</p>
<p>KSA received 28 applicants, with all applicants paying the stand alone 48,000 EUR fee.</p>
<p>4 types of Online/remote games of chance:</p>
 
 Casino games in which the players play against the licence holder (roulette and blackjack, for example). 
 Casino games in which the players play against each other (poker, for example). 
 Bets on events occurring during a sporting contest or on the outcome of a sporting contest 
 Bets on the outcome of horse racing and harness racing 
 
<p>Player Verification.</p>
<p>KSA say that Player verification takes place before allowing players to participate in games. The verification process includes identity verification, the decree states that the following information is required for purposes of player registration the surname, given names, date of birth, gender, place of birth of the person and, if available, the citizen service number appearing on the identity document of said person. The physical address and contact details of the person, including at least email and phone; and the contra account number or other unique identifier of the contra account, and the name on said account.</p>
<p>The most interesting part of the act, is that there will be a Central Register of Exclusion of Games of Chance, Cruks for short.&nbsp;Before a player can gamble, the gambling provider must check whether the player is registered.&nbsp;If so, the player should not be allowed in.</p>
<p>From KSA “Cruks is an important tool to combat gambling addiction.&nbsp;Providers of risky games of chance – physical and online – must join Cruks.&nbsp;The current schedule is that Cruks&nbsp;will&nbsp;enter into force&nbsp;on&nbsp;October 1, 2021&nbsp;.&nbsp;Providers of games of chance can&nbsp;test their affiliation with Cruks&nbsp;earlier”.</p>
<p>Probably fair to say the Dutch government has made sure it’s up there with most demanding regulations, and the operators must abide by the parts of the Remote Gambling Act concerning addiction prevention and consumer protection.</p>
<p>IDnow has a long history of complying with complicated regulations world wide, especially in such a sensitive industry as gambling and online betting. Players of our global and local clients such as GVC, Lottoland, Tipico, Kindred and others.</p>

  As workers become more mobile and workloads move into the cloud, the traditional model of enforcing security at the network perimeter becomes ineffective.

We may have an idea of what goes into maintaining an identity (things like names and passwords), but no real knowledge of the inner workings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But digital identity is all around us in daily life, and understanding how it works can help us think about identity in a new way and gain insight into how digital identity concepts can relate to one another. So, as someone who thinks about identity (a lot), I was struck by how identity concepts bear a striking resemblance to models and concepts found in physics.</p>

<p>World over, there’s a greater push towards data protection and privacy. In the EU, in particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been a big step forward in this direction.</p><p>One of the primary goals of GDPR is to give individuals complete control over their personal data including with whom and how they are shared. In simple terms, the two important data protection and privacy principles of GDPR&nbsp;are:</p>  Giving users complete control over the transactional aspects of their digital identity including its monetization  Free movement of data across the union to enable commerce.  <p>While this may sound simple, in reality, it requires a whole new way of storing and managing personal data, and many of the technologies we use today are not conducive for it because they were created at a time when security and privacy were afterthoughts.</p><p>Before going into whether SSI is the answer for GDPR, let’s understand the provisions of GDPR with respect to the data owner’s&nbsp;rights.</p> GDPR Provisions <p>Articles 13 to 22 of the GDPR describe the rights of the data subject concerning the collection and sharing of the subject’s data. Let’s briefly look into each of these articles to thoroughly understand GDPR in the context of data protection.</p><p>Please note that here, the data subject is the owner of a piece of data while a controller is the one using the owner’s data for monetization or any other&nbsp;purpose.</p>  Article #13 — When data is collected with the knowledge of the owner, the controller must give information as to how it will be&nbsp;used.  Article #14 — The onus is on the controller to provide information to the data subject on how the data will be used and when it was collected without the subject’s knowledge.  Article #15 — The subject has the right to know how the data is being processed and even get access to the same at any&nbsp;time.  Article #16 — The data subject has the right to rectify inaccurate personal data and has the right to complete any inaccurate piece of information  Article #17 — The data subject has the right to erase data and the controller must comply with&nbsp;it.  Article #18 — The data subject can restrict the controller from processing his or her personal data, provided it is inaccurate, unlawful, and illegitimate.  Article #19 — The controller has to communicate any rectification or erasure of personal&nbsp;data  Article #20 — The data subject has the right to obtain personal data in a structured and machine-readable format and can transfer the same to another controller at any&nbsp;time.  Article #21 — The data subject has the right to object to the grounds on which his or her data is being processed, especially when it is used for profiling purposes and marketing through&nbsp;it.  Article #22 — The data subject has the right to oppose any decision that’s based on automated processing, including profiling, that can create legal or any significant impacts  <p>A common theme among all these provisions is to empower the data subject and put him or her in complete control over personal data including the way it is shared and&nbsp;used.</p><p>Now, it’s time to see if Self-sovereign identity (SSI) addresses each of these provisions.</p><p>SSI is a form of digital identity where an entity owns and controls its information completely, including who can see what parts of the personal information and how they are shared. Here’s an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">interesting article</a> that compares SSI and Federated Identity Management.</p><p>There are many ways to implement SSI, and in this article, we will be looking at the idea of using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> for implementing SSI. At the most basic level, verifiable credentials are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically. There are three essential components of verifiable credentials, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  It is machine verifiable  It is secure and tamper-proof  Has been issued by a competent authority.  <p>Here’s a list of the possible list of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">VC use-cases</a>.</p><p>When you examine SSI implementation through VCs, you can visualize VCs to be the replacements for physical documents while SSI is the technology/platform that allows a subject to host his or her data and control the way it is shared and&nbsp;handled.</p> Does SSI meet the GDPR requirements? <p>Let’s examine how SSI meets each of the articles from #13 to&nbsp;#22.</p>  Article #13 — Since the data subject (called the owner/holder) owns and controls the data, he or she can decide to whom to share it with, and how the same can be&nbsp;used.  Article #14 — The data holder is the one who shares the information, so there’s no question of collecting any data without the owner’s knowledge.  Article #15 — Again, the holder shares the data with chosen entities, so it is completely aware of how the PII is being processed and where it is&nbsp;used.  Article #16 — The data holder can reach the issuer in case of any corrections before sharing them with the verifiers.  Article #17 and #18 — While it is not possible to completely erase the data, the access for the same can be revoked or a VC can also be deactivated if&nbsp;needed.  Article #19 — The data owner and controller are the same entity, so the owner can revoke or update at any&nbsp;time.  Article #20 — VCs are in a machine-readable format for easy&nbsp;sharing.  Article #21 and 22 — The data owner can revoke access if it was used for purposes besides which it was shared by the&nbsp;owner  <p>As you can see, the VC-based SSI implementation meets the GDPR requirements, so this could be a potential way to achieve GDPR compliance.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

<p>This guide was prepared by your Telegram admin &amp; Ontology Harbinger, <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Dumont</a>.</p><p>I decided to create this guide to ensure that everybody knows how to obtain ONG without asking for donations. We have an awesome community which is always helpful to those in need, but requests for ONG encourage spam that harms our community chats and threads. Some users also expose their wallet addresses. Wherever you are based, there is a way to get your first ONG, so let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p><p>First, let’s recap Ontology’s dual token&nbsp;model:</p><blockquote>The Ontology dual-token design uses ONT for staking and ONG as gas. ONT is used as the staking tool, and the time cost of staking and the operating costs of the nodes are considered to be inputs, with ONG distributed as revenue. ONG is the utility token used as a value anchoring tool for on-chain applications <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/a-breakdown-of-the-ontology-dual-token-model-16b322795c01">(source)</a>.</blockquote><p>In short, you can get ONG as a reward for staking ONT. However, you also need 0.05 ONG per transaction on Ontology’s chain. The same goes for staking or claiming staking rewards. So the question you might be asking yourself is, “Where do I get my first ONG tokens to start staking or to just move my stuck ONT&nbsp;tokens?”</p> Where to get&nbsp;ONG?  1. Centralized Exchanges (easiest) <p>You can always check available markets at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ontology-gas/markets/">coinmarketcap</a> or <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ontology-gas#markets">coingecko</a>, but the most popular option is definitely <a href="https://accounts.binance.cc/en/register?ref=27915785">Binance.</a> With Binance, you can buy any amount of ONG and withdraw it to your wallet with only a 0.1 ONG withdrawal fee. Binance does not require KYC and for unverified accounts offers a 2 BTC daily withdrawal limit. The easiest method is to deposit some crypto (listed on Binance) and trade it for&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>If you cannot access a centralized ONG market due to your geographical location, see the alternative methods&nbsp;below.</p> 2. ONTO Wallet&nbsp;(easy) <p>(This solution is good for users who are unable to buy ONG at centralized exchanges but can buy and withdraw&nbsp;ONT)</p><p><a href="http://onto.app">ONTO </a>is the official Ontology mobile wallet which has a built-in swap function enabling users to swap ONT for ONG without paying gas fees. It was designed specially for users who have ONT but run out of ONG. A step-by-step guide on how to perform this swap can be found <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/assets/swapping-ont-for-ong">here</a>. To learn how to download, install, and set-up your ONTO wallet, click&nbsp;<a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/app-basics/how-to-register-an-account-on-onto-wallet">here</a>.</p><p>How to send your ONT tokens to ONTO if you store them elsewhere:</p><p>a) If you have ONT tokens on an exchange, withdraw them to your ONTO wallet (On the Assets page, click on ONG, press Receive and copy the&nbsp;address)</p><p>b) If you have ONT tokens in a third party, non-custodial wallet such as Trust wallet, export your mnemonic phrase or private key and import it into&nbsp;ONTO.</p><p>To import the address, install ONTO and create a new ONT ID wallet first. Once you have your wallet set-up, click in the upper right corner on your profile picture, select Manage wallets and then at the bottom press +Add new wallet and then Import wallet. In the Import wallet window select Import other wallet and from the list select ONT Wallet. It will show you all of the supported import&nbsp;options.</p><p>c) If you struggle to import your third party wallet to ONTO, you can still use option a) workaround, just buy some ONT on any exchange you can access and withdraw it to your ONTO wallet. Then swap 1–10 ONT for ONG and send them from ONTO to your third party wallet. This workaround is valid also for US based users who can, for instance, use <a href="http://binance.us">binance.us</a> to buy and withdraw ONT to ONTO&nbsp;wallet.</p> 3. Other wallet swaps&nbsp;(easy) <p><a href="https://www.exodus.com/">Exodus wallet</a> currently offers ONG swaps. Unfortunately, it seems that the value of each swap has to be at least approximately $215. You cannot use an Exodus mnemonic phrase to import to ONTO, it will result in a different wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p><a href="https://atomicwallet.io/">Atomic wallet</a> should have available ONG swap pairs currently, so you can use this wallet to get some ONG as well. The minimum swap value is $15. You will need to create a new wallet and deposit some assets which can be swapped for&nbsp;ONG.</p> 4. Decentralized approach via ApeSwap or PancakeSwap (hard) <p>(This solution is a good option if you have Binance Smart Chain BNB. You can use it to buy ONT in a decentralized way, which you can then swap for ONG inside ONTO&nbsp;wallet)</p><p>Currently you cannot directly trade ONG on BSC (Binance Smart Chain), but you can get ONT which you can then swap to ONG within your ONTO wallet, based on the steps described above. If you are familiar with BSC’s ecosystem, it should be easy for you. All you need is a multi-token wallet app which supports BSC and ONT, such as <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO</a>. Create a new wallet if you don’t have one already and deposit some BNB (BSC). Then open ApeSwap or PancakeSwap (based on your preference or available liquidity). Here, you can trade BNB for ONT (BSC version). ONT (BSC version) can then be swapped to native ONT via <a href="https://www.binance.org/en/bridge">Binance&nbsp;Bridge.</a></p><p>You can locate both ApeSwap, PancakeSwap and Binance Bridge, inside ONTO wallet on the Discovery page. Binance Bridge’s smallest ONT chain swap is 3 ONT (with a 1 ONT swap&nbsp;fee).</p><p>That’s it! If you know any other ways to get ONG, please let me know and I will add them to this guide,&nbsp;asap!</p><p>If you have any questions, would like to report missing or incorrect content, or want to tip my wallet to buy me a cup of coffee, you can reach me on <a href="https://t.me/dumontiskooo">Telegram</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter.</a></p><p>See you!</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details about our decentralized identity and data solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a>, or simply follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

 Anybody who has used Ethereum smart contracts recently is aware that it has
gotten expensive. There are a large quantity of
complicated and clever techniques each with their own trade-offs
that are collectively referred to as "layer 2 solutions" (see further
resources for more information about these). This is in contrast to

  <p></p>
<p>Anybody who has used Ethereum smart contracts recently is aware that it has
gotten expensive. There are a large quantity of
complicated and clever techniques each with their own trade-offs
that are collectively referred to as "layer 2 solutions" (see <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#resources">further
resources</a> for more information about these). This is in contrast to
the base computational layer of Ethereum called "layer 1", which is what constitutes most Ethereum usage and where <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/azimuth/">Urbit ID</a>’s smart contracts currently exist.</p>
<p>Tlon has always covered gas costs for Urbit ID up to a set limit, and this was easy a couple of years ago when the cost of transactions required to get a <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/planet/">planet</a> up and running came out to less than a dollar. Unfortunately the ongoing Ethereum gas crisis, along with the rising price of Ethereum itself, has made this impossible. We’ve seen gas costs to set up a planet as high as several hundred US dollars at time of writing!</p>
<p>In response to the gas crisis, Tlon has spent the last several months developing
a simple, in-house layer 2 solution which we anticipate will reduce typical gas costs by 65x or more.</p>
<p>This post is primarily a short non-technical explainer of the end-user experience of our solution aimed at planet and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/star/">star</a> owners and those in the market for one, as well as a status update on where we're at in development. At <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">the end</a> we give some minimal technical details and resources to help you dig deeper should you wish. 
This is also primarily aimed at those who currently self-host or plan to self-host their
urbit. For anybody utilizing a hosted service, this matter will all be handled
by your provider. There is a <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#stars">separate section</a> addressed specifically at star owners, and another <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#rollers">section</a> for those who wish to set up their urbit to accept and submit layer 2 transactions. We’d like to emphasize that this system is 100% opt-in—if you are satisfied with the current experience of Urbit ID, then nothing changes for you whatsoever.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most pressing question held by anybody reading this is—when will
it be ready? It's not reasonable to give a timeline on difficult engineering
work, but rest assured that completing this upgrade is a top priority. Much
of the back-end is approaching completion, and we are confident in a release before the end of Q3 and hopefully much sooner.</p>
 Naive rollups 
<p>Our layer 2 solution, designed primarily by Tlon lead engineer <code>~wicdev-wisryt</code>,
is known as "naive rollups" and we will be using this term interchangeably with
"layer 2"—though it is important to note that there are many layer 2 solutions
utilized by projects other than Urbit. As we're avoiding technicality here, we’re focusing primarily on the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing our layer 2 solution, and how that affects the management of your <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ship/">ship</a>.</p>
<p>Very briefly, a rollup is a way to combine many transactions into one, and we
are building infrastructure so that any Urbit ship may be utilized as a "roller". A
roller will collect layer 2 Urbit ID transactions, confirm their validity, and
post them to the Ethereum blockchain. More detail is given <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">at the end</a>. Anybody may set up a
ship to <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#rollers">act as a roller</a>. Tlon will be launching our own publicly accessible roller, but as Urbit is a decentralized network, by no means will we have a monopoly.</p>
 Pros and cons 
<p>The primary advantage to using naive rollups is that the gas cost for Urbit
ID-related actions will be dramatically reduced. It will be reduced sufficiently that we expect that a few transactions per ship per week (plenty for ordinary usage) submitted to Tlon's roller will not cost the end user anything. There are no gas costs associated with submitting a layer 2 transaction to a roller, and Tlon will bear the gas cost of posting the results to the blockchain. That means that the cost you see for a planet on a market that utilizes Tlon's roller ought to be
the final cost.</p>
<p>There are a few trade-offs for this, but none of them really sacrifice the core
value propositions of Urbit ID.</p>
<p>The most substantial one is that ships on layer 2 are essentially completely isolated
from the rest of the Ethereum ecosystem. They can no longer interact with smart
contracts designed to work with Urbit ID or non-fungible tokens (which are how Urbit IDs are represented) in general. It is also not possible to write new Ethereum smart contracts that work with layer 2 ships.</p>
<p>Compounding that factor, the journey to layer 2 is one-way only—at
least for now. There are theoretical ways a ship may be moved back to layer 1, but they do not yet exist, and we cannot promise that such a thing will be available in a timely manner. Anybody moving a ship to layer 2, or buying a ship on layer 2, should assume that they will
remain on layer 2 for the foreseeable future. We do not expect this to be
permanent, but it is perhaps the most significant drawback for the time being.</p>
<p>Another one is that transactions may no longer be "instant". Effectively, this
was already the case on layer 1—unless you paid a lot of gas, you could wait
hours or even days for your transaction to clear. But the way we are saving on
gas is essentially by "bundling" or "rolling up" many transactions into one, and
submitting them as a single transaction. The more transactions in the rollup,
the better the savings. This bundling is not the only factor at play here
though—costs are reduced other ways, but this is a technical detail 
<a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">discussed later in this post</a>. It is possible to use layer 2 to submit single
transactions (and this will still save on gas costs!), so utilization of layer 2
should not incur any delay over layer 1 when utilized in this fashion.</p>
<p>Tlon has not finalized the details on how our roller will work, but it will
probably involve waiting until a sufficient backlog of transactions have been
submitted to make it economical to bundle them up, or just submitting every set
time period, whichever arrives first. We do not see this as a big issue—we
view Urbit ID as "digital land", and a few hours to acquire land, or waiting for
your new personal computer to be delivered, is still lightning fast in
comparison to the real world. We also have ideas on methods that will allow you to get on the network before the transfer has been confirmed, but that is outside of the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Our layer 2 preserves the main value proposition of Urbit ID, which is that your ship 
belongs to you forever, and that this is assured by very strong cryptographic methods and
game-theoretic arguments comparable to the ones that exist on layer 1. We
consider this principle to be uncompromisable, and maintaining ultimate
sovereignty over your ship was totally central in choosing our solution.
We summarize the new security model <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">below</a>, and <code>~wicdev-wisryt</code>
goes into greater detail in the <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#resources">resources</a>.</p>
 Changes to User Experience 
<p>The primary way one manages their Urbit ID, namely performing tasks such as
transferring ships, setting networking keys, or setting
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/proxies/">proxies</a>, is with a web interface called
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/bridge/">Bridge</a> found at
<a href="https://bridge.urbit.org">bridge.urbit.org</a>. If you already own a planet,
you've probably used Bridge before - perhaps only a single time.</p>
<p>Bridge will be getting a facelift to enable easy interfacing with layer 2,
including loud warnings about what is being gained and lost by doing so. From
here you will be able to transfer your ship to layer 2, and once there,
perform all the usual actions you can on layer 1.</p>
<p>The main difference for layer 2 transactions on Bridge will be the additional
choice of a roller to submit transactions to. Tlon's will be free for ordinary, non-time-sensitive usage.
You could use your own ship for a fast single transaction for a little more gas. We expect that planet markets and stars may wish to set up their own rollers as well.</p>
<p>Every planet has a sponsor star, which distributes <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ota-updates/">OTA
updates</a> to their sponsored planets and assists with peer discovery. Both layer 1 and layer 2 planets will be able to be
sponsored by either layer 1 or layer 2 stars, meaning that nothing will change
in terms of how sponsorship works.</p>
<p>When you buy a ship, any reputable seller will inform you whether or not it is
on layer 1 or layer 2. Anyone running an urbit will be able to verify this information, and we expect for tools to exist to make this information publicly available (see <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/bounties/1101665172-network-explorer-data-pipeline-http-api">this grant</a>).</p>
<p>And that's it! If you'd like to know how things will be changing for
<a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#stars">stars</a>, what goes into <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#rollers">setting up a roller</a>, and additional
<a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">technical details</a>, read on.</p>
 Changes to stars 
<p>Both planets and stars will be able to move to layer 2.
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/galaxy/">Galaxies</a> must remain on layer 1 for technical
reasons, and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/moon/">moons</a> and
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/comet/">comets</a> never interacted with Ethereum anyways, so
they are completely out of the picture.</p>
<p>Stars will be able to remain on layer 1 with no action required. For star owners
that wish to take advantage of the cheaper gas costs, there are two possible
modes: ownership of the star on layer 2, or setting the spawn proxy to layer 2
with ownership remaining on layer 1.</p>
<p>The first mode—a star which is owned on layer 2—has the same advantages and
disadvantages as a layer 2 planet. Planets spawned by a layer 2 star will also
necessarily be on layer 2 - there is no way to spawn a layer 1 planet from a
layer 2 star, though any planets which were spawned on layer 1 before the
star migrated to layer 2 will remain on layer 1.</p>
<p>The second mode—ownership on layer 1, with spawn proxy on layer 2—is only slightly more complicated. Such a star will change its networking keys, transfer
between wallets, and set its management proxy all on layer 1, with the
corresponding higher gas cost. However, it will be able to spawn planets on
layer 2—and only on layer 2—with the corresponding layer 2 tradeoffs. Like
moving ownership to layer 2, this will be a one-way journey for now. Planets
spawned before moving the spawn proxy to layer 2 will remain on layer 1, but
from then on, all planets spawned by that star will live on layer 2. Finally, stars in this second mode may transition to the first mode, but not vice versa.</p>
 Creating a roller 
<p></p>
<p>Rollers are urbit nodes which users submit transactions to to be "rolled up"
into a bundle to be submitted to the Ethereum blockchain. The business logic for
a roller runs on the urbit node itself. Thus, anybody with an urbit ship may set
it up to act as a roller. While the details of how rollers work are still being
hammered out, one should expect that one can either set transactions to be
submitted at regular intervals, once a sufficient number of transactions have
been received (as more transactions means greater savings), manually, or some
combination of the above.</p>
<p>Tlon plans to release documentation on how to set up your own roller concurrently with
the release of our layer 2 solution.</p>
<p>Malicious rollers could potentially exist, but the worst they ought to be able
to do is simply not submit your transaction. The security factors for rollers
are briefly addressed <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#technical">below</a>, and elaborated upon in the
<a href="https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/#resources">resources</a>, but you can expect full technical documentation on
these factors to be included in the roller documentation.</p>
 Changes to Azimuth 
<p><a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/azimuth/">Azimuth</a> is the set of Ethereum smart contracts
governing Urbit ID. They will require a few changes to accommodate the new
system. Some of this has been implicit above, but to be clear, we will only be
making a couple minor alterations:</p>
 
 Once a star's spawn proxy is set to the layer 2 address, it can't be switched
back, and they can no longer spawn layer 1 planets. 
 Galaxies and their proxies cannot be deposited to layer 2.
Some other minor details are yet to be worked out, but again, nothing will change for those who wish to remain on layer 1. 
 
 Technical details 
<p>What's really going on behind the scenes here? Briefly, only the data of the Urbit ID transactions will be posted on-chain, while computation and state storage will now happen on your ship.</p>
<p>In layer 1, the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a> guarantees the validity of state transitions, while for layer 2 transactions, each Urbit node guarantees the validity of the state transitions.</p>
<p>Changes to the state of Urbit ID on layer 1 works as follows:</p>
 
 A transaction is posted to the Ethereum blockchain. 
 The EVM calculates the resulting state transition and checks its validity, then updates the state. 
 Your urbit downloads the new state from an Ethereum node. 
 Your urbit makes the final decision on whether the new state is valid. 
 
<p>In practice, the fourth step is never used in layer 1. The primary change to our
security model is that we are cutting out step 2 and beefing up step 4. Your
ship will now perform validation of the transactions posted to the Ethereum
blockchain, rather than the EVM.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/arvo/">Urbit OS</a> is deterministic, and Hoon has some nice formal
properties, it turns out to be a great language for writing smart contracts. Thus we are effectively swapping the Ethereum smart contract with a “Hoon smart contract” run locally on your ship. </p>
 Further Resources 
<p>We want to keep this post brief and non-technical, so that's all we'll say about
it for now. To find out more, you have a few directions to go on. We held a
<a href="https://urbit.org/events/developer-call-scaling-azimuth/">Developer Call</a> where
<code>~wicdev-wisryt</code> outlines the design in much more technical detail, and also
explains why we decided to utilize our own design rather than other known layer
2 solutions such as <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/optimistic_rollups/">Optimistic
rollups</a>,
<a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/layer-2-scaling/zk-rollups/">ZK-rollups</a>,
etc, or other blockchains. He also plans to do a more technical walkthrough video sometime before release. For those who would rather read, see
<code>~wicdev-wisryt</code>'s <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/g/dev/c/p6rP_WsxLS0/m/hQBX0modAwAJ">RFC: Naive rollup for cheaper Urbit ID
transactions</a>
post on the <code>urbit-dev</code> mailing list. Lastly, the primary working branch on
Github for the Urbit side of naive rollups is

<p>We’re excited to share that the transition of the Dock blockchain to Proof of Stake (PoS) is expected to take place in June 2021. In preparation for this major milestone, the team is now actively seeking parties that are interested in participating in the PoS network as a validator.</p><p>In charge of producing blocks (processing transactions) and validating blocks produced by other validators, Dock validators form an integral part of the Dock ecosystem. Validators will earn token rewards for participating in the network. Before we get into what this step means for validators, it would be remiss not to mention what this milestone means for the entire Dock community. </p><p>Of course, transitioning to Proof of Stake, or Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) to be precise, provides more than a new way for Dock nodes to agree on the state of the network. It introduces profound and fundamental changes to the network and the Dock ecosystem. Firstly, once NPoS is incorporated into the Dock mainnet, the network will become more decentralized. The number of validators will increase from the current 11, to potentially several hundred candidates all competing for the 50 slots, and these validators will not be chosen by Dock - rather, they will be selected by the network based on how much stake the validator has accumulated.</p><p>Furthermore, this hugely important milestone will further decentralize governance of Dock as community members will now be able to make and vote on proposals, as well as vote on candidates they wish to oversee the ongoing management of the network on the Dock Council. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-future-in-decentralized-governance/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=join-dock-network-as-a-proof-of-stake-validator">This blog post</a> articulated our plans for decentralized governance, and it is recommended for the additional context it provides while also showing the evolution the network has undergone since the mainnet was launched in September of 2020.</p><p>How It Works</p><p>The individuals interested in serving as Dock validators should contact our team by emailing us at <a href="mailto:marketing@dock.io">marketing@dock.io</a> or reaching out to us via social media. When NPoS begins, the candidate validators will be able to stake (lock up) their own tokens, and/or be nominated by other token holders (nominators), who can back candidates by locking tokens on the candidates’ behalf. The network algorithm will automatically choose candidates with the most stake to become validators. There can be at most 50 validators at any given time. </p><p>As the validators produce and validate blocks, they (along with their nominators) will earn rewards in the form of Dock tokens. After each epoch (10 days), 40% of the rewards, consisting of emission rewards and transaction fees, will be distributed among validators based on their contributions in that epoch. Then for each validator, the network will divide up the rewards among the validator and their nominator(s) according to the validator’s commission and how much they have staked compared to one another.</p><p>Each year Dock will release at most 25% of the remaining token supply as emission rewards. The release schedule for the next 25 years, as well as further details about the validator selection and rewards, can be found in our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">token economics documentation</a>. General information about the Dock network’s ecosystem, token utility, governance, and consensus can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn">here</a>.</p><p>How to Get Started</p><p>Any cloud provider can be used to run a Dock node cost at minimal expense. The technical requirements for validators are as follows:</p>  1 or 2 publicly accessible machines  At least 4 GB of RAM  At least 50 GB of SSD  Bandwidth of 10 Mbps over WAN  Some familiarity with provisioning machines (either cloud or on-prem) and some familiarity with Linux command line is needed to run the provided scripts to generate keys and deploy node. Dock currently supports Ubuntu 18.04.  <p>If you’d like to participate as a validator, please contact us by any of the following channels so that we can keep you updated with the latest information:</p>  Email: <a href="mailto:marketing@dock.io">marketing@dock.io</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">@docknetwork</a>  Riot: <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#!KpPIERdKQjLTTwsOkn:matrix.org">Join the chat here</a>  <p>We will run a testnet in the first instance, and our plans are to launch NPoS on the Dock mainnet in June 2021, further to a successful security audit. At this point the validators will be able to start earning rewards.</p>

<p>In the last year, Blockchain Commons has produced a large collection of specifications, reference libraries, architectures, and reference utilities meant to improve blockchain infrastructure by enabling interoperability among Bitcoin wallets — and in the future, other cryptocurrency applications, such as Ethereum wallets, and other cryptography programs, such as chat systems, key management programs, and more.</p>

<p>So, what do Blockchain Commons’ technologies do? We’ve just released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">a Technology Overview video</a> that discuses the concepts and foundations underlying our work and also highlights many of our most important technological releases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY"></a></p>

<p>As the video notes, our work is built on a considerable volume of existing literature. We work with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m56s">entropy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=2m39s">seeds</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m45s">keys</a> and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=6m34s">airgaps</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=5m12s">multisigs</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=4m6s">secure storage</a> to ensure robust key creation, safe key usage, and responsible key management. We also build on crucial technological foundations such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m13s">CBOR</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=11m37s">CRC-32</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=14m53s">Fountain Codes</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=8m15s">QRs</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=12m55s">SHA-256</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=13m36s">Shamir’s Secret Sharing</a>.</p>

<p>This results in a number of core Blockchain Commons technologies:
</p>
 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=16m21s">Bytewords</a> are a text-encoding method for binary data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=19m58s">Uniform Resources</a> support self-describing data that can be used interoperably. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=24m55s">LifeHash</a> allows for graphical recognition of seeds, keys, and other data. 
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=26m52s">SSKR</a> provides new libraries and methodologies for sharding secrets. 
   The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY#t=28m46s">Torgap</a> architecture creates security by partitioning blockchain services. 
 

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">Technology Overview video</a> discusses all of this and more.</p>

<p>We are also continuing to produce documents of use for the entire blockchain community, with our newest tutorials offering more depth on how to use the technologies highlighted in this video. That begins with some just-published developer-focused documents that expand on the overview of Uniform Resources (URs) found in the video. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources: An Overview</a> explains how URs are put together, and then <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-2-keys.md">A Guide to Using URs for Key Material</a> looks at <code>ur:crypto-seed</code>, <code>ur:crypto-bip39</code>, and <code>ur:crypto-hdkey</code> as three different ways to transmit key material in a standardized, typed format. (We have more UR docs planned on SSKRs, PSBTs, and our new request and response system.)</p>

<p>The specifications, architectures, references, and documents that we’re creating at Blockchain Commons are all meant to improve interoperability among many different vendors, to support the creation of wallets (and future cryptography applications) that enable independence, security, and resilience for their users. We’ve been working with an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">Airgapped Wallet Community</a> to create these various technologies. If you’re designing blockchain applications of your own, we hope you’ll view the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">video</a> to see how some of our technologies can help you.</p>

<p>You can also support the continued development of technologies like these, meant to support the entire community by becoming a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">sponsor at GitHub</a> or by making a one-time donation <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">at our BTCPay</a>.</p>

   Purpose 
<p>The current ucal project has .ics support, but does not currently sync with Google and Outlook. This creates a chicken-egg problem, where users in organizations with those tools cannot reliably migrate to using ucal, because they can't correctly expose availability.</p>
<p>Tools like the iPhone Calendar app handle this by syncing from and to those calendars. This lets them handle their own native calendar events while also exposing a user's full calendar to that user. Our goal is to replicate that model in Urbit.</p>
<p>This is a project intended primarily for developer use. Once it is completed, it will:</p>
 
 unlock further development of ucal for end users 
 allow use of Urbit ucal as a single source of truth to manage a user's schedule, inside and outside of Urbit 
 enable future integration with WebRTC for native Urbit video calls and ephemeral chats 
 
 End Product 
<p>This project will produce threads used to call Google and Outlook.</p>
<p>The step of "pushing" events to Google, Outlook and other ucal users should be implemented as producing custom data structures ("cards") that a later Gall agent will route appropriately.</p>
<p>todo: find out which files the below goes into and where the ICS type is.</p>
 
 mar
-- modify the grow arm to take an ICS Hoon type and convert to a valid ICS calendar file 
 lib
-- add a converter from ICS to 
 ted
-- take a user's authentication info
-- pull Google or Outlook ICS file
-- convert into Hoon format
-- push Hoon calendar events to Google or Outlook
-- push calendar events to other ucal users 
 tests
-- unit tests of outside ICS files parsing into Hoon format
-- unit tests of Hoon calendar structures into ICS
-- unit test producing "cards" representing calendar event updates
-- thread testing of syncing 
 possible external code
-- handle situation when extra auth flows are needed with Google/MS.
-- could require a webpage to be opened to generate an OAuth code or similar 
 
<p>This code will not need to be merged into Urbit core.</p>
 User Stories 
<p>As a developer, I want to</p>
 
 input credentials for a Google or Outlook calendar 
 retrieve ICS files associated with those credentials 
 create/modify events 
 push out created/modified events as updates to ucal or external users 
 
 Resources and Workflow 
 
 Improvements will be PRs to the https://github.com/taalhavras/ucal/ project 
 Contributor will check in weekly with a Foundation director 
 Current ucal contributors 
 Example article on pulling ICS files from those services: https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-sync-outlook-calendar-with-google-calendar/ 
 
 Milestones 
 
 
<p>Data conversion, sync and calendar updates
Estimate: 21 days - a month | Reward: 2 Stars</p>
 
 handle credential imput and auth flows 
 handle syncing 
 push updates to Google/Outlook calendars from CLI

<p>On&nbsp;April 27, 2021, Apple introduced&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/apple-app-tracking-transparency-details/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT) feature&nbsp;as part of its iOS 14.5 update.&nbsp;Knowing there would be pushback, Apple announced the ATT feature a year ago but delayed the launch to give app developers&nbsp;time to adjust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ATT&nbsp;forces&nbsp;apps to ask users, clearly and up front:&nbsp;Do you want&nbsp;us to track your activity across&nbsp;other companies’ apps and websites?&nbsp;The app can&nbsp;briefly&nbsp;justify its reasoning for tracking and, most importantly, the user can say yes or no.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">Facebook is&nbsp;going blue in the face</a>&nbsp;arguing the move will hurt&nbsp;everything from&nbsp;its&nbsp;bottom line to&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-apple-small-business/">small business</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;free market economy.&nbsp;It&nbsp;tried using&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">“educational screen”</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;implied it would&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking">charge a fee</a>&nbsp;tousers who&nbsp;say no to&nbsp;tracking, and even put&nbsp;its case in&nbsp;full-page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-04-29/apple-iphone-tracking-operating-system-update-facebook-privacy/100100172">ads&nbsp;in major newspapers</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook isn’t the only app affected by ATT, but it is the&nbsp;most&nbsp;affected. Let’s dive in.&nbsp;</p>



 What does ATT do?&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>ATT puts user consent&nbsp;to&nbsp;cross-app&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;up front for the first time and gives the user unprecedented&nbsp;control&nbsp;over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every time a user opens an app for the first time after the&nbsp;iOS 14.5&nbsp;update,&nbsp;a&nbsp;pop-up privacy prompt&nbsp;will&nbsp;tell them&nbsp;the app wants to track&nbsp;their activity&nbsp;across the internet, give a brief justification,&nbsp;and&nbsp;ask their&nbsp;permission&nbsp;to allow it.&nbsp;Thenevery app that has asked permission&nbsp;will appear&nbsp;in a tracking menu in the iOS privacy settings so the user can review and change their choice at any time, for all apps or certain ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saying no to the privacy question stops cross-app tracking. This means the app can no longer use the user’s IDFA (ID for Advertising) or other identifiers such as hashed email addresses to aggregate data&nbsp;about the user across&nbsp;other&nbsp;apps and sites on the internet. The IDFA is&nbsp;a unique number Apple has been assigning since 2012 to each user’s device to knit together their data and activity&nbsp;across web sites and apps&nbsp;and build a highly detailed user profile for&nbsp;personalized advertising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the app, a ‘no’ answer will mean&nbsp;turning off the&nbsp;data&nbsp;tap&nbsp;that&nbsp;feeds&nbsp;its&nbsp;targeted advertising and losing a revenue stream if they sell the aggregated data to others, including&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a>.&nbsp;And they’re&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/">not allowed</a>&nbsp;to restrict access to features for those who opt out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Facebook’s case, a user saying&nbsp;‘no’&nbsp;to tracking&nbsp;would have&nbsp;no effect on Facebook tracking what a user does on&nbsp;its own platform, but it&nbsp;would stop&nbsp;Facebook aggregating data about&nbsp;that user&nbsp;across&nbsp;other&nbsp;apps&nbsp;and sites.&nbsp;Clearly,&nbsp;it’s this&nbsp;aggregated data product&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;extraordinarily&nbsp;valuable to Facebook’s ad revenue because&nbsp;it shows advertisers exactly what users are browsing and buying. (See&nbsp;<a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/">Signal’s&nbsp;recent&nbsp;hilarious targeted ad campaign</a>&nbsp;proving this point, which Facebook shut down.)&nbsp;Of course&nbsp;a user&nbsp;saying&nbsp;‘yes’&nbsp;to tracking&nbsp;would mean&nbsp;the&nbsp;app&nbsp;can&nbsp;continue its free-for-all&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance</a>&nbsp;on the user’s devices.&nbsp;Situation normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>Importantly, the users who opt out will still&nbsp;see&nbsp;ads, just not as&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">spookily relevant</a>&nbsp;ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to&nbsp;ATT,&nbsp;a user&nbsp;had to click on a link&nbsp;in their phone settings&nbsp;to reset their IDFA,&nbsp;which would&nbsp;interrupt data tracking.&nbsp;Now the&nbsp;ATT effectively&nbsp;randomizes&nbsp;the opted-out users’&nbsp;IDFAs&nbsp;and&nbsp;breaks&nbsp;the tracking.&nbsp;Under iOS 14.5, if a user selects ‘Allow apps to ask’ under Settings &gt; Privacy, each app&nbsp;they use&nbsp;gets to implement the&nbsp;ATT&nbsp;privacy prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Highly charged emotional responses to ATT&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>With&nbsp;ATT,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;allows&nbsp;apps to make their case to the user:&nbsp;why we’re asking for your permission for cross–apptracking.&nbsp;And it’s interesting to see how different companies are&nbsp;doing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Apple first announced the change, Facebook was the most vocal dissenter&nbsp;and still is.&nbsp;Although an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/26/ios-14point5-apple-iphone-software-leads-to-german-antitrust-complaint.html">antitrust complaint filed in Germany</a>&nbsp;against Facebook is serious stuff too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook argues&nbsp;ATT will&nbsp;be bad&nbsp;for not only&nbsp;its&nbsp;business&nbsp;but&nbsp;small businesses everywhere that rely on targeted&nbsp;(arguably&nbsp;more&nbsp;effective)&nbsp;advertising.&nbsp;They said&nbsp;it was&nbsp;a hit to&nbsp;the&nbsp;free market economy.&nbsp;And&nbsp;they even&nbsp;implied the possibility of a fee&nbsp;for&nbsp;users&nbsp;who&nbsp;opt out of&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;—&nbsp;a&nbsp;bullying tactic that many&nbsp;experts&nbsp;agree&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">won’t come to pass</a>and a statement&nbsp;that&nbsp;Facebook has since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">clarified and denied</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;Electronic&nbsp;Frontier&nbsp;Foundation&nbsp;(EFF)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small">calls&nbsp;Facebook’s pushback</a>&nbsp;“a laughable attempt&nbsp;…&nbsp;to distract you from its poor track record of anticompetitive behavior and privacy issues as it tries to derail pro-privacy changes from Apple that are bad for Facebook’s business”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes,&nbsp;Facebook will take a hit from ATT but&nbsp;it will&nbsp;still make ad revenue and&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">plenty of it</a>.&nbsp;Absolutely, less relevant ads&nbsp;will&nbsp;mean fewer clicks, fewer sales and less revenue. But, like&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">Google</a>, Facebook still has&nbsp;loads of&nbsp;first party data from which to profit,&nbsp;which explains why the&nbsp;<a>EFF says</a>&nbsp;“Facebook’s&nbsp;laughable&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;against Apple&nbsp;is&nbsp;really&nbsp;against&nbsp;users and&nbsp;small&nbsp;businesses”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Requiring trackers to request your consent before stalking you across the Internet should be an obvious baseline, and we applaud Apple for this change. But Facebook, having built a massive empire around the concept of tracking everything you do by letting applications sell and share your data across a shady set of third-party companies, would like users and policymakers to believe otherwise.&nbsp;Make no mistake: this latest campaign from Facebook is yet another direct attack against our privacy and, despite its slick packaging, it’s also an attack against other businesses, both large and small,” the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/facebooks-laughable-campaign-against-apple-really-against-users-and-small">EFF article notes</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course&nbsp;Facebook’s&nbsp;is&nbsp;just&nbsp;one perspective&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;companies are using various emotive techniques to justify tracking and&nbsp;to&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;(bully?)&nbsp;users into selecting ‘allow’&nbsp;at&nbsp;the ATT privacy prompt.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-ad-tracking-pressure-ios-14-5/">Copping heat</a>&nbsp;right now&nbsp;is&nbsp;Canada’s&nbsp;Weather Network&nbsp;app&nbsp;that’s using&nbsp;fear without any justification&nbsp;to make users agree to tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Our position on ATT&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>With ATT,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;is giving&nbsp;users more visibility about tracking and more power to opt out.&nbsp;We feel these are legitimate steps by Apple to enhance consumer privacy. They’re in touch with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumer mindset</a>&nbsp;around privacy&nbsp;and they’re responding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But&nbsp;of course&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;also&nbsp;has the luxury of making this change without disrupting its own revenue streams.&nbsp;As&nbsp;a primarily&nbsp;hardware business,&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;can readily choose&nbsp;this as a battleground.&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;may be&nbsp;doing this to&nbsp;disrupt&nbsp;Google,&nbsp;and Facebook is just&nbsp;hefty&nbsp;collateral damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What the early&nbsp;opt-out&nbsp;stats say&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Early stats from&nbsp;<a href="https://branch.io/">Branch Metrics</a>&nbsp;on Twitter&nbsp;say,&nbsp;of the people&nbsp;who had the “Allow apps to request to track” box checked&nbsp;in iOS 14.5,&nbsp;only&nbsp;4% of users allowed tracking. That means 96% of people&nbsp;didn’t want&nbsp;tracking. For those who argue that&nbsp;generally&nbsp;users want tracking, these stats are strong rebuttal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What&nbsp;we recommend&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>We’ll always recommend that you answer ‘no’ to the ATT privacy prompt. Disabling cross-app tracking is good for your&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>. Do it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>ATT is clearly a huge leap for data&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;but it doesn’t stop tracking within a single app&nbsp;(remember, it’s only for cross-app tracking). You still need&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;to keep your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalized and protected</a>&nbsp;across different services. Take&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">90 seconds</a>&nbsp;to learn how.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			<p>In the previous article, we have discussed <a href="https://tokeny.com/the-3-services-digital-asset-marketplaces-provide-to-issuers/">three services a Digital Asset Marketplace (DAM) can provide to security token issuers</a>. Now, let’s dive into the benefits it can offer to security token investors. Before going into the details, we have listed the standard structure that a DAM provides to investors in this chart below:</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 1. Access to curated offerings 
<p>For investors, the main benefit of a DAM is to easily discover curated investment opportunities. The marketplace operator selects issuers of securities depending on its positioning and the value they offer to Investors.</p>
<p>With this selection of investment opportunities, the investor can now access curated offerings and participate in projects that meet their preferences and ensure they only subscribe to projects based on their level of quality. And the whole process is fully digitized, from subscribing to offerings, to making payments, to signing digital signatures. Not only does it facilitate the process, but also provides a smooth digital experience for investors.</p>
<p>A DAM must be compatible with the most adopted blockchain identification systems used on the market. So it allows Investors to directly use their Blockchain Account to prove who they are without submitting the same information for each token. As a result, investors can access various offerings without having to repetitively provide the same information, for example for KYC/AML checks.</p>

		 
	 
    Digital Asset Marketplace - Primary Market Interface     
	 
		 
			 2. Manage their digital asset portfolio  
<p>The DAM also provides a real-time view of their digital assets through the investor dashboard, enabling investors to better manage their portfolios. Investors can utilize this data to develop a cohesive investing strategy based on their goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. In addition, a built-in communication tool can help investors easily track the announcements and status of their securities on the platform, which helps investors better allocate their assets and adjust their investment strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>For each security token, investors can access the details of the asset, his positions, transaction history and other information.</p>

		 
	 
    Digital Asset Marketplace - Portfolio Interface     
	 
		 
			 3. Improve liquidity 
<p>Being able to manage digital asset portfolios is important for investors, but equal importance is the transferability of these digital assets. After analyzing the portfolio, investors can then go to the secondary market on the DAM to rebalance their portfolios by selling and buying digital assets on a peer-to-peer basis. Depending on the services fee set by the DAM, the transfer fees can be as little as a few cents and take only a few seconds to execute, compared with days or weeks in the traditional financial world. </p>

		 
	 
    Digital Asset Marketplace - Secondary Market Interface     
	 
		 
			<p>Ultimately, DAMs bring better liquidity and transferability to their investors through an easy-to-use interface that is also friendly for non-blockchain investors. This is crucial for investors because, with the recent hype about digital assets, more and more investors are turning their eyes to this market and are getting ready to participate. Now more than ever, there is a need for a non-crypto newbies-friendly marketplace. Such a platform makes it easy for traditional investors to take part in the new era of investment to subscribe, manage and transfer their security tokens.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to explaining more in the next article. If you can’t wait, this is an excerpt taken from the ebook we published with CoinTelegraph, <a href="https://tokeny.com/the-era-of-digital-asset-marketplaces/">download here</a>.</p>

  The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the way customers engage with brands and led to increased digital interaction. But this has increased the incidence of fraud during the account creation process. As a result, businesses now face the challenge of verifying customer identity and verifying that those entities interacting with their brand are human and who they claim to be.

  <p>When thinking about the C-suite’s priorities, people tend to focus on growth, security, digital transformation or, more recently, keeping a remote workforce running. All of these aspects are important to keep the business profitable, remain at the forefront of innovation, maintain shareholder satisfaction and ensure that employees are safe, equipped and content. Yet, there is something that underpins every one of these priorities: digital trust. And without it, every area of the business would cease to function.</p>
<p>Digital trust is a concept no business leader can ignore today. With most of the world working online, digital trust is vital in order for CXOs to trust that employees are doing their jobs, that the workforce is keeping security threats at bay, and that trust is cultivated with customers.</p>
 The fundamentals of trust in an evolving cybersecurity landscape 
<p>Trust will always be intangible and requires belief in three key aspects: reliability, truth and ability. We need to have belief that someone or something will deliver on the promises made, can be relied on to be truthful, and is capable of what they set out to achieve in order for us to place our trust in it. The issue of digital trust has come to the fore for CXOs amidst the challenges presented by the pandemic in the last year, as we have shifted to a remote working structure.</p>
<p>In this context, it is even more vital that organisations are aware of which employees, partners and customers they can trust to access their data and systems. Vice versa, these employees, partners and customers must trust that an organisation can protect any personal data they share.</p>
<p>Effective security tools and policies, especially those focused on seamlessly managing the identities of users, help to drive stakeholder trust. And an organisation with stringent security in place can trust that each stakeholder only has as much access to business systems as required.&nbsp; This symbiotic online relationship between organisation and stakeholder is digital trust.</p>
 How organisations can cultivate digital trust through their security policies 
<p>Business and IT leaders must be transparent about the cybersecurity measures and policies they are implementing to foster trust and staff buy-in.</p>
<p>We have seen an increase in the number of cyberattacks during the lockdown period as malicious actors attempt to take advantage of the increased threat vectors. F5’s <a href="https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/2020-phishing-and-fraud-report" title="2020 Phishing and Fraud Report">2020 Phishing and Fraud Report</a> saw a 220% increase in phishing attacks during the pandemic compared to the yearly average.</p>
<p>Okta’s <a href="https://www.okta.com/uk/resources/whitepaper-the-digital-trust-index/" title="Digital Trust Index">Digital Trust Index</a> found that 34% admit to not knowing if their employer has done anything to protect them from cyberthreats, indicating that businesses need to do more to communicate and educate employees.</p>
<p>This is problematic for CXOs, because user uncertainty around cybersecurity measures puts the business at greater risk. If employees are unclear about what is and what isn’t protected by the organisation’s security platforms, they are unable to apply best practice online, so are less able to identify issues when they arise. CXOs must improve their communication with employees to ensure they are effectively educated on their organisation’s cybersecurity measures.</p>
 The importance of education 
<p>Security must always be the first layer of trust. For employers, partners and customers, it is vital they feel secure sharing their data. And for trust to be cultivated by organisations, education is crucial.</p>
<p>Amidst the need for better education, the cyberthreat landscape is constantly evolving, with new tricks and methods tried out frequently. CXOs have a responsibility to ensure that this education is a continuous process. Since the shift to mass remote work, many office workers have become more aware of phishing, data breaches and new risks such as deepfake fraud. But businesses must also ensure they are staying ahead of the game as much as they can in order to combat these new threats with new approaches, and engaging in ongoing conversations with employees while doing so.</p>
<p>In the enterprise, it begins with a Zero Trust approach focused on validating identity before trusting anyone in the digital realm. The ultimate strategy puts identity at the heart of digital security, and invokes risk-based access policies and continuous and adaptive authentication, meaning identity validation is required for user access to be granted. As enterprises move towards this, it is vital that users are kept afoot with the evolving nature of the cybersecurity policies in place. The growth in knowledge across all levels of the business will lead to improved understanding and a stronger belief in the reliability, truth and ability that together form the basis of digital trust. When this is applied effectively, this trust from employees, partners and customers will not only mitigate harm, but will ultimately drive loyalty, revenue and value for organisations. Whether they are aware of it or not, digital trust reinforces each priority on CXOs’ agendas, and will continue to grow in importance as we delve deeper into a digital world.</p>

<p>Covid 19 has impacted the way many businesses work today, and one of the key factors that changed for many of our clients at IDnow were reported spikes in remote verification. The pandemic impacted how we onboard users. The biggest question that came up was how do operators’ onboard players remotely and can IDnow handle the capacity of the volume spikes?</p>
<p>Since March 2020 Covid 19 not only transformed the world and how we operate, but also player behaviour. This is exactly the transition we have observed in online gambler behaviours. Data shows that the online market increase by 29% active users and 7% of players were made up of inactive accounts. What brought on this change?<br>
Businesses adapted very quickly to respond to the pandemic however there were some businesses that unfortunately suffered for not planning; and therefore, some operators were able to leverage this advantage more than others. There are clear differentiators between reactive and proactive business behaviours. Player behaviour changed as bets went up by 12% due to operators creating longer-lasting online slots i.e., longer than an hour.</p>
<p>In May 2020, operators who were active in regulated markets were instructed to perform extra checks including affordability checks, the prevention of reverse withdrawals, and restrictions on bonus offers which came into play eventually on October 31st, 2020.</p>
<p>In a webinar we held with Martin Lycka, SVP Compliance at GVC-Entain, he was able to share his views on responsible gambling:<br>
“Like any other market responsible gambling is critical to its long-term sustainability and this will be the case in Germany. Operators such as Entain and others have rolled out very sophisticated responsible gambling processes, policies and protocols.”</p>
<p>In the run-up to the planning for the Euro’s, there are many other factors that were considered from the end-user experience.</p>
 
 How to keep fans engaged while they are unable to physically attend matches at stadiums? 
 How to create a safe and engaging environment for supporters? 
 How to enable youth and amateurs to keep playing and enjoying football? 
 
<p>Euro 2021 football tournament is expecting a spike in volume by up to 5 to 10 times more than usual. The excitement is visible as the absence of last year’s Grand National also had a clear impact, with only the virtual race running in 2020.<br>
Grand national this year broke records shared from sportsbook apps and across exchanges, with £92.8m traded on the big race, which made up 71% of the £131m bets across the three-day Festival. This represented a 28% increase from 2019.<br>
Cheltenham Festival broke records with £210m in total betting volume; with more bettors at home, the online betting industry is experiencing spikes more than ever before.</p>
<p>Sports has had major setbacks by pausing plans for the partial return of fans to stadiums on the 1st of October 2020 and this due to the rapid spike in Covid-19 cases. It will continue to add growing fears that clubs could go out of business due to potent spikes, and we might continue to see this with the ease of lockdown.</p>
<p>IDnow is prepping for the Euro’s focusing on the user experience and rising cases of fraud. From an operator’s perspective, how does IDnow ensure that players are verified satisfactorily while maintaining the operator’s player conversions? There was a lot of effort made by gambling operators to stay on top of constant changes in online gambling regulations with new guidelines. They have shared that KYC providers like IDnow are seen as a positive influence and KYC facilitator.</p>
<p>IDnow is an identity verification company and has been serving customers with their compliance requirements in some of the most heavily regulated markets with a platform of secure and efficient products. IDnow has seen processes move forward by developing close relationships in Germany with the youth protection ministry. We have worked diligently to ensure our products are compliant with KYC requirements.<br>
Players also can take comfort in knowing that appropriate measure are being put in place for their safety.</p>

   Reactive APIs are a powerful way to handle and serve large amounts of data and large numbers of requests in a web application. They rely on a “server-side event” model in which the client (e.g. your browser) subscribes to “events” on the server, and the server “pushes” events to the client as they become available.

  <p>Reactive APIs are a powerful way to handle and serve large amounts of data and large numbers of requests in a web application. They rely on a “server-side event” model in which the client (e.g. your browser) subscribes to “events” on the server, and the server “pushes” events to the client as they become available.</p>

<p>For simple CRUD applications this is not very useful. However, in situations with millions of “subscribers” it can offer improved performance versus the standard “request-response” paradigm.</p>

<p>Spring Boot 2.0 provided reactive web technology by integrating with <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/reactive-rest-service/">WebFlux</a>, a framework built on top of <a href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</a>. Using WebFlux you can create reactive APIs easily in Spring Boot. However, because most Spring Boot applications are CRUD-ish and are backed by relational databases, reactive APIs may not provide much benefit because the underlying database transactions (querying, updating, etc) are synchronous/blocking.</p>

 What is R2DBC? 

<p><a href="https://r2dbc.io/">R2DBC</a> is an API which provides reactive, non-blocking APIs for relational databases. Using this, you can have your reactive APIs in Spring Boot read and write information to the database in a reactive/asynchronous way.</p>

<p>In this tutorial you will develop a Spring Boot application that:</p>
 
   Communicates with an H2 database using R2DBC 
   Integrates with Okta for security using OAuth 2.0 
   Serves reactive streams of data to a secured web page 
 

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

<p>Prerequisites: <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net">Java 11</a></p>

 Create a Spring Boot Project with R2DBC 

<p>Click <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.4.5.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=com.okta.dev&amp;artifactId=okta-r2dbc&amp;name=okta-r2dbc&amp;description=Spring%20Boot%20App%20for%20Okta%20%2B%20R2DBC&amp;packageName=com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc&amp;dependencies=lombok,data-jpa,data-r2dbc,webflux,okta,h2">this link</a> or go to <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a> and select the following options in your browser:</p>

 
   Project: <code>Maven Project</code> 
   Language: <code>Java</code> 
   Spring Boot: <code>2.4.5</code> 
 

<p>Under Project Metadata, set the values to the following:</p>

 
   Group: <code>com.okta.dev</code> 
   Artifact: <code>okta-r2dbc</code> 
   Name: <code>okta-r2dbc</code> 
   Description: Spring Boot App for Okta + R2DBC 
   Package: <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc</code> 
   Packaging: <code>Jar</code> 
   Java: <code>11</code> 
 

<p>Select the following dependencies:</p>

 
   Spring Data JPA 
   Spring Data R2DBC 
   Spring Reactive Web 
   Okta 
   H2 Database 
   Lombok 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Generate to download the project files. Unzip the file and import the project files into your favorite IDE.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect Application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



 Configure and Secure Your Reactive Spring Boot Application 

<p>Open your IDE and edit your application’s configuration file at <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://MY_OKTA_DOMAIN.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId=CLIENT_ID
okta.oauth2.clientSecret=CLIENT_SECRET

spring.data.r2dbc.repositories.enabled=true
spring.r2dbc.url=r2dbc:h2:mem://./testdb
</code>   

<p>Make sure <code>MY_OKTA_DOMAIN</code>, <code>CLIENT_ID</code>, and <code>CLIENT_SECRET</code> are replaced with values from the Okta CLI.</p>

<p>Open the Java class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.OktaR2dbcApplication</code> and add the <code>@EnableWebFlux</code> and <code>@EnableR2dbcRepositories</code> annotations to the main class:</p>

   <code>@EnableWebFlux
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class OktaR2dbcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OktaR2dbcApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>@EnableWebFlux</code> enables the reactive API, and <code>@EnableR2dbcRepositories</code> configures the application to use reactive database repositories via R2DBC.</p>

<p>Create the persistent entity representing an application user:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

import lombok.Data;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;

@Data
public class UserEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
    private Long id;
    private String email;
    private String name;
}
</code>   

<p>Define a reactive <code>R2dbcRepository</code> to manage this user entity:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

import org.springframework.data.r2dbc.repository.R2dbcRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends R2dbcRepository&lt;UserEntity, Long&gt; {
    Flux&lt;UserEntity&gt; findByEmail(String email);
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>R2dbcRepository</code> interface abstracts away much of the complexity of managing reactive database connections, but some major differences between this and the non-reactive <code>JpaRepository</code> should be noted:</p>
 
   Methods like <code>findById()</code> which return one entity will instead return a <code>Mono&lt;&gt;</code> object. 
   Methods like <code>findAll()</code> which return lists of entities will instead return a <code>Flux&lt;&gt;</code> object. 
 

<p>A thorough explanation of these reactive types is outside the scope of this tutorial. For a more thorough introduction you can check out the official documentation <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#mono">here</a>. For now it is enough to know that these reactive types represent data that is changing or not-yet-whole, and it is the responsibility of the caller to “react” to the results as they become available.</p>

<p>Next you will create an OAuth-enabled <code>UserDetailsService</code> which will manage our user authentication and security with OAuth 2.0. Create a file at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain.UserDetails</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain;

// imports omitted

public class UserDetails implements OidcUser {

    private final String email;
    private final OidcIdToken oidcIdToken;
    private final Map&lt;String, Object&gt; claims = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
    private final Map&lt;String, Object&gt; attributes = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();

    public UserDetails(String email, OidcUserRequest oidcUserRequest) {
        this.email = email;
        this.claims.putAll(oidcUserRequest.getIdToken().getClaims());
        this.attributes.putAll(oidcUserRequest.getClientRegistration().getProviderDetails().getConfigurationMetadata());
        this.oidcIdToken = oidcUserRequest.getIdToken();
    }

    @Override
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; getClaims() {
        return new HashMap&lt;&gt;(claims);
    }

    @Override
    public OidcUserInfo getUserInfo() {
        return new OidcUserInfo(getClaims());
    }

    @Override
    public OidcIdToken getIdToken() {
        return oidcIdToken;
    }

    @Override
    public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; getAttributes() {
        return new HashMap&lt;&gt;(attributes);
    }

    @Override
    public Collection&lt;? extends GrantedAuthority&gt; getAuthorities() {
        return Collections.singletonList(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("USER"));
    }

    @Override
    public String getName() {
        return email;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This <code>OidcUser</code> object represents the authenticated user and loads user information from the various claims provided by the OAuth identity provider.</p>

<p>Create the user service at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain.DbUserService</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.domain;

// imports omitted

import java.util.Map;

public class DbUserService implements OAuth2UserService&lt;OidcUserRequest, OidcUser&gt;, ReactiveUserDetailsService {
    private static final String CLAIM_NAME = "name";
    private static final String CLAIM_EMAIL = "email";

    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public DbUserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    @Override
    public OidcUser loadUser(OidcUserRequest oidcUserRequest) throws OAuth2AuthenticationException {
        Map&lt;String, Object&gt; metadata = oidcUserRequest.getIdToken().getClaims();
        String email = (String) metadata.get(CLAIM_EMAIL);
        String name = (String) metadata.get(CLAIM_NAME);

        Flux&lt;UserEntity&gt; userLookup = userRepository.findByEmail(email);
        UserEntity userEntity = userLookup.blockFirst();

        if (userEntity == null) {
            userEntity = new UserEntity();
            userEntity.setEmail(email);
        }

        userEntity.setName(name);
        userEntity = userRepository.save(userEntity).block();

        return new UserDetails(userEntity.getEmail(), oidcUserRequest);
    }

    @Override
    public Mono&lt;org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails&gt; findByUsername(String username) {
        return null; // not used
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>DbUserService</code> handles requests from OAuth 2.0 to automatically load users into the database. The user’s information will be created or updated on each login via the reactive connections provided by <code>UserRepository</code>.</p>

<p>Secure the application by creating a configuration file at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.config.SecurityConfig</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.config;

// imports omitted

@EnableWebFluxSecurity
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public ReactiveUserDetailsService userDetailsService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        return new DbUserService(userRepository);
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain configure(ServerHttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        return http
            .csrf().disable()
            .authorizeExchange()
            .pathMatchers("/", "/index").permitAll()
            .anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and()
            .oauth2Login()
            .authenticationSuccessHandler(new RedirectServerAuthenticationSuccessHandler("/protected"))
            .and().build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>@EnableWebFluxSecurity</code> annotation secures the application according to the settings defined in <code>configure()</code>. There are some small differences between this and the normal security configuration classes usually seen in non-reactive Spring Boot apps, but it should appear familiar. To note:</p>
 
   The home page (<code>/</code> and <code>/index</code>) is exposed and not protected by authentication. 
   All other requests/pages are protected 
   OAuth 2.0 login behavior is enabled by <code>.oauth2Login()</code> 
   After a successful OAuth 2.0 login, the user is redirected to a protected page: <code>/protected</code>. 
 

<p>Now to create the web pages. Create a file at <code>src/main/resources/pages/index.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;R2DBC Example - Home&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Hello!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is the main page for the application and does not require authentication to access. Next create a file at <code>src/main/resources/pages/protected.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;R2DBC Example - Protected&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Okta login successful!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>For serving these pages with WebFlux you will create an application router that maps HTTP requests to resources in the codebase.</p>

<p>Create a Java class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.ApplicationRouter</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc;

// imports omitted

@Configuration
public class ApplicationRouter {

    // (1)
    @Value("classpath:pages/index.html")
    private Resource indexHtml;

    // (2)
    @Value("classpath:pages/protected.html")
    private Resource protectedHtml;

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction&lt;ServerResponse&gt; route() {
        return RouterFunctions
            // (3)
            .route(RequestPredicates.GET("/index"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))

            // (4)
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/protected"), request -&gt; pageResponse(protectedHtml));
    }

    private static Mono&lt;ServerResponse&gt; pageResponse(Resource page) {
        return ServerResponse
            .ok()
            .contentType(MediaType.TEXT_HTML) // (5)
            .body(DataBufferUtils.read(page, new DefaultDataBufferFactory(), 4096), DataBuffer.class);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In this class you can see the following:</p>
 
   The page resources created above are injected as <code>Resource</code> objects at (1) and (2). 
   A mapping to the unprotected <code>index.html</code> page is defined in (3). 
   A mapping to the protected <code>protected.html</code> page is defined in (4). 
   (5) When creating the server response (which is a reactive <code>Mono</code>), the <code>TEXT_HTML</code> content type is specified. This makes sure your browser renders the content as an HTML page and not plain text. 
 

<p>One more step is necessary to get the application running. R2DBC does not automatically generate the database schema, so you must do it yourself.</p>

<p>Create a file at <code>src/main/resources/schema.sql</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>CREATE TABLE USER_ENTITY 
(
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR2,
    name VARCHAR2
);
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>@Bean</code> which will automatically detect and execute this script on startup. Open your main application class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.OktaR2dbcApplication</code> and add a <code>ConnectionFactoryInitializer</code> bean:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc;

// imports omitted

@EnableWebFlux
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class OktaR2dbcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OktaR2dbcApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean // added
    public ConnectionFactoryInitializer connectionFactoryInitializer(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
        ConnectionFactoryInitializer initializer = new ConnectionFactoryInitializer();
        initializer.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory);
        initializer.setDatabasePopulator(new ResourceDatabasePopulator(new ClassPathResource("schema.sql")));
        return initializer;
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>initializer.setDatabasePopulator()</code> will pick up the <code>schema.sql</code> file and execute it to create the <code>user_entity</code> table on startup.</p>

<p>Open your command line tool and run the application:</p>

   <code>cd /path/to/okta-r2dbc-app
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open your browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and you should see the unprotected index page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/protected</code>. You should be prompted to log in with Okta, and after successfully authenticating returned to the protected page:</p>

<p></p>

 Stream Data to a Webpage Using R2DBC 

<p>You’ve successfully implemented R2DBC in your Spring Boot application, but the behavior is still non-reactive: querying and saving users during authentication is still a synchronous, blocking process. Now you will implement a non-blocking API endpoint which reads from the database using reactive techniques.</p>

<p>Create a persistence entity at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database.HeartbeatEntity</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

// imports omitted

public class HeartbeatEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
    private Long id;

    private Long timestamp;
    private String username;
    private String text;

    // getters and setters omitted
}
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>@Repository</code> for this entity at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database.HeartbeatRepository</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.database;

@Repository
public interface HeartbeatRepository extends R2dbcRepository&lt;HeartbeatEntity, Long&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Open the initialization SQL file at <code>src/main/resources/schema.sql</code> and add the table definition for <code>HEARTBEAT_ENTITY</code> so it looks like this:</p>

   <code>CREATE TABLE USER_ENTITY 
(
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    email VARCHAR2,
    name VARCHAR2
);

CREATE TABLE HEARTBEAT_ENTITY 
(
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    timestamp BIGINT NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR2 NOT NULL,
    text VARCHAR2
);
</code>   

<p>The database model for <code>Heartbeats</code> is complete, now you’ll create:</p>
 
   A service to generate and save heartbeats to the database 
   An HTTP endpoint routing to serve a reactive stream of heartbeats 
   Simple JavaScript to display the stream on a web page 
 

<p>Create the heartbeat service at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.service.HeartbeatService</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.service;

// imports omitted

@Service
public class HeartbeatService {
    private final HeartbeatRepository heartbeatRepository;

    @Autowired
    public HeartbeatService(HeartbeatRepository heartbeatRepository) {
        this.heartbeatRepository = heartbeatRepository;
    }

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 1000) // 1 second
    public void create() {
        HeartbeatEntity heartbeatEntity = new HeartbeatEntity();
        heartbeatEntity.setTimestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
        heartbeatEntity.setText(randomString());
        heartbeatEntity.setUsername("system");
        heartbeatRepository.save(heartbeatEntity)
                .log()
                .then()
                .subscribe();
    }

    private static String randomString() {
        int lower = 'A';
        int upper = 'Z';

        return IntStream.range(0, 10)
                .mapToObj(i -&gt; {
                    double range = upper-lower;
                    char charIdx = ((char)(lower + (range * Math.random())));
                    return new String(new char[]{charIdx});
                })
                .collect(Collectors.joining());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>create()</code> method is marked with Spring Boot’s <code>@Scheduled</code> annotation, which will cause the method to be called asynchronously on a schedule you define. Specifying <code>fixedRate = 1000</code> means the method will execute every 1000 milliseconds (i.e. one second).</p>

<p>To enable scheduling, you must also add the <code>@EnableScheduling</code> annotation to a configuration class. Open the main application class at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.OktaR2dbcApplication</code> and add it:</p>

   <code>@EnableScheduling // &lt;-- added
@EnableWebFlux
@EnableR2dbcRepositories
@SpringBootApplication
public class OktaR2dbcApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(OktaR2dbcApplication.class, args);
    }

    // other code omitted
}
</code>   

<p>Open your application router at <code>com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc.ApplicationRouter</code> and modify the <code>route()</code> method to add a routing for <code>/heartbeats</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.dev.oktar2dbc;

// imports omitted

@Configuration
public class ApplicationRouter {

    // other code omitted

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction&lt;ServerResponse&gt; route() {
        return RouterFunctions
            .route(RequestPredicates.GET("/index"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/"), request -&gt; pageResponse(indexHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/protected"), request -&gt; pageResponse(protectedHtml))
            .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET("/heartbeats"), request -&gt; {
                Flux&lt;Long&gt; interval = Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
                Flux&lt;HeartbeatEntity&gt; heartbeatEntityFlux = heartbeatRepository.findAll();
                Flux&lt;HeartbeatEntity&gt; zipped = Flux.zip(heartbeatEntityFlux, interval, (key, value) -&gt; key);

                return ServerResponse
                    .ok()
                    .contentType(MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM)
                    .body(zipped, HeartbeatEntity.class);
            });
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Within the <code>/heartbeats</code> routing you are:</p>
 
   Defining a <code>Flux</code> named <code>interval</code> which will publish a <code>Long</code> object every second (the value of the <code>Long</code> is not important here, just that it publishes every second) 
   Defining <code>heartbeatEntityFlux</code> which is a <code>Flux</code> of all <code>HeartbeatEntities</code> in the database 
   Creating a “zipped” <code>Flux</code> which interpolates items from the two <code>Flux</code>. An item will be published from <code>interval</code>, and then one from <code>heartbeatEntityFlux</code>, and then one from <code>interval</code>, etc. 
   Returning this stream with a <code>Content-Type</code> of <code>text/event-stream</code> 
 

<p>Open the protected HTML page at <code>src/main/resources/pages/protected.html</code> and modify it:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;R2DBC Example - Protected&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        $(function() {
            var cnx = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/heartbeats');
            cnx.onmessage = function (e) {
                var data = JSON.parse(e.data);
                var htmlText = '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+data.id+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+data.timestamp+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'+data.text+'&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;';
                $( "#heartbeatTable &gt; tbody" ).append(htmlText);
            };
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Okta login successful!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heartbeats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table id="heartbeatTable"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;ID&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Timestamp&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Text&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The JavaScript function:</p>
 
   Opens a streaming connection with the <code>/heartbeats</code> endpoint defined above 
   Creates an HTML table row whenever new data is received from the stream 
   Appends that table row to the body of <code>heartbeatTable</code> 
 

<p>Start the application again:</p>

   <code>cd /path/to/okta-r2dbc-app
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open your browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/protected</code>. When the page loads you should see a streaming, constantly updating list of heartbeats.</p>

   Overview 
<p>In order to understand the growth of the network, it's important that we be able to measure the amount of activity within groups at any given point. Your task is to build an open-source script (a <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/tutorials/hoon/hoon-school/generators/">generator</a>) that exports group activity into a format that can be analyzed.</p>
 Implementation 
<p>The generator will read data from <code>graph-store</code> (and other requisite agents) and extract it into a CSV file.</p>
 Output 
<p>The output of the generator is a CSV file with the following format: <code>timestamp,ship,group,channel,channel-type,content</code>. Each row of data represents a single post of some type; either a chat message, notebook post, or collection post. </p>
<p>The result of running the CSV should output the clay path to the file. </p>
 Inputs 
<p>The generator should accept a few parameters:</p>
 
 <code>path</code> (required): path to write the CSV to. 
 <code>from</code> (required): absolute date (<code>@da</code>) from which data should be pulled. 
 <code>to</code> (optional): absolute date (<code>@da</code>) up until which point data should be pulled. Default is the current time. 
 <code>groups</code> (optional): list of groups to read data from. Default is to pull data from all groups that the running ship is a member of. 
 <code>content</code> (optional): boolean of whether or not to include content in the CSV. Defaults to <code>false</code>.  
 
 Requirements &amp; Resources 
 
 The Urbit Foundation will connect you with Tlon engineers for 1:1 support, should you need it 
 Code should be submitted as a pull request against https://github.com/urbit/urbit 
 The generator shall be called <code>crunch</code> (we're open to better ideas) 
 
 Milestones 
 Work is complete 
<p>1 stars
The generator is submitted as a pull request to the Urbit repository, reviewed, and merged.</p>

 Introduction &amp; Digital Trust Challenges 
<p>Mathieu: I wanted to start the conversation today, John, by making the statement that achieving digital trust is difficult. Some background to this, and showing in trends overall, is that businesses, governments, and organizations, are adopting digital mediums to interact with their customers, their employees, their vendors, and their citizens. Everyone’s on a digital transformation journey today. Secondly, people are demanding more privacy in all their activities nowadays, and I think we’re seeing the best signals for this coming from the largest companies in the world. Apple is a very good example of this; they’re using privacy as a feature inside of their marketing, but they’re implementing capabilities inside of their operating system and their ecosystem to really push user-centric consent and privacy. At the same time, the laws around privacy are changing rapidly, and everyone’s trying to adapt to these. That brings us around again to the statement I started off with; achieving digital trust is difficult. I think people realize it’s tough to achieve today, and there is a great deal of fraudulent behaviour and other issues that seem to get in the way of people conducting businesses online.</p>
<p>This takes us to where we are today, in the internet era where there is a trust gap. To illustrate my comment about fraudulent behaviour; a very straightforward example of this that occurs frequently is phishing attacks that happen online. It’s quite easy for someone to gain access to my email address, which is a central point for me to interact with all sorts of different organizations. It’s very easy for someone who gains access to that to reset my passwords for various accounts that I have all over the place. Once they’ve reset my password, then they are able to take over my account. This happens every day, because it’s very easy for people to impersonate other people on the internet. That’s one side of it, and then there’s another side; there are just tons of things that aren’t possible to do on the internet today at all. When we start talking about more high-value, high-risk transactions, these are situations that are the most challenging. Most of the value that’s generated out of the internet today comes from advertising or e-commerce, but high-value high-risk transactions still rely on this real-world or paper credential era. As we’re looking to move from the current internet era towards this new era of digital trust, I think it would be helpful if you were able to give an overview of how we got here. Perhaps we can take a step back, before the internet era, and discuss the paper credential era — I think that sets a good framework for where we’re going with these new digital trust models.</p>
<p>John: Sure. Thanks for that introduction, Mathieu; it’s good to be here. That’s a lot of material to work with there, so I’ll give it a crack.</p>
<p>First, we’re talking about digital trust and trust in general. That’s a very high-level idea, so let’s break that down a little bit. When we talk about trust, generally speaking, we’re going to focus on a relationship between two parties. For example, perhaps between me and another individual like you; or between me and a business that I’m going to do something with, or a business to a business. My full-time job is with the province of British Columbia, and there’s a trust model between the government and its citizens. In all of these cases, I’m talking about a relationship between two parties. The determination of trust is a combination of things; do I have some type of method of conveying trust between those two parties in the context of a transaction, and do I have an understanding of why I would trust that other party?</p>
<p>In the case of a business to a business transaction, we tend to develop relationships through human interaction. We find each other’s business, we’re going to become a supplier or a customer, and then we tend to have a mechanism by which we formalize that relationship. We call it a contract, and contracts are everywhere. That’s one of the key mechanisms we have in society for establishing a formal relationship, and defining the boundaries of that relationship. If somebody goes outside of those boundaries, it’s governed by the contract. And, what is the contract governed by? Well, it’s governed by law, that has been set forth by a democratically elected society, in our case. Those laws set out the boundaries for what can happen between businesses, between people and businesses, and between governments and people, and governments and businesses. That is the nature of our society right now.</p>
<p>Essentially, personal identity is given to you by the government in a lot of ways; that is, in an administrative sense, and not your philosophical sense of being, and who you are. Rather, the fact that you can say that your name is John Jordan, and your age and so forth; those attributes or characteristics of you are attested to by the government, based on an administrative process of registration and their authority to manage that. In the same way for businesses, we have business registries, and they have a process for creating legal entities. It is these sources of truth, or these administrative authorities, which allow us to enter into contracts. We know who that party is, and we have physical evidence of this through an identity document, such as the BC services card, which we commonly call a driver’s license. Or, contracts such as the legal contracts that are drawn up and can be referenced, like articles of incorporation and so forth.</p>
<p>Back before these things we call computers were around, it was difficult to create or recreate these documents, because printing presses were big and expensive, and there were techniques that could be deployed by them to prevent fraudulent copies of these things. Because things happened at paper speed, the risks were relatively low in terms of the wide-scale ability to defraud.</p>
<p>So, that’s in a way the foundation of our society: we have Acts; those Acts create powers in the government to identify persons, including humans and legal entities, and the rules by which those entities can interact. We formalize those rules and contracts, and that’s how the world effectively operates, in a lot of ways. However, now in the era of the web, we don’t have a way to convey that architecture into the web. In turn, the web has introduced a new actor, that we don’t have an equivalent for in the physical world. On the web, we have this idea of ‘login’; there’s an intermediary between me and another person, or between me and the business I’m trying to do something with, and so forth. This intermediary has no defined role in any of our legal structures; there’s no such thing as ‘the login service’ in the Business Corporations Act of British Columbia. Likewise, in the Freedom of Information and Personal Protection Act, there’s no concept of ‘login’; there are only ‘persons.’ Because we have this login service, there’s a sort of ‘middle person’ in between our relationships, which has some very significant consequences.</p>
<p>One of the consequences is that it means that none of my relationships online are confidential: meaning that they’re not known only between me and the party I’m trying to interact with. If I go to the gym, or I go to rent a car, or I go to the doctor or the lawyer or whatever, that interaction that happens is private. It’s not known, generally speaking, by any other entity, including the government. If all of my relationships were known, then we would be very unhappy — we call that surveillance, and that would be an erosion of our privacy.</p>
<p>As a result, we don’t even have the conditions on the web for privacy. By the very architectural structure of it, there must be a login service in order for me to connect to another party. By definition, that means it’s not confidential. Often, the information or data that I exchange with that other party is subject to loss; that other party I’m talking to gathers a lot of information about me, and if they don’t protect it well, it can be stolen. Then, the really bad side effect occurs, which is that personal information that has been stolen about me can be replayed. It can be used by a malicious third party that has gained access to it through possibly poor stewardship of it by the business that I did business with, or worse; they sell it. A bad actor can replay that information and pretend to be me, and we call that identity theft. I think I’ve outlined here the two big, unforeseen consequences of the login architecture of the web, which is that a) none of my relationships are confidential and b) the data that is exchanged through that non-confidential interaction can be lost and replayed without my permission and knowledge, and therefore I can be impersonated.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I covered all of your domains, but to me, these are the fundamental flaws. It’s not as if that concern was foreseen 20 or 30 years ago; it was simply the way we built computer systems. Computer systems were expensive, and we needed a way to share them. The way to share them was to provide access to that computer system, which we accomplished through a new ceremony or ritual called login. To use a funny word, there’s no analogue of that digital ritual in the physical analog world. So, this is where we find ourselves, in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Mathieu: There’s so much to unpack there. I love the focus on relationships over and over again between two parties. When you think about login being this new party that shows up in the middle there; at the end of the day, there’s a reason why it showed up — to try to make things more secure or make it actually happen. However, they inherently ended up removing value from the system altogether. It seems as if there’s a back and forth in technologies, where things go from distributed, to centralized, to back to distributed. It feels as though in the real world, or in the paper credential era, it’s really a distributed way of doing things. There’s nothing centrally stored: everyone has their credential or their ID, and they use it how they wish, with the relationships that they interact with. Whereas, in this internet era, you lost that direct connection or direct relationship with the entities that you were interfacing with.</p>
 The Credential Trust Triangle &amp; The Role of Trust over IP 
<p>Mathieu: People are always curious about this when they’re looking to move into this next phase — let’s call it the digital trust phase. They play inside of the model, and the model has been represented in different ways. The one that’s gotten the most traction, is this <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/WP0010-toip-foundation-whitepaper/trust/vcred_trust_triangle/">Credential Trust Triangle</a>. There’s another model which looks like a diamond, so I could call it the Credentialed Trust Diamond, which is otherwise known as the Government’s Trust Triangle. Is that type of model similar to the model that existed in the paper credential era? How is this model being replicated or ingested into this new digital trust era?</p>
<p>John: I discovered the Trust Triangle, as we call it, in around 2017. As we started to understand it, we said, “But, this is how we do things already in the real world.” Sometimes, I talk about, “Let’s just forget this really awful nightmare of the last 40 years of computing and remember how we did it back in the old days, when we developed relationships with our friends, our business partners and so forth, and we had the underpinning of the government.” You know, the government is there; we don’t always know it or acknowledge it, but I described how the government underpins the ability for us to establish these trusted relationships. We can go back to that now.</p>
<p>When we talk about the trust triangle, we use this jargon called “Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers,” and that exactly maps to the world that we have today. We often play those roles at different times and in various interactions. To give an example: let’s use the business registries because I’ve been doing a lot of work with BC Registries over the years. Originally, we would say that BC Registries is going to be a Verifier. It’s going to take on the Verifier role; you’re going to show up at BC Registry’s door, and you’re going to say, “I’d like to incorporate a business.” They say, “Great, tell me some things about yourself, so that I can understand who I’m doing business or working with. And then, what is it you want to do?”</p>
<p>They’re verifying this information. They have a business process to approve it, and when they approve it, they become an Issuer. What they issue to you, are your Articles of Incorporation and perhaps other documents (I don’t dive into the super gory details of the corporation). The ultimate expression of your successful administrative act of creating a corporation is your Articles of Incorporation. You would take those Articles of Incorporation; you might go down to the bank and open a bank account with them, using proof of your identity, proof of your Articles of Incorporation, and proof of you being an officer in that company. At that point, the bank has been acting as a Verifier, and then they issued you a bank account. All the while, you as the individual, and you as the individual representing the corporation, are what’s called the Holder.</p>
<p>So, the Holder is the person or entity that receives things from Issuers, and presents them to Verifiers. This is extremely common. As soon as you put the jargon aside, you realize that this is exactly what happens in any trusted interaction — all of them. The fact that you play all three roles; it depends on where you are in a particular process what role you might be playing. You might not always play all three, but you’re likely going to play a couple of them. That’s the way we’ve always organized things, and it has simply taken a while for the computing world to come to a place where we recognized that there is a way to replicate that set of relationships using digital technology.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what the role of the <a href="https://northernblock.io/trust-over-ip/">Trust over IP Foundation</a> is trying to do, which is to introduce a couple of things. One is to bring a little more structure to the set of technical capabilities that allow us to do this, and the second, (and this is really a key differentiator of the Trust over IP Foundation mission) is that it recognizes that there are actually two parts to trust. There’s the technical or mechanical aspect of trust, which I referred to earlier as contracts. Those are technical documents, that are highly structured and understood and recognized by law, and in the paper physical world. And then, there’s a set of governing authorities and aspects that make that contract enforceable. That’s why I talked about the Business Corporations Act — it’ll be named different things in different jurisdictions, but it’s always there. That’s exactly the legal framework, under which a contract is even valid. That’s what makes it possible to have a corporation, or a non-profit society, or different legal entities that can be recognized in a court and able to enter into agreements, and so forth and so on.</p>
<p>That’s the governance framework. In fact, in the digital world, it’s the same. It’s just that we have no way, digitally, of representing a contract, or an agreement, or even a relationship, in some legally recognizable way. That isn’t something that was foreseen by the technical model of the web, so yeah, that’s the mission of the Trust over IP Foundation. The uniqueness of it, is this bringing together of the business/legal aspects, combined with the technical aspects, that allow us to create the conditions for trusted digital relationships. We hope that if there’s broad adoption of this, the big vision is that if parties choose to have any contractual relationship possible, using the internet as the communications mechanism and essentially replacing the web model, then there would be no logins. Relationships will be peer-to-peer, and there would be trusted interactions between those peers. Ideally, privacy laws and other laws would recognize those interactions as equivalent to what we have today in the physical world. Contracts would be upheld, and all the correct legal terms would be able to be upheld in the court systems of your jurisdiction. It’s a big vision, but I think that’s where we want to go. I think that would be a fair representation of the goals of the members.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I would agree with that. Having had many interactions with several dedicated and smart members of the Trust over IP, I think that that’s everyone’s goal. The internet has done such incredible things and created so much value. But now, to take it to that next step; it’s about creating this other layer that gives us this digital trust. You’ve described perfectly the trust triangle model of the Issuer, Holder, and Verifier, where today, the Verifier in scenarios is often referred to as the ‘Relying Party.’ In that model, they’re relying on data from someone. Whereas, today, they don’t have to rely on anything specific. Whatever they’re given at the point of a transaction can be verified against its source. It can be verified that it’s reliable, that it’s authentic, and its provenance; there are transparency features with this too. All of this is made possible, and the whole model fits within the dual stack architecture that you just described. That is, the governance and the technical layers, where you have the business, the legal, and the tech, on the technical side.</p>
<p>To finish off this dialogue, John; right after this discussion, we’re going to have some working group leads have a conversation with us, to talk a little more about the different working groups and different layers within the dual-stack architecture. Would you mind giving listeners of the podcast, who might not be familiar with this, what are these four layers? How do they play together? And, why do they matter so much in this model?</p>
 The Role of Working Groups in the Community 
<p>John: Sure. As I mentioned, the idea of the Trust over IP model or stack is that it has two sides. One side is concerned with the technical means by which to establish trusted digital relationships. That is, peer-to-peer connections, with protocols that can work through those peer-to-peer connections. In particular, protocols that allow for what we call <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">verifiable credentials</a> to be issued to Holders, and for Verifiers to be able to request from Holders cryptographically protected proofs that they’re holding these credentials, and sharing the data that’s held with them under the control of the Holder.</p>
<p>The other side is the governance side, which says that the services and means by which these technical capabilities are offered actually have a set of rules and actors behind them, that you can inspect. You can decide if you like how they’re operated, and therefore, make a determination about their trustworthiness. The working groups are structured in similar fashions: we have working groups who are focused on the technical stack, and we have working groups concerned with the governance stack.</p>
<p>Essentially, the first set of working groups looked at creating a community of practice around how we create governance artifacts, and decided to have a community of practice around how we create technical artifacts. Then it was decided to have a group where we understand what it would take if we want to put these things into practice. So, we have the Governance Stack working group, and the Technology Stack working group, both of which are more concerned with creating the generalized tools, documents, standards, and so forth. And then, we have the Ecosystem Governance working group, and the Utility Governance working group. I might be messing up the names; I apologize, they’re not in front of me right now.</p>
<p>However, these are communities of practice, where practitioners come together and share their expertise and their experiences so that they can help others create new ones, faster and better, with less friction. We can learn from each other, and it’s been just about a year that we’ve been together. I think the real value that we have right now in Trust over IP, is this idea that there’s a community of practitioners out there who are learning together, sharing with each other, and creating outcomes. Whether it’s implementation guides, or blueprints, or other kinds of knowledge-based artifacts, they can codify how to create digital ecosystems or communities, where there’s a common set of trust interactions that they want to be able to describe to their members.</p>
<p>I think that is really an important part of the Trust over IP organization, and is something that’s new and different. What I’m really happy about, and what I think is going to be our area of growth, is that we are bringing people into this world who would never have been involved in the more technical communities out there. We have organizations, that are not technology-based organizations. They obviously use technology, and they recognize the importance of trusted digital relationships to their business. They want to learn more and participate in the growth of that, and they see it as a competitive advantage to their businesses, to be able to understand how to do that. I think that’s clearly the direction that we want to continue; to keep growing that community. And, more and more, helping others understand why it’s important that they have <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">trusted digital relationships with their customers</a>, with their citizens, and with their friends and family, for that matter.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think it’s incredible to see the number of ecosystems that have been popping up over the past year. New ones that are popping up, as well as existing ecosystems, are coming into the Trust over IP for guidance on how to build with digital trust in the core of their <a href="https://northernblock.io/services/ssi-implementation/">digital transformation strategy</a>. I think it’s been over the past year since the Trust over IP has been active; the popularity around verifiable credentials is growing like crazy. I think everyone is interested in it.</p>
<p>Once people get their beaks wet a little bit with verifiable credentials, they begin to be aware of all of the other activity that should be taken seriously: the governance pieces that we’re talking about at the core, and the peer-to-peer communication channels that totally disrupt the way we do things via APIs today. Once people start realizing this stuff, they begin to see the value beyond the simple economic efficiencies, or the checkbox compliance stuff that people use these tools for, today.</p>
<p>The last comment is that I really echo your thoughts of the community. The community is strong; it’s vibrant, and it’s growing. You and everyone else have done a fantastic job of bringing these people together. As you alluded to, it’s so interesting to see people from different areas that you would never talk to in your day-to-day life, but you’re able to learn from them. The power of these open communities, is that you could build on top of what’s happening, in order to really leverage the learnings and the failures of other projects, and build on top of that experience. I think in this digital age, or in the age of digitally native people and products, the value ultimately comes from community. Whoever has the strongest communities is going to create the strongest digital value. So, I love how the Trust over IP is set up to really push this forward. A huge thank you, John, for what you have done to move this forward. It’s incredible to see the community growing around this.</p>
<p>John: Well, thanks, and really it’s the members that do this, so thank you for this as one of our members. To all the other members who are working hard and well, I look forward to the next year and seeing where it goes.</p>
 Introduction to Working Group Leads 
<p>Mathieu: Hey guys, thanks for doing this. Some of you may be new to the audience listening to this, and some of you have been on existing podcasts before. What I wanted to do today with each one of you is to have you give a brief introduction on yourself; your background, what expertise you bring to the Trust over IP, and what interested you in the Trust over IP, to begin with. Let’s start with a newcomer to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7EbSvsNpYPKK1WVAXANGWo">podcast</a>; I’ll throw it over to Karl; if you want to open it up, Karl? </p>
<p>Karl: Thanks, Mathieu. My name is Karl Kneis; I’m the COO of idRamp. Our background is in building enterprise ecosystems, solving complex identity problems, and service delivery for multinationals. Our interest in Trust over IP, particularly, was based on our experience working with corporations and business organizations solving ecosystem development problems. We find that the need for repeatable design patterns and open source standardized frameworks helps our customers save time and money. These features simplify adoption of the new <a href="https://northernblock.io/">technology around verifiable credentials</a>, so Trust over IP was very much a natural fit for idRamp. We joined up as founding members, and I’ve been working on hosting the Ecosystem Foundry working group.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thank you, Karl; we’ll get to the Ecosystem Foundry in a few minutes. Maybe I’ll shoot it over to someone who’s participating in another foundry working group; André Kudra. André, you’ve been on the podcast before, talking about identity and access management, and how verifiable credentials and the Trust over IP stack could be used for those use cases. I know Karl is familiar with what you guys do as well, but, André, would you mind giving a brief introduction for any newcomers, on yourself, your expertise, and what brought you to the Trust over IP?</p>
<p>André: Absolutely, Mathieu, thank you for the opportunity to be here again. My name is André Kudra; I’m the CIO of Esatus AG in my day job. In my night and weekend job, I fill various roles in SSI community groups. I’m a trustee of the Sovrin Foundation, and my company Esatus is a founding and steering member of Trust over IP. I am also a board member of the Teletrust IT Security Association in Germany, with more than 340 members. I try to promote Self-sovereign Identity everywhere in these groups. Since 2015, when we first ran into SSI, I saw that this is the way ahead. Last year, when the community convened to form Trust over IP as the organization that will deliver the missing trust layer in the network world, we said, “Well, we absolutely have to be part of this group, and we have to be part of the community in this new foundation, Trust over IP.” From the European perspective, since we are based in Germany, we want to bring the European angle into the works. Since the beginning, I’ve proudly been serving on the steering committee and as the co-chair of the Utility Foundry working group.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thank you, André; it’s fantastic to have you back on here. Now, I’ll throw it over to Scott. Would you mind giving a brief introduction on yourself and what brought you to the Trust over IP?</p>
<p>Scott: Thanks, Mathieu. I’m Scott Perry; I’m an auditor in the identity and cybersecurity space, and I’ve been doing that for my whole career. I became very focused on the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) area about 15 years ago, when I was working with the US Federal PKI. We were creating standards around how you can interoperate identity credentials in that ecosystem. I am also a licensed WebTrust Auditor and a player in that ecosystem, where you exchange secure certificates that get attached to websites. So, I have worked with several different governance authorities. I was seeking fairness by actually participating in the rules that are established between interoperable trust. I got involved in the verifiable credentials in the SSI space about five years ago, working to establish the governance framework for the Sovrin Foundation. I have architected the Trust Assurance Framework for Sovrin as well. I’m a co-chair of the Trust over IP Governance Stack working group, and it’s great to be here.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thanks, Scott. Last but not least; someone who’s been on the podcast before, with quite a popular episode. Paul, a lot of people are interested in what you’re bringing to the community, but for those who don’t know you: would you mind giving a brief introduction on yourself and what brought you to the Trust over IP community?</p>
<p>Paul: Sure. I’m Paul Knowles; I’m the head of the Advisory Council of the Human Colossus Foundation. At the foundation, we have combined expertise in three synergistic domains; decentralized authentication, decentralized semantics, and decentralized governance. We sit at the centroid point of those domains. My background is with clinical trial data management and statistical analysis, and in that domain, they have 25 years of very rich semantic experience. At Trust over IP, when it was first developed, there wasn’t a space specifically for semantics; at Trust over IP, they work with a dual stack model of governance versus technology, which doesn’t mention semantics at all. So, I approached the leadership group and suggested, “Why don’t we set up a semantics group so that we can talk about how data can geometrically and semantically fit together?” This is something you need to do for good machine learning, and analytics, and stuff. At Trust over IP, I’m the convener of the Inputs and Semantics working group. The Input side is more about authentication, and the Semantics side is more about deterministic semantics. I’m happy to be here and looking forward to the chat.</p>
 Trust over IP – Working Groups Overview 
<p>Mathieu: Thanks, everyone.&nbsp; What I’d like to do now, is jump into the day-to-day of what’s happening inside of the Trust over IP. There are tons of activities happening throughout various working groups within the Foundation. For background; when the Foundation came to be just over a year ago, there were four initial working groups that were established. There were two working groups that fell within a ‘Stack’ category and two that fell within ‘Foundry’ categories. The two that fell within the Stack category, were the Technical Stack working group and the Governance Stack working group. The two that fell within the Foundry category were the Utility Foundry working group and the Ecosystem Foundry working group.</p>
<p>Throughout the past year, as Paul described, he, and others, realized that there was a gap in the work that was happening. A new working group was created — the Inputs and Semantics working group — which fell inside the Stack category, as well. We’re going to go through each of these working groups to give a better idea to the audience of what’s actually happening within the Trust over IP. I think an exciting one I would like to start with is the Ecosystem Foundry working group, which sits at that top layer of the Trust over IP stack. Karl, you’re very lucky to have visibility into this and to be a chair of this working group. Could you give a bit of background of why you got into the Ecosystem Foundry within the Trust over IP? Why you took that leadership position, and how things have evolved, and what’s happening within the Ecosystem Foundry? </p>
<p>Karl: Well, part of my background included over 20 years of working with enterprise architecture, solution architecture, service delivery, and in that ecosystem development space. When the opportunity came up to form the Ecosystem Foundry working group, I was very eager to volunteer to chair that.</p>
<p>Mathieu: What happens from session to session, now? Are you seeing the rise of more ecosystems that are using the Trust over IP stack? What direction is this going in?</p>
<p>Karl: The Ecosystem Foundry working group is focused on acting as the ‘front door’ of that business layer of the Trust over IP stack that you saw in the introduction. As that front door, we help business organizations and consortiums incubate their governance frameworks and their ecosystems. We want those aspects to be shared as open-source, repeatable design patterns, for whatever or whoever their stakeholders may be.</p>
<p>We have a diverse community that is growing at a pretty regular and rapid pace. For example, we have the Yoma ecosystem that’s sponsored by UNICEF, focused on helping youth in Africa up their skills and promote themselves for employment opportunities. We have the Global Legal Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), which has been acting as a pioneer in adapting verifiable credentials as global legal identifiers. The Good Health Pass ecosystem that was recently formed as a working group within Trust over IP, is working with ID2020 in the World Health Organization to create interoperable solutions working with many different providers. I think that ecosystem alone has roughly 80 people that I’ve seen in some of those meetings, all from different organizations; medical, private consultants, government folks — very dynamic.</p>
<p>There’s another ecosystem sponsored by Identidad and the United Farm Workers, that’s focused on helping migrant farmers have an identity and use identity in their food distribution networks. We have education ecosystems, and the list goes on. There are so many; I couldn’t easily go through the whole list. But, at the end of the day, what we see is that businesses have a need for a standardized architecture and a standardized approach to these governance questions, that they can reproduce and repurpose to help them do business. Some of the discussion in the industry around governance is a little bit confused because governance is often perceived as a blocker or a bureaucratic inconvenience. In the Foundry working group, we can see that we’re leveraging all the great thinking that comes out of the Stack working groups to incubate and form these business models, and help accelerate adoption of this new technology. First and foremost, we’re standardizing trust across different business communities and business objectives.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Thanks, Karl. Scott, since you’re a co-chair or the chair of the Governance Stack working group, are the Foundry working groups’ customers’ to the work that you’re doing? How do you collaborate with the Ecosystem Foundry working group? I know this is probably the broadest question I could ask, but could you perhaps give a bit of background on what governance is in the context of digital trust? </p>
<p>Scott: Sure. You’re exactly right in what you’re saying, as far as the way that Karl’s group and my group interrelate. Karl’s group is out there, doing the outreach and working with a diverse group of needs in the marketplace. Karl needs standard specifications, recommendations, templates, white papers, and tools, so that he can provide that outreach for his customer base. So, that’s what the Governance Stack working group is focused on; where you start.</p>
<p>If you’re building a house, you have got to have a blueprint. If every builder that’s building a house has a standard set of how blueprints look — they have certain colours, certain notations, certain categories — then, when they get that blueprint, they know exactly how to build a house. Likewise, you have to start with the blueprint of what a governance framework looks like, and so we’ve spent time and energy on putting together what we call the ‘governance meta-model.’ That is, the standard set of categories and requirements that every governance framework needs to have. It also needs to have the structure so that when they become interoperable, you know exactly where to find certain pieces of information. Certain pieces of information are required in every governance framework, and it also has to have the flexibility to be able to work with a variety of different risk models associated with it. Some ecosystems are dealing with lots of requirements due to the mitigation of risks; some don’t have those constraints. So, we need to be able to provide all of the options in order to serve a wide variety of different needs.</p>
<p>We do have very focused areas that we’ve already invested in; we have a scope. You have to define what the ecosystem is, what are the boundaries of it, what the components are, and the players and actors that participate in it. Who governs it, whether there’s an authority or a designated party that drives the requirements that are listed in ‘must’ statements, or ‘should’ statements, or ‘may’ statements. These outlined requirements drive the directives that happen from the governance authority: what are the principles that are operating within that governance authority. Certainly, the Sovrin Foundation has advanced many of the principles of SSI, and some of those are actually baked into some of the governance frameworks that we’re seeing. So, we also need to have objectives within those governance frameworks. What are they? What are the outcomes they’re trying to achieve? It obviously needs to be risk-based to drive the mitigation, because, in the broad spectrum of things, governance frameworks try to reduce risk in some way, shape, or form and should include privacy and security by design.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Awesome; we’ll get back to governance a little later on in the conversation. I’d like to hop over to the other Foundry working group.</p>
<p>André, I think it’s interesting, and Scott described this too, that they’re serving the Foundry working groups. You obviously want to make sure that you’re serving it with a purpose, so having the business requirements being driven down from the Ecosystem working group is really pushing where a lot of the innovation and standards need to happen throughout the rest of the stack. André, you have a similar experience to Scott through the Sovrin Foundation. Additionally, you have quite a nice lens, in that you are not only working on an ecosystem solution through IDunion, but you’re also co-chair of the Utility Foundry working group, which is on Layer One of the Trust over IP stack. Would you mind giving a little more background on the activities that are happening at Layer One at the Utility Foundry working group, and how you look at the collaboration with the rest of the organization?</p>
<p>André: Absolutely, Mathieu. I think we need to start off by getting a better picture of the utility we are talking about. Everyone is talking about utilities. These are the fundamental things that are laying the foundation for everything else that’s happening on the dual stack. A utility is something that everyone has a different understanding of. To try to put it in layman’s terms; we are building an infrastructure that is comparable to things like a mobile telephone network. With a utility, we’re essentially creating the trust infrastructure where you can have the cryptographic trust mechanisms in our network that everyone can use. The utilities are building the fundamental block of infrastructure upon which the use cases are based. These are then defined by ecosystems, with the governance in place.</p>
<p>This is what the Utility Foundry working group is dealing with. We help everyone who wants to embark on their own utility journey, with getting up to speed and getting started. In more practical terms, what we do is that we give them a guideline, based on which they can execute their own journey. This is the six-stage model that we have laid out, which is called our Utility Project Lifecycle Management Guide. First, you gather your information in the ‘learn stage,’ then you convene to get the people who want to do it, to get together and build your utility. Then, you define the management and governance scope, and the methods and tools that you want to use, and then you actually create. So, before that, that’s all data gathering and getting up to speed. In the ‘create’ stage, you actually get together and establish a legal entity, which you may want to have. In the ‘implement’ stage, you implement the governance model, and onboard the members. Then, you maintain everything, which means you run the ledger, the utility, the infrastructure, on which the trust layers above are built. As I’ve mentioned, you have to have some kind of governance framework, that is, in fact, governing the network, and the utility, and the actors of the utility, and the participants in the network</p>
<p>This is what we helped people to understand, and to traverse through these stages to ramp up their own utility. As an example, IDunion is a very major initiative in Germany, and it is both a utility project as well as a project that is funded by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs in Germany to implement use cases. This is precisely what we are doing; getting through these stages and making it work on this example. Sovrin has been the pioneer in that round, having done all that without the Trust over IP stages being there to guide them.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Wonderful. I think we share the same thought, André. I’ve repeated this over and over again; people tend to overlook this layer sometimes, as it’s not the most attractive aspect from an outside perspective. However, the need to have this root of trust under the stack is crucial, and I think the work that the Utility Foundry working group is doing to provide that base for everything to function is tremendously important.</p>
<p>André: I don’t want to forget to mention that this is obviously something that is not only driven by me; I have great help there. Dan Gisolfi from IBM has been the co-chair all along, and obviously, you, Mathieu, are doing a tremendous job with supporting all the activities and throwing in many work hours. So, let’s take this opportunity to thank you, also, for being there.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Right, that’s why I talked it up! Thanks, André.</p>
<p>Paul, how do you see your work in the Inputs and Semantics working group being inside this? As a Stack working group, you’re also functioning as a supporter to the Foundry working groups. The way I look at the activities that your working group is doing, is that for this stack to take off and for adoption to really pick up, a lot of the stuff you’re doing is going to facilitate that. What’s the output that’s coming out of the working group, and how are you collaborating with the various ecosystems?</p>
<p>Paul: As you mentioned, it’s a different lens than the other stack groups. Where they look at governance versus technology, we look at data inputs versus semantics, or data entry versus data capture, if you like. Because we’re still obviously a very full space without having to specify where people are in the four-layer stack, it’s turned into a bit of an innovation space. That is, people who are working with centralized solutions and everything, still have a space in this whole ecosystem to be able to express what they’re doing, and their needs. They are bringing all of their expertise within their domains into this rich space.</p>
<p>I would say, for anybody new coming into Trust over IP, the Inputs and Semantics working group is a nice entry point from a centralized space. They can come in, they can learn about decentralized technologies, and then, when the time’s right, they can be pushed into the ecosystem side, or the utility side, or the technology, or the governance. I think it’s a nice place to enter the space.</p>
<p>We work on a vertical structure and a horizontal structure. When I say a horizontal structure; we’ve got a bunch of task forces underneath that. We have the Notice and Consent task force, the Privacy and Risk task force, and the Storage and Portability task force. All of these discussions happening in those groups feed back into the Inputs and Semantics working groups so that we can start thinking about how some of this stuff knits together. We’re building this huge amount of expertise. For example, in the Storage and Portability task force, we’ve had people from Inrupt talking about solid pods; next week, they’re talking about authentic chain data containers. We’ve got all these new technologies coming into this space. As a group, we find out what the best bits of those are, and we try to work together to get a nice, interoperable solution for all of those things.</p>
<p>We work on a vertical structure, as well. We’ve got a Healthcare task force, and underneath the Healthcare task force is an FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) focus group. Those guys have been super busy at the moment, because of the Good Health Pass Collaborative. I co-chair the Common Data Models and Elements group. In that group, the EU and the World Health Organization have said that FHIR is the common data model that they want to use, so obviously, all the work they’re doing in the FHIR focus group is super important for that whole initiative, as well. It’s a very active group, and it’s pretty unrestrained with the stuff that can come into it. I hope that answers your question.</p>
 Selling Digital Trust to C-Level Executives 
<p>Mathieu: That was fantastic. I really love that all of you have showcased the collaborative aspect of the Trust over IP; how the Foundation is able to work with different communities, and people are able to come in, people are able to share stuff. You mentioned Inrupt just now, Paul; and Karl, when talking about the Good Health Pass earlier, you mentioned a couple of other organizations. I think that’s not talked about enough: how friendly the community is, and how easy it is to work together and learn from each other. Everyone has the same goal of driving digital trust forward, and that benefits everyone. It’s more about growing the pie together.</p>
<p>From that perspective, I think what we would like to do now, is maybe open it up and have a little more of a discussion. We’ve covered the different working groups, and I have a few topics here that I’ll throw your way. I’ll throw the first one towards you, Karl. Anyone else, please feel free to jump in, as I’m sure you have thoughts of your own, and experience around this as well. The first thing I would like to ask, Karl, is: how has your experience been, selling the Trust over IP stack to enterprises or to C-level executives? How do you approach these conversations?</p>
<p>Karl: Well, our enterprise customers come to us with enterprise stacks, right? A typical enterprise already has a pretty robust, and usually complicated, governance and their own conglomeration of technology that’s architected together. What we do, is show them how Trust over IP can be used to augment those existing investments in existing ecosystems, to help amplify standardization, amplify interoperability, and ‘future-proofability’ (I think that’s not a proper word). We help them to adopt incrementally things like verifiable credentials and great new utilities, like the ones you’re hearing about in this session. Again, these things are a toolset for the Trust over IP stack to help organizations. Most of our customers are established enterprises, so they come with all of that baked in, and that’s my day-to-day reality. However, in Trust over IP, we also have what we call ‘green-field ecosystems,’ meaning that they’re starting from scratch, and they don’t have to traverse all that. To use your term, the way it’s ‘sold’ is to say, “You have a hundred questions; well, here’s a hundred answers.” It’s a simple way to help answer repeated problems around creating trust in a digital and distributed ecosystem, if that answers it.</p>
<p>André: If I may add a bit to that: obviously, people have often heard a variety of things about&nbsp; SSI, and the missing trust layer on the internet, and so on. They don’t have a defined understanding of what’s going on and what this can do for them. In fact, the dual stack model helps very well, to slice and dice the problem and illustrate connecting points for the solution, and for their understanding. You effectively can use the model to pick people up where they are standing, and traverse through the dual stack and make it more tangible to them. Then, in the end, you can come to an understanding, where you tell them, “Look, if you embark on this journey, you have the potential of cutting your own complexity.”</p>
<p>It’s exactly what you’re talking about, Karl. The complexity and conglomerates of infrastructure, which has heterogeneous governance and processes that are not well aligned, so you can help them portray a better future. In this new model, they can reduce the complexity and use the modules that Trust over IP with its technology components is delivering, to solve this and get to a leaner organization that is more future proof. That’s exactly the same way that I perceive the situation. Trust OIP is a great vehicle for transporting all these messages in a concise and consistent way.</p>
<p>Scott: Mathieu, I think one of the things that’s key, is that, as Karl had mentioned, people come with their own sphere of control. If they issue credentials, they can manage what it is. However, we’re dealing with situations where an ecosystem creates and issues credentials, whether it’s for SSI or for other purposes. Other ecosystems that are not related need to be able to rely on that. Where are they going to go to create that transitive trust between ecosystems?</p>
<p>That’s what we’re trying to define within our organization. We see that, for example, with the Good Health Pass, where you have health credentials that are very focused and very health-related. But, these individual credentials are being used for travel — a totally different industry — and they have to be able to work together to compare the requirements between those needs, between the issuers and the verifiers, in order to benefit the populace.</p>
<p>Paul: I’d also add that in a truly decentralized economy, or a dynamic data economy, we call it; there are three main domains that need to be truly decentralized. There’s identity management, there’s data management, and there’s access management in those spaces. You’re in a data life cycle; you can think of it as data entry, data capture, and data exchange. In those three spaces, it’s really about authentication, in that what you enter into the system comes from an authentic source. There are deterministic semantics, meaning that once data has gone into the system, you have to capture and structure it. You want to know that those items that you’re capturing are deterministic, meaning that no matter how many times you copy it across various networks, that same hash always equates to the same thing.</p>
<p>The last piece is decentralized governance, and that’s all about access management and authorization; that’s more the data exchange part. When you talk about decentralized governance, you want to make sure that there are no roadblocks getting in the way of those sorts of access issues. It’s quite rich; it’s not only focused on verifiable credentials. I think a lot of people come into this space and think it’s all about authentication, but it’s actually broader than that. It’s about authentication, determinism, and authorization. We can handle all of that somewhere in the organization, or within the foundation.</p>
 ToIP Governance Models 
<p>Mathieu: Just to riff off of the comment about the fact that if you’re creating credentials within an ecosystem, you don’t necessarily know how they’re going to be used in the future. With the comment about health credentials being used for travel, this comes back to ensuring that when you are creating a supply of credentials inside an ecosystem, you want to make sure that it’s good quality data. It’s the same thing over and over again: if you have garbage in, there’s garbage out. You want to make sure that what’s coming in, is high quality.</p>
<p>Scott, some of the stuff when you’re talking about building governance models, and maybe working with the Good Health Pass to do these things — what are some of the components that you take very seriously within the governance models, if it comes to registries? How do you look at that whole concept?</p>
<p>Scott: Well, there are a variety of ways that you can get transitive trust. You start with the cryptographic layer; making sure that we’re all using the same cryptographic tools. We have machine-readable rules engines, and the rules need to be built, and everyone needs to have agreement on what rules need to be put into these engines, and on the output. There are requirements, but also you have great disclosure. As Paul was mentioning, you have to have clarity on what the payloads are in transactions. Finally, you need to have clarity on the requirements: what do you require when I issue a credential? What am I getting, when I get the credential? What was built into the credential? What verification was done when the credential was issued? What’s included in the payload of that credential so that it can be used outside of its potential sphere? We’re focusing mostly on disclosure and clarity of requirements to allow others to actually use it.</p>
<p>Mathieu: When an external organization comes in, and there’s been quite a few that come in through the ecosystem foundry and directly to the foundation, as well for consultation. The Ontario government is a good example of one that came into the Trust over IP, and I know the UK government had come in as well. Anyone could jump in here, who was involved with these consults, but how does the Trust over IP guide these public sector groups? Are there differences between guiding the public sector versus the private sector? </p>
<p>Scott: Well, I could start it off because I have been working with the UK, and I was involved in the Ontario activity. These are interested communities; they want to promote digital life, digital communication. We’re still in the midst of a pandemic, and we’ve changed our focus around how digital life is. We want to improve digital life, and we want to foster trusted communication, because our lives have been restricted over the last 14 months or so. How do we create the communication and interoperability standards, to allow these communities to foster more trustworthy online communication? They’re interested parties, but they’re basically incubating the ecosystems that would fall more into Karl’s realm.</p>
<p>Karl: You have the side question there, about, how did we convene that? How did we respond? It’s an open community, where we all collaborate. We say, “Okay, there’s this call for a response: is this worthy of the community, to put together different resources, to try to articulate a response?” When something like the BC Government project comes up, it’s a great opportunity to educate a large group of people on best practice approaches to decentralized architecture, decentralized design, and all the principles around trust. The way I like to discuss it with some of my customers, is removing the need for trust. That’s the problem: the fact that if I need to trust you, to me, that’s a problem. Personally, I’d rather just not have to trust you. What is it you say, Paul? Assurance, not trust.</p>
<p>Paul: Yes,&nbsp; cryptographic assurance, right!</p>
 Digital Trust Ecosystems &amp; Collaborations 
<p>Mathieu: André, I think that what’s happening in Germany is extremely exciting, where people are taking this architecture and this viewpoint very seriously. How does Germany go about approaching this whole thing, really looking to adopt the Trust over IP architecture?</p>
<p>André: Yes, I think we still need to pull them in a bit more to Trust over IP, so I’m trying my best here to make that happen. I think it’s good, that at the higher political levels in Germany, at least they have an understanding of what’s going on there in the world. They are leveraging the great momentum that the SSI community has built throughout the last few years. We are very happy that, on the highest political levels, the understanding is now there that with Self-sovereign Identity, and with the European ecosystem of leveraging Self-sovereign Identity, they can have a distinction against ‘Big Tech.’ Plus, they can have an interoperable and open ecosystem that will help to drive European interests and organizations forward.</p>
<p>I think this is now well-known, and the momentum is ever-growing. In fact, this month, coming from the Chancellery in Germany, there will be a project that has been driven for the past month. The first pilot will become public, and then I think we will see a lot of stuff happening. This is on top of the IDunion initiative, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs, so there are lots of different streams working in the same direction in SSI. I think this is based on the understanding that this is a global topic, which Trust OIP is helping to shape, and build, and make more understandable and digestible for everyone who wants to get on the journey.</p>
<p>Trust over IP has such a great resource pool of talented people who are thought leaders and experts in their fields. Trust over IP is a great point where you can tap into this knowledgeable resource pool. This is exactly what we see happening with Good Health Pass and the government transportation works that have already been done. This wouldn’t be happening if there wasn’t the notion that the thought leaders of the world are getting together to work on these topics, and everyone sees the benefit of tapping into that. I totally see the value and the advantage that the Trust over IP is providing there.</p>
<p>Paul: It’s a nice place to incubate new collaborations between the people that are interested in decentralized technologies without necessarily being at the government levels. I’ve seen a lot of people that are working in spaces, and then they think, “Oh, I love what you’re doing, we’re doing this. Oh, that’s cool.” They collaborate, and they build some kind of new technology, so that’s really nice to see — it’s very organic. It’s not all about Trust over IP; they can shoot off and do their own side projects and then come back to Trust over IP and explain what they’ve done and what kind of things they’ve solved. So, in that way, I think it’s a super organic space.</p>
<p>Karl: I think André hit a really important point for me in the day-to-day; the value of Trust over IP is that you’d be hard-pressed to find any community that has such a diverse set of very well-informed and intelligent members on the subject. I don’t think most budgets could support paying, even on a consulting basis, to get this diversity of skill and diversity of perspective. For me, personally, that’s the day-to-day value that’s really immeasurable when you consider the commitment to the community. The reciprocal value back to me, is simply learning from all these fascinating minds, and these projects like the IDunion project and all the LISSY work out there, that in turn, is inspiring ecosystem and utility envisioning in the United States. I know that US senators, for example, have been discussing the great work that André’s been talking about.</p>
<p>Scott: To add to Karl’s point, the Good Health Pass joined with Trust over IP in solving a global problem. They marshalled nine drafting groups together, and there’s been a concerted effort in the last month to put documents out. We have 150 pages right now; very well constructed recommendations. It’s just a tremendous amount of effort that could not be done, unless you have an organization putting them all together.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s tough to keep up with all the momentum that’s happening in the space. I echo your thoughts, Karl, and everyone else. With the number of intelligent, hard-working, well-intentioned people that are going in the same direction, it’s tough to keep up. It’s interesting that as more projects or ecosystems are popping up, they’re laying the foundation for others. Something you maybe didn’t think was possible yesterday, is today, and you have the blueprint in front of you to create a project based on that.</p>
<p>Karl: Another wonderful aspect is that you also have competitors — companies that are competing directly in the same space, doing the same thing — joining their minds together and coming up with better and more powerful solutions for their customers, because of that reciprocal benefit. It’s something you hear about with newer members: sometimes they’re shy about their own Intellectual Property or their own companies. But quickly, as you start to participate in the community, you’ll see that there are very fluid and agile ways to share ideas and really improve your own commercial objectives while improving the greater objectives around digital trust and interoperability.</p>
<p>Paul: For all of this to work, there’s an interesting space that’s going to be developing over the next couple of years in the data governance authorities, at the jurisdictional level, and even more for the trust ecosystems within those jurisdictions. You’re forcing this sense of collaboration, for people that are trying to solve a common problem or working for a common purpose. I think Trust over IP is just a fantastic framework to start noodling these spaces, which are becoming inevitable for the whole thing to work. It really is a fantastic space to be noodling in.</p>
<p>Mathieu: One aspect that excites me quite a bit, and I know André brought this up in the past, too, is that there’s so much momentum behind verifiable credentials as a whole. If you take the bigger umbrella, the whole digital identity space is understanding some of the benefits that come with verifiable credentials. But, one of the underappreciated innovations that I think is going to disrupt so many things is the API-less aspect to it. I could completely disrupt spaces and be significantly more agile than others, by being able to leverage services without needing to do an integration.</p>
<p>André: Totally. This is one key part of my speeches these days. We call it Self-sovereign Identity, and the ‘identity’ word implies we are dealing only with identity, but in fact, it’s so much more. SSI is a key enabler of any type of digitalization effort, because we’re able to pass on trustworthy data, without ever having agreed on an interface before. Obviously, this requires our understanding of the data model and the semantics, which is totally Paul’s domain. This is the key requirement that we have to pass on with each credential, but then the whole merit of a data-driven economy can unfold without APIs being specified upfront. I think this is the real game-changer.</p>
<p>So, even though it’s called Self-sovereign Identity — this is the term that has been coined, and I know that many people don’t like it — it’s so much more. It’s an enabler for transporting trusted data across the network world. This is brilliant, and this is the reason why everyone’s going to like it and love it at some point. It’s an inevitable piece of all the digitalization efforts.</p>
<p>Karl: That perspective matches our day-to-day with our enterprise customers. As soon as they understand the concept of a verifiable credential, password-less login, data privacy, data minimization, and all that, they love all those ideas. However, that’s just scratching the surface.</p>
<p>We talk about digital transformation; think about all the analog processes that are still moving around. All the papers are still being pushed for verification and any kind of business process. For example, we had one education customer in a public sector engagement, where they wanted to issue payslips as verifiable credentials, to be interoperable with loans, and in getting real estate and housing for their students and their alumni. I think that digitization is where you find the full depth and the breadth of the value of this technology. The credentials, the password-less login, that’s all great; the market’s seen a lot of that, but there’s real depth in answering the call to digital transformation, that the enterprise has been trying to resolve through several generations of technology. We finally have some very important quantum leaps forward to improving the digital trust experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Paul: There’s another important aspect, as well. We’re talking a lot about the transient objects with verifiable credentials, but I’m really interested in where the source of that data is coming from. That’s another nit that we’re working on; not just in this community, but across a number of communities. Finding out the persistent records in a database — when I say a database, it could be a database that’s held in a personal data store, that’s under your control — but that’s your root of authenticity, if you like. From there, you can build your verifiable credentials and stuff.</p>
<p>It’s a super interesting space, because you can think of it as the control being totally right back with the citizen with all of this. They have access to their data; they can create credentials from that; it’s got an authentic source that’s been certified by certifying authorities. The important thing is that the data throughout all of that can flow from peer-to-peer, being safe and secure using verifiable credentials, semantic containers, good semantics, and all of that stuff. You’re working peer-to-peer, and it’s totally secure. The whole ecosystem will just unfold and be an amazing place for safe transacting.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s fantastic. I love your point, too, Karl, where you’re only scratching the surface with use cases like password-less authentications and certain access protocols. With these types of use cases, you could 10x current processes. But, the stuff that I think excites all of us, is the hundred and thousand x possibilities that are going to grow the entire pie.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to all of you for doing this today; it was a wonderful conversation, and I look forward to part two at some point.</p>

  <p>Attend this session to learn how One Identity’s cloud-first solutions portfolio enables organizations to let business needs, not IT capabilities; drive how they implement their Identity Governance and Administration strategy. There is no single right way to do cloud-based Identity and Access Management services. Not only is every organization at a different place in their journey, and each will prioritize cloud benefits differently. So, no matter where you are on your cloud journey, modular and integrated solutions can strengthen your identity security, help you achieve governance and a Zero Trust model, and get compliant. Join this session, led by One Identity Field Strategist Rob Byrne. He’s worked with clients from many different industries with a wide array of Identity Security challenges and helped them successfully implement a secure and efficient IGA program.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/2021-05-11-byrne-iga-cloud"></a>

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-158-big-tech-gets-bigger-self-sovereign-identity-5-years-on-907543545539">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The Economist on the future of banking — special&nbsp;report  Why self-sovereign identity matters in a world of&nbsp;CBDCs  BONUS: A TV show about central&nbsp;bankers  Greg Kidd: I work in regtech, not&nbsp;fintech  What magic teaches us about misinformation  Chart of the week — the creator ecosystem  This week in&nbsp;Facebook  Tweet of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. The Economist’s comprehensive overview of the future of&nbsp;banking Photo: Micheile Henderson<p>A <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021-05-08">great collection of articles/special reports from The Economist</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>).</p><p>First, on “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/08/a-future-with-fewer-banks">a future with fewer banks</a>,” a reminder that banking and in particular, “money” historically hasn’t been about technology much at&nbsp;all:</p><blockquote>Because technology has disrupted so many industries, its impact on banking may seem like one more example of a stodgy, uncompetitive business made obsolete by slick tech firms. But money and banking aren’t like taxis or newspapers. They make up the interface between the state and the economy. “The deep architecture of the money-credit system, better known as banking, hasn’t changed since the 18th century, when Francis Baring began writing about the lender-of-last-resort,” says Sir Paul Tucker, formerly deputy governor of the Bank of England and now at Harvard. “Which means it has not, so far, depended on technology at all, because Francis Baring was writing about it with a quill&nbsp;pen.”</blockquote><p>But technology is now coming to eat banks’ lunch. The Economist discusses <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/how-fintech-will-eat-into-banks-business">how that’s playing out</a>. Check out this&nbsp;chart:</p><p>Also from the collection:</p>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/a-bigger-role-for-venture-capital">Comparing venture capital to whale&nbsp;agents</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/when-interest-rates-turn-negative">When interest rates go&nbsp;negative</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/when-central-banks-issue-digital-money">On CBDCs</a>  <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/will-the-dollar-stay-dominant">The future of USD dominance</a>  <p>So where does all of this leave us? According to The Economist, it’s “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/a-brave-new-world-for-banks">a brave new world for banks</a>.” We’ve talked plenty about how digital wallets are disrupting the space. But it’s important to emphasize as well how fundamental banks are to how the global system works. Central banks define monetary policy but ultimately, it’s the banks that execute the plan — holding 90 percent of broad money supply in deposits.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/us/politics/cryptocurrency-regulation-sec-ripple-labs.html?referringSource=articleShare">the NYTimes pointed out</a>, “the value of all outstanding cryptocurrency has jumped to about $2.4 trillion — or more than the approximately $1.2 trillion of United States currency in circulation worldwide.” On the other side of things, China’s fintech giant Ant “can reach 400 million customers outside of China through its partners,” according to The Economist.</p><p>In other words, this isn’t just about fintech disrupting another industry or the furious rise of crypto — it’s about the rejiggering of the world monetary&nbsp;system.</p><p>These are uncharted waters. Back to <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/05/06/a-brave-new-world-for-banks">The Economist on a brave new&nbsp;world</a>:</p><blockquote>But this revolution brings with it new problems. Because they benefit from network effects, payment platforms will tend to concentrate into just one or two giant intermediaries. As more activity migrates away from banks, existing monetary-policy mechanisms may become obsolete.The risk of losing control over the monetary system has lit a fire underneath usually staid central bankers. Projects to accelerate fast payment systems have cropped up worldwide. So have e”orts to create central-bank digital currencies, a digital form of paper cash to compete with the digital payments of private giants. In China, where payments&nbsp;!rms are most advanced, more than 100,000 people are already using a digital yuan in pilot projects.</blockquote><blockquote>The roll-out of what amounts to a new monetary system thus comes with risks. Many of the issues it raises are as tricky as the financial stability and inclusion problems of old. As people move their money into cbdcs they will pull it out of banks, threatening the system developed to foster loans without overt state interference in credit allocation. The digital involvement of the central bank in everyday transactions would not only increase the risk of such interference but also be a gift to those wishing to snoop on citizens. And the concentration of the economy in digital money, whether it is run by private firms or by a central bank, could provide a new route for malicious actors to destabilise systems through cyberwarfare.</blockquote><p>So the risks of getting it wrong are high. But the risk of inaction could be even&nbsp;higher:</p><blockquote>Central bankers that run reserve currencies can head off the potential nightmare of leaving Facebook or China’s government in charge of global payment systems by issuing digital currencies of their own. If they do it sensibly, digital money could even become a force for good, not just a defence against disaster. “There is a parallel with biological evolution,” said Sir Jon Cunli”e of the Bank of England in March. Evolution is generally slow, but at times of geological or environmental change it can be rapid. A bewildering number of life forms may appear and many do not survive. This is “a helpful lens through which to look at what’s happening now,” Sir Jon suggested. When people look back at this period they will see banking in a period of very rapid change. The hope is that it may emerge in a better&nbsp;state.</blockquote><p>Also relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/generosity-is-trending-neobanks-are-tapping-into-that">Generosity is trending.

CBDCs make self-sovereign identity more relevant than&nbsp;ever <p>Something anyone who has followed GlobaliD has known for some time — here’s the FT on “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/88f47c48-97fe-4df3-854e-0d404a3a5f9a?shareType=nongift">Why CBDCs will likely be ID-based</a>:</p><blockquote>“Central banks are realising CBDCs will have to be intimately linked to identity to deal with illicit finance and bank disintermediation risk.”</blockquote><p>Why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters:</p><blockquote>When money goes ID-based, one also has to consider the broader parameters of the potential data creep. Just how far should that personal file reach? What sort of non-monetary information should or shouldn’t be contained within it? To what degree should account-holders be able to refuse access to their data to third parties? Who might the government entrust to manage and operate these schemes, and how can we hold them to&nbsp;account?</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/04/27/google-promised-its-contact-tracing-app-was-completely-private-but-it-wasnt">Google Promised Its Contact Tracing App Was Completely Private — But It Wasn’t — The&nbsp;Markup</a>  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/28/1022940/slum-dwellers-india-google-plus-code-access-delivery-apps/">Slum dwellers in India get unique digital addresses through&nbsp;Google</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a> — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-bug-account-data-leak/">Peloton’s leaky API let anyone grab riders’ private account data — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/interview-idemia-matt-thompson-mobile-id-identity-on-the-edge-705059/">INTERVIEW: IDEMIA’s Matt Thompson on the Reality of Mobile ID and ‘Identity on the Edge’ — FindBiometrics</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRsvz6pRtZE">Edward Snowden Talks Privacy Coins at Ethereal&nbsp;2021</a>   3.

What magic teaches us about misinformation: <p>A cool piece from <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>—<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cea69f0-7d44-424e-a121-78a21564ca35">the FT</a>:</p><blockquote>Why do people — and by “people” I mean “you and I” — accept and spread misinformation? The two obvious explanations are both disheartening.</blockquote><blockquote>The first is that we are incapable of telling the difference between truth and lies. In this view, politicians and other opinion-formers are such skilled deceivers that we are helpless, or the issues are so complex that they defy understanding, or we lack basic numeracy and critical-thinking skills.</blockquote><blockquote>The second explanation is that we know the difference and we don’t care. In order to stick close to our political tribe, we reach the conclusions we want to&nbsp;reach.</blockquote><blockquote>There is truth in both these explanations. But is there a third account of how we think about the claims we see in the news and on social media — an account that, ironically, has received far too little attention? That account centres on attention itself: it suggests that we fail to distinguish truth from lies not because we can’t and not because we won’t, but because — as with Robbins’s waistcoat — we are simply not giving the matter our&nbsp;focus.</blockquote><blockquote>What makes the problem worse is our intuitive overconfidence that we will notice what matters, even if we don’t focus closely. If so, the most insidious and underrated problem in our information ecosystem is that we do not give the right kind of attention to the right things at the right time. We are not paying enough attention to what holds our attention.</blockquote><blockquote>The art of stage magic allows us to approach this idea from an unusual angle: Gustav Kuhn’s recent book, Experiencing the Impossible, discusses the psychology of magic tricks. “All magic can be explained through misdirection alone,” writes Kuhn, a psychologist who runs the Magic Lab at Goldsmiths, University of&nbsp;London.</blockquote><p>Check out <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cea69f0-7d44-424e-a121-78a21564ca35">the full&nbsp;article</a>.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cea69f0-7d44-424e-a121-78a21564ca35">What magic teaches us about misinformation</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/antoine">/antoine</a> — <a href="https://caitlinjohnstone.substack.com/p/silicon-valley-algorithm-manipulation">Silicon Valley Algorithm Manipulation Is The Only Thing Keeping Mainstream Media&nbsp;Alive</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/60296d">Briefing: Facebook’s Oversight Board Upholds Trump Ban, Calls for&nbsp;Review</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/glaad-study-facebook-instagram-youtube-tiktok-8d9555b6-4cee-4db8-8b51-5b5fdad0c749.html">GLAAD finds top social media sites “categorically unsafe” for LGBTQ&nbsp;people</a>   6.

 Future Verus miners: take notice. Prepare for the full mainnet release of PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service) and find great opportunities to maximize profit with your hardware. Mine up to 22 blockchains with the same hashrate. With Verus’ hardware equalizing hashing algorithm (VerusHash 2.2) you can mine efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even ARM devices.

The hashing algorithm uses the AES/AVX instruction sets built into most modern CPUs to boost CPU hash&nbsp;power.</p><p>Mine Verus most efficiently with CPUs, mobile phones and even certain ARM devices. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit#gid=10943314">Compare mining hashrates here.</a></p> Coinbase Rewards <p>1440 blocks are generated each day. On average 720 blocks go to miners, 720 blocks go to stakers (<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-beginners-staking-guide-efbbdc4de951">learn more on staking Verus</a>). For generating — or finding — a block, miners and stakers get compensated. This compensation is called a coinbase reward. There will never be more than 83,540,184 VRSC.</p><p>If you look at the image below, you might think that the possibility of earning VRSC for miners and stakers goes down drastically. We explain next that earnings don’t stop at coinbase&nbsp;rewards.</p>Verus Coin Emission Schedule. From block height 10,080 on, all coinbase rewards of 384 and 192 VRSC were timelocked and then unlocked at random block heights. The last of those rewards were unlocked at block height 1,181,520. Earning from Economic&nbsp;Activity <p>Miners and stakers don’t just earn coinbase rewards (the reward for finding a new block), they also take a small portion of the Fee Pool. The Fee Pool collects fees that are paid by users when they are interacting with the protocol. Protocol fees&nbsp;include:</p>  PBaaS-chain*: creating a blockchain on Verus costs 10,000 VRSC. 5,000 VRSC goes into the Verus Fee Pool, and 5,000 VRSC goes into the Fee Pool of the created blockchain, earned by miners and stakers of that blockchain  (DeFi) Currency and tokens*: creating a currency on the Verus blockchain costs 200&nbsp;VRSC  VerusID: identity fees for miners and stakers are 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100&nbsp;VRSC  Conversion fees: each time a user converts currencies it costs&nbsp;0.025%  Transaction fees: each transaction is minimally 0.0001&nbsp;VRSC  <p>Miners and stakers are protecting the blockchain and at the same time servicing the Verus economy. We expect the Fee Pool rewards to exceed the coinbase&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Think about it: someone creates a PBaaS-chain, 5,000 VRSC goes to the Fee Pool, the winner of the next block gets 50 VRSC extra on top of the coinbase reward. Now imagine a whole lot of economic activity: users making conversions through the protocol, registering VerusIDs, creating DeFi currencies and tokens, and the Fee Pool can get quite&nbsp;large.</p><p>*Fees are subject to change before hitting&nbsp;mainnet</p>Verus Fee Pool. Percentage is subject to change before hitting&nbsp;mainnet. Merge-Mine up to 22&nbsp;Chains <p>The example above is only for mining Verus directly. Keep in mind that Verus is a multichain protocol. All PBaaS-chains in the protocol have exactly the same specifications as the Verus mainchain. They too have a Fee Pool that collects fees through VerusID registrations, conversions, DeFi currency and tokens and even in a later stage also PBaaS-chains!</p><p>And you can mine 22 of them! All with the same hashrate as you would when mining only&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>All these chains have the same consensus algorithm, 50% PoW, 50% PoS, so you can also stake an unlimited amount of PBaaS-chains.</p>Merge-mine 22 chains with one&nbsp;device Happy Mining (and Staking)! <p>Everyone in the world can start mining Verus today with our low barrier hashing algorithm.

<p>How to setup a secure Kusama Validator in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>A short time ago, we as <a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes</a> decided to host our own Kusama Validator. This article will help you to understand how you can set up your own Validator on Polkadot’s Canary Network. At the very least you will walk away with a basic understanding of how staking works in Polkadot and what responsibilities different roles have in the ecosystem. Let's start with the most important concepts Validators and Nominators.</p> Validators and Nominators <p>In Polkadot’s ecosystem, a node participating in the BABE Consensus is called a Validator. Such an entity has three key responsibilities:</p>  Produce blocks if asked to do&nbsp;so  Vote over the blocks (more precisely the “chain of blocks”) that still have to be finalized  Forward messages between Parachains  <p>To allow your Validator to become part of the active set that is currently validating the chain, you will need to stake a minimum of ~<a href="https://polkaview.network/ksm">4000KSM</a>. Obviously, holding or acquiring such a vast amount of KSM is only possible if you’re quite wealthy, as 4000KSM are 1.28 million dollars as of writing&nbsp;this.</p><p>A Nominator is an entity holding vast amounts of KSM, these are most likely entities involved in Polkadot for a long time. The Nominator elects different Validators to Stake his KSM. In short, this role describes someone who does not run his own node. Instead, the entity stakes their KSM most profitably by assigning their stake to a validator. Please understand that staking is risky for the Nominator, if the Validator — for whatever reason — stops running, they both risk getting slashed. The slash would ultimately affect the Nominator's stake.</p><blockquote>This mechanism incentivizes Nominators to choose Validators that charge a minimal commission fee and have a good reputation in running their nodes. Validators in return get incentivized to run their node as stable as possible. In return Validators can use low commission fees to attract Nominators.</blockquote> Controller and&nbsp;Stash <p>As we now know the two most important roles in the consensus process we can talk about the accounts you have to set up to run your Validator. Two account types are of importance at this stage — The Controller and the&nbsp;Stash.</p><p>Controller and Stash Accounts are explained quite easily. While the Stash is the entity holding the majority of your funds, the Controller is the entity having control over the Stash and the actions you take — like starting or stopping your Validator.</p>Stash and Controller [1] Setting up a Secure Validator <p>To set up your Validator you can either choose the <a href="https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/mirror-maintain-guides-how-to-validate-kusama">manual set-up</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup">Secure Validator Setup</a>. As you can already guess from the subtitle we have chosen the second&nbsp;option.</p><p>Within the Secure Validator Setup, you will have two options for setting up the node. The first option is to set up your server and the Polkadot application in one run using Terraform. We decided to use the second option which is to set up your server yourself and then use Ansible to securely set up the Polkadot application.</p><p>For the following setup you will need the following:</p>  At least one Debian-based machine (preferably Ubuntu 18.04 as used in Polkadot’s Documentation) with the following specs (min. 300GB Storage, 2–8GB Memory, 1–2 CPUs) hosted with the Provider of your&nbsp;choice.  <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">Ansible</a>(v2.8+) installed on your&nbsp;machine  A minimal of 3KSM depending on the amount you want to stake yourself. 0.3KSM will be needed for requesting an on-chain identity. 1–2 KSM should be held for upcoming transaction fees. The overhead can then be used to stake using your own validator. A higher amount of self stake raises trust in your validator as you project more trust on it yourself.   Preparing Your&nbsp;Node <p>Before deploying Polkadot to your remote machine you will need to prepare an additional user and ssh access for this user. Start with <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/add-new-user-account-with-admin-access-on-linux/">creating a new admin user</a> and then <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-2">create new ssh keys</a>. Preferably you should also disable the root login as described in the ssh key instructions.</p> Running the Secure Validator Setup <p>If you successfully opened a shell to your remote machine, you can adjust the Ansible script for your needs. First, clone the repository:</p> git clone <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup.git">https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup.git</a> <p>Now start adjusting the ansible/inventory.sample file according to the instructions given in the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup/blob/master/GUIDE_ANSIBLE.md">setup guide</a>. Below you can find an already edited example inventory file using placeholder values:</p><p>If you are done adjusting the inventory file to your needs you should be able to execute the playbook via the provided&nbsp;script:</p> chmod +x setup.sh<br>./setup.sh my_inventory.yml <p>The Ansible Playbook will now be executed and deploy the Polkadot service to your remote&nbsp;machine.</p><p>In case everything worked well your node should show up on the telemetry. It will now take some time until the node is in sync with the network. For us, this took nearly 7 days. Once finished you will only need to <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup/blob/master/GUIDE_ANSIBLE.md">bond your KSM </a>and <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-validator-setup/blob/master/GUIDE_ANSIBLE.md">set your session keys</a> to enter your validator into the “waiting” list. From there on, it is a game of building trust into your Validator so that enough foreign stake is received to participate in the active validators pool. The more trust you generate in you and your node the more steady your rewards will become in the long term. To achieve more trust in your node you can also have a look at <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-identity">on-chain identities</a>. For about 0.3KSM you can request a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-identity#registrars">Registrar</a> to verify your personal information which Nominators can then use to get more information on who is actually running the&nbsp;node.</p> Monitoring Your Validator <p>As keeping your validator up and running is key to running your node successfully, good monitoring is a must-have. For an initial layer of monitoring, you can use a <a href="https://t.me/Kusama_bot">Telegram Bot</a>. But for the more sophisticated part of the monitoring, most people will use <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> and <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>. You can set these up following the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-monitor-your-node">instructions given in Polkadot's documentation</a> but beware that some metrics might not show up in the provided Grafana dashboard as not all metrics are delivered which is what happened to us. This is why we enabled the node exporter in the Secure Validator Setup which provides additional data and can be displayed in Grafana with dashboards like&nbsp;<a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11207/reviews">this</a>.</p> Validator Stats and Nomination <p>In the PolkadotJS-UI under <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/query">Validator Stats</a> you can browse Validators and inspect stats like rewards or previous slashes. For example, search for ESgN4sdziBpAubx2pGJ1CapGxetE2E1zUbTQCaRFbxxrW2Y and you will find our Validator. Using the displayed information a Nominator can determine his risk with a Validator. He should now be able to nominate the validator as <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot">described in the documentation</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> based in Stuttgart is a provider of crypto-economy solutions.</p><p>51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of Blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking">https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-staking</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/kusama-validator-node-setup-5ddcd5e39f99">Kusama Validator Node Setup</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
