 The Real Politics of the Blockchain <p>One of the arguments for why Octopuses have not managed to make the jump to high technology in the past few million years is that, despite being spookily intelligent, their young are free floating little sea creatures rather than being raised by parents. No way to build culture. EVERY GENERATION STARTS FROM&nbsp;ZERO.</p><blockquote>Humans can’t start from zero — we need to learn from previous generations.</blockquote><p>Today’s younger generations are as adrift on the internet, on the infinite seas of the information environment, as baby octopuses are in the vast depths of the open ocean. The only things which are stable reference points are archaic (religion) or capitalised (product-based identities). Equally&nbsp;abyssal.</p><p>But Humans can’t start from zero — we need to learn from previous generations. Some say cave paintings were used to teach younger people how to hunt! We have been at this a&nbsp;while.</p><a href="https://smarthistory.org/bhimbetka-cave-paintings-2/">https://smarthistory.org/bhimbetka-cave-paintings-2/</a><p>So I’m thinking again about how to handle the political disenfranchisement of young people through the blockchain, building on something <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-blockchain-sleep-of-reason-b28f3bd3f83b">I wrote a while back</a>. The hopes and dreams of a better world where people have individual agency and great collective power are deep-rooted in blockchain culture. Can we deliver that&nbsp;dream?</p><p>I believe we can but it needs some careful cultural thinking about how young people got so screwed over by the economy and socially atomized, and what might be needed to fix it. It’s all about “frontier” and getting away from incumbents to places where it’s genuinely possible to create something.</p><p>Also humans live a really, really long time which means you can have me — a Gen X “90s kid” — tell you what I think about the situation. In contrast Octopuses only live about five years so their elders are pre-school. But in the 1990s we had almost exactly the same obsessions that the current generation has and my hope is that we can help you find a way&nbsp;fowards.</p><p>Does any of this look familiar? Hell we’re even fighting the same companies.</p><p><a href="https://www.trippingly.net/burning-man-musings/burning-man-1996">Burning Man 1996: Helco - Trippingly</a></p><p>Can we deliver the&nbsp;dream?</p><p>I was part of an internet community in the early 1990s. People all over the world. Our symbol? A simple “@“ because nobody else had a cultural identity as an email&nbsp;user.</p><p>Just think about that for a second. You’re driving around in some suburb looking for your friend’s house, that you only know from the internet, and you pass a mailbox with an “@“ symbol printed on a piece of paper and taped to the outside of the mailbox. “Internet People Here”. It’s like seeing the Bitcoin logo on a shop, or the Ethereum logo on a conference.</p><p>You know that in this place you’re part of The&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Go back to the age of rail and there were <a href="https://popularmechanics.com/technology/a25174860/hobo-code/">Hobo Code symbols</a>. The “@“ symbol was our technomad code. “Internet People&nbsp;Here”.</p><p>That’s 30 years ago. It’s as distant from 2023 as the 1960s were for us in the 1990s. It’s an entire world&nbsp;away.</p><p>Fashion used to play the same role. Subcultural branding and tagging and identity all woven together. You’ve seen these guys? London in the 1980s had one of the most extreme fashion subcultures ever seen. That version of punk was expensive in money and opportunity costs. Social&nbsp;proof!</p><p>The people that paid that cost were in it together against the world — out-in&nbsp;group.</p><p>Of course, with those people it&nbsp;was:</p><p>Today, by and large, young people are not responding like this; it is notable that in the 21st century the thriving ferment of street subcultures has largely died out except as nostalgia trends (although, even then, no one has brought back<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jul/30/big-quiffs-zombies-and-dead-crows-the-wild-world-of-psychobilly"> psychobilly</a> — no one should bring back psychobilly).</p><p>So now everybody’s on the internet. Young people who skipped college are sitting around at home trading crypto in their teens, and then moving to Singapore for tax reasons in their 20s (or whatever). In an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=petals+on+a+wet+black+bough+ezra+pound&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR187jpNODAxVTpycCHZNtAngQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=petals+on+a+wet+black+bough+ezra+pound&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzoECCMQJ1C5A1iHCmD1C2gAcAB4AIABY4gBngSSAQE2mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWfAAQE&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=AsyeZZHOKNPOnsEPk9uJwAc&amp;bih=751&amp;biw=1314&amp;client=safari">infinite sea of faces</a>, who are your people? Who do you invest in knowing? And I do mean “<a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a19712238/how-many-hours-best-friends/">invest in knowing</a>” — relationship building takes time, and young people invest in it very, very,&nbsp;hard.</p><blockquote>Who do you invest in&nbsp;knowing?</blockquote><p>Today, while young people still deal with this through <a href="https://youtu.be/ti4PGYISY44?si=6l0tcL5F96xQLu9G">aesthetics</a>, these are wider ranging and more diffuse than just clothing, and they do it through social media. Let’s talk social media’s “aesthetic” obsession. From <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cottagecore">Cottagecore</a> to <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Academia">Dark Academia</a>, what does social media’s obsession with creating aesthetics say about us? And why is it such a problem? The aesthetic subcultures folks follow “alpha” (information) flows, and you need money to buy in. You become a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti4PGYISY44&amp;t=89s">VSCO girl</a>” or go “Cottagecore” and it costs you a few dozen hours of analysis and a few thousand dollars of purchases. Now you look like Those Other People. Outside of college campuses etc. the Cottagecore Community doesn’t really meet in reality. This is all online. It’s much the same economic cost as buying into a mid-price NFT project. It’s almost like we’re all trying to anchor in the enormous full emptiness of the internet.</p><p>You can see the same thing in the photography “community” — all the Fuji buyers making “film like” into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKk3MlP9ypk">thing</a>, while the Nikon buyers are showing off their P1000 shots of birds feeding their babies 4.5km away with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sM7882GmuRg">superzoom</a> goodness. It’s markets being used as community mediums. Buy this product to find your&nbsp;people.</p><p>Other people anchor through economics. I think that the heavy slant of the blockchain space towards libertarianism, autism, Asperger’s, Nerd Culture, and the general social blunting that comes with working with machines (I could hardly talk when I was a computer graphics engineer) is partly responsible for this. Crypto-socio-economics — binding people together with economically shared incentives through things like NFTs or DAOs is a nerd response to living in an atomized society. — with people for whom aesthetics don’t appeal, economics may do the job of bringing people together.</p><blockquote>Other people anchor through economics</blockquote><p>So I think what’s happening in the NFT space, and to a limited degree in stuff like L2 chains or crappy little L1s, is a similar kind of social anchoring. “You’ve got $20,000 of Dogecoin? Well we’re 100% on the same team. Go Doge!” Because otherwise people just drift away online. There’s no cost to leaving the community so people do, often silently.</p><p>The only way we know how to answer the question of “who are you?” Is socially.</p><p>Family names. “John of Sudbury”. “Joe Baker”. Given names. I travelled all over America in the 1990s on “@“. The story of “who am I?” was tightly coupled to the social technology of the day: email lists. I don’t think nearly enough work has been done on the “economic sociology” of crypto projects, particularly DAOs and NFT communities. Now that I’m seeing this head-on, it all makes so much more sense. A single framework with aesthetic and “<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/core-words-cottagecore/">-core</a>” cultures, NFTs and DAOs together. This also neatly explains the early adopter communities on Twitter, Instagram and, earlier than that, Flickr (really the first social network for people that made images rather than writing as a way of expressing their identity) — influencers as social leaders: reference point organisers. In ancient times this was one of the functions of soap operas: people who worked in the same office but lived in different communities could gossip about people they both “knew” outside of the workplace, those being the cast of Friends etc — Yes, I know this sounds incredibly dumb. But 30 years ago (!) there were academic publications as people discovered this phenomena!</p><a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communication-zangana-baym-1993.pdf">https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communication-zangana-baym-1993.pdf</a> Who’s writing the equivalent paper today about&nbsp;NFTs?<p>I don’t think nearly enough work has been done on the “economic sociology” of crypto&nbsp;projects</p><p>So the idea that what we have is <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/history-co-operative-movement#:~:text=In%201844%20the%20Rochdale%20Pioneers,surplus%20to%20benefit%20the%20community.">economic responses to social atomization</a> is not a new one but I’m seeing it in a new way because I’ve got it from two sides right now: “aesthetic” culture from YouTube etc. and NFT/DAO from&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>This is almost gendered, women and men.&nbsp;Almost.</p><p>As we have transformed our physical and social environment further and further from the environment that we evolved in, it becomes harder and harder for us to find the true happiness which is harmony between our own nature and nature itself. We love dogs and BBQs beside water. No form of happiness is more universal than a few families and friends gathering to grill food on a beach or by a lake. That’s where we evolved. That’s our native environment at its&nbsp;best.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@leashless/friends-dogs-and-faint-wood-smoke-e596fe387427">Food, fire and friends beside&nbsp;water.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@leashless/friends-dogs-and-faint-wood-smoke-e596fe387427">Friends, dogs, and faint wood smoke</a></p><p>Ape Utopia.</p><p>That’s what people are seeking in these internet cultures, but are they finding&nbsp;it?</p><p>Once, in the ’90s, when the internet was young, we did this with mailing lists and newsgroups, we had little social communities where like-minded people found each other and generated whole new friendship groups that didn’t rely on geography or finding the right pub. There’s even an archived list of all the “<a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/ezines/kr5hou2zh4qtebqk.onion/UXU/UXU-148.TXT">cyberpunk</a>” email lists from the 1990s. Isn’t that amazing? It was all DIY and profoundly uncommercial. but this was basically commodified and destroyed by social media that first co-opted it, then corrupted it by filtering the messages and monetising the interactions, so the groups no longer felt like&nbsp;“home”.</p><blockquote>This was commodified and destroyed by social&nbsp;media</blockquote><p>You can see why an entire generation of innovators latched on to crypto because it seemed like it could, in theory, reinvent that uncommercial sense of online community by owning the commercial aspects collectively, and then offer social solidarity at the “tribal” and potentially even the “municipal” level through larger projects like Ethereum.</p><p>Ethereum Nation.</p><p>But it’s all stretched. We can’t actually live inside of the metaverse. The people who own the same NFTs as you do might be too far away and too alien to babysit your kids. The core biological reality of our lives is only very slightly improved by online community. Life still happens in the real world and this is what’s producing the crazy addictive (often life damaging) effects: it doesn’t matter how much you drink wine if what you need is coffee. The strongest online communities are still only reflections and shadows of “food, fire and friends beside water.” Social media does not give people what they actually need. That’s why we keep scrolling.</p><blockquote>We can’t actually live inside of the metaverse</blockquote><p>People are growing up untethered: fashion doesn’t indicate identity when you can drop $200 at Shein and walk out with an entirely new wardrobe. There’s no social cost to weird hair. There’s no geographic binding after high school really. The idea that what we have is a set of broad pathologies based on the conditions of internet atomization resulting in community inclusion being mediated by products, in other words you have to buy your friends, is fucking brutal. I’ve heard it before, but only understood it for myself now; it is a desperate position for a social monkey to find itself&nbsp;in.</p><blockquote>Community inclusion being mediated by products is fucking&nbsp;brutal</blockquote><p>This is not the utopia you are seeking — it’s “pay to play tribalism”. This is unfortunate. You can see the perfect opportunity for people being exploited: you want to join a tribe and get to know people. You want to make money. The two impulses are joined in the DAO structure: a community you buy into. It’s a little bit like having a cult with elected leadership, or a multi-level marketing scheme which is owned by the members. The social dynamics are very similar to both cults and MLMs. The social dynamics fuse capitalism and society in a new and probably kinda dangerous way.</p><blockquote>It’s “pay to play tribalism”</blockquote><p>Clearly there’s a social binding force — but with that come problems. The combination of social solitary and commerce is unsafe. We cannot make an atomized population powerful with either shallow social organisation or technology. To save the world — and here I’m thinking climate change — we need the most profound de-atomization imaginable (or maybe geoengineering).</p><p>We’re in a&nbsp;maze.</p><p>We’re building technologies without the end goal in sight. What people want at a shallow advertising-driven level and what people need at a “my life is whole and makes sense to me” level are way different. Instagram does not substitute for a better relationship with your sister. And this is the fundamental challenge of the “real world assets” phase of Ethereum. OK, now we can handle real estate on the blockchain in tokenized form. We really can:<a href="http://mattereum.com/land"> http://mattereum.com/land</a> is a real deal and there’s <a href="https://swarm.com/swarm-partners-with-mattereum-to-securitise-real-world-assets-on-chain/">way more</a>&nbsp;coming.</p><blockquote>Instagram does not substitute for a better relationship with your&nbsp;sister</blockquote><p>But can we solve the social problems too? We’re already seeing the broad outlines of this attempt: Network States are “crypto communities do real estate” with kinda strange Silicon Valley logic&nbsp;applied.</p><p>Once you tease out the projects that are the Silicon Valley equivalent of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement">Sovereign Citizen</a> play (i.e. opting out of existing nation state structures to avoid tax and law, while still physically living in the state) what they are is electronic communities organised around money rather than community: the people grew up atomized: never felt community. We get regular pings from people with ambitions of doing community land projects and building physical settlements with crypto finance as an integral part of the start up plan, often with community governance done using DAOs or other crypto voting&nbsp;methods.</p><p>People are reaching.</p><p>This is really the&nbsp;key.</p><p>If we’re going to ship large-scale community-oriented real estate development projects that actually deliver “food, fire and friends beside water” at scale we’re going to need to figure out the sociological issues which have made modern community so hard. Winding up a Network State that failed is going to be much harder than winding up a company or shuttering a community.</p><p>People think they want tokenized real estate. They need community. They won’t be happy with tokenized real estate unless it delivers community.</p><p>That is part of why there is so much interest in DAOs and Network States. People want to be reconnected to each other. That’s the fundamental human drive at the heart of all of this. Yes, professional real estate clients want faster transactions and so on. Yes, Mattereum can deliver that. But their clients want community. The enormous cultural push towards de-atomizing society and returning to interconnected forms is unstoppable: it is human nature returning to being human after centuries of industrial oppression.</p><p>Post-industrial society is like post-war society: an attempt to return to&nbsp;peace.</p><blockquote>Professional real estate clients want faster transactions but their clients want community</blockquote><p>As we move down the pathway towards tokenized community real estate projects, whether they be Network States or start-up villages or just plain old electronic communes, we’re going to wind up having to try and bring wisdom about community, not just the <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> legals.</p><p>It’s not like I haven’t lived in communities and studied them in detail for more than 30&nbsp;years.</p><p>I do have grounded opinions about how to do this, and I think if we invested in researchers and worked closely with clients we could actually deliver functional community templates. And that is, after all, probably the highest good that <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> can deliver to retail customers: better arrangements for buying their houses and managing shared assets with their neighbours.</p><blockquote>The highest good that Mattereum can deliver: better arrangements for buying houses and managing shared&nbsp;assets</blockquote><p>Professional finance needs precision and efficiency. But homeowners need warm relations. Bad governance and bad finance produce stone cold grinding poverty: Homeowners Associations and sharecropping. If we actually go into this tokenized real estate thing with a clear sense of the end goals in mind it might be a lot easier than we think: nobody’s tried with lawyers. “Good fences make good neighbours”, and a contract is nothing but a fence of written words. The legal structures are all there: there’s no reason for Homeowners Associations to be terrible.</p><p>There’s no reason shared ownership has to be predatory. Societies do not have to be the way they are; we can change&nbsp;them.</p><p>So — what does this all mean? Well, my parents’ generation were part of the post-war economic boom. The economy was buoyant and everyone, whatever their income was, floated up on the tide. Until, basically, the 1980s; Thatcher, Reagan and neo-liberal economics, which, as a matter of policy, was “every person for themselves” — there’s no such thing as society. Those who had money were able to leverage more at the expense of those with less, because money translates to power, allowing them to become obscenely rich while everyone else’s income stagnated. We weren’t going to do better than our parents, the first generation in a century to say&nbsp;that.</p>see also <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/</a><p>For my parents, stability and community was home, family, the workplace. Young people today are priced out of owning a house, or even stably renting one, there’s no expectation of long-term jobs or even a single career through your working life, let alone staying in the same place. But they still want “food, fire and friends beside water” (and also cats) and where they are looking for it is online, but the neo-liberals got there first and have commodified, monetized and corrupted the will for online community, so they end up basically with “pay-to-play” friends. Is it any wonder people are starting to have romantic relationships with AI Chatbots? The blockchain offers a way round that, a means to create a self-generated trusted community, to build structures that are egalitarian, supportive and nurturing through DAOs and similar. To do this needs more than good will, it needs law, it needs appropriate fences to keep out the thieves, scammers and profiteers. The current global operating system is broken, its head has been severed and it is running on reflexes, not quite aware it is dead yet. Politicians pull the levers and wonder why they no longer work, resorting to “dead cat” distractions to hide the fact they have no functioning policies.</p><p>Nettles need to be grasped and the <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming">rough beast slouching towards Bethlehem</a> needs to take&nbsp;form.</p><p>There are ways forward. We need to build&nbsp;them.</p><p>Next, I will take a look at possible ways to do this — watch this&nbsp;space!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-blockchain-save-the-young-from-themselves-0639b24b335c">CAN THE BLOCKCHAIN SAVE THE YOUNG (from themselves)?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Data vs. disaster - Can you crack the code to safer roads and traffic accidents in Spain’s region of Catalunya?</p><p>2024 marks the 3rd year of the Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Program initiative. ‘Road to Safety: Traffic Accident Analysis’ is the first data challenge in 2024. The challenge launches today Jan 11, 2024, with a deadline to participate ending Jan 30, 2024, 23:59:59 UTC. Access to the challenge description and submission guidelines can be found on the <a href="https://bit.ly/48HMB77">Desights</a> platform.</p><p>‘Road to Safety: Traffic Accident Analysis’ is based on over 20,000 traffic accident specifications in Catalunya from 2010–2021. The dataset set includes 57 different recorded metrics that dominate each column header in the dataset. This is a unique opportunity for data people to dive into real-world data and uncover insights that could shape the future of road safety in this&nbsp;region.</p> Challenge Overview <p>Objective: This challenge aims to dive deep and discover trends that cause traffic accidents in Catalunya. In this, you will also develop predictive models for future traffic accidents in the region. To execute, participants will need to analyze trends and patterns in historical data to identify key drivers of emissions in each region, accident type, and cause. Then, these findings will apply to your final&nbsp;report.</p><p>Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns and propose solutions.</p><p>Data Set: Access to the comprehensive dataset of traffic accidents in Catalunya is available for download It is available to download from the <a href="https://bit.ly/48HMB77">Ocean Market, here</a> via the Mumbai Test Network (Polygon Testnet).</p><p>Column headers are defined in English. Row-by-row details are composed of different integer and string data points. Some are recorded in English, Catalin, or numbered.</p><p>Each field in the dataset is defined&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/3HfoLTQ">here</a>.</p><p>Prizes: For 2024, we’ve increased the prize pool to $6,500 USDC (payable in OCEAN) per challenge.

<p>ID Document Verification was introduced to solve many of the issues that raise from services that require higher levels of authentication. Certain services require more reliable authentication methods, which offers higher assurance of the user’s identity. However, this can cause issues, especially for users of different nationalities. Lower-level authentication methods can often be used by all users regardless of their country of origin, whereas in the case of higher-level methods, it is not always the case. However, with the use of ID Document Verification it becomes easier for all users to prove their identity. In this blog, I will explore the basics surrounding ID Document Verification and some of the main features that support these solutions.</p>
 What is ID Document Verification? 
<p>The basic concept is that – instead of using a &nbsp;user ID and password to sign into an eService, I identify myself by scanning my identity document and taking a selfie or a video clip to prove who I am. I can scan the document by taking a picture of it according to instructions given by the service provider. The service uses different highly sophisticated AI (Artificial Intelligence) driven technologies to verify that the person in the picture or a video matches the one shown in the document.</p>
<p>There are several ID Document Verification service providers in the markets and as you can imagine there are some differences in the principles of how these services function. You might be interested to know how many different countries are supported by the solution, which ID documents are accepted, whether is there a need to install an app, is ID Document chip scanning supported, where is the ID document information stored, what type of fraud detection systems the solution uses and what is the price per authentication transaction, especially during the initial registration.</p>
<p>The most common ID documents accepted by these services are driver’s licenses, national ID cards and passports but depending on the country I am from there can be over ten different documents including residence permits and work permits among others that I can use to prove my identity. Depending on the service provider I can scan the identity documents using a web browser-based or app-based user interface. The result is the same, after the initial ID document scanning procedure I get access to the eService. But what happens when I want to access the same eService again?</p>
<p>The benefit of a browser-based version is that I don’t have to install a new app on my smart device. Generally, it can be a good solution for a one-time authentication. However, if the goal is to reuse my identity again without re-registration, then my ID document information must be sent to the service provider’s servers. Even though the information is stored in an encrypted format, many users do not necessarily like the idea that non-governmental 3rd party operator stores this kind of information in their servers.</p>
<p>The benefit of an app-based solution is that it provides me with the possibility to store the scanned identity document information in an encrypted format on my smart device. I have the option to remove this information at any point I want. However, many eService providers do not want to ask their customers to install additional apps on their smart devices.</p>
 How reliable is the ID Document Verification? 
<p>Can ID Document Verification methods be considered strong authentication methods? Often, strong authentication methods utilise at least two factors from the list of something the user knows (e.g. password, pin code, answer to a security question), something the user has (e.g. security token, digital certificate, an ID card, a &nbsp;phone with a built-in hardware token, software token), and something the user is (e.g. typically biometrics such as fingerprint, iris scan, vein scan etc.).</p>
<p>ID Document Verification uses a variety of AI-driven fraud detection mechanisms, such as face matching to confirm that the person who took the selfie or a video is the same as on the document. Texture analysis makes sure that the pictures or videos are genuine and not copies. In addition, features such as audio processing, face tracking and mouth tracking – where they have to say some specific words, turn my head, blink my eyes etc. – can be utilised to further verify that we have the right person trying to access the service. And if the algorithm is still not sure if it is the right person, some solutions provide an option to ask a trained employee to verify the user and make the final decision. From this perspective, we can say that ID Document Verification Authentication methods can provide strong authentication.</p>
<p>However, as an example, in Finland the official strong authentication methods include BankID, national ID cards (requires a card reader) and Mobile PKI (Mobiilivarmenne in Finnish). These methods have gone through a complex certification process to prove the maturity of the solution. This is indicated by using a Level of Assurance (LoA) levels. LoA levels use the international 4-step scale and the EU 3-step scale in parallel in the following way:</p>



International scale
EU scale
Notes


LoA 1
Not used
(EU uses 3-step scale)


LoA 2
eIDAS Low



LoA 3
eIDAS Substantial
BankID, Mobile PKI


LoA 4
eIDAS High
National Identity Card



<p>eIDAS = Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services</p>
<p>Since ID Document Verification method vendors are private companies, they do not have such LoA certifications. From a security point of view, it is important to make sure that the vendor follows the latest developments in the standards and technology used to identify fraudulent documents.</p>
<p>Also, it is good to notice that in some European countries, it is possible to open a bank account online using ID Document Verification authentication, indicating that these banks trust their selected vendor’s solution – which is a noteworthy seal of approval.</p>
<p>One way to improve the reliability of the scanning procedure is to scan the microchip in the ID Document. The chips inside of passports and national ID cards include user-specific certificates that are very difficult to forge, thus they can be used to increase the reliability of the document verification procedure. To do this, I have to make sure I have an NFC (Near-Field Communication) chip in my smart device. In addition, some solutions can run backend queries to external databases to validate documents’ ID attributes and execute fraud evaluation against fraud databases.</p>
 Which services can use Identity Document Verification? 
<p>While ID Document Verification authentication methods have often been used in banking services, there are also many other services where they are very useful. This is especially useful where the eService requires a higher assurance of identity verification but the users cannot use the official strong authentication methods of the given country.</p>
<p>One good example of this is the universities. Very often these educational institutes have foreign students and teachers who need to authenticate themselves to access the university eServices to attend online lectures, examinations etc. Username and password methods are just not strong enough in these cases, but reliable online authentication methods are not available. This type of issue can be solved with ID Document Verification Authentication. Notice that the new European Digital Identity (EUDI), which is a part of the eIDAS regulation will allow EU-level cross-border strong authentication services. It will solve this issue for people who have EU-level digital identities. Read more about it here: <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/">https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/</a></p>
<p>In addition, several other eServices can use ID Document Verification for more convenient, passwordless authentication. Instead of writing my username and password I can just take a selfie (biometric facial recognition) or scan a QR code to access the service. Also, if the service has a password, I could reset it by taking a selfie.</p>
<p>Integrating an ID Document Verification Authentication service with a CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management) solution such as Ubisecure’s Identity Platform makes the onboarding of new users frictionless. This type of solution can utilise the registration form autofill feature during the initial phase of the procedure. Many of the required attributes can be scanned directly from the ID document, thus users do not have to type them in manually.</p>
<p>The integration procedure can be established using the tools provided by the CIAM system. If the ID Document Verification Authentication service supports standard authentication protocols, such as SAML or OIDC, then it is a very straightforward procedure. If the service uses proprietary APIs, then a separate adapter needs to be created to establish communication between the CIAM and the service. This type of solution allows you to easily take the ID Document Verification Authentication service to use for all of your eServices with just a few mouse clicks.</p>
 Pros and cons of ID Document Verification 
<p>Below, I have listed some positives and negatives of the ID Document Verification Authentication services. It is good to remember that the solutions vary between different vendors. So, depending on your needs you can choose a vendor that fulfils your requirements.</p>



Positives
Negatives


+ International authentication method, not limited to one national ID
– Chip scanning requires a phone with NFC functionality


+ Passwordless authentication utilising:<p></p>
<p>+ QR-codes</p>
<p>+ Selfies</p>
<p>+ Videos</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Initial registration can sometimes be cumbersome


+ Difficult to forge (especially the methods based on chip scanning)<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Not all countries have centralised registries for attribute verification<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Possibility to confirm scanned information from external registries<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Cannot cover 100% of customers. Some manual customer service processes still required for certain users<p></p>
<p>– The service can cover a maximum of just over 200 countries at best (depending on the service&nbsp; provider)</p>
<p>– Not all users have the smart devices required available</p>
<p>– Not everyone has the documents required</p>
<p>– Not everyone has the know-how to complete the registration process</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ The possibility of doing a password reset using a recheck of a selfie or a video<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Initial authentication can be a bit expensive (for the eService provider)<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Frictionless onboarding of new customers with registration form auto-filling when combined with CIAM<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
– Some solutions require the user’s ID Document information to be stored in an external DBs<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


+ Good for services that are subject to stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) requirements.
– There can be differing levels of accuracy different skin tones, genders and ages, enquire with your vendor about bias mitigation.

<p>As we have seen, the official strong authentication methods are usually national-level solutions. Even with the EUDI service, we can offer only EU-level solutions for the problem. The ID Document Verification Authentication services can offer an option for strong authentication for global users. In addition, it can simplify the onboarding processes and provide passwordless sign-in to eServices. Its AI-powered biometric identification engines for facial recognition and anti-spoofing technologies make it a safe option for a variety of eServices.</p>

<p>Look behind the scenes of any slick mobile application or commercial interface, and deep beneath the integration and service layers of any major enterprise’s application architecture, you will likely find mainframes running the show.</p>



<p>Critical applications and systems of record are using these core systems as part of a hybrid infrastructure. Any interruption in their ongoing operation could be disastrous to the continued operational integrity of the business. So much so that many companies are afraid to make substantive changes to them.</p>



<p>But change is inevitable, as technical debt is piling up. To achieve business agility and keep up with competitive challenges and customer demand, companies must absolutely modernize these applications. Instead of putting off change, leaders should seek new ways to accelerate digital transformation in their hybrid strategy.</p>



 <a></a>Don’t blame COBOL for modernization delays 



<p>The biggest obstacle to mainframe modernization is probably a talent crunch. Many of the mainframe and application experts who created and appended enterprise COBOL codebases over the years have likely either moved on or are retiring soon.</p>



<p>Scarier still, the next generation of talent will be hard to recruit, as newer computer science graduates who learned Java and newer languages won’t naturally picture themselves doing mainframe application development. For them, the work may not seem as sexy as mobile app design or as agile as cloud native development. In many ways, this is a rather unfair predisposition.</p>



<p>COBOL was created way before object orientation was even a thing—much less service orientation or cloud computing. With a lean set of commands, it shouldn’t be a &nbsp;complicated language for newer developers to learn or understand. And there’s no reason why mainframe applications wouldn’t benefit from agile development and smaller, incremental releases within a DevOps-style automated pipeline.</p>



<p>Figuring out what different teams have done with COBOL over the years is what makes it so hard to manage change. Developers made endless additions and logical loops to a procedural system that must be checked out and updated as a whole, rather than as components or loosely coupled services.</p>



<p>With code and programs woven together on the mainframe in this fashion, interdependencies and potential points of failure are too complex and numerous for even skilled developers to untangle. This makes COBOL app development feel more daunting than need be, causing many organizations to look for alternatives off the mainframe prematurely.</p>



 <a></a>Overcoming the limitations of generative AI 



<p>We’ve seen numerous hypes around generative AI (or GenAI) lately due to the widespread availability of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and consumer-grade visual AI image generators.</p>



<p>While many cool possibilities are emerging in this space, there’s a nagging “hallucination factor” of LLMs when applied to critical business workflows. When AIs are trained with content found on the internet, they may often provide convincing and believable dialogss, but not fully accurate responses. For instance, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-courts-e15023d7e6fdf4f099aa122437dbb59b">ChatGPT recently cited imaginary case law</a> precedents in a federal court, which could result in sanctions for the lazy lawyer who used it.</p>



<p>There are similar issues in trusting a chatbot AI to code a business application. While a generalized LLM may provide reasonable general suggestions for how to improve an app or easily churn out a standard enrollment form or code an asteroids-style game, the functional integrity of a business application depends heavily on what machine learning data the AI model was trained with.</p>



<p>Fortunately, production-oriented AI research was going on for years before ChatGPT arrived. IBM® has been building deep learning and inference models under their watsonx™ brand, and as a mainframe originator and innovator, they have built observational GenAI models trained and tuned on COBOL-to-Java transformation.</p>



<p>Their latest <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-code-assistant-z">IBM watsonx™ Code Assistant for Z</a> solution uses both rules-based processes and generative AI to accelerate mainframe application modernization. Now, development teams can lean on a very practical and enterprise-focused use of GenAI and automation to assist developers in application discovery, auto-refactoring and COBOL-to-Java transformation.</p>



 <a></a>Mainframe application modernization in three steps 



<p>To make mainframe applications as agile and malleable to change as any other object-oriented or distributed application, organizations should make them top-level features of the continuous delivery pipeline. IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z helps developers bring COBOL code into the application modernization lifecycle through three steps:</p>



 
 Discovery. Before modernizing, developers need to figure out where attention is needed. First, the solution takes an inventory of all programs on the mainframe, mapping out architectural flow diagrams for each, with all of their data inputs and outputs. The visual flow model makes it easier for developers and architects to spot dependencies and obvious dead ends within the code base. 



 Refactoring. This phase is all about breaking up monoliths into a more consumable form. &nbsp;IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z looks across long-running program code bases to understand the intended business logic of the system. By decoupling commands and data, such as discrete processes, the solution refactors the COBOL code into modular business service components. 



 Transformation. Here’s where the magic of an LLM tuned on enterprise COBOL-to-Java conversion can make a difference. The GenAI model translates COBOL program components into Java classes, allowing true object orientation and separation of concerns, so multiple teams can work in a parallel, agile fashion. Developers can then focus on refining code in Java in an IDE, with the AI providing look-ahead suggestions, much like a co-pilot feature you would see in other development tools. 
 



 <a></a>The Intellyx take 



<p>We are generally skeptical of most vendor claims about AI, as often they are simply automation by another name.</p>



<p>Compared to learning all the nuances of the English language and speculating on the factual basis of words and paragraphs, mastering the syntax and structures of languages like COBOL and Java seems right up GenAI’s alley.</p>



<p>Generative AI models designed for enterprises like IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z can reduce modernization effort and costs for the world’s most resource-constrained organizations. Applications on known platforms with thousands of lines of code are ideal training grounds for generative AI models like IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z.</p>



<p>Even in resource constrained environments, GenAI can help teams clear modernization hurdles and augment the capabilities of even newer mainframe developers to make significant improvements in agility and resiliency atop their most critical core business applications.</p>

<p>While still in its early stages, generative AI can provide powerful optimization capabilities to manufacturers in the areas that matter most to them: productivity, product quality, efficiency, worker safety and regulatory compliance. Generative AI can work with other AI models to increase accuracy and performance, such as augmenting images to improve quality evaluation of a computer vision model. With generative AI, there are fewer “misreads” and overall better-quality assessments.</p>



<p>Let’s look at five specific ways IBM® delivers expert solutions that have helped real clients incorporate generative AI into future operations planning.</p>



 1. Training validation 



<p>Worker training is an important part of creating a safe, efficient manufacturing environment, but it’s a time drain on managers. Generative AI can watch videos and track worker training steps, including noting specific events and validating proper completion. Generative AI then can summarize the results, including time stamps for managers &nbsp;to review the event—saving time for everyone. In highly regulated industries, having “proof” beyond a certificate will improve workforce readiness and operations. Early testing suggests generative AI could reduce training time by about 30% and boost training completion and certification by 25%.</p>



 2. Assisting workers accessing SOPs 



<p>Workers accessing standard operating procedures (SOPs) often have tons of questions, especially in complex plants, which can have more than 3,000 SOPs. Getting quick answers with visual and audible support from generative AI can improve operational efficiencies by around 15% and increase end-user problem solving by as much as 90%. Being able to query and confirm operational steps reduces time consumed by other workers, increases the confidence of junior staff and improves overall adherence to procedures.</p>



 3. Verifying line set-up 



<p>In some industries, set-up and startup can be very complex tasks, which can lead to significant economic consequences if not handled correctly. One example is setting up line clearance in biopharma manufacturing, where properly executed line clearance can mean the difference between a high-value batch of medicine sold or costly scrap. Generative AI can review videos to provide automated verification of manufacturing line set-ups, checking and clearing the correct production run setup. Coupled with video and computer vision, generative AI can proactively augment workers’ manual checks, substantially reducing rework and decreasing set-up errors by about 75%.&nbsp;</p>



 4. Enhancing quality assurance processes 



<p>Many industries are already using AI and computer vision to check quality. Generative AI can improve the fidelity of images that are then reviewed for quality assurance. Identifying and summarizing defects with mitigation strategies helps improve overall first-pass quality and could drive an 80% increase in quality error detection over other methods. Enabling workers to quickly tweak a manufacturing setting to eliminate quality issues can greatly lower the subsequent number of quality issues, improve throughput and enhance market reputation.</p>



 5. Maintaining regulatory compliance 



<p>Regulatory fines are no joke and can cost manufacturers millions of dollars each year. And as more countries create regulatory bodies and issue regulations, global businesses face an ever-changing, complex environment. The ability to check current processes and policies against regulatory databases for needed updates will increase adherence, reduce fines and avoid potential public embarrassment of missed requirements. Generative AI can drive a 25% reduction in fines and a 60% improvement in compliance using real-time text and spoken-query access to regulatory bodies to assist end users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now is the time to maximize your use of generative AI, and the experts at IBM Consulting® can help you quickly and confidently&nbsp;design and scale cutting edge AI solutions and automation across your&nbsp;business.&nbsp;​</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the convergent fields of computer and data science focused on building machines with human intelligence to perform tasks that would previously have required a human being. For example, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, language understanding and more. Instead of relying on explicit instructions from a programmer, AI systems can learn from data, allowing them to handle complex problems (as well as simple-but-repetitive tasks) and improve over time.</p>



<p>Today’s AI technology has a range of use cases across various industries; businesses use AI to minimize human error, reduce high costs of operations, provide real-time data insights and improve the customer experience, among many other applications. As such, it represents a significant shift in the way we approach computing, creating systems that can improve workflows and enhance elements of everyday life.</p>



<p>But even with the myriad benefits of AI, it does have noteworthy disadvantages when compared to traditional programming methods.&nbsp;AI development and deployment can come with data privacy concerns, job displacements and cybersecurity risks, not to mention the massive technical undertaking of ensuring AI systems behave as intended.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll discuss how AI technology functions and lay out the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence as they compare to traditional computing methods.</p>



 What is artificial intelligence and how does it work? 



<p>AI operates on three fundamental components: data, algorithms and computing power.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Data: AI systems learn and make decisions based on data, and they require large quantities of data to train effectively, especially in the case of machine learning (ML) models. Data is often divided into three categories: training data (helps the model learn), validation data (tunes the model) and test data (assesses the model’s performance). For optimal performance, AI models should receive data from a diverse datasets (e.g., text, images, audio and more), which enables the system to generalize its learning to new, unseen data. 



 Algorithms: Algorithms are the sets of rules AI systems use to process data and make decisions. The category of AI algorithms includes ML algorithms, which learn and make predictions and decisions without explicit programming. AI can also work from deep learning algorithms, a subset of ML that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks (ANNs)—hence the “deep” descriptor—to model high-level abstractions within big data infrastructures. And reinforcement learning algorithms enable an agent to learn behavior by performing functions and receiving punishments and rewards based on their correctness, iteratively adjusting the model until it’s fully trained. 



 Computing power: AI algorithms often necessitate significant computing resources to process such large quantities of data and run complex algorithms, especially in the case of deep learning. Many organizations rely on specialized hardware, like graphic processing units (GPUs), to streamline these processes.&nbsp; 
 



<p>AI systems also tend to fall in two broad categories:</p>



 
 Artificial Narrow Intelligence, also called narrow AI or weak AI, performs specific tasks like image or voice recognition. Virtual assistants like Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, IBM watsonx and even OpenAI’s ChatGPT are examples of narrow AI systems.  



 Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), or Strong AI, can perform any intellectual task a human can perform; it can understand, learn, adapt and work from knowledge across domains. AGI, however, is still just a theoretical concept. 
 



 How does traditional programming work? 



<p>Unlike AI programming, traditional programming requires the programmer to write explicit instructions for the computer to follow in every possible scenario; the computer then executes the instructions to solve a problem or perform a task. It’s a deterministic approach, akin to a recipe, where the computer executes step-by-step instructions to achieve the desired result.</p>



<p>The traditional approach is well-suited for clearly defined problems with a limited number of possible outcomes, but it’s often impossible to write rules for every single scenario when tasks are complex or demand human-like perception (as in image recognition, natural language processing, etc.). This is where AI programming offers a clear edge over rules-based programming methods.</p>



 What are the pros and cons of AI (compared to traditional computing)? 



<p>The real-world potential of AI is immense. Applications of AI include diagnosing diseases, personalizing social media feeds, executing sophisticated data analyses for weather modeling and powering the chatbots that handle our customer support requests. AI-powered robots can even assemble cars and minimize radiation from wildfires.</p>



<p>As with any technology, there are advantages and disadvantages of AI, when compared to traditional programing technologies. Aside from foundational differences in how they function, AI and traditional programming also differ significantly in terms of programmer control, data handling, scalability and availability.</p>



 
 Control and transparency: Traditional programming offers developers full control over the logic and behavior of software, allowing for precise customization and predictable, consistent outcomes. And if a program doesn’t behave as expected, developers can trace back through the codebase to identify and correct the issue. AI systems, particularly complex models like deep neural networks, can be hard to control and interpret. They often work like “black boxes,” where the input and output are known, but the process the model uses to get from one to the other is unclear. This lack of transparency can be problematic in industries that prioritize process and decision-making explainability (like healthcare and finance). 



 Learning and data handling: Traditional programming is rigid; it relies on structured data to execute programs and typically struggles to process unstructured data. In order to “teach” a program new information, the programmer must manually add new data or adjust processes. Traditionally coded programs also struggle with independent iteration. In other words, they may not be able to accommodate unforeseen scenarios without explicit programming for those cases. Because AI systems learn from vast amounts of data, they’re better suited for processing unstructured data like images, videos and natural language text. AI systems can also learn continually from new data and experiences (as in machine learning), allowing them to improve their performance over time and making them especially useful in dynamic environments where the best possible solution can evolve over time. 



 Stability and scalability: Traditional programming is stable. Once a program is written and debugged, it will perform operations the exact same way, every single time. However, the stability of rules-based programs comes at the expense of scalability. Because traditional programs can only learn through explicit programming interventions, they require programmers to write code at scale in order to scale up operations. This process can prove unmanageable, if not impossible, for many organizations. AI programs offer more scalability than traditional programs but with less stability. The automation and continuous learning features of AI-based programs enable developers to scale processes quickly and with relative ease, representing one of the key advantages of ai. However, the improvisational nature of AI systems means that programs may not always provide consistent, appropriate responses. 



 Efficiency and availability: Rules-based computer programs can provide 24/7 availability, but sometimes only if they have human workers to operate them around the clock.  
 



<p>AI technologies can run 24/7 without human intervention so that business operations can run continuously. Another of the benefits of artificial intelligence is that AI systems can automate boring or repetitive jobs (like data entry), freeing up employees’ bandwidth for higher-value work tasks and lowering the company’s payroll costs. It’s worth mentioning, however, that automation can have significant job loss implications for the workforce.&nbsp;For instance, some companies have transitioned to using digital assistants to triage employee reports, instead of delegating such tasks to a human resources department. Organizations will need to find ways to incorporate their existing workforce into new workflows enabled by productivity gains from the incorporation of AI into operations.</p>



 Maximize the advantages of artificial intelligence with IBM Watson 



<p>Omdia projects that the global AI market will be worth USD 200 billion by 2028.¹ That means businesses should expect dependency on AI technologies to increase, with the complexity of enterprise IT systems increasing in kind. But with the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">IBM watsonx™ AI and data platform</a>, organizations have a powerful tool in their toolbox for scaling AI.</p>

<p>Hybrid cloud has become the <a href="https://filecache.mediaroom.com/mr5mr_ibmnewsroom/194056/IBM%2BTransformation%2BIndex%2B-%2BState%2Bof%2BCloud.pdf">dominant approach for enterprise cloud strategies</a>, but it comes with complexity and concerns over integration, security and skills. To address these concerns the industry is embracing container runtime environments to abstract away infrastructure. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform">Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RH OCP)</a> has emerged as a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-named-leader-2023-gartnerr-magic-quadranttm-container-management">leading solution</a> for supporting the application development lifecycle, provisioning and managing container images and workloads into a platform for containerized applications and ecosystem. RH OCP provides a common deployment, control and management environment for workloads across a diverse set of infrastructures that underpin a hybrid cloud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In brief, Red Hat OpenShift is the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-named-leader-2023-gartnerr-magic-quadranttm-container-management">leading hybrid cloud application platform</a> built on open-source innovation designed to build, deploy and run applications at massive scale, wherever you want.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hybrid cloud is also forcing a significant rethinking of how to secure and protect data and assets. As such, the industry continues to move away from traditional moat-and-castle strategies towards zero trust-based architectures that micro-segment environments to minimize attack surfaces.&nbsp;</p>







<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/confidential-computing">Confidential computing</a> is an emerging foundational capability that enables the protection of data-in-use. The protection of data-at-rest and data-in-motion has been a standard practice in the industry for decades; however, with advent of hybrid and decentralized management of infrastructure it has now become imperative to equally protect data-in-use. More specifically, confidential computing uses hardware-based security-rich enclaves to allow a tenant to host workloads and data on untrusted infrastructure while ensuring that their workloads and data cannot be read or modified by anyone with privileged access to that infrastructure. This is typically referred to as technical assurance that can summarily be described as a provider or person cannot access your data. One can contrast technical assurance to the more commonly used operational assurance that provides the lesser guarantee that a provider or person only promises they will not access your data, even though they technically could. As compromised credential threats as well as insider threats have become a <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/category/cybersecurity/">dominant cause of data-security incidents</a>, technical assurance has become a priority for securing sensitive and regulated workloads whether the latter are running in traditional on-premises or in a public cloud data centers.&nbsp;</p>







<p>IBM and RedHat have recognized the requirement for technical assurance in a hybrid cloud platform. They have worked as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) <a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/confidential-containers/">Confidential Containers</a> open-source community to address this concern <a href="https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/blogs/louisa-muschal/2023/12/04/confidential-containers-at-enterprise-scale-and-se">and are continuously working together to make confidential container technology available.</a> The latter marries security-rich enclave technology such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/O158MBWG">IBM Secure Execution for Linux</a> with Kubernetes-based OpenShift to allow for the deployment of containers into secured pods, providing all the advantages of a ubiquitous RH OCP operational experience while also designed to protect a tenant’s containers from privileged user access. Confidential containers go beyond prior efforts at solving this problem by isolating the container not only from infrastructure administrator but also from the Kubernetes administrator. This provides the tenant with the best of both worlds where they can fully leverage the abstraction of a managed OpenShift to develop-once-deploy-anywhere while being able to deploy data and workloads with technical assurance into a fully private and isolated enclave even if the latter is hosted and managed on third-party infrastructure.</p>



<p>IBM is further adding additional zero trust principles designed to increase security and ease of use with the <a href="https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpieces/pdfs/sg248555.pdf">IBM Hyper Protect Platform</a>.</p>







<p>This unique capability is designed for workloads that have strong data sovereignty, regulatory or data privacy requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, confidential containers play a key role across industries engineered to secure data and foster innovation. Some example use cases to highlight:&nbsp;</p>



 Confidential AI: leverage trustworthy AI and while ensuring the integrity of the models and confidentiality of data&nbsp; 



<p>Organizations leveraging AI models often encounter challenges related to the privacy and security of the data used for training and the integrity of the AI models themselves. Protecting the confidentiality of proprietary algorithms and sensitive training data is crucial. In many cases multiple party must collaborate and share sensitive data or models between each other to gain valuable AI-based insights. On the other hand, the valuable data needed to gain those insights has to stay confidential and is only allowed to be shared with certain parties or no third parties at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, is there a way to gain insights of valuable data through AI without the need to expose the data set or the AI model (LLM, ML, DL) to another party?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Hat OpenShift, empowered by Confidential Containers based on IBM Secure Execution, provides a confidential AI platform. This safeguards both the AI model and the training data, allowing organizations to deploy machine learning models without compromising intellectual property or exposing sensitive information. By mitigating attack vectors through security-rich containers, Confidential Containers ensure the integrity of AI models, enhancing trust in AI applications.&nbsp;</p>



 Healthcare: enabling health tech while keeping patient data private&nbsp; 



<p>In the healthcare industry, the protection of sensitive patient data is paramount. With the increasing adoption of digital health records and collaborative research initiatives, there’s a growing concern about securing patient information from unauthorized access and potential breaches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Hat OpenShift, leveraging Confidential Containers, establishes a security-rich enclave for healthcare applications. So that records and sensitive medical data are encrypted and processed securely, protecting against data leaks and unauthorized access. By safeguarding both the code and data, healthcare organizations are able to confidently embrace digital transformation while keeping their patients’ privacy by adopting data privacy-enhancing technologies, such as Confidential Compute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is designed to enable multiple use cases in the healthcare industry, one being secure multi-party collaboration between different institutions as shown in the following example.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Financial services: innovate customer experience while keeping sensitive information secure and stay compliant&nbsp; 



<p>Financial institutions face constant threats to their critical data and financial transactions. The industry demands a secure infrastructure that can protect sensitive financial information, prevent fraud and ensure regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Hat OpenShift with confidential containers provides a fortified environment for financial services applications. This ensures that financial data and transactions are processed within security-rich enclaves, shielding them from external threats. By safeguarding code and data integrity, confidential containers on OpenShift helps financial institutions meet stringent regulatory requirements and enhances the overall security posture of their digital infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



 Enhancing digital rights management and intellectual property protection through confidential compute-protected tokenization&nbsp; 



<p>In today’s digital landscape, the risk associated with stolen tokens or unauthorized signing of corresponding contracts, such as intellectual property and digital rights tokens, poses significant challenges. The potential financial losses and threats to the integrity of digital ecosystems demand a robust solution that goes beyond conventional security measures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Confidential compute offers a practical solution to the risks associated with stolen tokens by incorporating confidential compute technology into the tokenization process, which is designed to establish end-to-end security. This approach ensures that sensitive operations occur in a secure and isolated environment, safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of digital assets throughout their lifecycle. Confidential compute is engineered to prevent malicious actors from deciphering or manipulating sensitive information even if they gain access to the underlying infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementing security-rich token platforms through confidential compute delivers tangible benefits. Digital rights holders can manage and monetize their intellectual property without the constant concern of piracy or unauthorized distribution. Stakeholders in various industries gain the ability to create, trade and enforce digital contracts with increased confidence in the security of their tokenized assets. Financial implications tied to token theft are significantly minimized, reducing the risk of revenue loss due to piracy or counterfeiting. This not only protects the economic interests of content creators and distributors but also promotes a more trustworthy digital ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, the adoption of confidential compute in the tokenization process addresses the crucial challenge of the expanding set of use cases from financial assets, real estate and to much larger scale tokens securing digital rights and intellectual property. The outcome is a shift towards more security-rich token platforms, providing content creators, distributors and consumers the confidence to engage in digital transactions while ensuring the sustained growth and integrity of the digital economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One example of growing use for tokens is online gaming. Confidential compute’s integration into tokenization safeguards in-game assets like virtual currencies and items. This is designed to promote heightened security, minimizing the financial risks and disruptions caused by stolen tokens in the dynamic landscape of online gaming.&nbsp;</p>



 Sovereign cloud: enhance data security to enable data privacy and sovereignty&nbsp; 



<p>National security and data sovereignty concerns drive the need for a secure hybrid cloud infrastructure that is designed to ensure that critical data and applications are not subject to unauthorized access or foreign jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Hat OpenShift, with confidential container capabilities, supports the implementation of sovereign clouds. By establishing secure containers, it enables nations to host critical applications and data within a protected environment, promoting data sovereignty and protecting against external threats. This solution provides a trusted platform for government agencies and critical infrastructure, fostering national security in the digital age.&nbsp;</p>



 Zero Trust SaaS: succeed at your SaaS transformation while keeping your client’s data private by applying built-in zero trust principles&nbsp; 



<p>As a SaaS provider aiming to offer scalable solutions to target customers with sensitive data or regulatory requirements, the challenge lies in providing cloud-based services without compromising the security and confidentiality of clients’ data. The need for a comprehensive Zero Trust framework becomes crucial to assure clients that their sensitive information remains inaccessible, not only by the SaaS provider but also by the underlying cloud infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Hat OpenShift, fortified with confidential containers and integrated with Zero Trust as a service, revolutionizes the approach to Zero Trust SaaS from the provider’s standpoint. This solution helps that the SaaS provider, the cloud provider, IaaS Admin, and Kubernetes Admin have zero access to clients’ data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The absence of isolation between different clusters within the cloud environment not only helps to optimize costs but also streamlines operational efficiency. Simultaneously, the isolation at the pod level within each cluster’s namespace enhances security, contributing to reduced certification audit efforts and reinforcing the SaaS provider’s commitment to data integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the implementation of multi-party Zero Trust allows clients and 4th party ISVs to run confidential workloads as containers without direct access to the underlying data. This innovative approach not only meets the stringent security requirements of clients but also positions the SaaS provider as a trusted partner capable of delivering scalable and security-rich solutions for clients with sensitive data or regulatory constraints.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Warm or cold, good or bad, global climate constantly changes in various ways. This data challenge used carbon emission rates sorted by each country to prove or debunk common climate change assumptions with data science. Understanding trends of the past and simulating future outcomes through available data seeks to lead to better awareness, business intelligence, and policy shaping in years to&nbsp;come.</p> Introduction <p>This Data Challenge ran from November 23 to December 12, 2023, and was the last challenge of the 2023 championship season. The purpose of was challenge was to dissect carbon emission statistics and rates by each country, and then develop predictive models for future emission rates on a continental scale.</p><p>The Carbon Emissions data challenge gave a stepping stone to understanding emission rates for intensive purposes of the data challenge experiment. Later R&amp;D on this subject routes to dynamic analytics, data-informed decision-making, and stride to mitigate asymmetric facts and truth about climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>To execute, the Ocean Protocol Data Science team and the challenge participants used the provided data made available by the European Commission <a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2023">EDGAR — Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research</a>. Two Data Sets were used to weigh carbon emission rates under two different metrics: Co2 (Carbon Dioxide) and GHG (Green House Gases). Each data set weighed its metric at the country level, sector-specific data, per GDP, and Per Capita emission&nbsp;rates.</p><p>The key objectives of this data science competition were to analyze the influence of different industry sectors and countries, exercise statistical and machine learning models to derive assumptions, and forecast what the short-term future may look&nbsp;like.</p> Winners <p>Participants were tasked with analyzing trends and patterns in the historical data and identifying key drivers of emissions per country per industry sector, per capita, and per GDP. Then, apply these findings to indicators by continent. Beyond the data set provided, participants were encouraged to assess the impact of different sectors and economic activities on emission levels. 13 reports were entered, and 3 have earned podium finishes for USDC prizes and points accrued to their standing in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Championship &amp; Leaderboard.</a></p><p>Podium finishers are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1st — Andrey Bessalov — $2500&nbsp;USDC</p><p>This report is available on the Ocean Market for Consumption <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:a08d2b52d21ad4660db8da92536f930ba88accc917eca95721f9c70d6ccad96f">here</a>.</p><p>Andrey’s report was the best prepared and thorough. The key conclusion was that Asia is the most polluting continent, with recent emission levels reaching approximately 33 Gt GHG and 25 Gt CO2 per year, constituting about two-thirds of the total global emissions. Conversely, Australia is identified as the least polluting continent. This highlights a significant disparity in emission levels across continents, underscoring the crucial role of regional factors in global emission&nbsp;trends.</p><p>2nd — Elisa Anderson — $1500&nbsp;USDC</p><p>A key standout in the proposal made by Elisa was the development and application of a sophisticated predictive model. This model, based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture, is designed to forecast CO2 and GHG emissions by continent. The model demonstrates varying levels of predictive accuracy across different regions, highlighting the unique factors influencing emissions in each&nbsp;area.</p><p>3rd — Colin Chan — $1000&nbsp;USDC</p><p>This report is available on the Ocean Market for Consumption <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:64b4f1ff8b085b3acaf6772b7ba6334c750c85f43761f8314a876fc6c51de3b3">here</a></p><p>The most interesting takeaway from Colin Chan’s report, “Forecasting Carbon Emissions Across Continents,” is the discovery that Africa has experienced the greatest surge in CO2 emissions, nearly tripling over the observed time period (30 Years). This sharp increase is attributed to the continent’s industrialization and rising demand for transportation services, driven by urbanization and population growth. Conversely, Europe has shown a decrease in CO2 emissions, thanks to investments in renewable energy, strict environmental regulations, and the implementation of the European Union Emissions Trading System. This contrast illustrates the diverse paths of development and environmental impact across different regions.</p> Results <p>Global warming is the long-term increase in the Earth’s average surface temperature. Since the pre-industrial period (1850–1900), the Earth’s average surface temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</a> has concluded that it is extremely likely that human activity is the main cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. One noteworthy insight derived from this challenge found in this data challenge, that goes against common perception, is that CO2 emissions in Europe have been only declining for the last 30 years, whilst CO2 emissions in Asia for the last 30 years have steadily increased.</p><p>Through this exercise, we were able to assume a few key metrics that influence carbon emission rates via Co2 and GHG and define these assumptions before further&nbsp;reading:</p><p>The main source of carbon emissions and increased rates globally is burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity, power cars and trucks, and heat homes and businesses. Other sources of carbon emissions include deforestation, waste management, alternative energy production, industrial processes, urbanization &amp; population growth, and agriculture.</p><p>Global warming is already having several negative effects on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>These effects are expected to become more severe in the future. Some of the most serious effects of global warming include rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, changes in animal and plant life, and soil health &amp; erosion. Here we use data science to diagnose the issues and propose better practices to treat our planet better than the last 30&nbsp;years.</p> Exploratory Data Analysis&nbsp;(EDA) <p>In Asia, the surge in CO2 and GHG emissions is closely linked to rapid population growth, industrialization, and the rise of emerging economies. This region’s dynamic economic development, often driven by energy-intensive industries and expanding urban centers, has significantly increased its carbon footprint.</p><p>Meanwhile, continents like Oceania, Europe, and North America have witnessed a decline in emissions, largely attributable to effective environmental policies and a shift towards cleaner energy sources. This contrast highlights the varying trajectories of different regions in addressing climate change, underscoring the need for tailored solutions that consider economic and social contexts.</p><p>The same phenomenon is reflected in GHG emissions with Europe improving in its environmental efforts while the rest of the world continues to increase its emissions as&nbsp;Africa</p><p>leads the rise. Europe contributed 26.44% of total GHG emissions in 2022, down from 37.40% in 1970. On the other hand, Africa’s contribution rose from 12.70% in 1970 to 20.65%. This dichotomy is largely reflected and expected based on the aforementioned analysis of CO2 emissions.</p> Co2 vs GHG correlation <p>The heatmap indicates a strong positive correlation between CO2 emissions and overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a correlation coefficient of&nbsp;0.99.</p><p>This suggests that in the dataset analyzed, as CO2 emissions increase or decrease, GHG emissions tend to follow very closely. Given that CO2 is a major component of GHG emissions, this high correlation is expected.</p> Industry Sector Contribution Correlation The trend of Co2 Emission Rates by Sector&nbsp;GloballyTrends of GHG &amp; Co2 Emission Rates by Industry&nbsp;Sector<p>The graphs below show the absolute values of sectoral CO2 and GHG emissions expressed in Mt CO2/yr on the left, and the shares of these values from the total contribution on the&nbsp;right.</p><p>The most polluting sector is the Power Industry (generating energy). In recent years, the value of CO2 emissions has reached 30 Gt per year, which is approximately 30% of total GHG emissions, and 40% of total CO2 emissions. The least polluting sector in terms of GHG emissions is&nbsp;Waste.</p><p>- The agriculture sector is a significant contributor globally, necessitating sustainable farming practices.</p><p>- The building and fuel exploitation sectors call for energy-efficient construction and cleaner energy&nbsp;sources.</p><p>- Industrial combustion and the power industry sectors require enhanced regulations and adoption of cleaner technologies.</p><p>- Increased waste sector demands improved waste management sustainability globally.</p><p>- The transportation sector emphasizes the urgency of sustainable mobility solutions.</p><p>Following Per Capita and Per GDP metrics, it was recognized that global average CO2 emissions per capita decreasing from 1990 to 2022 indicates a positive trend towards lower individual carbon footprints. Because GDP and Per Capita benchmarks are continuously increasing, further reasoning for a decrease in correlation could mean several things: Improved energy efficiency, introduction of renewable energy, increased awareness, and policy measures.</p> Temporal Analysis <p>In Temporal analysis, research was tasked with Examining the temporal trends in CO2 and GHG emissions across continents. Then, scoring was made on the ability to identify notable patterns or shifts over time, pinpointing periods marked by significant increases or decreases in emissions. Explain these trends, considering policy changes, economic shifts, technological advancements, or natural events that might have influenced the observed patterns. The summary to solve this question is briefed based on averages of the submitted reports.</p><p>Over time, all continents recorded a rise in CO2 emissions except for Europe. In the meanwhile, Africa led the pack with the greatest surge in CO2 emissions, nearly tripling throughout the time. This can be possibly explained by the industrialization of Africa as the amount of CO2 emissions from transport rose dramatically in the continent. These include railways, buses, and ferries as the countries experience urbanization and population growth, increasing the demand for transportation services. These signs of economic development often go in tandem with trade and business activities, necessitating transportation services to move goods and people. Furthermore, as Africa’s GDP gradually increases, this enhances the affordability of citizens in the region to purchase vehicles, leading to elevated emissions.</p><p>However, with the lack of government policies and public awareness, it fails to sufficiently curb these emission activities and promote sustainable emissions.</p><p>As for sectoral composition, agriculture led the greatest fall (23.10% to 19.59%) in contributions to total GHG emissions while Processes contributed the largest rise (10.94% to&nbsp;14.64%).</p><p>Livestock, especially cattle, contribute significantly to methane emissions. The implementation of improved livestock management practices, such as dietary changes and methane capture technologies could contribute to lower emissions from the agriculture sector. As for processes, this could be plausibly explained by the changes in consumer demand and trade patterns which shifted to more energy-intensive manufacturing techniques such as computer parts and electronic equipment, due to the rise in income per&nbsp;capita.</p> Prediction Model <p>For predictions, two different approaches were exercised by challenge participants. Drawn between 1) Time Series Analysis, by analyzing historical trends and patterns in the data, time series models like ARIMA and ARIMAX can be employed to predict future emission levels. And 2) Machine Learning by the vehicle of algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Neural Networks was trained on the provided data to learn complex relationships and patterns.</p><p>For one example, this linear regression model is described here to forecast future global CO2 and GHG emission rates based solely on historical emissions data. The model utilizes the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method from the Statsmodels library in Python. The dataset used for training and prediction consists of two columns: ‘Year’ and ‘Emission’, where ‘Year’ represents the respective year, and ‘Emission’ denotes the total CO2 or GHG emissions for that year. The objective was to develop a predictive model that can estimate future total global CO2 emissions based on historical data.</p> Understanding Emission Rates, Climate Change, &amp; What to Do About&nbsp;It <p>The “Forecasting Carbon Emissions Across Continents” challenge has been a pivotal journey in understanding the complex dynamics of CO2 and GHG emissions globally. Through meticulous data analysis and advanced modeling, we’ve uncovered distinct emission trends across continents and the substantial impact of various sectors on these emissions. Our models have forecasted emissions for the upcoming three years, providing a crucial tool for policymakers and Environmentalists.</p><p>The analysis paints a world where geography and economy intertwine with emissions. While Asia grapples with the environmental costs of rapid growth, the West shows the feasibility of stabilizing emissions. Africa’s trajectory points towards a need for sustainable development models. The insights call for a global response, balancing economic needs with environmental sustainability.</p><p>This was the last data challenge of 2023.

 In IDnow’s latest webinar, experts gathered to discuss the challenges of preventing fraud, and the crucial role of identity verification services in the fraud capital of Europe. 



 



<p>If we are ever to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK (which currently claims the dubious honor of being fraud capital of Europe), then more must be done to educate the public of the real harm, according to participants of IDnow’s recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/fraud-digital-identity-verification-uk/">webinar, ‘The future of fraud and identity verification in the UK.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>The panel discussion, which is available now on-demand, gathered an eclectic bunch of experts, including Philipp Mind, Director Digital Technology and Innovation at UK Finance, Francisco Martins, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow, Tony Sales, ex-fraudster and current Chief Product Officer at We Fight Fraud, and Paul Stratton, ex-police officer and current Founder and Lead Trainer at The Fraud Nerd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Philipp, who was the moderator for the session, started by setting the scene, which included sharing some startling statistics of just how dire the problem of fraud is in the UK. (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">Read more about the UK’s problem with fraud here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>It then seemed only fitting to begin by speaking with the once dubbed “Britain’s greatest fraud star” to give his opinion on the state of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Criminals have now got more tools and data streams available to them than ever before. When I was a criminal, getting someone’s information was quite difficult, it wasn’t the process that it is now with Telegram, and the dark web, and all these places where criminals can harvest information, so it’s a lot easier to commit than it ever was before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tony added that the cost-of-living crisis has a part to play in people committing fraud, as does the role of social media in creating unobtainable lifestyles that persuade people to “get involved in deetsing [acquiring funds from account details].&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>They don’t even realize the consequences of their actions. They just want to get that item that they see others have. I think that’s a massive part of why we see the numbers [of fraud] we do nowadays.</p>Tony Sales, ex-fraudster and current Chief Product Officer at We Fight Fraud</blockquote>



<p>Paul, who has been historically at the opposite end of the interview table throughout his career, agreed with Tony, but also added that it was the ‘white collar’ perception of fraud that had a damaging impact on its prevalence, and often had the police deprioritize investigations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fraud is still seen as just a business crime by a lot of senior officers, but fraud is also about the emotional harm as well as the financial crime. However, some police divisions like Merseyside Police [where Paul worked] are moving away from solely focusing on the financial harm.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Paul believes that it is this perception, or misperception, that is key, citing how police divisions will invariably prioritize more ‘serious’ crimes like burglaries or murders, for example, as the harm is clear, and the public outrage if such crimes weren’t investigated, would be massive. Paul did say that times were slowly changing, though, and that the days of police fraud teams only taking on fraud cases if over a million pounds had been lost, are (in most areas) coming to an end…&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As a police force, and a society, if we can move toward acknowledging the actual harm that fraud causes, and not just see the financial element, then I think that will make a big difference.</p>Paul Stratton, ex-police officer and current Founder and Lead Trainer at The Fraud Nerd</blockquote>



 The effect of KYC: A blessing and a curse.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>It’s clear that technology and especially AI has facilitated an increase in new types of fraud (eg: deepfakes) in the UK. Thankfully, other types of technology like digital identity verification and eKYC were helping massively in the fight against fraud. However, while it’s important to be aware of new fraud trends, it’s also important to not forget the basics. For many organizations that means ensuring they have a robust and comprehensive KYC (Know Your Customer) process. For Tony, however, that acronym means something completely different.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do it differently at We Fight Fraud; we call it Know Your Criminal. From a criminal’s perspective, if an organization does have a thorough KYC process in place, then they will often abandon the onboarding, and just go to a company that doesn’t have such a robust KYC process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, companies that comply with the bare minimum of KYC and AML requirements (in order to onboard customers quicker or offer a more attractive customer experience) are not only putting their business at risk, but also their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s some great technology out there, especially in some of the banking apps, such as liveness scan functionality. When it’s configured correctly and working as part of comprehensive process, it’s great, but sometimes the drive to onboard customers means some businesses skip steps,” explains Tony.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A few years ago, we (We Fight Fraud) tested some organizations’ onboarding processes, and I was able to onboard my face with my colleague’s ID, and then we reversed it and used my ID document with her face. We even tried and succeeded wearing a bright yellow balaclava and were able to onboard with all three accounts, and deposit and withdraw money. It was a really easy process because the process hadn’t been configured properly or the liveness check wasn’t working in the way it should have been, and everyone’s worried about deepfakes! Let me make it clear, this was not IDnow!”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Biometrics, as Tony said, is very important. Identity verification vendors need to ensure the same face cannot be onboarded twice and the same document cannot be onboarded with another face, and most identity verification vendors cannot do that. You need risk analysis. You need heavy checks, what we call document and selfie checks, but it needs to be a holistic approach.</p>Francisco Martins, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow</blockquote>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This week I am joined by Craig Ramsay from Omada, here to discuss the importance of identity governance and how it is helping to solve problems in real-world. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello, for today’s episode about Identity Governance and Administration, mostly known as IGA, we have invited a super interesting guest who is Craig Ramsay. He is a Senior Solution Architect at Omada. He’s from Edinburgh, Scotland. He has worked for Omada for three years and has previously worked at RSA Security and different financial services organisations in the United Kingdom within their identity functions. Outside of work, Craig’s main interests are hiking and travelling. Hello, Craig.</p>
<p>Craig Ramsay: Hey, Oscar. How are you doing?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. Nice talking with you.</p>
<p>Craig: Thank you, you too.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, let’s talk about digital identity. As usual, we want to hear more about our guests. Please tell us about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Craig: Sure. So, I mean, thank you for the introduction. And I guess, in terms of my journey into identity, it was a little bit by fluke rather than by design. I studied Computer Science and when I graduated, I joined an operational IT graduate scheme. They had recently started a new IAM project, because I think back in 2008, identity and access management, identity governance wasn’t as mature as it is now. It was still kind of seen as an operational IT project rather than an information security principle. So, the drivers there were more about the efficiency, automated provisioning and stuff. But yeah, they were looking for a graduate on that project. That was me.</p>
<p>And apart from a few years where I decided to try what it was like being a policeman, I have worked in identity ever since either for, as you said, financial services organisations doing the work at the coalface or for vendors, either in project delivery or, and you know pre-sales in my solution architect role.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So, let’s go first with the basics. We have not talked about IGA yet in this podcast, have not focused on that. So, tell us, what is that? What is Identity Governance and Administration, IGA? What is important?</p>
<p>Craig: Sure. So, I mean, identity governance, when you focus on it, at its core, it’s a solution that will ensure the right individuals have the right access for the right reasons at the right time in your organisation. So, it’s protecting the authorisations or the resource assignments within your organisation. And that’s often policy-driven to ensure that all of, and I think the important distinction here when we talk about IGA, that’s traditionally your internal identities, maybe your third parties and contractors.</p>
<p>And then in terms of the overall importance of identity governance, as I said, it’s evolved over the years from being primarily driving and focusing, looking at the provisioning element of things. But as governance has become more and more important, as we start to take a more holistic view at identity, when you look at the adjacent technologies; privileged access management, cloud infrastructure and tailored management, user endpoint, behaviour analytics, identity governance is now really being seen as the kind of control plane across that identity fabric. So, I think it is becoming crucial. And there’s a lot of visibility on the importance of identity now, right up to C-level and maybe wasn’t 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Oscar: You mentioned this concept about identity fabric. Could you also explain a bit more about that in this context?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, sure. So, I mean, identity fabric is a term that’s been coined in the last maybe few years by a lot of industry analysts out there. It’s maybe a new phrase, but I think the concept isn’t necessarily that new. So, I think we also hear people calling it an enriched security ecosystem. So, it’s where you look at these solutions in the PAM space, UEBA, your SIEM solutions, etc.</p>
<p>Those traditionally have worked in perhaps a bit more of a siloed manner. And the integrations have been maybe limited and not as seamless. Whereas now, I think this concept of that enriched security ecosystem, that fabric is that these things should be joined up and they should be – the convergence of intelligence and data between those solutions, I think is becoming more and more important so that you can take a holistic approach to reducing your identity-related risk.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is very important, as you said, because there will be anyway, other solutions working together with IGA. Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>What are the main problems, just – I’m sure there are many, but what are the top main problems that IGA solves?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, so from a business problem or business challenge perspective, I think the main thing that we always focus on when we’re helping people build their IGA business case, is that we focus on security, compliance and efficiency. So, it’s looking to increase the efficiency and productivity of your end users and their experience, all whilst ensuring that you’ve got increased compliance, increased security and reduced risk.</p>
<p>So, when we look at that, some of those common challenges and problems within that would be reducing the attack surface in the organisation. So, removing unneeded access, adhering to the principle of least privilege, making sure that your identities only have the access they should. I mean, combining those two things is going to reduce the likelihood and the impact of a potential breach in the organisation. It provides you with a unified view of access across the organisation, which a lot of people often haven’t had previously. So, understanding who has what access.</p>
<p>And then there’s the automation around identity lifecycle management. So that’s reducing the time taken to provision your joiners, your movers, your leavers. You’re putting governance and auditing around all of these processes too. So, when people are requesting access, you’re ensuring they’re getting it for the right reasons with the appropriate approval. And you’re cutting down on things like rogue IT administration and stuff like that.</p>
<p>So that’s high level, there is more obviously, but I think those are the high-level ones that we see frequently when we’re speaking to prospects out there in the market.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a security compliance, and efficiency. Yeah, we’d like to talk about this. But before actually it will be interesting to – so people can understand the broader concept, how we try to imagine in their minds.</p>
<p>If you can see in a real-world example, how work for a typical corporation that uses IGA. So, tell us what are these main processes that you say, mostly employees, right? What are these main processes? Let’s say a new employee goes from beginning until the end.</p>
<p>Craig: Yes. I mean, if we’re going to talk – the phrase we kind of, is from hire to retire. So, when I try and explain this to my friends, maybe aren’t so technically minded when they ask what I do, I sort of give them an example. I say, OK, you join an organisation, and you are working in their HR department. So, from day one, you should have access to be able to log into the network, an email account, access to various file shares to do with HR to enable you to be productive from day one.</p>
<p>So, the IGA solution will help you identify the policies to automate that process, to make sure that you are productive and also make sure that you’ve only got access to what you should. So, if you’re joining HR, you shouldn’t be getting access to any file shares to do with finance, R and D, anything like that. And then as you move around the organisation or your needs change, you should be able to request access that goes through the appropriate channels.</p>
<p>It should be reviewed regularly to make sure that it is still appropriate as you go through your life cycle as an identity in the organisation. If you are promoted or changed departments, that should change automatically in line with those policies too. And if you either leave the organisation, be it permanently or temporary for maternity leave, garden leave, that kind of thing, your IGA solution should then disable or provision that access in a timely manner too, to make sure you’re reducing risk.</p>
<p>So, I mean, those are kind of some of the high-level things that it’s that right access for the right people at the right time for the right reasons is kind of trying to, in a nutshell.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, that was in a nutshell, very, very easy to understand. Thank you for that. Some of these at least main problems and how these are being solved. But IGA, let’s start with security as you put security first, how IGA is helping with security?</p>
<p>Craig: So, in terms of how it contributes to, you know, maybe security and risk management, I think, it’s providing stronger access control. So, it’s starting to limit access to your sensitive and privileged information. So, when you start to look at either personal identifiable information, financially sensitive information, or privileged access, so this is when you start to look at integrations with adjacent technologies in the PAM space, you’re ensuring that the access control is limiting that access.</p>
<p>Reducing risk. I already talked about the fact that that principle of least privilege means that if there is a breach in the organisation, the identity of the account that’s breached should have only the access needed to do the job that it can, and it shouldn’t have any elevated permissions permanently. The ability to traverse the network or to have a much more impact on that breach should be reduced. You’re also reducing the likelihood by integrating with identity providers to perform strong authentication. And those unneeded accounts or unwanted accounts or unused accounts have been removed over time as well. So that should be helping you reduce the risk and then improve your security posture.</p>
<p>In combination with that as well, if you look at some of the real-time monitoring and identity incidents or detection and prevention you’re starting to see integration with abnormal access patterns, maybe you know impossible logons, for example, we integrate with the Azure identity risk subscription so that’s looking at – user logged on from Edinburgh one minute and they’re trying to log on from Beijing the next. That’s impossible, so that may be an indication of compromise. And then your IGA solution could lock down that account.</p>
<p>So, there’s many ways you could do that and it’s obviously a maturity journey, you need to crawl before you can walk before you can run. But it’s a maturity journey you go on to take a holistic view in reducing your identity related risk.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. From basic essential functionalities of security to much more advanced like some of the ones you described.</p>
<p>The second one is, of course, we’re interested about compliance is very common that someone comes, start to ask someone from Omada, or from another company even Ubisecure, we also do identity access management and one of the key drivers for them is compliance especially in some industries, it’s more important that. So, tell us about compliance.</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. So, I mean, when you go out there in the market and you’re speaking to organisations like more and more and more we are speaking to organisations that operate on a global basis. So, you’ve got country or region-specific things like GDPR, SOCS, HIPAA, PCI, DSS etc that are external regulatory compliance frameworks that you must comply with. And you know we keep a track on with things like Schrems II as well. We’re always keeping an eye on that to ensure that the solution we provide is compliant with those things.</p>
<p>But then we’re also helping our customers comply with how they are storing, processing and managing the data in relation to those things. So, if you look at what I often say is that an identity governance solution is a technical translation of your business processes. I think you always have to look at making sure your people process and technology are working in harmony with each other. Technology alone will not resolve your problems. So, I think as part of a wider identity information security strategy you should ensure that your internal policies and standards are created in such a way that it will help you comply with those external regulations if they apply to you.</p>
<p>But you should always look, I think it’s a healthy thing for any organisation across any vertical to have these well-defined policies and standards and ensure that they can comply with those. And as I said that’s where identity governance comes in, because it helps you comply with those things by defining policies that can detect when you’re non-compliant, you’ve got that audit trail. So, it offers – you’ve got transparent auditing for your internal and external users to prove compliance. You will go through regular recertification, attestation, reviews, whatever you want to call it. But that also ensures that you’re demonstrating regular compliance.</p>
<p>And then we already talked about risk management as well, but compliance and risk often do overlap each other. So, you’re identifying and mitigating compliance risks through the definition and enforcement of these policies as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, there is some reports that can be directly created, right, from the IGA system. And that can be directly taken by the compliance officer or whoever requires it, right?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: The other you mentioned there was the operational efficiency, right? So, as you mentioned, it’s one of the three main problems. Let’s – I’d like to hear more about that as well, how IGA helps.</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. And I think that’s one of the things that I think separates IGA and the information security market sometimes. That it’s not always focusing on risk reduction and things that are maybe potentially seen as negative. So, you talk about fear and certainty and doubt within the sales process, etc. When you’re doing that, it can often be quite a hard sell because it’s hard to quantify the risk. We can’t help with that. There are formulas out there of calculating the impact of a risk based on, you know, and the likelihood, the cost of the actual breach, etc.</p>
<p>But to bring it back to what you actually asked about from an efficiency perspective, if you look at – if organisations are still heavily manual in their provisioning and their processes, there’s a huge cost to that from areas like your service desk, your operational IT administrators. And often it leads you to the potential for human error as well. So, if you start to automate those things, you see a reduction in numbers of calls to the desk, a number of manually created events and things that are being done. And you can put a pound, euro, dollar sign against that clearly from an efficiency and a cost reduction perspective.</p>
<p>From an end user perspective as well, I mean, it’s always, I think there’s – we’re still trying to shake off the thing that security is a barrier to efficiency. There’s an old adage that I keep using for it regularly that ‘efficiency is insecure, but security is inefficient’. And I don’t think that’s true anymore. I think if you correctly apply your policies in a way that apply the appropriate level of risk, your users – to them, it should be seamless pretty much all the time. They shouldn’t see these processes as an action. They should see it as; they request the access they need, it gets granted to them in a timely manner. When they move around the organisation, a lot of that should happen automatically.</p>
<p>Overall, you should see an increase in productivity. Your line managers aren’t getting frustrated when people join the organisation and they’re having to submit 10 different requests to get them functioning from day one. So, it’s overall operational efficiency and cost reduction. But the productivity. And end user experience of it as a result of a well-delivered IGA program, I think is clear to see as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, cost reduction is clear and is a great reason to buy a product like IGA. Absolutely. Well, if you quantify that to a buyer, it’s like, wow, you can convince him or her very easily. Yeah.</p>
<p>At Ubisecure, we are working with CIAM, and I experienced directly that sometimes requests come from potential customers, and they are looking for identity and access management. And when we review closely, we see that sometimes what they need is IGA or what they need is both IGA and customer identity and access management. So, and in those cases, the customer will need to deal with these two types of system, right? The IGA and CIAM.</p>
<p>So, what is your perspective from your experience working integrating these two types of tools? What are the main things that a buyer bought from business and technical perspective should know at least?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, so, I mean, funnily enough, I have worked on a couple of opportunities where Omada and Ubisecure have been working together on those kinds of joint proposals where people are looking for IGA and CIAM. And I think it’s interesting because you can make a very strong case about where the overlap is, but you can also equally make a very strong case about why they should be separate because of the nature of the requirements.</p>
<p>From a CIAM perspective, you’re looking for that seamless, really quick response for all your consumers. And then you should be able to deal with high demand periods when you’re very, very busy, when your consumers are consuming your services. And from an IGA perspective, you’re very much looking at the internal and the control and the level of these privileges that we’re talking about. And there are similarities in the capabilities in terms of, you know, being able to provision in a timely manner, deprovision in a timely manner, ensuring that it’s the level of appropriateness.</p>
<p>So, if you look at it from an integration perspective, a unified management of the identities, I think, could be important whilst treating them differently. I think your end user experience again should be important. So, you’re balancing security and efficiency for your internal and external customers. And then you should be able to have that from a scalability perspective by seeing those things integrate well with each other as well.</p>
<p>I think what is important when you’re speaking to people, understanding their requirements is crucial. So, when they’re talking about, you know, B2B or B2C capabilities and requirements, it’s OK, well, how do you manage your B2B and B2C use cases? Because I think if you take software or technical organisation where their consumers consume their services in a far, far different way to maybe a retail bank or a supermarket. The requirements for end users from that perspective, they’re opening up a loyalty card in a store and you’re processing their personal data in that manner is very, very different to maybe a software company where people are having accounts created and consuming those services.</p>
<p>So, as you can probably tell, not an absolute expert in the CIAM space, but I think whenever those opportunities arise, I think the first important question is why? To understand what it is exactly they’re trying to achieve. And then you map the use cases to the functionality in each of the appropriate solutions to make sure that it’s well matched. There will be overlap in some cases. But as I said, there’s a strong case for when there’s similarities and when they should be managed separately. But ultimately, it’s part of that wider identity fabric we mentioned earlier that it’s kind of all identity in the end, I guess.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Indeed. As you say, you put it very clear, the importance of really knowing very well the requirements because in a conversation, they might tell you we need this one, two, three, five things and can be also in a written Excel file or whatever. But then you have to go deeply to understand what they meant by saying this B2B or anything, right? So, yeah. Indeed. Thank you for sharing that.</p>
<p>Looking now at the present and future, let’s say, because IGA, as many other types of products have been evolving, are evolving all the time because there are different needs. So what customers are asking today when they are clear that they need an IGA software? What they’re asking today and what are these new problems that need to be solved, are being solved now and need to be solved if they are not solved today?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah. So, it’s a very timely question. To be fair, we recently released a <a href="https://omadaidentity.com/resources/analyst-reports/state-of-iga/">State of IGA for 2024 report</a> at Omada and we did a webinar discussing the findings of it and it did exactly that it looked at how seriously people were taking identity. And then as you said what are they looking for currently and what are they looking ahead at as well. So, and we just talked about the why and the use cases, so I think, number one that we still see is that the solution they’re looking at adapts and meets to their changing business needs. So, the requirements they have now and the requirements they think they’ll see in the future, it’s the core capabilities must adapt and must comply with that.</p>
<p>We’re seeing an increased importance being put on the ability for the solution to integrate as part of that security ecosystem we talked about. So being able to play nicely with the adjacent technologies across the identity fabric. And then from a connectivity perspective, I mean I talked earlier about a unified view of access across the board, the nature of organisations has changed massively in terms of on-premises systems to a lot more cloud services being consumed. So the ability to extend and integrate with a growing list of different target systems is important for them.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we do see AI and Machine Learning coming up again and again. And I think when we see that it’s important to take those as separate things. So, from ML perspective, you know, if you look at kind of the role mining capabilities that have been there for some time, recommendations during reviews, recommendations for decisions or decision support for approvals, that stuff has been around for a little while.</p>
<p>From an AI perspective, I mean there’s a huge buzz around what’s happening in AI. Just now Google just released their Gemini Chatbot to rival Chat GPT and that the generative AI stuff and the practical uses of that are going to start to be seen. So, you know integrating generative AI, we have stuff where it’s looking at… you can ask questions about the documentation. So, like what is this object in Omada and like what’s the difference and it’s starting to respond to that so we’re in the process of testing and releasing that.</p>
<p>And then looking further down the line, it’ll be generative AI within the solution. So, user logs in and it says, “What are you trying to do today?” “I need the same access as my colleague Allison.” And it’ll say, “OK she’s got this, this and this. Maybe this is what you need to request.” Or it’s becoming more mature and more complex or sophisticated in what it can do.</p>
<p>So, I think ultimately what people are looking for is ensuring that the solution they have can do what they need to do today and can do it well, it’s scalable, it’s easy to upgrade, it’s easy to maintain. They’re reducing the complexity of management of it so they’re simplifying it from that perspective. But looking ahead they’re needing that generic connectivity that can allow them to connect to any of the systems they have now and ones they want in the future. And then being able to take advantage of the advances in the AI and ML space to improve end user experience and also the maintenance and administration of the system itself for their administrative users.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, you believe that machine learning and the other what we call artificial intelligence is going to be used. It’s to be solving those problems that today customers are bringing up.</p>
<p>Craig: I think it’ll augment, and I think – because that’s the thing people get worried about AI replacing us and whatnot. And maybe somebody using AI more efficiently than you might replace what you’re doing but AI itself can’t and I think any algorithm that – it does do in the output of it still needs human validation particularly in a field like IGA where OK it’s taken a huge amount of data, provided this output and most that might look OK. There’s probably some human context in terms of exactly what that business does that’s needed to say, “Yes I’m still OK with that.” Because ultimately the human’s going to have to be accountable for the decision that’s made. I don’t think and I don’t think we’re going to see algorithms being fined or sent to jail for data breaches you know, I mean.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, a human will go to jail anyway. Hopefully not. Hopefully that doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>Craig: No, hopefully not that’s what we’re trying to prevent. You’re right, we’re trying to prevent that but yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, exactly. Yeah, yeah definitely. Also, one thing you mentioned, it comes back to what we discussed earlier these identity fabrics. Yeah, the way to coexist all this all these tools, IGA, PAM, CIAM all together that’s also, as you say, it’s something that is becoming more important because the environments are getting more complexes.</p>
<p>Final question for you, Craig. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Craig: So not to spoil the magic of the podcast but we’re recording this just before Christmas towards the end of the year and I don’t know when it’s going to be released but that’s always a time for reflection and looking at where you’re at and where you want to be going. And I think for any business leader right now, I think conducting an identity maturity assessment is something that you can do actionably right now. So, look at where you’re at from an identity maturity perspective and identify gaps that you need to start filling, or priorities looking ahead and aligning that with your business goals, your business risks to ensure that your information security strategy, your policies and standards support your overall business objectives.</p>
<p>And then from that, building a plan of continuous improvement, some milestones as well. And I think any well-delivered IGA project should be doing that. It shouldn’t be looking to boil the ocean or deliver everything at once at big bang. It should be continuous improvement and continuous demonstration of value.</p>
<p>So, I appreciate that might be – that’s not something cutting edge or brand new or innovative, but I think it is really something actionably you can do now to take a step back, assess exactly where you’re at and then build that plan and start to try an action that. Do that at the end of the year, at the start of the year. There’s never a bad time to take a step back and reflect and put that plan in place. But I think that’s definitely something actionable that they could put on their agenda right now to do from today.</p>
<p>Oscar: I couldn’t agree more an assessment, absolutely. It’s something needed. Yeah, it takes time. And it’s very actionable, as you said. Yeah, thank you very much, Craig, for having this very interesting conversation about IGA and other topics, related topics.</p>
<p>So, let us know for people who would like to continue this conversation with you, or follow you, or find out more about what you do, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Craig: Yeah, absolutely. So, you can find me on LinkedIn, Craig, I think my username is Craig86. Obviously, I work at Omada Identity, but that’s, again, if you search for Omada, you’ll find us there. I mentioned our <a href="https://omadaidentity.com/resources/analyst-reports/state-of-iga/">State of IGA 2024 report</a>, you can download that free from omadaidentity.com. And there’s also an on-demand webinar where myself and Rod Simmons, our VP of Product Strategy, discuss that report in-depth.</p>
<p>But yeah, please do feel free to reach out and connect. If you want to chat about all things identity or just want to know a bit more about Omada or myself. But yeah, it’s been a pleasure talking to you, Oscar, as well. Thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: My pleasure as well. Well, all the best. Happy New Year. Now, this coming the new year, 2024, I wish you all the best for you, Craig, Omada, and everybody who is doing all this great job in the identity space. Thank you. All the best.</p>

<p>The emergence of generative AI prompted several prominent companies to restrict its use because of the mishandling of sensitive internal data. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/22/tech/generative-ai-corporate-policy/index">According to CNN,</a> some companies imposed internal bans on generative AI tools while they seek to better understand the technology and many have also blocked the use of internal ChatGPT.</p>



<p>Companies still often accept the risk of using internal data when exploring large language models (LLMs) because this contextual data is what enables LLMs to change from general-purpose to domain-specific knowledge. In the generative AI or traditional AI development cycle, data ingestion serves as the entry point. Here, raw data that is tailored to a company’s requirements can be gathered, preprocessed, masked and transformed into a format suitable for LLMs or other models. Currently, no standardized process exists for overcoming data ingestion’s challenges, but the model’s accuracy depends on it.</p>



 &nbsp;4 risks of poorly ingested data 



 
 Misinformation generation: When an LLM is trained on contaminated data (data that contains errors or inaccuracies), it can generate incorrect answers, leading to flawed decision-making and potential cascading issues.&nbsp; 



 Increased variance: Variance measures consistency. Insufficient data can lead to varying answers over time, or misleading outliers, particularly impacting smaller data sets. High variance in a model may indicate the model works with training data but be inadequate for real-world industry use cases. 



 Limited data scope and non-representative answers: When data sources are restrictive, homogeneous or contain mistaken duplicates, statistical errors like sampling bias can skew all results. This may cause the model to exclude entire areas, departments, demographics, industries or sources from the conversation. 



 Challenges in rectifying biased data: If the data is biased from the beginning, “<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/08/30/researchers-impossible-remove-private-user-data-delete-trained-ai-models/">the only way to retroactively remove a portion of that data is by retraining the algorithm from scratch</a>.” It is difficult for LLM models to unlearn answers that are derived from unrepresentative or contaminated data when it’s been vectorized. These models tend to reinforce their understanding based on previously assimilated answers. 
 



<p>Data ingestion must be done properly from the start, as mishandling it can lead to a host of new issues. The groundwork of training data in an AI model is comparable to piloting an airplane. If the takeoff angle is a single degree off, you might land on an entirely new continent than expected.</p>



<p>The entire generative AI pipeline hinges on the data pipelines that empower it, making it imperative to take the correct precautions.</p>



 4 key components to ensure reliable data ingestion 



 
 Data quality and governance: Data quality means ensuring the security of data sources, maintaining holistic data and providing clear metadata. This may also entail working with new data through methods like web scraping or uploading. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/why-data-governance-is-essential-for-enterprise-ai/">Data governance</a> is an ongoing process in the data lifecycle to help ensure compliance with laws and company best practices. 



 Data integration: These tools enable companies to combine disparate data sources into one secure location. A popular method is extract, load, transform (ELT). In an ELT system, data sets are selected from siloed warehouses, transformed and then loaded into source or target data pools. ELT tools such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/datastage?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700050328190090&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwj5mpBhDJARIsAOVjBdpmEnFqSTNIXxngYnBIxdcHssbefKzddZ1MjMWx_bwGBIutBU-FeV8aAsEPEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM® DataStage®</a> facilitate fast and secure transformations through parallel processing engines. In 2023, the average enterprise receives hundreds of disparate data streams, making efficient and accurate data transformations crucial for traditional and new AI model development. 



 Data cleaning and preprocessing: This includes formatting data to meet specific LLM training requirements, orchestration tools or data types. Text data can be chunked or tokenized while imaging data can be stored as embeddings. Comprehensive transformations can be carried out using data integration tools. Also, there may be a need to directly manipulate raw data by deleting duplicates or changing data types. 



 Data storage: After data is cleaned and processed, the challenge of data storage arises. Most data is hosted either on cloud or on-premises, requiring companies to make decisions about where to store their data. It’s important to caution using external LLMs for handling sensitive information such as personal data, internal documents or customer data. However, LLMs play a critical role in fine-tuning or implementing a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based- approach. To mitigate risks, it’s important to run as many data integration processes as possible on internal servers. One potential solution is to use remote runtime options like .

<p>Navigating the intricate realm of modern enterprise applications requires collaboration among diverse personas to effectively manage complexity. This helps with continuous business support through applications automating essential workflows. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditionally, applications and their hosting infrastructure align with DevOps and CloudOps. However, rising costs due to diverse IT environments led to the emergence of FinOps, focusing on expense monitoring and control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Various personas in application deployment have introduced highly complex workflows. Typically, DevOps initiates requests, scrutinized by CloudOps, NetOps, SecOps and FinOps teams. These intricate workflows lead to extended application update times, occasionally impacting business processes and customer satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>



 Introduction to Red Hat Services Interconnect&nbsp; 



<p>Red Hat Services Interconnect (RHSI), based on the popular open-source project Skupper, aims to simplify the hybrid cloud connectivity needed for applications. It empowers the DevOps teams to get the connectivity that they need, without needing special privileges or without having to depend on complex VPN connections and special firewall rules. This greatly accelerates the application deployment workflow and helps the business users respond with greater agility to the needs of their customers. This also helps in preserving the overall CloudOps and SecOps posture, as it doesn’t ask for new connections to be made at the infra level, or new firewall rules to be added or ports to be opened. &nbsp;</p>



 RHSI—the technology beneath&nbsp; 



<p>RHSI reduces the dependencies on the L3 layer mechanisms to create application tunnels. Primarily, any L3-based transport will use a VPN mechanism, such as an IPSec tunnel or any other equivalent tunneling mechanisms at L3. These tunnels are to be provisioned and terminated in the routers deployed in the application infra, and hence need to be owned and provisioned by the NetOps and the SecOps teams. As an alternative, RHSI focusses on creating application-level tunnels at a higher layer and uses a well-known messaging infrastructure to transport them at a layer above IP. RHSI employs an open standard application layer messaging protocol. This reduces the dependency on the network layer for creating L3 tunnels for each application, and hence greatly improves the efficiency of the DevOps teams. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition, RHSI also is deployed as an “in-cluster gateway”, which means that the gateway is deployed as close to the applications as possible, and therefore can develop a greater awareness about the application environment, as against the traditional routers that are deployed well outside the application hosting environment, and therefore can offer only limited application awareness. </p>



 How IBM® Hybrid Cloud Mesh adds value to RHSI&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In the world of the IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh, there are two big building blocks: &nbsp;</p>



 
 A SaaS Platform that acts as the management, control and policy plane (aka Mesh Manager)&nbsp; 
 



 
 Set of distributed gateways that are deployed close to application workloads, within the application environment (aka Gateway)&nbsp; 
 



<p>In the above, RHSI plays the role of the gateway, implementing the data plane needed to transport application traffic across different locations. Outside the data-plane, there are still a lot of complexities that needed to be dealt with, such as lifecycle management of the gateways, certificate rotation, policy administration, and, more importantly, observability. IBM’s Mesh Manager seamlessly manage a set of distributed RHSI gateways at scale and makes certain that the DevOps users are empowered to run faster, while making sure that the CloudOps persona retain the control that they are used to experiencing, but with a much lesser effort. &nbsp;</p>



 Take the next step with Hybrid Cloud Mesh&nbsp; 



<p>We are excited to showcase a tech preview of Hybrid Cloud Mesh supporting the use of RHSI gateways simplifying application connectivity and security across platforms, clusters and clouds. <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/service-interconnect">Red Hat Service Interconnect</a>, announced 23 May 2023 at Red Hat Summit, creates connections between services, applications and workloads across hybrid necessary environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re just getting started on our journey building comprehensive hybrid multicloud automation solutions for the enterprise. Hybrid Cloud Mesh is not just a network solution; it’s engineered to be a transformative force that empowers businesses to derive maximum value from modern application architecture, enabling hybrid cloud adoption and revolutionizing how multicloud environments are utilized. We hope you join us on the journey.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Reality and Digital Reality 
<p>Navigating these two worlds isn't always seamless, especially when it involves translating our physical identity documents into the digital sphere. Just recall the last time you witnessed your passport being scanned for digital records when opening a bank account. Going from physical to digital is usually not the most secure or smooth process. Particularly for identity documents, it's a challenge to ensure they maintain their trustworthiness and verifiability in the transfer.</p>
<p>Going from physical to digital has been a bumpy ride, which is why a digital “wallet” populated with digital credentials that are shared in both digital and physical ways is a game changer for individuals and organizations.</p>
 The Game-Changer 
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable verified IDs</a>—a game-changer in seamlessly navigating our digital and physical worlds. A verified identity refers to digital identities that have been verified to describe a real-world identity in digital form, and that the verification remains valid throughout the identity lifecycle. Reuse means that the verified identity can be used in multiple contexts. This ranges from being used by the issuing organization multiple times – like using a verified attribute like facial biometrics as an authentication factor – to enabling the verified identity to be reused by organizations independent of the issuing organization – like an employer accepting a verified education credential for a new hire.</p>
<p>Reusable verified IDs give an opportunity to leap the hurdle posed by the evolving landscape of a multi-reality, multi-wallet, and multi-credential world. Reusable verified identities are held by the individual that it describes, allowing them to travel with the individual through different applications – be it in virtual interactions or in person.</p>
 Interoperability: Critical for Success 
<p>This individually-held verified ID presents a valuable opportunity for organizations to securely and smoothly identify their customers, employees, partners, or things, but requires interoperability across multiple dimensions: with an organization’s own systems, and with other reusable verified identity solutions. The reusable identity community is unique in that from very early on it accepted that in order to achieve mass adoption of the method, it must adhere to commonly agreed upon standards. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> specification is one of the foundations that is being used to ensure interoperability between otherwise competing reusable verified identity solutions.</p>
<p>As technology advances and standards for secure digital identities evolve, the potential for a smoother, safer, and more efficient exchange between our physical and digital identities becomes increasingly tangible. It's a transformative step towards harmonizing our existence across both realms, promising a future where our identities move with ease, irrespective of the world they inhabit.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC</a>, we will be discussing the role that reusable verified identities play for the enterprise, along with many supporting technologies, like <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/decentralized-identity">decentralized identity</a> and identity verification.

 The World of Web 3 



<p>Web 3 represents a revolutionary convergence between the physical and digital worlds, triggering an unprecedented cultural, technological and mindset transformation. This new digital era not only redefines our interaction with technology, but also reshapes our perception of digital identity, ownership, security and community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By integrating advanced technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and augmented reality, Web 3 facilitates immersive and personalized experiences, expanding the scope of our digital existence and redefining the structure of our social and economic relationships. This innovative fusion of the physical and digital not only enhances our daily lives, but also drives a mindset shift towards greater interconnectedness and global collaboration.</p>



<p>Having said that, the distinction between Verifiable Information and Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) is extremely important for Web 3. While SSI focuses on the self-management of personal digital identity, allowing users to control and distribute their own information, Verifiable Information has a broader scope. This concept extends to areas such as records, customs, security and contracts, where authenticity and verification are critical. Here, Verifiable Information is not limited to personal identity, but encompasses any data or information that can be used to verify the authenticity of a person’s identity.</p>



<p>In other words, SSI is a very relevant use case within the immense potential of Verifiable Information.</p>



Digital Identity in Web3



<p>Both systems ensure greater efficiency and speed in processes such as data verification, thus reducing operational costs. They also improve security and trust in digital transactions, which is essential in an increasingly interconnected and technology-dependent world. In short, these technologies – properly implemented – offer greater value and a better experience at a lower cost in a world that is already embracing these technological innovations in various sectors.</p>



 “Digital self-sovereignty,” “Decentralized Identity,” “Blockchain Identity?” 



<p>Defining the concept of “sovereignty” in the context of SSI presents a particular complexity in addressing human and non-human identities. Inspired by politics, sovereignty implies control and power over others. By exploring the notion of “self-sovereignty” and “autonomy” in these identities, it is intended to go beyond mere individual data management.</p>



<p>While terms such as “decentralized identity” or “blockchain identity” are used, self-sovereignty implies the autonomous issuance of identities while ensuring their portability and verification independently of specific networks or blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although other concepts, such as “self-managed data,” might apply in certain contexts, none fully captures the duality of being self-issued and, at the same time, globally portable and verifiable.</p>



<p>Whether using terms such as “self-sovereignty,” “autonomy,” “decentralized identity,” or “blockchain identity,” the essence is quite similar: the aspiration is to decentralize, protect, and empower users by granting them full control over their identities. Autonomy of issuance, combined with portability and independent verifiability, represents our fundamental commitment to providing a more secure and empowering approach to managing identities, both human and non-human.</p>



 SSI Use Cases 



<p>The following use cases demonstrate the versatility and positive impact that Verifiable Information and SSI can have in a variety of industries, driving significant advancement in efficiency, security and user experience.</p>



 
 Customs: streamlining identity verification processes for the clearance of goods, improving security and reducing waiting time. 



 Contracts: facilitates authentication of the parties involved, ensuring the validity and transparency of agreements. 



 Medical and legal records: enables secure and controlled access to sensitive information, maintaining privacy and confidentiality. 



 Banking: improves security in financial transactions, reducing fraud, high cybersecurity costs and identity theft. 



 Enterprises: optimizes employee and customer identity management, improving operational efficiency. 



 Security and cybersecurity: strengthens authentication and authorization mechanisms, protecting against unauthorized access. 



 Identity recognition: applied in access control and customer verification, improving user experience and security. 



 Public and private services: Simplifies registration processes and access to services, guaranteeing the integrity of user data. 
 







 As a conclusion 



<p>This article has explored the immense potential of Web 3 in merging the physical and the digital. We have differentiated between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Information</a> and SSI, highlighting their varied use cases. We also clarified concepts such as “decentralized identity” and “sovereignty” in the <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/the-global-decentralized-id-self-sovereign-identity-journey/">context of SSI</a>.</p>

 The Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (KJM) confirms that IDCheck.io, the AI-based identity verification solution, is suitable for age verification in accordance with the youth protection treaty in Germany 



<p>Munich, January 9, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, today announces that its fully automated, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">AI-based solution IDCheck.io</a> has been positively assessed by the German Commission for the Protection of Minors in the Media (<a href="https://www.kjm-online.de/">Kommission für Jugendmedienschutz, KJM</a>) for the use of age verification. With this latest confirmation, IDcheck.io joins the extensive list of IDnow solutions already rated as positive by the KJM for age verification. Previously, the videochat-based VideoIdent, AutoIdent, IDnow eID and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a> were among the solutions approved for age verification by the Commission.</p>



<p>Protection of minors via age verification systems</p>



<p>The German Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors in the Media (Jugendmedienschutz-Staatsvertrag, JMStV) stipulates that certain unsuitable content, such as AO-rated video and browser games, gambling offers or pornography, may only be distributed online if the provider ensures that it is only available for adult user groups. In order to ensure such closed, adult-only user groups, age verification systems (AV systems) are used. The KJM publishes a list of evaluated age verification systems which fulfil the legal requirements to provide legal and planning security for providers and operators of such content.</p>



<p>“There are corners of the internet that contain content best unseen by child or adolescent eyes. However, curious young minds will often go searching for these, so there needs to be a method of gatekeeping on these websites that goes beyond asking a user to simply click a button to confirm or deny their adult status, which is what the KJM stands for in Germany. With IDCheck.io, IDnow is pleased to offer yet another solution for online age verification, which has been rated positively by the KJM. With our broad range of identity verification methods, IDnow remains a strong partner for the protection of minors, especially in the gaming and gambling space,“ says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>

<p>Legacy architectures of monolithic applications are difficult to change, expensive to maintain and may pose business risks. In December 2022, Southwest airlines cancelled more than <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2022/12/30/southwest-airlines-cancellations-minimal-as-normal-returns/#google_vignette">13,000 flights due to outdated software systems and IT infrastructure</a>. This meltdown resulted in major losses for the airline company, damaging brand reputation. In contrast, Netflix pioneered the microservices architecture and is a market leader in online streaming, having more than 250 million subscribers across more than 200 countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Application modernization allows teams to develop reusable services that will ultimately increase the productivity and support accelerated delivery of new features and functions.</p>



<p>In our last blog post, we outlined our phased modernization approach, starting with runtime/operational modernization and then performing architectural modernization, refactoring monolith into microservices. In this blog, we will do a deep dive into architectural modernization of Java™ 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) applications and explain how <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/mono2micro">IBM Mono2Micro</a>™ tool accelerated the transformation.</p>



<p>The following diagram depicts generic J2EE architecture of a monolithic application. The different components — client-side UI, server-side code and database logic — are tightly coupled and are interdependent. These apps are deployed as a single unit and often result in longer churn time for small changes.</p>







<p>In architectural modernization, the very first step is to decouple client-side UI from server-side components and change the data exchange mechanism from Java objects to JSON.&nbsp;Backend for Front-End (BFF) services make it easier to convert Java objects to JSON or vice-versa.&nbsp;With the front end and backend separation, they can be modernized and deployed independently.</p>







<p>Next step in architectural modernization is to decompose backend code into individually deployable macroservices.</p>







<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/mono2micro">IBM Mono2Micro</a> Tool accelerated the transformation of monolithic application into microservices. IBM Mono2Micro is an AI-based, semi-automated toolset that uses novel machine learning algorithms and a first-of-its-kind code generation technology to assist you in that refactoring journey to full or partial microservices. It analyzes the monolithic application in both a static and dynamic fashion and then provides recommendations for how the monolithic application can be partitioned into groups of classes that can become potential microservices</p>



<p>Here is how Mono2Micro works:</p>







<p>For one of the large financing applications in the CIO portfolio, Mono2Micro provided insights into the code complexity, uncovering the dependencies among classes across partitions and their interactions. </p>



<blockquote>
Mono2Micro saved more than 800 hours of manual effort to assess, redesign and develop the microservices architecture. Setting up Mono2Micro may take 3–4 hours to understand the different components and how these components work together to refactor your monolith. But it’s worth investing a few hours to save hundreds of hours for transforming your monolith to deployable microservices.
</blockquote>



<p>In nutshell, modernization tools like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/mono2micro">IBM Mono2Micro</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/websphere-hybrid?topic=tools-cloud-transformation-advisor">Cloud Transformation Advisor</a> drove faster transformation and promoted cost efficiency, but real differentiators are:</p>



 
 Platform: Right sizing our infrastructure from bloated on-prem virtual machines to cloud-native containers 



 People: Building community of developers to collaborate and create a future-ready culture 
 



<p>Modernization fosters innovation with business agility, enhances system security and simplifies data management. Most importantly, it improves developer productivity while providing cost-efficiency, resiliency and improved customer experience.</p>

<p>Enterprise AI customization is on the rise, with businesses embracing tailored generative AI applications. These applications are designed to meet specific business needs by integrating proprietary data and help to ensure more accurate and relevant responses. This trend signals a move toward more efficient and personalized AI-driven business solutions. For example, a global retail chain might adopt region-specific AI models that are trained on data, such as customer preferences and cultural nuances. This approach results in highly personalized customer interactions.</p>



<p>In Japan, AI prioritizes efficiency and precision, while in Brazil, it emphasizes warmth and engagement, reflecting each market’s cultural values. This trend is expected to extend to various industries, transforming AI from a generic tool into a vital strategic asset. Businesses increasingly rely on AI for customer engagement, operational efficiency and market competitiveness, leading to a dynamic business landscape where AI fuels innovation and addresses specific market and operational challenges.</p>



 2. Open source AI models 



<p>In 2024, open source pretrained AI models gain significant traction, empowering businesses to accelerate growth by combining these models with private or real-time data. This synergy enhances productivity and cost-efficiency. IBM actively contributes to open source AI models, which are exemplified by its collaboration with NASA.</p>



<p>A noteworthy contribution is the geospatial AI foundation model, the largest of its kind on the Hugging Face platform and a pioneering open source AI foundation model created in partnership with NASA. This model expands access to NASA’s earth science data, particularly for geospatial intelligence and advancing climate-related research. Derived from NASA’s satellite data, this model demonstrates the commitment by IBM to use open source technologies for critical areas such as climate change.</p>



<p>By making this model available on Hugging Face, a well-known repository for transformer models, IBM and NASA aim to democratize access and encourage its application in climate and earth science innovations. The model has shown impressive results, achieving a <a href="https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/2023/08/03/ibm-hugging-face-ai-foundation-model-climate-science/">15% improvement over state-of-the-art techniques</a> with only half the labeled data, making it a potent tool for tasks like deforestation tracking, crop yield prediction and greenhouse gas detection and monitoring.</p>



 3. API-driven AI and microservices 



<p>The proliferation of application programming interfaces (APIs) will simplify the creation of complex AI-driven applications, boosting productivity across various sectors. IBM developed a suite of custom AI microservices for a retailer, accessible through APIs. These services included customer behavior analysis, inventory management and personalized marketing tools.</p>



<p>A key feature was the integration of IBM’s AI-powered intelligent assistants into the retailer’s customer service system. These assistants, capable of handling numerous customer inquiries in real time, provided tailored responses based on individual customer data. Additionally, the retailer used IBM’s AI-driven summarization tools to efficiently analyze customer feedback and sales data, enabling swift and informed decision-making. The impact was significant: customer service efficiency improved, marketing strategies became more data-driven and inventory management was optimized. The flexibility and scalability of these API-driven solutions enabled the retailer to adapt rapidly to market changes.</p>

<p>In 2023, the European Union demonstrated its commitment to elevating AI as a national priority by progressing toward the finalization of the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act). This historic legislation represents the world’s inaugural comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence, categorizing AI systems into different risk levels (unacceptable risk, high risk and limited risk) and imposing corresponding obligations.</p>



<p>The EU AI Act legislation represents a significant step in the regulation of AI deployment within the EU, encompassing a wide array of AI applications, ranging from high-risk scenarios like AI usage in sensitive systems such as welfare, employment, education and transport, to low-risk applications like chatbots. Also, the EU AI Act prohibits certain AI applications that are considered to pose unacceptable risks, including the use of emotion recognition in the workplace and social scoring based on social behavior or personal characteristics.</p>



 5. Multimodal generative AI 



<p>Transitioning from text-based generative AI to multimodal language, the integration of text, speech and images promises contextually relevant responses and fosters innovation across diverse sectors. For instance, during a customer service call, AI can analyze a client’s spoken request, interpret their financial documents and assess their facial expressions in a video consultation. By synthesizing these data points (speech, text and visual cues), AI can provide more personalized financial advice and enhance creditworthiness assessments with precision.</p>



 6. AI safety and ethics 



<p>As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, the focus on AI safety and ethics intensifies. Leading AI organizations are collaborating to develop robust AI systems with standardized safety protocols and best practices to help ensure ethical AI usage. IBM and Meta started the AI Safety Alliance to address AI concerns, along with industry leaders like Intel, Oracle, AMD, Dell and the Linux® Foundation. This alliance aims to create alternatives to closed AI systems, foster responsible AI innovation and help ensure scientific rigor, trust, safety, security, diversity and economic competitiveness. It also supports AI hardware growth, advances open AI technology development, and establishes global benchmarks, resources and standards for responsible AI development. This initiative reflects IBM’s commitment to AI safety and ethics, promoting open innovation in AI development.</p>



 Embracing the future: A call to action for the AI-driven world of 2024 



<p>These trends and predictions aren’t mere technological forecasts. They serve as a roadmap for innovation, growth and societal advancement. As AI evolves, it challenges us to rethink not only our business practices but also our interactions with the world. The potential of AI is vast and its impact is just beginning. By staying informed, adaptable and proactive, we can harness the power of AI to build a more efficient, innovative and inclusive future.</p>

<p>Picture this: your business is a dynamic player in your industry at the brink of a pivotal juncture. Struggling with the limitations of conventional approaches, you recognize the imperative to embrace IT-as-a-service to stay ahead, with the infusion of AI becoming the catalyst for change. The result? A revolution across revenue operations, customer engagement, employee satisfaction and the seamless flow of product development and delivery.</p>



<p>Welcome to a new era—where the infusion of AI into every facet of operations is not just an option, but a necessity. We’ve found in this new <a href="https://idcdocserv.com/US51430123">IBM-sponsored IDC white paper</a> that the shift to delivering IT-as-a-service is foundational and extends the strategic transformation of IT infrastructure, adding even more value to the business. In fact, IDC estimates that IT infrastructure-related spending will grow by a modest 4.5% relative to 2022, with the highest being in infrastructure-as-a-service (at 23%) followed by software-as-a-service (SaaS, at 8.4%) and IT services (at 3%).</p>



<p>In my last piece “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/unlock-innovation-today-and-for-tomorrow-with-a-future-ready-digital-infrastructure/">Unlock innovation today and for tomorrow with a future-ready digital infrastructure</a>,” I went into detail around how IBM aims to help our clients make strategic architectural decisions to future-proof their businesses and create enduring value, emphasizing the limitless possibilities through flexible as-a-service solutions for tailored workloads. With this in mind, I want to dive a bit deeper into those four core imperatives that IDC also helped highlight in more detail:</p>



 1. Empowering your hybrid cloud strategy  



<p>A pivotal aspect of modern IT environments blends the cost-efficiency, scalability, privacy and dependability advantages of both private and public clouds. Although more than 77% of decision-makers <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-09-28-Global-Business-Leaders-Say-Hybrid-Cloud-is-Critical-to-Modernization,-Yet-Security,-Skills-and-Compliance-Concerns-Impede-Success">in an IBM study</a> have adopted a hybrid cloud approach, the majority struggle with the complexity of making all their cloud environments work together. Successful hybrid cloud strategies require a unified control and management plane, enabling automated deployment of applications across various environments, comprehensive observability and improved cyber resiliency.</p>



 2. Building confidence in safeguarding data 



<p>Data is the lifeblood of modern businesses, but its movement must be safe and compliant. An IDC survey forecasting the primary reasons for an increase in enterprise storage spending in 2023 cites, “greater data protection needs” was the most selected primary driver by IT decision makers. A unified platform can allow an organization to draw on best-in-class cloud security and regulatory compliance technologies across all environments in a consistent way.</p>



 3. Scaling AI for better business outcomes and impact 



<p>AI has transitioned from peripheral to core business driver, demanding optimized infrastructure for high-performance AI workloads. Overcoming challenges means addressing data ingestion bottlenecks, hybrid cloud AI model distribution, robust model safeguarding through advanced encryption and governance for trustworthiness. As you may have seen recently, IBM and Meta recently <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/AI-Alliance-Launches-as-an-International-Community-of-Leading-Technology-Developers,-Researchers,-and-Adopters-Collaborating-Together-to-Advance-Open,-Safe,-Responsible-AI">launched the AI Alliance</a>—a group of leading organizations across industry, startup, academia, research and government coming together to support open innovation and open science in AI. This reinforces our commitment to create opportunities everywhere that can shape the evolution of AI in ways that better reflect the needs of businesses, but most importantly our society.</p>



 4. Fast-track IT on demand 



<p>The traditional perception of IT as an internal service provider is evolving. Modern IT organizations must shift towards delivering IT on demand, offering a centralized control plane for hybrid cloud services that consume resources as needed. This approach optimizes infrastructure for specific workloads, introduces new technologies seamlessly and ensures agility and scalability.</p>



 The shift to XaaS and the path forward 



<p>Think of your XaaS offerings similarly to dining at your favorite restaurant. When you’re out to eat you’re there for the experience of being out, whether that be with a loved one or catching up with an old friend. You don’t have to worry about hosting, shopping for ingredients, cooking or even the resulting clean up. Instead, you pay for a meal and enjoy the convenience and experience of someone else handling everything. This is what the “fit-for-purpose” model of XaaS is out to achieve. It takes care of the technical aspects, allowing organizations and IT leaders to focus on their core business activities and, most importantly, the clients they serve with a clear focus on the outcomes they are looking for.</p>



<p>In this current landscape, XaaS emerges as a solution that can simplify operations, enhance resilience and accelerate digital transformation. According to IDC, 78% of IT organizations agree that XaaS offerings are a key part of their future strategy. Ultimately, the winners in this digital transformation journey will be those who modernize their IT environments and operating models, leveraging insights from data to optimize workflows, automate productivity and accelerate business outcomes. IBM, with its focus on XaaS and a comprehensive AI and data platform, is poised to be a leader in this transformative era, offering organizations the tools they need to thrive in an ever-changing digital landscape. Delivering IT through an XaaS foundation harnesses the power of flexibility, speed and ease of consumption, with an outcome-driven focus—now, this is the future of our business.</p>

<p>Organizations are increasingly investing in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> as a way to maintain or grow a competitive advantage. Organizations implementing successful business transformations are more likely to grow their existing businesses, eliminate silos, create revenue growth and business models and reinvent how they handle their operations.</p>



<p>A tried-and-true way to approach digital transformation is to understand the relationship customers have with the product and the brand, where that relationship currently falls short, and how it can be improved. Organizations then benefit from looking at industry and technology trends to better decide how to deliver the best possible customer experience to existing and prospective customers.</p>



 3 reasons why digital transformation is tied to business strategy<a></a> 



<p>A digital transformation journey involves the introduction of new technologies—and business processes related to those technologies—to optimize customer experience and improve relationships with other stakeholders. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/rewired-to-outcompete">According to </a><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/rewired-to-outcompete">McKinsey</a>, digital transformation helps disparate organization functions collaborate in new and productive ways. The result is nearly always the same. Digital leaders saw returns on “tangible equity, their P/E ratio, and their total shareholder returns materially more than digital laggards.” Why? There are several reasons why digital transformation and business strategy are so closely tied together:</p>



 1. Changes in customer habits and preferences 



<p>Organizations must respond to customers’ increasing pain points and needs. Customer expectations have changed since the pandemic began and organizations must change to meet them. Digital transformation often creates opportunities to establish new business models and create new products, revolutionize user experience, and help an organization embrace modernization.</p>



 2. The rise of advanced digital technologies 



<p>Technological developments improving organizations include<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation"> </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">quantum computing</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT). The right technology creates an opportunity to create new digital solutions and improve operational efficiency. It also enables an organization to better respond in real-time to competitive challenges.</p>



 3. Increased competition and business pressures 



<p>Existing organizations are under pressure from digital-first startups and other established organizations that have quickly embraced digital transformation initiatives. To maintain their current business value and hopefully grow, organizations must take transformation into their own hands to establish new capabilities as a bulwark against competition and fuel for growth.<br><br>Digital transformation is top of mind for so many organizations and executives because it can contribute to important business outcomes and create increased adaptability in a hyper-competitive marketplace. But what is a digital transformation strategy and how does an organization successfully execute it?</p>

 How to strategically accelerate your digital transformation journey 



 1. Secure executive-level buy-in 



<p>Digital transformation projects are unlikely to succeed if they are not endorsed and driven by executive leadership. There is a reason why digital transformation is often a key component of change management: it completely alters how a business operates. Some leadership teams may need guidance on how digital transformations, which incur upfront and ongoing costs, contribute to business goals and ultimately drive value. </p>



<p>One way to understand digital transformation is to remember it not only pushes a business forward to achieve future goals, it also protects them against competition that is likely undergoing a digital transformation process as well. An organization’s CEO, for example, must work directly with the CIO and other executive suite members to plot how digital transformation will affect their departments, so the organization has a complete picture of what changes will occur and how it will improve the organization’s standing.</p>



 2. Understand the impact 



<p>One must understand that digital transformation is as much an organizational or business transformation as it is a technological one. Comprehensive digital transformation creates a significant cultural change. It addresses workflows to create greater efficiency. It introduces technologies that will fundamentally change employee ways of working, often reducing manual processes while enhancing their decision making and the value they bring. </p>



<p>For example, digital transformation may introduce a suite of digital tools that enhance their decision making. It may replace spreadsheets and word-processing files with centralized online portals, forcing employees to change how they work. However achieving that balance usually requires training and re-orientating many processes, which some long-standing employees may find difficult. That’s why it’s incredibly important to communicate the value of the digital transformation successes and encourage employees to help shape the roadmap to make them successful.</p>



 3. Treat digital transformation as a never-ending process 



<p>Digital transformation is an always-on process. There is a beginning, but no ending, to a successful digital transformation. Organizations that engage in digital transformation will routinely discover new ways to improve, must consistently assess how the process is going, identify which new technologies and external forces impact it and course correct when necessary.</p>



 4. Map out what success looks like 



<p>While digital transformation does not have an end date, individual initiatives within will have milestones and goals. As an example, organizations may move from a telephone-based customer service to a digital innovation like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a> or knowledge-base wikis. By doing so, they should expect resolved customer service issues and customer satisfaction to improve. If the organization is encountering issues with legacy technology, it may need to prioritize<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization"> application modernization</a>. In doing so, an organization should expect downtime and security incidents to decrease, driving increased efficiencies.</p>



 5. Obsessively track results 



<p>Every successful digital transformation involves the establishment of key performance indicators (KPIs) and the rigorous tracking of metrics. That way, the organization understands where they’ve had successes and where they’ve fallen short. Any successful digital transformation must include a robust data analytics component to accurately track successes. </p>



<p>For example, if an organization is looking to improve customer satisfaction, it should benchmark Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores and Net Promoter Scores (NPS) before and after the digital transformation. If it is using digital transformation to change its digital marketing strategy, it should track metrics like return on ad spend (ROAS) and cost per acquisition. By doing so, the organization can ensure the digital transformation is producing results and driving value.</p>



 6. Embrace the ecosystem 



<p>Digital transformation creates digital capabilities that can create <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-transformative-power-of-ecosystem-partnerships/">unlock partnerships within ecosystems</a>. For example, organizations that enable APIs can share real-time information and data with partners to better serve each others’ end customers. For example, an e-commerce organization that pulls in APIs from several payment processors can complete sales with customers regardless of what payment option they prefer.</p>



 7. Find the right partner 



<p>Digital transformations are complex, time consuming and often require an organization to step out of its comfort zone. They have a better chance of succeeding if they<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/companies-need-help-making-the-dream-of-digital-transformation-a-reality/"> </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/companies-need-help-making-the-dream-of-digital-transformation-a-reality/">include the right partner</a> who can using tried-and-true levers to help unlock maximum value.</p>



 A robust digital transformation strategy is worth the investment 



<p>Digital transformation is a powerful tool for any organization looking to improve its relationship with customers and better adapt to an ever-changing world. While digital transformations require investment and ultimately change how an organization conducts its business, there are many benefits if done correctly. Those organizations that succeed at digital transformations will stay ahead of the competition, drive better relationships with employees and customers and be better prepared for what may come in the future.</p>

  <p>Today, I’m excited to share with you several new developments in the journey towards phishing-resistant authentication for all users!&nbsp; This isn’t just essential for compliance with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order&nbsp;14028 on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity</a> but is increasingly critical for the safety of all the orgs and users who bet on digital identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TL;DR? Here’s the cheat sheet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Microsoft Authenticator announces phishing-resistant passkey support. 
 Microsoft Authenticator is FIPS 140 compliant on all platforms. 
 More configuration options for PIV/CAC authentication. 
 FIDO2 support for iOS and MacOS applications. 
 Managed policies help you with “secure by design, secure by default.” 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details below!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Authenticator is becoming phishing-resistant! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/identity-at-microsoft-ignite-securing-access-in-the-era-of-ai/ba-p/2747279">announced</a> at Ignite 2023, in the first half of 2024, Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to register and sign in with device-bound passkeys managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app. This is a cost-effective, phishing-resistant credential available to anyone with the Authenticator app! Passkeys provide you with the latest and greatest security enhancements that will come to the FIDO standard over the next many years – and Authenticator integration lets you take advantage of the security innovations and advanced features Authenticator provides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Passkey managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further enhance Microsoft Authenticator and help customers meet compliance requirements, the Authenticator App on Android is now FIPS-140 compliant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning with version 6.2310.7174, Microsoft Authenticator for Android is&nbsp;compliant with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 140) for all Microsoft Entra authentications using phishing-resistant device-bound passkeys, push multifactor authentications (MFA), passwordless Phone Sign-In (PSI), and time-based one-time passcodes (TOTP).&nbsp;For organizations using Intune Company Portal, install version 5.0.6043.0 in addition to the latest version of the Authenticator for FIPS compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS is already FIPS-140 compliant, as announced in December of 2022.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved configurability for organizations that uses PIV / CAC 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last year since we announced the General Availability of Certificate-based Authentication (CBA), we’ve seen an increase of over 850% in Entra ID CBA usage for US Government customers. CBA helps our customers in their Zero Trust journey, migrating from on-premises IdPs such as AD FS, while continuing to provide familiar end user experience using PIV / CAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continue our investments in cloud-based CBA with recently added capabilities that allow you to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group. You can now select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multifactor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Additional phishing-resistant authentication options for mobile: FIDO2 support for iOS and macOS applications 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 2023, we announced support for <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/advancing-modern-strong-authentication/ba-p/3773135">FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS web browsers</a>. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS . With this release, users who have Microsoft Authenticator installed on iOS or Microsoft Intune Company Portal installed on macOS can sign into Microsoft applications using a FIDO2 security key. This feature is available now on iOS and will be available early next year on macOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO2 authentication is also available in MSAL-enabled third-party apps on iOS and macOS that meet the requirements listed in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/support-fido2-authentication">Support passwordless authentication with FIDO2 keys in apps you develop</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Adopting secure defaults, aligned with “Secure by design, secure by default” approach outlined by CISA 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/">Secure Future Initiative</a>. As part of this initiative, we will start <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=132044">Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies</a>. These initiatives align with the “Secure by design, Secure by default” approach called out by The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to ensure consumers can trust the safety and integrity of the technology that they use every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that tackling cybersecurity challenges is a collective effort. We're dedicated to collaborating closely with government agencies, security experts, and the broader community to strengthen our collective defenses against cyber threats. Our aim is to provide government customers with the tools and knowledge they need to stay ahead of evolving risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent releases and ongoing commitment to enhancing cybersecurity will support our broad set of customers, including the U.S. government customers who are working to meet the Executive Order. Together, we can build a more secure digital future.</p>

  <p>One of the best practices for securing your organization's data is to follow the principle of least privilege, which means granting users the minimum level of permissions they need to perform their tasks. Microsoft Entra ID helps you apply this principle by offering a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">wide range of built-in roles</a> as well as allowing you to create custom roles and assign them to users or groups based on their responsibilities and access needs. You can also use Entra ID to review and revoke any role assignments that are no longer needed or appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be easy to lose track of role assignments if admin activities are not carefully audited and monitored. Routine checks of role assignments and generating alerts on new role assignments are one way to track and manage privileged role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chances are that when a user with privileged roles is approached, they’ll say they need the role. This may be true; however, many times users will unknowingly say they need those permissions to carry out certain tasks when they could be assigned a role with lower permissions. For example, a user will be able to reset user passwords as a Global Administrator, but that does not mean they can’t do that with another role with far less permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Defining privileged permissions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#terminology">Privileged permissions in Entra ID</a> can be defined as “permissions that can be used to delegate management of directory resources to other users, modify credentials, authentication or authorization policies, or access restricted data.” Entra ID roles each have a list of permissions defined to them. When an identity is granted the role, the identity also inherits the permissions defined in the role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to check the permissions of these roles. The permissions defined in all built-in roles can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">here</a>. For example, there are a few permissions that are different for the Privileged Authentication Administrator role than the Authentication Administrator role, giving the former more permissions in Entra ID. The differences between the authentication roles can be viewed <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#compare-authentication-roles">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example of having differences between similar roles is for the end user administration roles. The differences and nuances between these roles are outlined in detail <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#who-can-reset-passwords">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Auditing activity 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To decide if a user really needs a role, it’s crucial to monitor their activities and find the role with the least privilege that allows them to carry out their work. You’ll need Entra ID audit logs for this. Entra ID audit logs can either be sent to a Log Analytics Workspace or connected to a Sentinel instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two methods that can be used to get the events of carried out by admin accounts. The first will make use of the IdentityInfo table, which is only available in Sentinel after enabling User and Entity Behavior Analytics (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/enable-entity-behavior-analytics">UEBA</a>). If you aren’t using UEBA in Sentinel or if you’re querying a Log Analytics Workspace, then you'll need to use the second method in the next heading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using Microsoft Sentinel 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ingest Entra ID audit logs into Microsoft Sentinel, the Microsoft Entra ID data connector must be enabled, and the Audit Logs must be ticked as seen below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1 Entra ID data connector in Sentinel with Audit logs enabled&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IdentityInfo table stores user information gathered by UEBA. Therefore, it also includes the Entra ID roles a user has been assigned. This makes it very simple to get a list of accounts that have been assigned privileged roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query below will give a unique list of activities an account has taken, as well as which roles the account has been assigned:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs 
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(90d) 
| extend ActorName = iif( 
                         isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                     ) 
| extend ActorID = iif( 
                       isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                   ) 
| where isnotempty(ActorName) 
| join (IdentityInfo 
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d) 
    | where strlen(tostring(AssignedRoles)) &gt; 2 
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by AccountUPN 
    | project AccountObjectId, AssignedRoles) 
    on $left.ActorID == $right.AccountObjectId 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, Identity, tostring(AssignedRoles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, AssignedRoles, Operations, OperationsCount, ActorID, Identity 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will give results for all accounts that carried out tasks in Entra ID and may generate too many operations that were not privileged. To filter for specific Entra ID roles, the following query can be run where the roles are defined in a list. Three roles have been added as examples, but this list can and should be expanded to include more roles:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let PrivilegedRoles = dynamic(["Global Administrator", 
                               "Security Administrator", 
                               "Compliance Administrator"

                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"])

<p>Once the query is run, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant and what roles those accounts have. In the example below, the top two results don’t pose any problems. However, the third row contains a user that has the Global Administrator role and has created a service principal. The permissions needed to create a service principal can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, this user can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because there is no table that contains the roles an identity has been granted, you’ll need to add the list of users to the query and filter them. There are multiple ways to get a list of users who have been assigned a specific Entra ID role. A quick way to do this is to go to Entra ID and then select Roles and administrators. From there, select the role and export the identities that have been assigned to it. It’s important to have the User Principal Names (UPNs) of the privileged users. You’ll need to add these UPNs, along with the roles the user has, to the query. Some examples have been given in the query itself. If the user has more than one role, then all roles must be added to the query.</p>

                                tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                                tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                            ) 
        | extend ActorID = iif( 
                            isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                            tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                            tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                        ) 
        | where isnotempty(ActorName) ) on $left.UserPrincipalName == $right.ActorName 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, tostring(Roles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, Operations, OperationsCount, Roles, ActorID 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you run the query, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant by the users you have filtered for. In the example below, the top two results can cause problems. Both have the Global Administrator role, but their operations don’t necessitate to have that role. The permissions needed for these operations can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, these users can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4 Actions taken by users in Entra ID</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this user still requires the Global Administrator role then the Security Administrator role will become redundant as the Global Administrator contains more permissions than the Security Administrator role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping accounts with privileges that are not required is keeping your attack surface greater than it needs to be. By ingesting Entra ID Audit logs, you can query and identify users who have unnecessary and over-privileged roles. You can then find a suitable alternative role for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital wallets are necessary but not nearly sufficient for effective verifiable credentials. Here I look at the essential details for verifying credentials that have nothing to do with wallets.</p>
<p>We use metaphors to make sense of novel phenomena in everyday terms. In technology, successful metaphors reduce non-intuitive concepts to concise, clear mental images. Metaphors shape how we think about things (noting that shape is itself a metaphor!)</p>
<p>Really catchy metaphors can capture our imagination to the extent that we stop thinking about how things really work. A powerful metaphor can distract instead of illuminate.</p>
<p>For example, the passport metaphor has dominated digital identity. In the early 2000s, Microsoft even named its e-commerce single-sign-on service “Passport”. It has taken the industry many years to wean itself off the single global identifier implied by that metaphor and graduate to a more nuanced model of contextualised credentials (see also “<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/no-such-thing-as-a-passport">No such thing as a passport</a>”).</p>
<p>So now I wonder if the popular metaphor of digital wallets is similarly diverting attention from the important work that needs to be done to make verifiable credentials truly verifiable at scale. </p>
<p>Renowned payments and digital identity commentator David Birch sees digital wallets as “<a href="https://dgwbirch.com/speaker/">the central organising principle for consumers [in the metaverse]</a>”. But I think the real organisation of payments and credentials is done well outside the digital wallet.</p>
<p>Digital wallets are certainly necessary, as personally controlled stores of credentials and secure carriers of our all-important private keys. The wallet is the graphical user interface to what is essentially a container of credentials and private keys. But wallets are not nearly sufficient to enable digital credentials to be meaningful and verifiable. If we focus too much on the container then we may overlook where the hard work remains to be done.</p>
 What are wallets for? 
<p>The wallet metaphor of course is all about cards. Our traditional wallets hold lots of them: payment cards, driver licences, government and professional IDs, employee IDs, transit cards, health cards, student cards, loyalty cards, club membership cards and so on. Most of these are candidates for analog-to-digital conversion.&nbsp; Indeed, payment cards and driver licences are the leading examples of cryptographically verifiable credentials. The Apple and Google wallets started with payments and are now adding driver licences (slowly and carefully).</p>
<p>Digital wallets will become quasi-standard doorways into much of cyberspace, <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202302/digital-wallets-to-be-as-essential-as-browsers-openwallet-foundation-calls-for-builders">perhaps as crucial as web browsers</a> have been. With big tech poised to monopolise the way consumers exercise their digital credentials, the “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2023/02/01/the-wallet-wars-are-not-about-money-they-are-about-identity/?sh=149889fe314a">wallet wars</a>” are looming.</p>
 The real action is outside the wallet and beyond the cards! 
<p>Credit cards are a modern-day miracle when you think about it: I can present an Australian credit card to almost any merchant in almost any country to buy most anything.&nbsp; The merchant doesn’t know me but what really matters is it doesn’t need to know my bank either or anything at all about the Australian financial system.</p>
<p>How is it possible? The answer illuminates the real role of the card and wallet, and the unsung power of the business networks.</p>
<p>A credit card is just a container of data which is issued by a customer’s bank and which needs to be conveyed to the merchant’s bank. It is clearly one instance of a general pattern: the card carries data about its holder, provided by a recognised issuer, to be presented to and ingested by a relying party.</p>
<p>But there is more to the story than carrying data. The essential complexity goes unnoticed by cardholders and extends way beyond the card:</p>
 
 card manufacture and customisation, in specially managed secure production plants 
 secure distribution and activation of cards (not to mention the test of the card lifecycle including renewal, replacement and retirement) 
 anti-counterfeiting technology to assure the merchant that the card presented is valid 
 a choice of standardised interface technologies for presenting cards to diverse retail systems (e.g. merchant terminals, kiosks, and remote card-not-present arrangements) 
 and above all, the legal and business arrangements whereby branded cards are accepted by merchants and payments then cleared between customer and merchant banks. 
 
<p>So a wallet is just a container of containers.</p>
 The network effects 
<p>Card schemes are more about business networks than the cards.</p>
<p>A card scheme operates a two-sided network which caters to both cardholders and merchants, via their respective banks. The scheme sets a raft of participation rules for the issuance of cards to customers and the acceptance of cards by merchants.</p>
<p>Cardholders and merchants are joined to the scheme via their respective banks. An issuing bank creates credit accounts for its customers and issues branded cards under a given scheme, such as Mastercard or Visa.</p>
<p>An acquiring bank provides merchants with credit card acceptance equipment and/or software services under a standardised merchant services agreement and takes care of the payment processing.</p>
<p>(A credit card acquirer does a whole lot more, such as providing payment guarantees, deposit timing, additional layers of security and fraud controls, to name a few, but these extras do not concern us right now; the current discussion is just about card acceptance.)</p>
 What made digital credit cards so much better? 
<p>The credit card has just one job to do: securely convey a copy of the cardholder’s details to the merchant together with signals to give the merchant confidence that the customer presenting the card is legitimate.</p>
<p>Over several decades, credit card technology has evolved to make the presentation of cardholder details more reliable, especially in regards to theft and illicit replay or tampering.</p>
<p>Old fashioned magnetic stripe cards store cardholder data in a short ferrite tape, much like a cassette tape stores music. There is no encryption; the data is held in a standard plaintext format, making it easily scanned and copied using commonplace equipment. This is what enabled large scale criminal skimming and carding to take over customer accounts.</p>
<p>Chip cards are very different, in two respects. Firstly, they carry cardholder details in a data structure that is digitally signed by the issuing bank when the card is manufactured, thus proving that each credit card is original and genuine.</p>
<p>And secondly, when cardholder details are transferred to a merchant terminal in a transaction, they are dynamically signed by the chip, thus proving that the card has been unlocked (it won’t operate to produce the signed transaction otherwise) and is therefore likely to be in the right hands.</p>
<p>The static and dynamic cryptographic functions make counterfeiting or copying chip cards infeasible.</p>
<p>Upgrading credit cards from magnetic stripe to chip was the single most important enhancement in the history of card payment security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile virtual credit cards share the same cryptographic security techniques as chip cards, but the crucial details are hidden from the cardholder; all they see is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph">skeuomorphic</a> wallet user interface and its familiar images.</p>
 The lessons of credit cards for verifiable credentials 
<p>As mentioned, digital wallets are getting all the attention in the move to cryptographically verifiable credentials.&nbsp; But why do we spend so much time designing digital experience and trust frameworks around a component that has played no part in system security?</p>
<p>Why do we bother with the wallet metaphor at all? Real world wallets are actually an uninteresting part of the payments system.</p>
<p>It is the credit card network that critically enables digital credentials from vetted issuers to be securely loaded to a customer’s card.</p>
<p>Being prepared to accept credentials requires extensive arrangements to be made in advance, including knowing what types of credentials to expect, and having the right public keys with which to verify the various digital signatures on the credentials and the presentations.</p>
<p>It’s this last aspect that needs the most attention for verifiable credentials to scale. Verifiable credentials need to be legible when the RP is at arms’ length from the issuer and can’t afford to make its own arrangements regarding all the different credentials and issuers, and which of them are fit for purpose.</p>
<p>I agree wallets are important, yet carrying cards is the easy part of payments and credentialing systems. The wallet metaphor does not illuminate much of the real problem to be solved in verifiable credentials, omitting the essential underlying infostructure needed to (a) load the right verifiable credentials from the many issuers coming onto the market, and (b) make credentials legible at scale.</p>

 An increase in candidate fraud is presenting a real risk for the HR industry, especially for remote recruiters. We delve into the history of document fraud, and explain how businesses can protect themselves from the different types of hiring fraud. 



 



<p>In 1934, Albert Einstein wrote: “Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief interest of all technical endeavors.” Although he was likely referring to his discoveries of the atom, and what, just a few years later, was to become the atomic bomb, Einstein’s quote also sums up the responsibility of those who create and rely on the latest technological advances. Thanks to the rapid pace at which the world has gone digital, technological innovation has produced risks that must be navigated in every industry, even in the recruitment sector.  </p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/document-fraud/">Document fraud</a> has always existed, from the earliest days of identity documents. For example, in 16th century France during the reign of François I the emergence of the first attempts to curb this already widespread scourge started occurring when people falsified their identity papers to avoid paying taxes. According to Christophe Naudin in his publication Document fraud: the explosion of a cross-disciplinary crime at the crossroads of all forms of trafficking he states,&nbsp;“To avoid paying tithes and gabelles (taxes for the church and for common goods), Jean du Moulin, who generally signed his name with a simple anonymous cross, claimed to be called Jean Meunier or Jean Blanc or Leblanc, or even Moulinier, swearing before God and all his saints that he had fulfilled his duties.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document fraud is one of those reprehensible acts that persist and mutate constantly, despite the inventiveness and ongoing technological advances developed to curb it. Thanks to the democratization of digital tools, the explosion in mobility and widespread access to the Internet, this type of crime is becoming increasingly popular among unscrupulous individuals who are prepared to falsify documents and information to achieve their ends. And the HR industry is no exception…</p>



 Understanding the different types of hiring fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>To grasp the impact of document fraud on recruiters and companies likely to hire a fraudster, it is necessary to understand the risks, and therefore the types of fraud.</p>



 Application fraud. 



<p>Application fraud refers to any information provided by the candidate that is invented or altered by him or her. Examples include, falsifying the ability to speak a foreign language, lying about experience abroad or exaggerating involvement in a project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Difficult to identify when reading a CV or application file, application fraud is nevertheless easily detectable when the candidate is confronted with his or her lie during an interview or the first few days on the job. For example, a simple foreign-language proficiency test during the interview will suffice to reveal the fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often of low intensity, application fraud is extremely widespread: in 2022, 62% of recruiters in France admitted to having already observed falsified CVs during recruitment. However, application fraud often only materializes through slight alterations, with the “enormities” rarely going unnoticed. The final risk for the recruiter is therefore relatively low.</p>



 Document fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>Document fraud involves the creation or use of falsified documents by the candidate. This may include forging identity documents, falsifying diplomas or forging credentials. It differs from application fraud in that the fraudulent candidate will attempt to “justify” the invented information by producing documents attesting to the accuracy of the lie in question. In some cases, it may also involve identity theft. According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, a fraud scheme can <a href="https://www.acfe.com/-/media/files/acfe/pdfs/rttn/2022/2022-report-to-the-nations.pdf">last 12 months before detection and costs companies a loss of $8,300 a month</a>. </p>



<p>This method of fraud is becoming increasingly widespread, facilitated by the use of technological tools (not to mention the use of Artificial Intelligence). Today, easy access to DarkWeb platforms, for example, enables anyone to obtain false papers for just a few hundred euros. Such is the democratization that it is now possible to find resellers of false identity papers on mainstream applications, such as SnapChat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document fraud, unlike application fraud, is a major challenge for a growing number of institutional and private players. Mainly centered around the falsification and creation of false identity documents (CNI, passport, etc.) or proof of identity (invoices, transport tickets, etc.), it presents a significant multi-factorial risk for end employers:</p>



<p>Legal: the irregularity of certain documents, particularly identity documents, can lead to severe legal consequences for the final employer: closure of the company, criminal liability of the director or even substantial fines. In France, regulations place the responsibility for verifying identity and professional documents on the employer, particularly in the event of an incident involving the fraudulent employee.</p>



<p>Reputational: The reputational stakes for companies that fall victim to fraud can be substantial. Organizations that are perceived as exploiting vulnerable, irregular or law-breaking workers risk damage to their brand image, which is sometimes more damaging than a simple fine.</p>



<p>Regulatory: In some sectors, companies require licenses or authorizations to operate. The employment of illegal workers can lead to the revocation of these licenses or authorizations, and seriously hinder company operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to document fraud having been identified as a critical issue by a growing number of players, there has been an increase in the number of training courses and job openings aimed at combating it, both within institutions and private companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because it is the main threat facing recruiters today, document fraud and its implications for recruitment processes will be the main focus.</p>



 Document fraud and legal obligations.&nbsp; 



<p>When it comes to recruitment in the EU, each country is regulated by law, and can be subject to regular checks by various government bodies. For example, the recruitment of an illegal worker can have a severe impact on a company, even if the latter demonstrates in good faith that it was unaware of the fraud.&nbsp;Plus, it is the company’s right to <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/human-resources/employment-contracts/employment-terms/index_en.htm">ask a potential employee their abilities such as foreign language skills</a> as long as they correlate to the job posting.</p>



<p>This legislative and jurisprudential framework is constantly evolving and requires dedicated regulatory monitoring.&nbsp;Even in the UK, Crowe, a UK-based accountancy firm along with the University of Portsmouth, <a href="https://www.crowe.com/uk/croweuk/-/media/Crowe/Firms/Europe/uk/CroweUK/PDF-publications/The-Real-Cost-of-Recruitment-Fraud-2019.ashx?la=en-GB&amp;hash=1EFDFE2F6EEFFC4C71781638A0B8A354DAA00404">carried out Resume and CV checks</a> of an unnamed organization’s 5,000 employees and found 80% contained discrepancies, with 20% using inflated job titles and 12% falsifying educational grades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To deal with these threats while complying with European regulations (notably the GDPR), technological solutions have emerged to facilitate the work of recruiters. Optical character recognition (OCR) technology is at the heart of these solutions. But the democratization of technologies enabling the falsification or creation of documents that can be used as proof of identity (passports, proof of residence, licenses, etc.) now requires the implementation of more robust, granular and detailed processes and solutions, in order to get to know candidates properly.</p>



<p>To this end, IDnow has developed various technical solutions to respond to these new threats:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/capture-solutions/">Real-time document capture</a>: using a web or mobile SDK that can be easily integrated into an existing interface, this increases the level of security while saving considerable time thanks to its many advantages (real-time photo or video capture, fluid, multi-channel UX, NFC chip reading, etc.).&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">Facial recognition and live detection</a>: biometric face capture enables us to use a video verification to ensure that the user is who they claim to be on their documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/verification-documents/">Instant document verification</a>: as a stand-alone API or integrated into an architecture, it enables virtually instantaneous verification (averaging 12 seconds) of the authenticity and validity of documents submitted.&nbsp;  



<p>These solutions enable recruiters to detect document fraud, and are capable of detecting the most elaborate forgeries.</p>



 Identifying the right solution: what are the key criteria?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Numerous solutions, such as those from IDnow, have appeared over the last 10 years to enable recruiters to work while protecting their companies from fraud. But are all solutions the same?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finding the right solution involves more than a simple economic calculation. It must offer a number of advantages, which can be prioritized as follows:</p>



  Reliability: The reliability of the tests carried out by the identity verification solution is the main criterion recruiters should aim for. The solution must provide its user with guarantees as to the results provided.&nbsp;  Transversality: The solution should incorporate the latest technologies for advanced fraud detection, with the option of live detection, face-matching or state-of-the-art occlusion techniques. It should also include the option of additional expert checks.&nbsp;  Flexibility: The solution should offer a wide range of options in terms of the type and range of documents covered, enabling checks to be customized according to the candidate’s profile, the documents provided, the employer’s expectations and the relevant regulatory framework.&nbsp;  Speed: It’s important that the solution delivers fast, near-instantaneous results, so as not to overburden the recruitment process and congest the recruitment department.&nbsp;  Rationality: The solution should meet the economic constraints of the recruiter and its organization, and be adapted to its needs: volume of candidates, frequency of recruitment, type of checks required, etc.  



<p>To meet these challenges, IDnow has developed a range of solutions and tools tailored to the risks identified. Using the established typology, here’s how IDnow addresses the issues identified:</p>



  Reliability: With 99.9% document fraud detection reliability, IDnow’s remote identity verification solution brings peace of mind to its users. In case of doubt, fraud experts can intervene to verify or complete the analysis made by the automatic solution.&nbsp;  Transversality: Based on the latest technologies in terms of occlusion, live detection and face matching, IDnow’s solutions are constantly updated by teams of dedicated document fraud experts to identify the latest fraud trends.&nbsp;  Flexibility: The IDnow solution can be customized, enabling recruiters to adjust their checks intuitively and efficiently.&nbsp;  Speed: with an average processing time of 12 seconds, the speed of verification brings unrivaled fluidity to recruitment, particularly in the case of high volumes.&nbsp;  Rationality: Available in several formats and options, the IDnow sales team is committed to offering its customers and partners solutions tailored to their needs and budgets.

  <p>Let’s continue our discussion on preventing data exfiltration. In previous blogs, we shared Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/apply-zero-trust-principles-to-authentication-session-management/ba-p/3615343">approach to securing authentication sessions</a> with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> (CAE) and discussed <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/how-tenant-restrictions-v2-can-be-used-to-prevent-data/ba-p/3915339">securing cross-tenant access</a> with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/tenant-restrictions-v2#step-4-set-up-tenant-restrictions-v2-on-your-corporate-proxy">Tenant Restrictions v2</a>. Today our topic is stolen authentication artifacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stolen authentication artifacts – tokens and cookies – can be used to impersonate the victim and gain access to everything the victim had access to. Up until a few years ago, token theft was a rare attack and was most often exercised by corporate Red Teams. Why? Because it’s simpler to steal a password than a cookie. However, with multifactor authentication (MFA) becoming more prevalent, we’re seeing real-life attacks involving artifact theft and replay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before diving into details, it’s important to note that Microsoft recommends that the first line of defense against token theft is protecting your devices by deploying endpoint protections, device management, phishing-resistant MFA, and antimalware, as described in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/11/16/token-tactics-how-to-prevent-detect-and-respond-to-cloud-token-theft/">Token tactics: How to prevent, detect, and respond to cloud token theft | Microsoft Security Blog</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let’s discuss types of authentication artifacts and what techniques are recommended for each type to minimize the impact of theft. All authentication artifacts can be roughly divided into two buckets:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Sign-in session artifacts, maintain single sign-on (SSO) and app state between the client and Entra ID. 
 Apps session artifacts, grant data access to client applications. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be obvious that the first priority would be protecting the most powerful device SSO artifacts - <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token">Primary Refresh Tokens</a> (PRT). The good news is that PRTs on all operating system&nbsp;platforms have been hardened against theft from day one. The level of protection depends on operated system capabilities, with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/concept-primary-refresh-token#how-is-the-prt-protected">Windows offering the strongest protection</a>. PRT protection is not controllable by policy and is always on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Offering similar protection for all artifacts is on our roadmap, but delivering these capabilities is going to be a multi-year journey. If you want to learn more about various challenges of building comprehensive protection against token theft, watch this <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/library/presentation/usa/2022/token%20theft%20hip%20kids%20are%20doing%20it%20now%20what%20are%20we%20going%20to%20do%20about%20it">RSA presentation</a>. In the meantime, you can reduce token theft by carefully orchestrating Entra ID security products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing token theft of sign-in session artifacts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/public-preview-token-protection-for-sign-in-sessions/ba-p/3815756#:~:text=Token%20Protection%20ensures%20that%20tokens%20can%20only%20be,users%20and%20data%20against%20breaches%20involving%20token%20theft.">Conditional Access: Token protection policy</a>&nbsp;offers cryptographic protection against replay of stolen tokens. This feature leverages and builds on top of already existing cryptographic protections of PRTs. When token protection policy is on, use of unprotected sign-in sessions is blocked. In combination with PRT protection always being on, it extends cryptographic protection to all renewable artifacts. Token protection is in public preview for Office and Outlook on Windows. Start in report-only mode first to evaluate the impact for your organization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Client Applications that are not yet in scope of token protection can be protected by enabling <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-compliant-network">compliant network check</a> for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access">Entra Global Secure Access</a>. This policy will ensure that authentication artifacts always come from your organization’s network. It means that stolen tokens can only be replayed from your organization’s network, thus significantly reducing blast radius of the attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing token theft of app session artifacts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on your network configuration, you might be able block usage of stolen access tokens and workload cookies outside of your corporate network by using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-location">Conditional Access: Block access by location</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation-strict-enforcement">strictly enforce location policies for continuous access evaluation (CAE)</a>. This new CAE enforcement mode blocks access from outside allowed IP ranges, thus blocking any usage of stolen tokens from outside your network and significantly reducing blast radius of the attack. To take advantage of this capability, your users must access both Entra ID and workloads from enumerable IP addresses. CAE strictly enforce locations policy can be enforced for corpnet users accessing data via Entra Global Secure Access (GSA) because Entra GSA is able to pass along IP address of user’s device. When configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/security/conditional-access-framework#named-locations">Named Locations</a> in Conditional Access (CA), make sure to include range of IP addresses from which your users access both Entra ID and workloads (e.g. SharePoint Online).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Detecting token theft 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To detect stolen artifacts, you can enable risk detections with Microsoft Entra ID Protection to elevate user risk when token theft is suspected. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#anomalous-token">Anomalous token</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#token-issuer-anomaly">token issuer anomaly</a>, and adversary in the middle detections can be indicative of token theft. Each detection is calculated offline, whereas anomalous token can also be calculated in real-time at sign-in to catch the threat and flag the sign in as compromised. To take full advantage of these detections, we recommend configuring <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-policies">risk-based access policies</a>&nbsp;to ensure your users have the proper policy controls applied when token theft is suspected. When risk-based access policies are applied against token theft detections, it forces the user to complete multifactor authentication and reset their password, and when applicable, require an admin to revoke user tokens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation">Continuous Access Evaluation</a> works together with risk-based access policies to block resource access with tainted artifacts. When user risk increases, CAE issues signals to all CAE-capable workloads to enforce risk-based access policy immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As token theft attacks are becoming more prevalent Microsoft constantly improves defenses against such attacks. Stay tuned for new updates in this area soon.</p>

As we express our gratitude to everyone who has been with Metadium in 2023, we would like to take a moment to review and summarize the key achievements and developments from the past six months before launching our new goals for&nbsp;2024.</p> Summary   From October to December 2023, 10,191,291 transactions and 41,912 DID wallets were&nbsp;created.  Bokbunja hard fork was successfully applied to the&nbsp;mainnet.  Metadium Mainnet Explorer was renewed following Bokbunja Hard&nbsp;Fork.  The staking contract for Metadium Governance was upgraded.  Announcements were made regarding changes in BP and FeeCollector addresses, staking amounts, and META circulating supply.   Technology Updates:  Q4 Monthly Transactions <p>During the fourth quarter of 2023, there were f 10,191,291 transactions, and 41,912 DID wallets were created.(as of January&nbsp;2nd).</p> Launch of Wepublic&nbsp;Wallet <p>The existing DID wallet service, MYKEEPIN, was renewed and rebranded as Wepublic Wallet. Metadium’s DID technology was implemented in Wepublic Wallet, contributing to Wepublic DAO participants’ identity verification protocol.</p><p>Wepublic supports four decentralized protocols: identity proofing, credentialing, result proofing, and balance proofing. Metadium aims to enhance transparency in society and services within the DAO platform ecosystem by utilizing blockchain technology.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/mykeepin-renewal-open-with-wepublic-wallet-and-adding-dao-functionality-6d733c3f5ad3">here</a>.   Explorer Renewal <p>With the Bokbunja Hard Fork on October 31, the Metadium Mainnet Explorer was renewed. The Explorer was redesigned for improved functionality and usability, serving as the foundation to provide better services to the Community.</p><p>The renewal included a visually comfortable design, easy confirmation of transactions and DID creations, a reflection of Bokbunja Hard Fork details, adding the Name Tag&nbsp;feature.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-explorer-renewal-5db583d05b8a">here</a>.   Bokbunja Hard&nbsp;Fork <p>On October 31, at 12 PM, the Bokbunja Hard Fork was successfully implemented on the mainnet -this groundbreaking upgrade aimed to enhance the Metadium network by introducing features, including fee delegation.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-update-bokbunja-hard-fork-8147ea32080e">here</a>.   Governance BP&nbsp;Upgrade <p>The staking contract is where Metadium governance members store their staking assets. A bulk transfer of staking assets was carried out to upgrade the staking contract. All the assets within the staking contract were transferred to the BP1 node wallet, serving as the contract owner. The total staking amount within the BP1 node wallet was subsequently moved to the newly upgraded staking contract.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-governance-upgrade-dabc9cc693a7">here</a>.   BP Staking Contract Asset&nbsp;Transfer <p>Assets were transferred to standardize the number of staking contracts to 5 million. If the BP quantity exceeded 5 million, the excess amount was unstaked and withdrawn. If the BP quantity was less than 5 million, an additional deposit was made for the insufficient quantity. The remaining amount was transferred to a non-circulating wallet that does not contribute to the circulating supply. Throughout this process, there was a change in the total staking&nbsp;amount.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/bp-staking-contract-asset-movement-amount-320b2e32126e">here</a>.   BP, FeeCollector Address Change and Circulating Supply&nbsp;Update <p>Voter addresses of BPs were changed, and the address of FeeCollector was registered. This change aimed to separate Voter addresses from Staker addresses and directed transaction fees to accumulate in the FeeCollector’s address.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-mainnet-bp-update-details-b775447240dc">here</a>.   Business Partnerships:  Purchasing META for THEPOL&nbsp;Rewards <p>THEPOL purchases META from the market to use as a reward for app users. As the number of THEPOL users and activities increases, the reward demand grows, and THEPOL buys additional META from the market. This signifies the growth of Metadium’s DApp in&nbsp;action.</p>  Find more information <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/thepol-has-bought-metadium-meta-to-use-as-a-user-reward-f4722257f047">here</a>.

 Summary 
<p>SelfKey DAO is on a mission to revolutionize the world of digital identity management and it needs your help to spread the word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of its community-driven approach, SelfKey DAO has introduced the Marketing POD—a dynamic initiative that empowers volunteers to play a vital role in spreading excitement about the project.</p>
<p>In this article, we will delve into the details of the Marketing POD, token generation for social activities, essential guidelines, legal requirements, and the significance of SELF tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's embark on this journey to understand how you can contribute to SelfKey DAO's mission and claim SELF tokens while doing so.</p>
 The Marketing POD: An Introduction 
<p>The Marketing POD is an exciting new initiative within SelfKey DAO, designed to harness the power of the community in promoting the project's goals and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Marketing POD volunteer, you'll have the opportunity to make a significant impact by sharing your enthusiasm for SelfKey DAO with the world. But how exactly can you get involved? Let's explore the steps to kickstart your journey.</p>
 Token Generation for Social Activities 
<p>One of the core features of the Marketing POD is the ability for participants to claim SELF tokens for specific social media activities. SELF tokens are an essential component of the SelfKey DAO ecosystem, and by participating in the Marketing POD, you may claim them while contributing to the project's success. Here's how it works:</p>
 Have a SelfKey.iD 
<p>To get started, you must have a SelfKey.iD, which serves as your gateway to participation. If you don't have one yet, you can easily obtain it by following <a href="https://app.selfkey.org/?utm_source=the_selfKey_DAO_marketing_POD&amp;utm_medium=textClick&amp;utm_campaign=selfkey_article&amp;utm_id=selfkey_article">this link</a>.</p>
 Spread Excitement 
<p>Your primary role as a Marketing POD volunteer is to share your excitement about SelfKey DAO with the world through social media. You can create posts on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram to promote SelfKey DAO and its mission.</p>
 Eligibility for SELF Tokens 
<p>Your efforts won't go unnoticed! Depending on the impact of your social media activities, you may be eligible to claim SELF tokens as a sign of appreciation for your dedication.</p>
 Accumulating SELF Tokens 
<p>Now let's talk about how you may claim your SELF tokens. By posting about SelfKey DAO on social media (platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram), you have the opportunity to accumulate SELF tokens. Here's how it works:</p>
 Initial Post 
<p>Create an original post about SelfKey DAO, present it to SelfKey DAO via a support ticket, and if the post is according to the guidelines, you may claim one SELF token. You can post as many posts as you want, if they are within the guidelines (see below), they might be accepted.</p>
 One-Week Check-In 
<p>Return after one week, provide proof that your initial post is still visible, and you may accumulate one more SELF token.</p>
 Engagement Bonus 
<p>You may claim an additional 0.1 SELF token for every one point of engagement on your post. Engagement includes views, likes, shares, or comments.</p>
<p>Please note that the actual number of SELF tokens you can accumulate is at the sole discretion of SelfKey DAO. It's essential to understand that the Marketing POD is an experimental initiative. Therefore, the results mentioned here may be subject to change.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are other ways you can participate in initiatives opened by SelfKey DAO to accumulate SELF tokens. If you’d like to learn more, please follow <a href="https://selfkey.org/how-to-qualify-for-self-selfkey-dao-bug-bounty/">this link</a>.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The Marketing POD of SelfKey DAO presents an exciting opportunity for you to actively contribute to the project's success, all while accumulating SELF tokens as a sign of appreciation for your efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By following the guidelines and legal requirements, you can play a crucial role in spreading the word about SelfKey DAO and its mission.</p>
<p>Remember, participation in the Marketing POD is about creativity, engagement, and adherence to the principles outlined in the <a href="https://app.selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-governance-agreement">SelfKey DAO Legal Documents</a> and Marketing POD Guidelines. Make sure to stay updated with any changes and always act responsibly and ethically when representing SelfKey DAO in your social media activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your commitment can make a significant difference in advancing the world of digital identity management.</p>

<p>In this article, we explore the vLEI (verifiable Legal Entity Identifier) and KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure). KERI is the technology that vLEI is built on.</p>
 What is vLEI? 
<p>vLEI is a new form of digitized organizational identity representing a secure digital form of a conventional LEI. To understand these concepts first, we have published <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/" title="articles introducing both LEI and vLEI">articles introducing both LEI and vLEI</a>.</p>
<p>vLEI is also an implementation of Verifiable Credentials, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials-understanding-key-principles/" title="read our introduction on the concept of Verifiable Credentials">read our introduction on the concept of Verifiable Credentials</a>. In short, “verifiable” means each vLEI credential has cryptographic proof that enables a recipient or Verifier to cryptographically verify its integrity and authenticity.</p>
 What is KERI? 
<p>KERI is a modern Distributed Key Management System (DKMS) and is the protocol on which vLEI is built.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll look at how vLEI builds on the KERI architecture and what the most important KERI features are for vLEI.</p>
 &nbsp;KERI Architecture 
<p>This diagram represents a typical KERI architecture for vLEI. See below for a description of each term included in the diagram.</p>
<p></p>
 Signify Client 
<p>The end user or controller uses a Signify Client instance to perform KERI operations. Only the Signify Client has access to the private keys of the controller. It implements a “Signing at the edge” concept where the private keys are never exposed outside the context of the Signify Client. The Signify Client adds controller signatures to key event log entries.</p>
<p>Signify Client is not an end user application itself. Instead, it is a library that is embedded as a component in other applications, such as mobile wallets, web applications etc.</p>
 KERI Agent 
<p>This is the backend of a Signify Client. The KERI Agent manages the key event logs of each Signify Client and publishes signed key event logs to witnesses.</p>
 Witness Network 
<p>A KERI Witness receives key event logs with controller signatures from KERI Agents. For authenticity, the witness adds witness signatures to the key events, then makes the key event logs available to Verifiers.</p>
 Verifier 
<p>A controller uses Signify Client to create digital signatures and to send presentations of verifiable credentials to Verifiers. The Verifier will access key event logs provided by KERI Witnesses when verifying digital signatures and credential presentations. Comparing key event logs from multiple witnesses lets the Verifier mitigate against duplicity and other types of threats against key event logs.</p>
<p>Many types of applications can act as Verifiers. For example, Verifier functionality could be integrated in the backend of a web application or in document management systems where signatures of signed documents are verified.</p>
 KERI Features 
<p>The KERI key management system has many features. Below I expand on some of the most important features for vLEI.</p>
 Key management 
<p>Key management is the main function of KERI. Key management solves problems such as:</p>
 
 How do you make sure you are using the correct keys with your peers? 
 How do you signal to your peers you have changed or terminated your keys? 
 
 Key Event Log 
<p>The Key Event Log (KEL) is the basic construct of KERI. The KEL is a hash linked chain of key events. A KERI identifier represents a single distinct KEL. The KEL is the cryptographic ledger or block chain of KERI.</p>
<p>Inception, rotation, and interaction are examples of common events in a KEL. Every KEL begins with an inception event followed by other events. The hash value of the first inception event becomes the KERI identifier of a KEL. Many key event logs will be relatively small and rather static with only a few entries.</p>
<p>The controller of a KEL adds its controller signature to each event that gets added to a KEL. As events are added the controller continuously publishes the KEL to one or more witnesses who add their witness signature to each event in the KEL. Once the KEL has been published to witnesses, the KEL becomes immutable, and no past entries in the KEL can be modified or removed. The witness makes the KEL available to Verifiers.</p>
<p>By comparing KELs from multiple witnesses a Verifier can make sure the KEL is authentic and has not, for example, been duplicated, branched, or otherwise tampered with.</p>
 Pre-rotation 
<p>Pre-rotation is a unique feature of KERI, where only the current public key or keys are published in a KEL. Only the hashes or commitments of the next public keys are published. Pre-rotation improves security because no parts of the key material of the next keys are made public.</p>
 Delegation 
<p>KERI delegation is a cooperative mutual agreement between two KERI identifiers. Delegation requires cryptographic commitment from both parties. KERI delegation delegates signing authority to the delegate.</p>
<p>In vLEI, delegation is used between the GLEIF root (a KERI identifier that links back to everything within the eco-system, this link is what provides the delegate-able abilities to vLEI) and external identifiers, and between the GLEIF external and QVI identifiers.</p>
 Multi-sig 
<p>KERI multi-sig is a KERI identifier formed from a group of public keys. Each multi-sig may be given a signing threshold to control who has signing authority and to improve resilience. </p>
<p>For example, a group with a signing threshold of three out of three always requires participation of all members. This threshold sets a strict control on signing authority but does not improve resilience. If any of the members lost control of their key, the group could no longer operate and recover from the loss.</p>
<p>In vLEI currently, the GLEIF root has a threshold of three out of seven. GLEIF external is two out of five. The minimum requirement for QVI and Legal Entity identifiers is a group of two members.</p>
 ACDC credentials 
<p>The wider ‘KERI’ ecosystem provides a verifiable credential format known as Authentic Chained Data Container (ACDC) credentials. Credential chaining is a unique feature of ACDC credentials compared to most other Verifiable Credential formats present today.</p>
<p>When verifying an ACDC credential the Verifier will check the revocation status of the received credential and each of the chained credentials. This allows implementing advanced use cases where, for example, credential revocation authority is delegated to other actors than the issuer of the credential.</p>
<p>In vLEI, every credential is on a chain that leads up to the QVI credential issued by GLEIF (Global LEI Foundation) to the QVI.</p>
 vLEI Trust Model&nbsp;  
<p>The vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework describes the trust model of vLEI in full. This is a distilled view of the most important roles and types of credentials.</p>
 GLEIF 
<p>The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) controls the vLEI root of trust with two multi-sig identifiers: GLEIF root and GLEIF external. The two identifiers are established with a delegation agreement. A member of the GLEIF multi-sig groups is called GLEIF Authorized Representative (GAR). The GARs will perform identity verification needed to issue QVI credentials.</p>
<p>The QVI credential is issued by the GLEIF external identifier to Qualified vLEI Issuers. The root identifier will never issue any credentials. This way the root identifier can remain offline, while only the KEL of the root identifier is made public.</p>
 <p>Figure 2 – GLEIF identifiers for vLEI root of trust.</p> 
 Qualified vLEI Issuer 
<p>The Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) is an organization that has been qualified by GLEIF to act as an issuer of vLEI credentials.</p>
<p>The QVI controls a multi-sig identifier with at least two members and that has established a delegation agreement with GLEIF external. </p>
<p>In addition, a QVI credential is issued by GLEIF external to the QVI. The QVI credential claims contain the LEI code of the QVI. The QVI credential is the top-most credential in the chain of vLEI credentials.</p>
<p>A member of the QVI multi-sig group is called Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representative (QAR). The QARs will perform identity verification needed to issue vLEI, OOR and ECR credentials.</p>
 <p>Figure 3 – GLEIF authorizes the QVI by setting up delegation and issuing a QVI credential.</p> 
 Legal Entity  
<p>The Legal Entity (LE) is an organization that receives the vLEI credential.</p>
<p>The LE controls a multi-sig identifier with at least two members.</p>
<p>A LE-vLEI credential is issued by the QVI to the LE. The LE-vLEI credential claims contain the LEI code and name of the LE. The LE-vLEI credential is chained to the QVI credential of the issuer. </p>
<p>A member of the LE multi-sig group is called Legal Entity Authorized Representative (LAR).</p>
 <p>Figure 4 – The QVI issues a vLEI credential to the Legal Entity.</p> 
<p>The LE may issue OOR and ECR authorization credentials to a QVI, to authorize the QVI to issue individual OOR and ECR credentials on its behalf. The LE may also directly issue individual ECR credentials.</p>
 OOR and ECR Authorization Credentials 
<p>Authorization credentials are issued to the QVI by the LE. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and role. The authorization credentials are chained to the vLEI credential of the LE. This way the LE has authority to revoke any OOR and ECR credentials. </p>
 OOR Credentials 
<p>Official Organization Role (OOR) credentials are issued to an individual person by the QVI. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and official role as defined by ISO, from the authorization credential. The OOR credential is chained to the OOR authorization credential.</p>
<p>The QVI will verify information about Official Role assignment such as Chairman of the Board, CEO etc. from public records and perform identity verification needed to issue the OOR credential.</p>
 <p>Figure 5 – An OOR credential has many levels of chaining, leading up to the QVI Credential.</p> 
 ECR Credentials 
<p>Engagement Context Role (ECR) credentials are issued to an individual person either by the LE itself or by the QVI. The credential’s claims contain the person’s name and context role. The role name is context specific and defined by the LE. The ECR credential is either chained to the vLEI credential or the ECR authorization credential.</p>
<p>If the LE issues the ECR credential, then it is the responsibility of the LE to perform identity verification to a level that satisfies requirements of the LE.</p>
<p>If the LE authorizes the QVI to issue the ECR credential, for example to external contractors, then the QVI will perform identity verification needed to issue the ECR credential.</p>
 <p>Figure 6 – An ECR credential has many levels of chaining, leading up to the QVI Credential.</p>

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF71 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

   Ready to get a start on understanding the latest digital identity credential standards? Two influential standards, ISO/IEC 18013 and W3C's Verifiable Credentials, offer different solutions for digital identity. Is one clearly better than the other? Well, no. Whether one is better than the other depends on. your use case. Choosing among these standards depends on your users' needs, the browsers you

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Staying informed about the latest digital identity standards and technology is more than a full-time job. Even focusing on just what’s available for the<a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/16/"> identifiers</a> that provide a way to recognize a (digital) identity is enough to keep a person gainfully occupied for a few years. Why a few years, you ask? Because these standards are still under development in many ways – this is a bleeding edge of digital identity. Let’s talk about the two of the most influential standards under development that inform so much of the activity in this space: the ISO/IEC 18013 specifications and the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C’s) Verifiable Credentials.</p>



 The tl;dr 



<p>The<a href="https://www.iso.org/search.html?q=18013"> ISO/IEC 18013</a> family of documents specifies the technical and operational requirements for physical and mobile driver’s licenses (mDL). The mdoc format, part of ISO/IEC 18013-5, refers to the structure and specifications for mobile driver’s licenses and similar electronic ID solutions. (18013-5 and the in-progress 18013-7 are the ones most identity people focus on). If you would like to read and implement according to these standards, be prepared to pay money to access them.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> is a standard developed by the Verifiable Credentials Working Group within the World Wide Web (W3C) consortium. You can use Verifiable Credentials for any type of credential, from educational degrees to government IDs. Unfortunately, the identity industry has confused matters by using the generic term “verifiable credential” to sometimes mean something more or less different from the W3C Verifiable Credential format. If you want to read and implement according to the W3C Verifiabl Credential data format, go for it. Access to the specification is free.</p>



 Comparing mdoc/mDL and Verifiable Credentials 



&nbsp;ISO/IEC 18013-5W3C Verifiable CredentialPurposeDesigned explicitly to represent driver’s licenses and possibly other official IDs in a mobile format. It can be used for “secondary use cases,” such as anything you might use a physical driver’s license for that doesn’t involve driving. The ultimate case of YMMV.A standard that<a href="https://gataca.io/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials/"> can be used</a> for any type of credential, from educational degrees to memberships, and not limited to driving licenses or IDs.Standardizing BodyISO/IEC (a treaty-based, government-supported standards organization)&nbsp;Be prepared to pay to read the standard. If you’d like to<a href="https://www.iso.org/get-involved.html"> participate</a> in developing the standard, you have a few more hoops to jump through.W3C (an industry-based standards organization that uses a tiered model for membership and engagement)&nbsp;Access to the standards is always free. The ability to vote on approving the standard requires a (paid)<a href="https://www.w3.org/membership/"> membership</a>. The ability to be a part of developing the standard or incubating an idea can be part of (paid) membership or (free) invited experts.Privacy and SecurityPrivacy is a strong consideration, but the focus is on a government credential and how governments need to use it. Protections are built in to ensure that data is shared only when necessary and (mostly) based on individual control. Because of the complexity involved, the use of am mDL is, at least as far as the specification is concerned, an in-person action. Remote use of these credentials is still a work in progress.Privacy is a strong consideration for the W3C as well. Since this specification is designed to support a broader set of use cases, there are privacy considerations to help the individual control what data is shared. There are also considerations about what data is collected since not all use cases require the same data.InteroperabilityThe ISO/IEC 18013-5 specification is trying to ensure interoperability across different jurisdictions, ensuring that a mobile driver’s license issued in one state or country can be read and verified in another, assuming both places follow the same ISO standard. Other use cases may take advantage of being interoperable if everyone uses the same format, but it’s worth remembering the underlying assumption of government use.The W3C VC specification is, as noted, designed for broad interoperability across the web. Interoperability means ensuring that various platforms, websites, and services can understand and verify the credentials. The underlying assumption here is that these credentials must be able to support use on the web by anybody, whether they be a company, a government, or the local pizza delivery service.



 Drama! Intrigue! Big Tech! 



<p>What we appear to have here is a general versus specific-purpose identifier format. Why not just use the one that fits your use case? Why all the drama?</p>



<p>In part, it comes down to resource availability. The costs grow for every standard or technology an organization has to support. Developer costs, UX designer costs, support team costs, they all add up. Even organizations the size of Google and Apple would very much like to limit what technologies they have to support. Anything else gets crazy expensive AND frustrates the individuals using their platforms with too many options.</p>



<p>In this case, Apple has<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wallet/get-started-with-verify-with-wallet/"> focused on supporting</a> the ISO specification only, which frustrates some developers. Google hasn’t decided whether it will support one or both of these standards. Outside of browser-land, the European Union is working on an<a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/"> entire digital identity ecosystem</a>. It willsupport use cases in education, social security, and other services; their<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework"> architecture</a> specifically mentions the W3C work.</p>



<p>Let’s not forget that the technology sector loves its ideology wars. From the command line<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war"> editor wars</a> between vi versus emacs to decades of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars"> browser wars</a>, technologists get attached to their favorite tools. This also appears to be playing out here in the mdoc versus VC drama.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Both ISO’s guidelines and the W3Cs specifications are still evolving. Several critical features are still under active development, sometimes in other standards organizations (I’m looking at you, <a href="https://openid.net/openid4vc/">OpenID Foundation</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/search?name=selective+disclosure&amp;sort=&amp;rfcs=on&amp;activedrafts=on&amp;by=group&amp;group=">IETF</a>). Some of those features are raising <a href="https://github.com/WICG/identity-credential/blob/main/custom-schemes.md">significant concerns</a> from privacy advocates.  If you are going to implement something, be prepared to be flexible to future changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exploring these formats is necessary if you’re moving to a Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) model. But that said, it’s not just about the content of the specifications. Also, review the use cases they are designed to support, what browser you expect your users to use, and even where you are in the world.</p>



 ETA: A Few More Thoughts 



<p>I love it when my posts spark discussion and feedback! <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@aniltj/111692855215449887">Anil John</a> offered some great insight in a thread on Mastodon that I’m sharing here (to keep it in one place) with permission:</p>



<p>❖ The starting point for the W3C VC work and the ISO mDL work were radically different; the mDL work was directly focused on in-person use cases while the W3C work was focused on remote/online use cases. Both are trying to address the other at present, but the starting point has influenced the design choices that are inherent in both standards.</p>



<p>❖ The W3C VCDM is a data model for describing a broad range of credentials and does not explicitly define the protocols used to move credentials defined using the VCDM from point A to Point B (provisioning and presentation)</p>



<p>❖ The ISO mDL is a tightly coupled mix of an explicitly defined set of data attributes that make up a digital version of a driver’s licence AND a protocol interface description for moving a credential composed of those attributes from a mobile device to a reader/verifier using NFC, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Aware protocols (in-person presentation); how that credential is provisioned to the mobile device from an issuing infrastructure is explicitly out of scope for the ISO mDL standard.</p>



<p>❖ The W3C VCDM supports and encourages the use of attribute and vocabulary transparency akin to how schema.org works; the ISO mDL vocabulary is part of the standard and as such is under the control of the ISO working group.</p>

Dahl</a> was named along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/openai/">OpenAI</a> co-founder and CEO Sam Altman; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/airbnb/">Airbnb</a> CEO Brian Chesky; Steve Hafner, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kayak/">KAYAK</a>; Vanessa Hudson, CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/qantas/">Qantas</a> Group; Robert Isom, CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-airlines/">American Airlines</a>; Aloke Bajpai, co-founder and group CEO, and Rajnish Kumar, co-founder and chief product and technology officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ixigo/">ixigo</a>; Alix Boulnois, chief digital officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/accor/">Accor</a>; Ben Drew, president, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/viator/">Viator</a>; Ethan Lin, co-founder and CEO, and Eric Gnock Fah, co-founder and COO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/klook/">Klook</a>; Rathi Murthy, chief technology officer and president of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/expedia/">Expedia Group</a> Product &amp; Technology; Andreas Slettvoll, co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/chooose/">CHOOOSE</a> ; Johnny Thorsen, vice president of business development for content distribution, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spotnanatechnology/">Spotnana</a> ; Richard Valtr, founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mewssystems/">Mews</a>; and Rose Yao, vice president of product management, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/">Google</a> for transforming travel in 2023 — and among those to watch in 2024.</p>
<p>Here’s what Dahl had to say about the news.</p>
<p>It’s an honor to be listed among leading innovators who are changing how the world interacts and moves. We founded Indicio to do just this — to remove the friction, the obstacles, and the limitations of how we move through the world, digitally, and to make every interaction simple, seamless, instant.</p>
<p>For travel, this meant reimagining airports without lines, where everything, from check in to border crossing would be digitized and managed with the traveler’s consent — from their sofa.</p>
<p>The solution would be simple to implement across airline systems and radically improve operational efficiency. It would be secure and trustworthy and protect privacy. Everything would be seamless, streamlined, and stress-free. Everything could be integrated from booking to rewards programs to airport services, hospitality and beyond. People could just go and keep moving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, thanks to partners SITA and the Aruba Tourism Authority, that’s what we delivered with the <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-873429964.html">Digital Travel Credential</a>. A seamless solution that works on any system and provides award-winning (<a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-eic-decentralized-identity-award-means-for-indicio/">KipplingerCole</a> EIC and <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-the-supernova-award-from-constellation-research-for-disruptive-technology-leadership-in-digital-safety-governance-and-privacy/">Constellation SuperNova</a>) privacy protection.</p>
<p>What it means today: You can now cross a border in the time it takes to smile.</p>
<p>What it will mean in 2024: Everything you need as a traveler will be accessible seamlessly — car rental, hotel check in, event booking, you name your need, we’ve got a simple, secure way to integrate it into your experience.</p>
<p>And, because verifiable credentials have digital superpowers, everything can be configured, with the traveler’s consent, to provide boss-level personalized interaction.</p>
<p>We’ve even <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">shown</a> how verifiable data and identity are essential for AI to access and leverage personal data.</p>
<p>In 2024, travel will show the world a new way of interacting digitally. It’s both a practical solution and a metaphor. With Indicio, we’re broadening the horizons of where you can go and what is possible when you bring the real and digital worlds together.</p>

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF70 is live today, Dec 28. It concludes on Jan 4. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF70   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF70 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.

What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 ERC-3643 Validated As The De Facto Standard For Enterprise-Ready Tokenization 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in December 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Ready for an exciting year of tokenization?</p>
<p>Last week, the ERC-3643 standard achieved a significant achievement by attaining<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/ethereum-community-approves-erc3643-as-the-first-tokenization-standard?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">&nbsp;‘Final’ status in its Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)</a>. This indicates its validation by the official Ethereum community.</p>
<p>The EIP is a rigorous process mandatory for all Ethereum-based standards, including prominent ones like ERC-20 and ERC-721. Achieving the final status signifies a major milestone for the tokenization industry, as&nbsp;ERC-3643 now provides an official token standard for compliant tokenization.</p>
<p>As the initial creator of the ERC-3643 standard, we identified an essential requirement for a unified standard to achieve interoperability. From its inception, we committed to an open-source approach. Initially known as the T-REX (Token for Regulated EXchanges) protocol, this protocol embodied our vision for a more interconnected and efficient tokenization ecosystem with built-in compliance.</p>
<p>In 2021, we submitted the T-REX protocol to the EIP, aspiring to establish it as an official standard. This journey, though extensive and intricate, involved the process of evolving from Draft to Stagnant, then to Review, and ultimately achieving Final status after two years of dedicated effort.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Today,&nbsp;ERC-3643 is the de facto standard for enterprise-ready tokenization,&nbsp;with highlights including:</p>
<p>✅ Validated&nbsp;by the Ethereum community: Earning&nbsp;<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3643?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">the ‘Final’ status</a>&nbsp;ensures official recognition and trust from the EVM developer community.</p>
<p>✅ Audited&nbsp;by Hacken:&nbsp;The audit results yielded&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/hacken-grants-tokenization-protocol-erc3643-a-10-10-security-audit-score/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">a flawless score of 10/10</a>, serving as a testament to the high level of security and integrity that the protocol offers.</p>
<p>✅ Supported&nbsp;by institutions: Prominent institutions and firms, like Apex Group, Invesco, Aztec, CMS, DLA Piper, and Polygon have formed<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">&nbsp;a non-profit association</a>&nbsp;to catalyze worldwide adoption of the ERC-3643.</p>
<p>✅ 6-year track record:&nbsp;The standard has been used to tokenize over&nbsp;$28 billion in assets for hundreds of projects over the past six years.</p>
<p>2023 marks the dawn of institutional tokenization, and we believe that institutions will increasingly embrace tokenization.&nbsp;The audited and validated ERC-3643 standard is set to expedite this shift in 2024!</p>
<p>It is an exciting day for Tokeny’s brainchild. We encourage anyone interested in tokenizing or wanting to implement ERC-3643 to access the code on GitHub&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/TokenySolutions/T-REX?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, building a tokenization platform is&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/what-should-you-expect-from-a-tokenization-platform-in-2024/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_kjLgkKyKQeSHDSFv2FH7jVneK_-VvwmDYV64SCj2JROetoODqqwO8Ke-Rdqi10DJW3wne">more than just deploying smart contracts</a>. We have built a no-code and API-ready platform for enterprises to start securely and quickly with an easy UI and UX.</p>
<p>We wish you a Happy New Year!</p>

<p>“Fast” and “frictionless” onboarding for customers, workers and citizens is an elusive goal. Sure, identity verification is crucial, but so is verifying claims such as educational qualifications, an industry certification, health data, citizen status, residency and more. Striking the right balance with defenses against another, less desirable “F” word—fraud—in a manner that protects privacy and reduces the chances of compromise, yet another challenge</p>
<p>Whether it’s for onboarding, new customer account origination, or provisioning additional digital services to qualified requesters, organizations need to replace and digitally transform outdated and manual verification using AI, data triangulation and machine verification of identity and credentials. The new and better way to do this is to give users reusable, verified “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/07/20/why-reusable-smart-credentials-will-win-over-physical-analog-identity-verification/?sh=6349fdf03373">smart credentials</a>“neatly packaged in a digital identity wallet that users keep up-to-date, present on demand, and grant specific sharing permissions.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials leverage data registries that include trusted databases, decentralized databases, government ID databases, and distributed ledgers. The credential holder mediates between the registry or trusted “issuer” and the verifier authenticating the holder—creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials#:~:text=Verifiable%20credentials%20(VCs)%20are%20digital,ownership%20of%20a%20bank%20account.">triangle of trust.</a> A holder’s credentials can be verified without any data being exchanged – a zero knowledge proof. In this way, verification is assured, privacy concerns are ameliorated, and the risk of identity theft or compromise is minimized or eliminated. Here again, the 1Kosmos architecture excels because this all needs to be done in an auditable, tamper-evident way to ensure high assurance and trust.</p>
 IAM Verified–Quickly, Easily, and Accurately 
<p>In Parts <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Two</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/ditching-the-feds-why-decentralized-digital-identity-is-key-to-effective-iam/">Three</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/the-immutable-chain-of-custody-why-distributed-ledger-is-critical-to-modern-iam/">Four</a> in this series, we explained how the<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/"> 1Kosmos architecture</a> provides a secure and reliable way to verify user or applicant identity and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometrically authenticate</a> them with 99.6% accuracy via decentralized digital identity (DID) mechanisms within our BlockID solution, including a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">reusable digital identity wallet</a> while removing the centralized PII honeypot hackers target for exploitation.</p>
<p>The final pillar of the 1Kosmos <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">architectural advantage</a> is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verifiable-credentials/">Digital Claims and Credentials Verification</a>, which delivers automated, cryptographically secure verification of identity, qualifications, competencies, authority, and more while respecting an individual’s privacy.</p>
<p>Why did we feel this pillar was so important? Because it provides progressively higher levels of identity assurance for authentication and digitally transforms a broad range of business processes—from worker or contractor onboarding to new customer account origination to the provisioning of new digital product lines and beyond. Often, there is more than one type of verifiable data registry utilized, depending on use cases that span:</p>
 
 Education: Utilize a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-credential-repository">credential repository</a> service to provide digital transcripts and digital credentials representing certificates or degrees verified to be earned by the individual 
 Finance: Perform Know-Your-Customer (KYC)- and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)-compliant identity verification using government-supplied <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> and issue a digitally-signed <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/#dfn-credential">credential</a> 
 Retail: Verify retail and payment account ownership, payment amount, and sufficient permission to approve payment 
 Healthcare: Facilitate patient-approved sharing of electronic healthcare records with a Qualified Health Information Network (AHIN) 
 Government: Enable government agencies to function as Credential Service Providers by performing Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) and issuing a digitally-signed Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) credential certified to NiST 800-63-3 and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a> standards 
 Enterprise: Share current and past employment to prospective employers and other entities that need to verify status 
 
 A Trustworthy Method for Verifying Claims and Credentials 
<p>1Kosmos BlockID automates manual identity and credential verification with a secure, rules-based workflow, reducing errors and improving accuracy. High assurance along with cryptographically secure storage and sharing establish repeatable, high-trust, and seamless re-verification by business partners or by additional lines of business. Key features of the 1Kosmos solution include the following.</p>
 Data Triangulation to Verify Claims Across Trusted Data Sources 
<p>To reach identity verification and authentication assurance to <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards, BlockID triangulates claims across multiple verifiable sources. These include personal details such as the individual’s full name, date of birth, address, place of birth, photo ID, phone number, employer, etc. The triangulation is based upon government- or bank-issued documents such as a driver’s license, national ID card, passport, credit card, and Social Security Number.</p>
<p>Information can be matched across multiple sources to validate documents as current, or flagged as lost or stolen. Our verification accommodates government-issued credentials in 205 countries with +99% identity proofing accuracy and spoofing/counterfeit detection. Verification at lower levels of assurance is achieved through banking, telco (SIM binding), email, Social Security Number, phone number, and more.</p>
<p>This kind of digital verifiable credential can represent all of the same information that a physical credential represents while also including additional assurances against fraud, such as a digital signature.</p>
 Standards-based Design for Maximum Interoperability 
<p>With 1Kosmos, verifiable credentials allow for the digital proofing of an individual’s claims information through public-private cryptography. Our solutions follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model</a> defined at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a>, which provides a common mechanism for the interoperable implementation of digital credentials that are cryptographically secure, tamper-evident, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.</p>
<p>A standardized data model enables credential packaging, cryptographic signing, and proof expression. This creates a verified credential (VC) ecosystem with interoperable credentials that can be processed and understood across and between disparate systems.</p>
 Powerful, Easy-to-Use Administration and DevOps Tools 
<p>We developed the 1Kosmos BlockID platform to require no custom coding, special firewall rules, or unique security configurations. Deployment is simple and fast, with over 50 out-of-the-box <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/">integrations</a> and a robust SDK/API framework that complies with the strictest GDPR, SOC2, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/privacy-by-design-iso-standard/">ISO 27001</a> certification standards for handling and retaining sensitive data.</p>
<p>This enables ID proofing to be quickly integrated into native apps via an API, mobile, web, or desktop integration. This flexible, standards-based approach can meet the needs of virtually any workflow and enables BlockID to satisfy both workforce and customer identity verification.</p>
<p>Our cloud-based administration panel makes configuring and managing the BlockID platform easy. And our <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/">DevX portal</a> provides a hosted sandbox for developers to test FIDO-based authentication and verification options integrated into your applications. The <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=dlverify">Developer Sandbox</a> offers an easy, hands-on way for developers to test use cases using available APIs for FIDO-based <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=passwordless">authentication</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=fidowebauthn">WebAuthn</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=magiclinks">Magic Links</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=dlverify">Driver’s License Verification</a>, <a href="https://developer.1kosmos.com/devportal/demo/?tab=vc">Verified Credentials</a>, and more.</p>
 A Modern IAM Architecture That Means Business 
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_in/forensic-integrity-services/ensuring-fraud-free-hiring-with-technology-powered-employee-background-check">Ernst &amp; Young survey</a>, nearly 70% of organizations report having manual verification processes that are riddled with errors, highly time-consuming, or both. By automating manual identity and credential verification with a secure, rules-based workflow, BlockID eliminates errors, improves accuracy, and reduces administrative overhead. Its high assurance and cryptographically secure storage and sharing, help establish repeatable, high-trust re-verification by business partners or additional lines of business. And its automated machine verification, combined with the high level of trust from a tamper-proof design, reduces the need for manual reviews and enables digital processes to scale or evolve rapidly. All while providing a fast, frictionless user experience—while kicking that other “F” word to the curb.</p>

<p>The end of the year is always an exciting time, from reflecting on everything we’ve accomplished to planning for the exciting projects that lie ahead.</p><p>For SpruceID, 2023 has been a positive year of growth and change. We grew our company, participated in many events that helped expand our community, enhanced our products and platforms, and more.</p><p>Let’s take a walk down memory lane through 2023 and revisit some major highlights of the past year together!</p> 👪 Our Team <p>We gained even more Sprucers this year and remain to be a small but mighty global team. From engineering to product development, marketing, and design, we’re excited to continue to build up our talent to meet the demands of our growing company.</p><p>Although we are a remote-first company, we hold offsites every six months for one week at a time to focus on relationship building, align on strategy, and more. This year, we met in Lisbon, Portugal, and Dublin, Ireland!</p><p>Interested in joining our awesome team? <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/sprucesystems?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Check out our open roles here</a>.</p> 🎤 Events and Hackathons   SpruceID attended ETHDenver this year and connected with others in the decentralized identity space! Our booth offered an interactive experience where visitors could test out claiming a credential to prove they visited our booth and then plant a tree after verifying that credential.&nbsp;  In March, we hosted <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-did-day-an-exploration-of-decentralized-identity-at-ethdenver-buidlweek/">did:day</a>, a half-day event during ETHDenver’s #BUIDLWeek with a mission to create a forum dedicated to educating about decentralized identity, how it impacts web3 and beyond, and how to increase adoption. The event consisted of several lightning talks and panels on user-controlled identity, decentralized social media, and more.  This summer, we<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/encode-university-hackathon-2023/"> participated in the Encode Future of Blockchain University Hackathon</a>. Over the course of four weeks, university students from blockchain clubs across the world learned about decentralized identity, built projects, and competed for prizes. Read more about our <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/encode-university-hackathon-2023/">bounties</a> and the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-our-encode-hackathon-bounty-winners/">winners</a>.  At the end of August, SpruceID <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-license-interoperability-event/">hosted the first fully remote asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations</a>. This event provided a collaboration forum over the course of two weeks for implementers of the draft technical specification for unattended or fully online presentation of mobile driver’s licenses (ISO/IEC 18013-7). Read more about the event results <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/iso-iec-18013-7-interoperability-event-results/">here</a>.  We rounded out the year by hosting a webinar with GovTech featuring a fireside chat between Wayne Chang, SpruceID Co-Founder and CEO, and Ajay Gupta, Chief Digital Transformation Officer at the State of California DMV. <a href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/console/apollox/mainEvent?eventid=4419861&amp;sessionid=1&amp;username=&amp;partnerref=&amp;format=fhvideo1&amp;mobile=&amp;flashsupportedmobiledevice=&amp;helpcenter=&amp;key=2C578405F3FE22F30ADF478630724166&amp;newConsole=true&amp;nxChe=true&amp;newTabCon=true&amp;consoleEarEventConsole=false&amp;text_language_id=en&amp;playerwidth=748&amp;playerheight=526&amp;eventuserid=653726278&amp;contenttype=A&amp;mediametricsessionid=561697865&amp;mediametricid=6227059&amp;usercd=653726278&amp;mode=launch&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Watch the webinar</a> to learn more about:  How the California DMV is offering mobile driver's licenses and other digital credentials, such as car registrations, to its residents and best practices for success  The importance of open-source development to enable myriad use cases across public and private sectors for verifiable digital identity  The security and accessibility advantages of digitally verifiable credentials     🛠️ Our Products<br>  Credible <p>This year, we’ve been honing in on Credible — an entire credential lifecycle management product with security and privacy at its core. From credential issuance and presentations to updates and revocations, Credible is made to integrate into high-assurance environments that require certain safety and security certifications.</p>  After working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for 18 months to bring mobile driver’s licenses to residents of California, we were thrilled to help launch the pilot program to allow California residents to <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone in August of 2023. This project demonstrated a successful implementation of Credible and our open-source libraries.  We ended this year on a high note with a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">Gartner Eye on Innovation Award for Government</a>. The State of California Department of Motor Vehicles won this award for their Open Source Mobile Wallet for Decentralized Digital Credentials, which was built by SpruceID. We couldn’t be more proud to have played a role in winning such a prestigious award.   SpruceKit <p>If you’ve been keeping up with our developer community, you may be familiar with many of our open-source libraries, such as Sign-In with Ethereum, DIDKit, and TreeLDR. This year, we moved these open-source libraries all under SpruceKit, an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity. SpruceKit enables secure wallet construction by allowing builders to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with data vaults.</p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum</p>  As of the end of this year, Sign-in with Ethereum has 2,890,141 total downloads on NPM (and 2,000,000 just in this year alone), as well as 53,848 downloads on PyPI!  This year, we <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-integrates-sign-in-with-ethereum-into-metamask-for-better-user-experience-and-safety/">integrated Sign-In with Ethereum into Metamask</a>. These efforts to provide user-friendly security and safety enhancements across Web3 wallet experiences should increase users' confidence in interacting with dapps.  <p>Kepler</p>  Kepler had an extensive refactor to extract the core logic into a new crate separate from the HTTP API and to implement its state tracking using SQL (SQLite, Postgres, and MySQL are supported) (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">kepler #143</a>).  This year, we added support for a capability read function so clients can read capabilities delegated to them and others if authorized (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/134?ref=blog.spruceid.com">kepler #134</a>).  We moved host key management into the OrbitDatabase in kepler-core via the Secrets trait and provided an implementation of the trait based on simple per-orbit derivation from a static secret (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/146?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#146</a>).  <p>SSI/DIDKit</p>  Support for DataIntegrityProof proof suites was introduced (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/515?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#515</a>).  We rewrote our VC API implementation in Axum (didkit <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit/pull/351?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#351</a>) and added it to the W3C-CCG interoperability test suites (<a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/vc-api-test-suite-implementations/pull/64?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#64</a>).  A major refactor of ssi was initiated. This refactor will help us to handle Linked Data better and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.  <p>TreeLDR</p><p>This year, we improved every aspect of TreeLDR: layouts, DSL, and generators.</p>  Layouts:  We introduced a new version of <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/v0.2/layouts/README.md?ref=blog.spruceid.com">TreeLDR's layouts</a>, simplifying their definition and how developers can interact with them. We are working on the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/tree/v0.2/layouts/book?ref=blog.spruceid.com">layout book</a>, containing an overview and formal specification of TreeLDR's layouts. This update introduces a lot of breaking changes for the better. We are still working on making all TreeLDR features work with these new layouts.    DSL:  We started using RDF as our intermediate representation for layouts. This change will allow the compiler to accept any RDF syntax as input in the future. Besides the TreeLDR DSL, the compiler supports N-Quads (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/108?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #108</a>) and RDF-Turtle (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/119?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #119</a>).  The DSL is not yet compatible with the new layouts. As a first step, we extracted the RDF handling part of TreeLDR's compiler into a separate project, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/inferdf-rs?ref=blog.spruceid.com">InfeRDF</a>. This standalone RDF engine is dedicated to the inference and interpretation of RDF datasets so the compiler can focus entirely on its primary purpose: layouts.    Generators:  We redesigned the Rust code generator to simplify maintenance and future extensions (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/143?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #143</a>), generate code for restricted data types with runtime validation (such as numerical constraints, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/145?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #145</a>), support for default values (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/147?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #147</a>), and more. In addition, the procedural macro used to embed TreeLDR layouts directly in Rust can now use external modules, allowing modular code generation (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/130?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #130</a>). The Rust code generator will be the <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/162?ref=blog.spruceid.com">first to support the new layouts</a>.    <p>Rebase</p>  We've added large amounts of prototype work to support two new flows, POAP ownership and NFT ownership (Rebase <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/44?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#44</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/45?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#45</a>), and added basic credential verification to the Rebase witness (Rebase <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/47/files?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#47</a>).  We've added the ability for Rebase Witnesses to arbitrarily validate any VCs that have types supported by ssi (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/69?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #69</a>).  We’ve added the ability to support delegate keys to allow users to issue their own credentials without a signing prompt for each one (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/82?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #82</a>).  <p>SSX</p>  We released support for NextAuth via our ssx-react package <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/tree/main/examples/ssx-test-nextauth?ref=blog.spruceid.com">with an example</a> to show how to integrate it.&nbsp;  We reworked the library architecture of SSX. The previous functions of SSX have been moved into a new module named UserAuthorization, which is responsible for end-user signing-related operations. A new storage module was added, which provides functionality to store and retrieve data in Kepler. Check out the <a href="https://www.sprucekit.dev/ssx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SSX v2.x Docs</a>.  We’ve added Credential Modules, which allow you to fetch credentials issued on <a href="https://issuer.sprucekit.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceKit Credential Issuer</a>, which can be used as a faucet for credentials.  <p>Example Apps</p>  In June, we released three new reference apps, <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-the-sprouts/">The Sprouts</a>, to demonstrate how you can leverage the SpruceKit open-source libraries to introduce decentralized identity in the next app you build. These included an AI chat interface, an app for book reviews, and a sample social networking app.   📝Standards and Working Groups   <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">We joined OpenWallet Foundation</a> as one of their founding members. The OpenWallet Foundation is a new open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation Europe. This collaborative effort will develop best practices for open-source digital wallet technology.  This year, we continued participating in working groups or global standards bodies and foundations to champion open-source, interoperable solutions that help create a more privacy-forward, user-centric internet. These include W3C working groups, ISO working groups, OpenID Foundation working groups, and more. To learn more about standards we’re contributing to, whitepapers we’ve published, and more, see an example of our quarterly Standards and Working Groups update <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/q2-2023-wgs-udpate/">here</a>.   See you in 2024 <p>2023 was an exciting year full of opportunities and growth. We can’t wait to see what’s in store for 2024 as we continue on with our mission to let users control their identity and personal data across the web in a way that facilitates trusted interactions. Here’s to a fresh new year!</p> <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

Nevertheless, cross-border commerce is hindered by the diverse practices, standards, and regulations used by individual countries, presenting a substantial obstacle for businesses.</p><p>The global challenge of identifying businesses saw a significant step forward with the introduction of the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a> by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) in the 2010s. While LEIs have proven to be a successful and reliable means of identifying organizations on a global scale, there remains a gap in effectively identifying organizations’ representatives.</p><p>Consequently, GLEIF has introduced an innovative solution to address this gap through the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI)</a>. The vLEI is a globally interoperable framework that enables individuals to digitally verify their status as authorized representatives of LEI-registered organizations worldwide. Stephan Wolf, GLEIF’s CEO, has articulated the necessity and significance of this revolutionary approach in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=F4WGybUNjElwWjeT&amp;v=3mhuL9_q-hs&amp;feature=youtu.be">Organizational Identity and the&nbsp;LEI</a>.</p><blockquote>The vLEI is a globally interoperable framework that enables individuals to digitally verify their status as authorized representatives of LEI-registered organizations worldwide.</blockquote><p>The vLEI harbors the potential to revolutionize the dynamics of digital interactions among organizations, fostering seamless global business transactions online. It is imperative for large organizations and regulators worldwide to diligently heed this transformative advancement.</p><p>In this blog, we provide a visual guide for GLEIF’s vLEI ecosystem and explore how it stands out from any other organizational digital identity infrastructures.</p> vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework <p>In 2022, GLEIF introduced the verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF)</a>, aligning with the Trust over IP (ToIP) Governance Specifications and Templates. The vLEI EGF meticulously outlines the following details:</p>  Rules, responsibilities, and obligations for all stakeholders involved in the vLEI ecosystem, including GLEIF&nbsp;itself.  Hierarchical relationships among the stakeholders, including organizations and their representatives.  Identity Verification processes for all human stakeholders.  Detailed qualification processes for vLEI issuing stakeholders, known as qualified vLEI issuers&nbsp;(QVIs).  Technical specifications for the management of cryptographic keys and self-certifying identifiers, known as autonomic identifiers (AIDs).  Technical specifications for six types of vLEI credentials.  Rigorous technical and business processes governing the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials.  <p>According to Drummond Reed, a member of the Trust over IP Foundation Steering Committee, the strategic choice to build vLEI EGF on the ToIP governance model is poised to foster a secure and interoperable system on a global scale. This move has the potential to revolutionize the global digital trust ecosystem, bringing substantial benefits to businesses and individuals across various industries and international borders.</p><p>As of December 2023, the vLEI EGF stands out as arguably the most comprehensive digital identity framework to&nbsp;date.</p> vLEI Stakeholders <p>Within the vLEI ecosystem, there are four key stakeholders that are issuers and holders of vLEI credentials. The key stakeholders include GLEIF, qualified vLEI issuers (QVIs), legal entities (LEs), and organization representatives. The first three in the list are organizations, which are made of representatives who are authorized to participate in the vLEI ecosystem. The overview of all vLEI stakeholders is displayed below.</p>vLEI Stakeholders, including organizations and their representatives.<p>1. Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF): GLEIF appointed representatives, called GLEIF Authorized Representatives (GARs), to participate in the vLEI ecosystem and issue the QVI vLEI Credential. There are three types of GARs as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Root GARs: The root GARs collectively serve as the root of reputational trust of the entire vLEI ecosystem. Root GARs do not directly participate in the vLEI ecosystem but, instead, delegate their authority to internal GARs and external&nbsp;GARs  Internal GARs: The internal GARs participate directly in the vLEI ecosystem as a collective holder of an LE vLEI credential.  External GARs: The external GARs are responsible for the issuance and revocation of QVI vLEI credentials as well as performing identity assurance of&nbsp;QARs.  <blockquote>Note: There are two types of trust in a digital identity system: reputational trust and attributional trust. The former is the human side of trust whereas the latter is the technical side. In the vLEI ecosystem, GLEIF serves as the root of reputational trust, providing trust for identity assurance of all stakeholders. The attributional trust, on the other hand, is purely cryptographic in the vLEI ecosystem and is provided by the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI protocol</a>.</blockquote><p>2. Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI): A QVI is an organization that is qualified by GLEIF to participate in the vLEI ecosystem as an issuer of vLEI credentials. Prior to being a QVI, a candidate organization has to undergo thorough qualification processes by GLEIF to ensure that they are capable financially and technically of issuing vLEI credentials. QVI authorizes two types of representatives:</p>  Designated Authorized Representative (DAR): The DAR of a QVI is the primary representative that is authorized to sign contracts with GLEIF and legal entities. The DAR designates and replaces the QARs of the&nbsp;QVI.  Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representatives (QARs): The QARs are a collective holder of a QVI vLEI credential. The QARs perform identity assurance, issue, and revoke LE, OOR, and ECR&nbsp;vLEIs.  <p>3. Legal Entity (LE): Within the vLEI ecosystem, an LE is an LEI-registered organization. The LEs also appoint two types of representatives:</p>  Designated Authorized Representative (DAR): The DAR of an LE is the primary representative that is authorized to sign contracts with a QVI. The DAR designates and replaces the LARs of the&nbsp;LE.  Legal Entity Authorized Representatives (LARs): The LARs are a collective holder of an LE vLEI credential. The LARs perform identity assurance, issue, and revoke ECR and AUTH&nbsp;vLEIs.  <p>4. Organization Representative: An organization representative is a person who is authorized to represent an LE. Representatives are categorized by either their official or functional roles within their&nbsp;LE.</p>  Official Organizational Role Person (OOR Person): An OOR person represents an LE in an official organizational role.  Engagement Context Role Person (ECR Person): An ECR person represents an LE in a functional role.  <blockquote>Note: A person may hold any number of role vLEI credentials from a single or multiple&nbsp;LEs.</blockquote> Official Organization Role&nbsp;(OOR) <p>In <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/80603.html">ISO 5009</a>, an official organization role (OOR) is defined as an “official role of a person within an organization or legal entity within a particular jurisdiction that is publicly discoverable in formation, registration or other official documents of the organization or legal&nbsp;entity”.</p><p>GLEIF has released the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/code-lists/iso-5009-official-organizational-roles-code-list">Official Organizational Roles (OOR) Code List</a>, comprising over 2000 OORs across 89 jurisdictions. While this list provides an overview of OORs in respective native languages, it is by no means exhaustive, and there are still numerous countries awaiting inclusion.</p><p>A legal entity may assign an OOR that is not in the official OOR code list as long as the OOR is publicly discoverable in a business registry or defined in official documents of incorporation for the organization. For example, Stephan Wolf has an OOR as the CEO of GLEIF. While GLEIF is registered in Switzerland, the CEO role does not exist in the official OOR code list for Switzerland.</p> Engagement Context Role&nbsp;(ECR) <p>An engagement context role (ECR) is loosely defined by GLEIF to widely include as many use cases as possible. Here are some examples of&nbsp;ECRs:</p>  ECR as an “unofficial” organization role: An organization role that is neither publicly discoverable nor defined in official documents may be considered an ECR. For example, an employee could have an ECR as a software engineer.  ECR as an internal functional role: An ECR could be defined and used internally within an LE. For example, an employee who is officially a software engineer could also have an ECR as a Cultural Ambassador.  ECR as an external functional role: An ECR could be defined and used externally to an LE. For example, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/">European Banking Authority (EBA)</a> may define an ECR called an “<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/d5b13b4d-a9dc-4680-8b7c-0a3a4c694fac/Discussion%20paper%20on%20Pillar3%20data%20hub.pdf">EBA Submitter</a>”. An LE may designate an employee to be their EBA Submitter so that the employee may submit a financial report to&nbsp;EBA.   Collective Identifiers for&nbsp;vLEIs <p>The vLEI ecosystem is designed to be used by organizations that are made of humans and inevitably prone to human errors and shortcomings. For the vLEI to be reliably used on the global scale with the utmost trustworthiness, the vLEI EGF chooses a decentralized approach to digital identity management, also known as self-sovereign identity (SSI), to eliminate a single point of failure to the entire ecosystem by a single human administrator.</p><p>On the flip side, the absence of an administrator leaves an organization without a safety net in the case of disastrous mishaps. Consequently, the architecture of decentralized identity management for an organization should prioritize fault tolerance, avoiding dependency on a singular person or key. Otherwise, there’s a potential risk of an organization permanently losing control over its digital identity — such as in the unfortunate event of a key employee’s sudden&nbsp;demise.</p><p>The section outlines how the vLEI EGF specifies the usage of a collective identifier for an organization that is collectively controlled by multiple individuals using the KERI protocol and a multi-signature autonomic identifier.</p> Key Event Receipt Infrastructure <p>To achieve the highest level of security, scalability, and decentralization for the vLEI ecosystem, the vLEI EGF chooses the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> protocol for the management of cryptographic keys and decentralized identifiers.</p><p>Invented in 2019 by Samuel M. Smith, KERI is a decentralized protocol for the management of cryptographic keys and identifiers that utilizes hash-chain data structures in a similar manner to traditional distributed ledger technology, also known as blockchains. Unlike traditional distributed ledgers, the KERI protocol is not subject to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/blockchain-trilemma">blockchain trilemma</a> because KERI does not rely on a distributed consensus mechanism such as proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.</p><blockquote>Note: For more information and a glossary related to KERI, I recommend <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/">KERISSE</a>, which is the KERI Suite Search Engine, and an upcoming browser extension <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/docs/test/kerific?level=3">KERIfic</a>.</blockquote> Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) <p>As mentioned above, GLEIF only provides the root of reputational trust — i.e., human trust — within the vLEI ecosystem. The root of attributional trust — i.e., technical trust — is purely cryptographic and provided by <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifiers (AIDs)</a>.</p><p>Without going into too much technical detail, an AID is a variant of a self-certifying identifier (SCID), which is used within the KERI protocol. This means an AID is derived by a cryptographic protocol in a decentralized manner. An AID has the following properties:</p>  An AID does not rely on any centralized entity, e.g., a human administrator. An AID is derived and controlled purely in a cryptographic manner.  An AID is persistent and is suitable for long-term use. This is because an AID is not tied to a single cryptographic key pair via a mechanism called <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#0a82">pre-rotation</a>.  An AID does not rely on a distributed ledger. However, it may be used in combination with one or more distributed-ledger networks.  An AID is portable across multiple platforms. In the case that an AID is used with a distributed ledger, an AID is not locked to that specific ledger and may be migrated to another&nbsp;ledger.  An AID is quantum-recoverable. In the case that an AID is attacked by a quantum computer, the control over the AID can be recovered from the&nbsp;attack.   Collective AIDs <p>In the KERI protocol, an AID may be cryptographically controlled via a multi-signature scheme that allows multiple individuals, called controllers, to collectively control a single identifier. This makes the KERI protocol and AIDs particularly suitable for organizational uses.</p><blockquote>Note: It is called the multi-signature scheme because multiple digital signatures from multiple private keys are required to control a single&nbsp;AID.</blockquote><p>Arbitrary levels of control authority over an AID may also be given to its controllers. For example, an AID of an LE may be controlled by three LARs — a CEO, an IT administrator, and a human resource manager — with the following control authority:</p>  The CEO of the LE has “2/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  The IT administrator has “1/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  The human resource manager has “1/3” control over the LE&nbsp;AID  <blockquote>Note: This type of scheme is called a fractionally weighted multi-signature scheme.</blockquote><p>A multi-signature AID requires signatures with a combined control authority of “1” or more. In the above example, the CEO may authorize a transaction with either the IT admin or the HR. However, the IT admin and the HR—without the CEO—are not able to authorize a transaction since their combined control authority is only “1/3” + “1/3” =&nbsp;“2/3”.</p> Multi-device AIDs and&nbsp;MFA <p>The multi-signature scheme also allows an AID to be controlled by multiple devices. For example, an ECR person may control their AID using a mobile phone and a laptop, each having control authority of “1”. In this example, the ECR person may either use their mobile phone or laptop to, e.g., sign a contract with the ECR vLEI credential.</p><blockquote>Note: To be more technically precise, the ECR person uses a private key that is associated with an AID to sign the contract. The AID must be the same as the AID specified in their ECR vLEI credential.</blockquote><p>The multi-signature scheme could be utilized to enable KERI-native multi-factor authentication (MFA). For example, an ECR person may assign “1/2” control over their AID to a mobile phone and another “1/2” to a laptop. In this example, the ECR must use both the mobile and the laptop to, e.g., sign a contract.</p><blockquote>Note: The multi-signature scheme may be used recursively. For example, an LE AID may be controlled by three individuals, each with control authority “1/3”. Each “1/3” could be further divided into two halves using two devices. For more details, see <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/discussions/602">Key Management for Organizational Identity</a> by Samuel M.&nbsp;Smith.</blockquote> AID Management by vLEI Stakeholders <p>The vLEI EGF requires that all vLEI issuing organizations — including GLEIF, QVIs, and LEs — hold collective AIDs using such multi-signature schemes. This enables the maker-checker process that requires the approval of at least two individuals for all workflows related to the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials.</p><p>An example of the management of the AIDs and associated cryptographic keys for all vLEI stakeholders is shown&nbsp;below.</p>Management of AIDs and associated keys by representatives of vLEI stakeholders.  GLEIF Root AID: The GLEIF Root AID enables the root of reputational trust of the vLEI ecosystem. The role of the GLEIF Root AID is to delegate to GIDA and GEDA. Currently, the GLEIF Root AID is controlled by 7 Root GARs, each with control authority of&nbsp;“1/3”.  <blockquote>Note: Delegation in the vLEI ecosystem utilizes the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#c421">cooperative delegation mechanism</a> in the KERI protocol. It requires a cryptographic commitment from both the Delegator and the Delegate to initialize or update the key states of&nbsp;AIDs.</blockquote>  GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA): The GIDA is used to participate in the vLEI ecosystem as the holder of the LE vLEI credential. Currently, the GIDA is controlled by the 5 Internal GARs, each with a controlled authority of&nbsp;“1/2”.  GLEIF External Delegated AID (GEDA): The GEDA is used to issue and revoke the QVI vLEI credentials. Currently, the GEDA is controlled by the 5 External GARs, each with controlled authority of&nbsp;“1/2”  <blockquote>Note: The key management for the GLEIF’s AIDs can be inspected from their KERI witnesses as follows: <a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EDP1vHcw_wc4M__Fj53-cJaBnZZASd-aMTaSyWEQ-PC2?name=GLEIF%20RoOT">GLEIF Root AID</a>, <a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EFcrtYzHx11TElxDmEDx355zm7nJhbmdcIluw7UMbUIL?name=GLEIF%20Internal">GIDA</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gleif.org/.well-known/keri/oobi/EINmHd5g7iV-UldkkkKyBIH052bIyxZNBn9pq-zNrYoS?name=GLEIF%20External">GEDA</a>.</blockquote>  QVI AID: A QVI AID is delegated by the GEDA and must be controlled by at least 3 QARs where at least 2 QARs are required to authorize issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials. For example, a QVI AID could be controlled by 4 QARs with control authority of [“2/3”, “2/3”, “1/3”, “1/3”] such that the QVI cannot authorize a transaction without either of the first two&nbsp;QARs.  <blockquote>Note: All QVI AIDs are also delegated by the GEDA using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#c421">cooperative delegation mechanism</a> in the KERI protocol. As a result, key rotation of a QVI AID must be approved by the External GARs. For example, if a QVI wishes to change one of their QARs by rotating the key of the leaving QAR, the QVI must inform the External GARs to approve the key rotation&nbsp;event.</blockquote>  LE AID: An LE AID must be controlled by at least 3 LARs where at least 2 LARs are required to authorize issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials. There is an exception to this rule when an LE has fewer than 3 employees. In this case, the LE cannot directly issue a vLEI credential and must authorize a QVI to issue it on their&nbsp;behalf.  Role AID: There is no requirement for a multi-signature scheme for ECR and OOR persons. An organization representative may control their AID using a single signing key. They may also use a multi-signature scheme to divide the control authority of their AID to multiple&nbsp;devices.   Types of vLEI Credentials <p>The previous sections have outlined the stakeholders, their relationships, and the management of their identifiers, called AIDs, in the vLEI ecosystem. We are now well-positioned to explore what the vLEI credentials actually are. The vLEI credentials, in fact, consist of six types of verifiable credentials that are issued and received by different vLEI stakeholders. Their schemas can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/vLEI/tree/dev/schema/acdc">here</a>.</p><blockquote>Note: vLEI credentials utilize<a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html"> Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs)</a>, which are considered a variant of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data&nbsp;Model</a>.</blockquote> (1) Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) vLEI Credential <p>A QVI vLEI credential is issued by the External GARs (i.e., the GEDA) to a candidate QVI after they complete the formal qualification process. The issuance of the QVI vLEI credential serves as the formal qualification by GLEIF that the QVI is now eligible to participate in the vLEI ecosystem.</p><p>Before the issuance of a QVI vLEI credential, the External GARs must perform identity verification on all of the QARs. After the issuance of the QVI vLEI credential, if the QVI wishes to add more QARs, the identity of the new QARs must also be verified by the External&nbsp;GARs.</p> (2) Legal Entity (LE) vLEI Credential <p>An LE vLEI credential is issued by a QVI to an LE. The issuance of the LE vLEI credential allows the LE to issue role and AUTH vLEI credentials.</p><p>Before the issuance of an LE vLEI credential, the QARs must perform identity verification on all of the LARs. After the issuance of the LE vLEI credential, if the LE wishes to add more LARs, the identity of the new LARs must also be verified by the&nbsp;QARs.</p><blockquote>Note: A QVI may issue an LE vLEI credential to the GIDA. The GIDA’s LE vLEI was initially issued by <a href="https://provenant.net/">Provenant Inc.</a>, the first&nbsp;QVI.</blockquote> (3) &amp; (4) Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) Authorization (AUTH) vLEI Credentials <p>A QVI AUTH vLEI credential is issued by an LE to a QVI to authorize the QVI to issue a role vLEI credentials, including the LE ECR and LE OOR vLEI credentials. A LAR of the LE has to input the accurate data of their representative — including the legal name and role — in the QVI AUTH vLEI credential. There are two variants of the QVI AUTH vLEI credentials as&nbsp;follows:</p>  OOR AUTH vLEI credential, which authorizes a QVI to issue an OOR vLEI credential  ECR AUTH vLEI credential, which authorizes a QVI to issue an ECR vLEI credential  <p>Before the issuance of a QVI AUTH vLEI credential, the LARs must perform identity verification on the representative, who is either an OOR or ECR&nbsp;person.</p> (5) Official Organizational Role (OOR) vLEI Credential <p>An OOR vLEI credential is a role vLEI credential issued by a QVI to an OOR person. Before issuing an OOR vLEI credential, the QVI must be first authorized by the OOR AUTH vLEI credential, which has been issued by the LE that the OOR person represents.</p><p>Before the issuance of an OOR vLEI credential, the QARs must perform identity verification on the OOR person. The QVI must also verify that the OOR person genuinely holds the specified OOR using official public sources or documents of the&nbsp;LE.</p> (6) Engagement Context Role (ECR) vLEI Credential: <p>An ECR vLEI Credential is a role vLEI credential issued to an ECR person. Unlike other types of vLEI credentials, an ECR vLEI credential may be issued by two approaches as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Direct issuance by an LE: The LARs of the LE perform identity verification on the ECR person and directly issue the ECR vLEI credential.  Issuance by a QVI: The LARs perform identity verification on the ECR person and issue an ECR AUTH vLEI credential to a QVI. The QARs of the QVI then perform identity verification on the ECR person again before issuing the ECR vLEI credential.   Credential Chaining <p>One of the unique properties of vLEI credentials, which utilize authentic chained data containers (ACDCs), is credential chaining. vLEI credentials are chained using strong cryptographic digests, starting from QVI vLEI credentials issued by the External GARs. For example, an OOR vLEI credential of an OOR person is chained in the following manner:</p>  (5) the OOR vLEI credential, which is issued by a QVI, is cryptographically chained to (3) an OOR AUTH vLEI credential issued by an LE that the OOR person represents,  (3) the OOR AUTH vLEI credential is cryptographically chained to (2) an LE vLEI credential that the same QVI issues to the&nbsp;LE,  (2) LE vLEI credential is cryptographically chained to (1) a QVI vLEI credential that the External GARs (GEDA) issue to the&nbsp;QVI  The GEDA is cryptographically linked to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.  <p>Due to credential chaining, every vLEI credential can be cryptographically verified, all the way, to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note: The cryptographic digests for ACDCs are generated using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-2-said-and-acdc-de6bc544b95e">Self-Addressing Identifier (SAID)</a> protocol.</blockquote> Conclusion <p>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) has laid a foundation for a globally interoperable digital identity system for organizations. The vLEI EGF defines a hierarchical governance structure where GLEIF is the root of reputational trust. It employs a novel approach to key management using Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) and autonomic identifiers (AIDs) that serve as the root of attributional trust. This approach enables multiple authorized representatives to collectively control their organizations’ decentralized identifiers. Most importantly, the vLEI EGF defines 6 types of vLEI credentials with rigorous cryptographic relationships that reflect the hierarchical structure of the vLEI ecosystem. Every vLEI credential is cryptographically chained and can be verified, all the way, to the GLEIF Root&nbsp;AID.</p><p>The vLEI EGF facilitates the issuance of vLEI credentials, providing the highest level of identity assurance. These credentials enable digital verification of organizations and their authorized representatives globally and across industries. The vLEIs stand as a cutting-edge, interoperable, and decentralized solution in the organizational digital identity ecosystem, positioning them as the utmost secure and trustworthy choice for global business transactions.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">vLEI Demystified Part 1: Comprehensive Overview</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Holochain started the year with the release of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-released/">Holochain Beta 0.1.0</a> and it’s been an avalanche of development and achievements since then. We can’t talk about everything here, but want to share some highlights with you. As we bundle up for winter in the northern hemisphere (and rejoice at summer in the southern hemisphere), let’s walk through the year together to remember where we have been.&nbsp;</p> Spring: Holochain Beta <p>The Holochain beta release continued through the spring with <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/tag/dev-tools-explainers/">dev tooling</a>, updates to the 0.1.x series, and even an early release of 0.2.x. Paul d’Aoust started work on our dev documentation and refreshed <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Dev Portal</a>, and the team could feel the excitement as we continued to improve on a stable codebase.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking Holochain back out on the road, we <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-at-ethdenver-2023/">attended EthDenver</a>, hosting a series of satellite events where we gave blockchain devs a hands-on opportunity to feel what Holochain can do, and collectively we imagined the future of the web.</p><p>In March, we had our first of two online <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-training-recap/">Dev Trainings</a>. The course was taught by Marcus Phillips, co-founder of the immersive software engineering school <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/hack-reactor/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hack Reactor</a>, and community developer Guillem Cordoba (check out his work at <a href="https://darksoil.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Dark Soil</a>). The cohort of eighteen students learned how to work with Holochain’s backend code, preparing them to build custom distributed applications.</p><p>This spring we felt Holochain really <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/becoming-viable-seeds-to-saplings/">become viable</a>.</p> Summer: DWeb Camp <p>Summer took us to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dweb-camp-2023-holochain/">DWeb Camp</a>. For those that don’t know it, DWeb Camp is a sort of Mecca for the distributed web community. Getting to think, work, talk, and present alongside and with all of the other projects building the next web (from Filecoin and OpenAI to Secure Scuttlebutt and Spritely) was truly an honor. But we might have learned the most from the <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/fellowships/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb fellows</a> who brought their openness, honesty, situated need, and greatly innovative ideas to the gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>As a co-sponsor of the event, Holochain showed up in force, with dozens of team and&nbsp; community members attending. In addition to presentations, workshops, and panels, we developed a custom app for the event. We decided to create an app for scheduling and managing emergent sessions across the event. But this app had to work in the woods, and on people’s phones. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/emergence-lessons-in-contextual-complexity/">In the end, we stumbled and learned.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>The need for mobile on Holochain has pushed us to develop a deep relationship with smartphone manufacturer <a href="https://volla.online/en/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Volla</a> as a first test case for a mobile native Holochain. In May, community devs <a href="https://twitter.com/Holochain/status/1663847940853571586?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hedayat Abedijoo and Nick Stebbings showcased a small Holochain application at the Volla community event</a>. Since then we have been in a collaborative process of application design and testing to get Holochain apps running on their privacy-first OS.</p> Fall: Connecting to Web3 <p>Fall took the team from conference, to podcast, to conference, including a number of appearances as speakers and moderators. Check out a few of the opportunities we had to talk to the world about Holochain throughout the year.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1689684274390212622?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mary on the Diving into Crypto podcast</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1692092474506752391?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mary on the Web3 Disruptor podcast</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7puEjHI2J4&amp;list=PLOuXrtFJO6zXsTs56d0bpPmVpHjMO7m50&amp;index=1&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Zebu Live 2023: How Verifiable Data Powers Up Web3</a>  <p>This fall also saw Holochain used in Web3 and blockchain contexts in new ways. <a href="https://welcometonor.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nor</a>, is a Web3 gaming platform using Holo and Holochain for a variety of systems, such as identity and login. Nor is creating new models of skill based gaming and reward in Web3.</p><p>Similarly <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a>, developed by Josh Hardy of the <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rain Protocol</a>, in partnership with our Executive Director Mary Camacho showed that it was possible to secure NFT assets on a Holochain app. The app is a live play, distributed art game, inspired by r/place, where players collaboratively make art which they can mint into NFTs. We showcased this game at events from <a href="https://www.zebulive.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Zebu Live</a> in London, to <a href="https://devconnect.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DevConnect</a> in Istanbul, and we even <a href="https://twitter.com/holochain/status/1721146092593586602?ref=blog.holochain.org">hosted our own event</a> spinning off from <a href="https://nftsanfrancisco.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">NFT SF</a> when the conference was sadly put on hold. Fractal Tribute acts as a proof of concept for new ways to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">augment NFTs using Holochain</a>.</p><p>In October we also held our second online <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/joins-us-and-learn-holochain/">Dev Training</a>.

The Holo network is built on the Holochain framework to provide distributed hosting to hApps. With the release of the Holo Network-RC and the upcoming Holo Launch, we have a real case study showing a performant Holochain used for a commercial application. This will spur development of Holochain apps, and we expect an increase in both apps hosted on the Holo network and operating directly in peer networks as a result.

			 What Should You Expect from a Tokenization Platform in 2024 
<p>Season’s Greetings from all of us at Tokeny!</p>
<p>As we approach the new year, it’s the perfect time to upgrade and take a look at your tokenization strategies. Let’s clear up a common misconception first: Far from being a straightforward task,&nbsp;building a robust tokenization stack demands more than just deploying smart contracts.</p>
<p>The platform should not only support advanced smart contracts such as ERC-3643 for on-chain compliance but also&nbsp;offer tools for transfer management, automation, data management, interoperability with existing financial systems, and a seamless investor experience. Let’s break these down below.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Tools for Automation and Token Lifecycle Management: 
<p>🎛️&nbsp;Onchain Compliance Rules: &nbsp;The platform must allow for setting up compliance rules via smart contracts (e.g., jurisdictions of investors, KYC checks, etc.) and utilizing a permission system to manage and appoint agents, for example, KYC agents for signing KYC credentials to investors’ digital identity.</p>
<p>🆔&nbsp;Digital Identities: &nbsp;Every stakeholder, and especially investors, must be properly identified on the blockchain to apply permissions and compliance rules. For this, an encrypted on-chain identity system is needed as wallets ownership cannot be used as proof of identity.</p>
<p>⛓️&nbsp;Blockchain Operations:&nbsp; As most operations result in blockchain transactions, the platform must prepare the needed parameters based on the issuers’ or their agents’ inputs, to facilitate the selection of concerned investors, gas fees, etc. Once ready, these transactions are sent for signature to the authorized agent. This should be made possible for all the functions provided by the token smart contracts (e.g., around 120 functions for the ERC3643 standard).</p>
<p>🔐&nbsp;Secure Wallet Solutions:&nbsp; Wallet solutions are needed for the issuer, its agents, and each investor. For issuers and their agents, they must support signature policies without impeding automation. For investors, they should offer non-custodial options to avoid regulatory constraints. Ideally, the wallet solution is integrated into the tokenization platform to automatically generate wallets, ensuring regulatory compliance and enabling seamless interchangeability through account abstraction.</p>
<p>🖥️&nbsp;User-friendly Interface:&nbsp; The platform must be user-friendly so that any stakeholder, regardless of coding or blockchain experience, can seamlessly navigate the platform. For investors, it should also offer an e-commerce-like experience akin to commonly used mainstream platforms with features like built-in self-custody wallets and gas tanks to eliminate friction points.</p>
 Data Management: 
<p>📊&nbsp;Real-time On-chain Data:&nbsp; The platform needs a performant indexer to sync blockchain data with the smart contracts orchestration platform. This is done by reading different nodes on the network. The platform has to provide an infrastructure management service to listen to the token and compliance smart contracts events, route to the most performing RPC, and provide a real-time data stream to the software and its users.</p>
<p>📑&nbsp;Investor Data Management: &nbsp;Managing investor data requires an automated cap table that aggregates off-chain data like personal identity data and on-chain data (i.e transaction records, digital identity credentials, etc.). In addition, issuers should be able to choose where they prefer the off-chain data to be stored.</p>
<p>📁&nbsp;Asset Data Management:&nbsp;&nbsp; To facilitate distribution, it is crucial to provide detailed documents and information about the tokenized assets to investors. The tokenization platform should enable the enrichment of the token with documents, third-party certifications (e.g., ESG), valuation, etc.</p>
 Interoperability with Financial Systems: 
<p>🔌&nbsp;Legacy Systems: &nbsp;Large institutions need API-ready solutions to plug and play in their legacy systems to ensure the adoption of new technologies is seamless. Synchronizing investors with their on-chain identities, or integrating token actions in existing investor portals are usually the most needed integrations.</p>
<p>🌐&nbsp;Trading Venues and DeFi Services:&nbsp; Broad distribution and diverse liquidity options are the most important reasons issuers tokenize assets on-chain. Therefore, the platform must enable issuers to connect natively to the best trading platforms (centralized exchanges, OTC, etc.), distributors, and DeFi applications (DEX, collateralization, etc.), to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>As we enter this new era of finance, asset managers, banks, and asset servicers must accelerate their tokenization market presence to stay ahead of the curve in 2024. It is crucial to collaborate with a seasoned tokenization platform provider, rather than starting from scratch.</p>

2024 Will Be the Year Tokenization Truly (Finally) Begins</p>
<p>After several years of being the next-big-thing, next year will be when tokenization of real-world assets really takes off, says Colin Butler, Global Head of Institutional Capital at Polygon Labs.

DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF69 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $27K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Dec 7, 2023: $0.511 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.0798 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.511 / OCEAN * 37,500 OCEAN = $19,163&nbsp;USD  $0.0798 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $7,980&nbsp;USD  Total: $19,163 + $7,980 = $27,142.5 ≈ $27K&nbsp;USD   Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.govtech.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Government Technology</a> and SpruceID hosted a webinar featuring a fireside chat between Wayne Chang, CEO and Founder of SpruceID, and Ajay Gupta, Chief Digital Transformation Officer at the State of California DMV, about their <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">recently launched mobile driver’s license</a> (mDL).</p><p>This conversation between Wayne and Ajay gave an inside look into the past couple of years working together to bring the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">Gartner-award-winning</a> mDL to the State of California residents — from addressing complexities with implementation, working to adhere to global standards, understanding the rapidly evolving market ecosystem, and more.</p><p>Read through the top 5 takeaways of this conversation, and listen to the full recording below to learn how the State of California DMV worked alongside SpruceID as their technology partner to bring this project to life.</p><p></p> 1 - People Expect a Digital Experience <p>At the start of this discussion, Ajay touched on how people expect a digital experience when interacting with any establishment in today's increasingly digital world. This expectation has been accelerated drastically by the pandemic when businesses were required to offer services online. With the shift to digital, people will inevitably be asked to verify their identity online in various situations.</p><p>Offering both a mobile driver’s license and an online self-serve onboarding experience provides increased efficiency and convenience for the user so they are not stuck in long lines waiting for a human to help them renew their driver’s license. It also greatly reduces the cost of operations within a DMV.</p><p></p> 2 - Implementing an mDL Comes with Complexities <p>Standing up a program that provisions mobile driver’s licenses has many advantages, such as reducing fraud (seen today in situations such as the billions of dollars lost by false claims to unemployment benefits online) or eliminating fake IDs. However, getting to this point isn’t without challenges and complexities.</p><p>Starting out, one question the California DMV had was how they would gain residents’ trust when they started using their digital ID. In the webinar, Wayne and Ajay touch on how SpruceID helped to introduce cryptography and other security elements, such as biometrics, to allow California to securely provision mobile driver’s licenses that could be trusted and help to eliminate issues such as fraudulent claims.</p><p>Another challenge was creating transparency with users regarding how their information is handled in the California DMV wallet app. The California DMV and SpruceID prioritized keeping users’ data private without there being any digital trail of how and where residents use their mDL. </p><p>In addition, they mention how important it was for selective disclosure to be built into the app so that residents provide only the minimum amount of information required when being asked to present their digital ID. It should be clear to users exactly what information they consent to share in each situation. For example:</p><p>Despite having to work through several complexities with the technology and ecosystem along the way, both the California DMV and SpruceID describe how they're confident this solution best serves California residents while preserving their privacy and keeping their data secure. In the full webinar recording, listen to both Wayne and Ajay dissect some of the complexities they encountered throughout this undertaking, and how they were addressed by technology.</p><p></p> 3 - Open-Source Has Its Advantages <p>One quality unique to SpruceID’s mobile driver’s license implementation is having built an open-source mobile wallet. The many benefits of using an open-source solution include things like customization, third-party audits, and increased trust and transparency. When discussing some of the open-source tools used, Ajay mentioned:</p><p>Allowing users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the software by checking the source code helps build accountability within a community of users.</p><p>In addition to the open-source approach, SpruceID also participates in a number of different working groups in order to contribute to some of the standards bodies on which our software is based. These standards bodies create technical frameworks to promote the safe and secure use of technology and define requirements for security, data elements, and more.</p><p>Wayne mentions how being an active participant and <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-license-interoperability-event/">helping lead events</a> for these standards groups has benefited SpruceID as an organization and has been a catalyst to drive the standards forward.</p><p></p> 4 - Market Ecosystem Opportunities are Endless <p>A high point of the webinar was hearing Wayne and Ajay talk through the multitude of market opportunities that will be brought about by the launch of California’s mobile driver’s license.</p><p>SpruceID and the California DMV talk through the market ecosystem that is being developed around digital credentials today, as well as their current efforts working with organizations that will begin accepting mobile driver’s licenses as part of their business model: </p><p>Facilitating market growth, including momentum from both users of mobile driver’s licenses and businesses accepting these digital credentials, will open many doors and opportunities for growth in the overall ecosystem.</p><p></p> 5 - The Future for California is Bright <p>As the webinar came to a close, Ajay talked through some of the exciting plans for the California DMV that lie ahead on their roadmap. To name a few, working with credit unions and banks to start accepting the mDL as an identity verification mechanism and creating digital registration cards, titles, and disabled placards. They are also collaborating with law enforcement on a way for police officers to safely and securely accept a mobile driver’s license.</p><p>SpruceID is looking forward to seeing what’s in store for the State of California DMV and working together as the current landscape evolves. We feel grateful and honored to have been able to partner with the California DMV team on this groundbreaking initiative.</p> Watch the Webinar <p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of what was covered during this inspiring and educational fireside chat, so head over to our YouTube channel to listen to the whole conversation between Wayne and Ajay.</p><p>Interested in chatting with us more about your own digital credentials, whether it’s augmenting existing infrastructure or creating something new? <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact us today</a>.</p> <a href="https://youtu.be/oy7ycRoCiws?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Watch Webinar Recording</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Despite recently introduced regulations, gambling on the black market in Germany is still alive and well. We gathered experts from the industry to discuss why that is and what can be done to curb the worrying trend of illegal gambling. 



 



<p>The drop in tax revenue from €55 million to €10 million per month is due to an inhospitable regulatory environment in Germany, according to Nico Jansen, CEO at Bet IT Best GmbH, who was speaking at our recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/germanys-problem-illegal-market-gambling/">webinar on black market gambling in Germany</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the introduction of the State Treaty on Gambling in 2021, German players have been flocking to either offshore operators, or unregulated black market operators. Why is this happening, and what can be done to stop it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the recent IDnow webinar, ‘Germany’s problem with the black market’, we gathered experts from the field, including Ted Menmuir, Content Director at the Sports Betting Community, Jochen Biewer, Managing Director at Chevron Consultants, Bernd Henning at IGamingConsult.com, Laszlo Pados, Brand Manager at Greentube GmbH, Nico Jansen, CEO at Bet IT Best GmbH, and our own Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming to delve deeper into the subject and explore what operators across the board need to know.</p>



 
   
     
                     Germany’s problem with the black market. 
                     Watch a panel of experts debate why Germany has witnessed a sudden increase in black market gambling, upcoming regulatory challenges, and what the future of gambling in the German market may look like.

 The current state of gambling regulation in Germany. 



<p>Historically, Germany has had a rather complex and fragmented approach to gambling legislation, with individual states retaining considerable autonomy. Recognizing that an outright ban on online gambling was unsuccessful and had allowed offshore operators to flourish, a new State Treaty on Gambling was enacted in 2021 to regulate the market and offer licenses to German operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (GlüStV)</a> was first luanched, it introduced a centralized licensing system for online sports betting and casino games and aimed to unify and modernize the regulation of gambling across the country. A noble cause indeed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, while the requirement of operators to have a license opened the market and allowed private operators to break the state monopoly on certain forms of gambling, it also introduced several restrictions and player protection measures, that, some argue, have largely driven players to the black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include:&nbsp;</p>



  Deposit and stake limits<br>  Identity verification<br>  Strict advertising guidelines<br>  Centralized database for monitoring activities  



<p>Read more in our blog post, ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">Online Gambling in Germany: regulations, restrictions and ramifications</a>‘.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online casinos licensed by the national gambling authority (<a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/de/">Glücksspielbehörde der Länder, GGL</a>) must enforce a deposit limit of €1,000 per player per month across all operators. This is monitored through a centralized database to check player behavior. To prevent excessive gambling, players are subjected to a €1 stake limit on casino games and a 5-second delay on slot machines. Operators must also pay a 5.3% turnover tax on each bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sportsbook operators face similar restrictions regarding deposit limits. Taxes are even higher, with a whopping 8% tax levied on sports betting. Certain types of betting, such as live betting and fantasy sports, are prohibited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As pointed out in our webinar, the DSWV report shows that between 2021 and 2022, total <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/compliance-updates/2023/03/13/131693/german-sports-betting-association-calls-for-rethinking-of-regulation-to-combat-the-black-market/">sports betting stakes fell from €9.4 billion to €8.2 billion</a>, and as a result, taxes collected fell from €470 million to €433 million, a drop of 13%.</p>



 What are the risks of black market gambling? 



<p>Perhaps because of the above, the German Betting Trade Association (DSWV) has reported a 65% increase in illicit gambling activities and sports betting activities and is calling for more action against black market activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gambling sites that operate without the necessary licenses from the GGL or use alternate licenses from international authorities such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta Gaming Authority MGA</a> or Curaçao are operating in defiance of the legal frameworks established by the government, and are therefore considered black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumers who use illegal or unregulated online platforms are doing so at their own risk, as consumer protection standards may not necessarily be enforced, which increases the risk of fraud, a lack of fair play, or responsible gambling mechanisms for players. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/money-laundering-threat-online-casinos/">Illegal gambling operations can also be used for money laundering</a> and other illicit activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lack of accountability and transparency can also contribute to difficulties in tracking financial transactions and investigating illegal activities.</p>



 Betting bad: What factors contribute to the growth of illegal gambling? 



<p>A lively discussion point from the webinar was what forced law-abiding German citizens to the black market. Participants suggested several reasons.&nbsp;</p>



  Better entertainment: Players are attracted to offshore gambling sites because they offer more games, betting options and bonus offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  No limits: There is no pre-set deposit limit, but players are often encouraged to set a daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limit as part of the operator’s responsible gambling strategy. Similarly, there is no €1 stake limit. Players can choose stake size according to preferences and financial capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  More features: Black market online casinos also offer features such as automatic betting, which spins the slot machine reels a pre-defined number of times without the need to manually click after each spin. There is also no 5-second delay on virtual slots.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Higher RTP: Due to the high tax rates for German operators, RTPs (return-to-player) on games are much lower, leading to smaller pay-outs on regulated platforms. As players often opt for games with the highest RTPs, they are invariably drawn to the black market.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Better experience: No deposit and stake limits, no predefined spin duration, more features, and more games can lead to an overall better user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>While there are a multitude of reasons for consumers to opt for black market gambling sites, a long and expensive licensing process also means many operators may find it more attractive to be licensed elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although being a licensed operator has its advantages, not least of which is being able to show you are compliant and adhere to fair play and responsible gaming measures, it does not necessarily make financial sense. Revenue is capped due to deposit limits, taxes are high, and the offering is limited as every game needs to be tested and approved by GGL (even if another operator already offers the exact same game).</p>



 The challenges, loopholes and regulatory hurdles of the German market. 



<p>Since coming into effect, the German State Treaty has proven to be largely ineffective in preventing access to the black market. Attempts at geo-blocking websites are often ineffective, as a recent example from Turkey showed, where one unregulated site was blocked but within minutes had sent a new URL to players via an SMS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main tool German authorities have in the fight against the black market is the ability to pressure payment providers to not process payments for illegal operators. However, when one payment method fails, players invariably just switch methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important factor driving players to the black market is the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC check</a>. As per KYC requirements, German operators are required to verify players at the registration stage or within 72 hours to weed out fraudsters and prevent underage users from accessing games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the user experience, especially for privacy-conscious Germans can be seen as a hurdle many are simply unwilling to surmount. Few people want to hand over personal details to use a product or service they don’t know much about. Many offshore operators don’t require immediate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-verification/">identity verification</a>, and usually only do so when players withdraw (a lot of) money from the site. In the case of the Malta Gaming market, this is usually north of €2,000.</p>



 Challenges faced by regulators. 



<p>With a steady decline in tax revenues from legal gambling activities, regulators need to create a more supportive and inclusive environment for players and operators alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the <a href="https://www.dswv.de/">German Betting Association (DSWV)</a> has pledged to work closer with operators to crack down on illegal operators. Industry experts don’t necessarily see this as the right approach, as more bans won’t solve the problem of players being drawn to more attractive offers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prohibition and restrictions can drive consumers directly to the black market. As covered in the webinar, high barriers to entry for operators, such as a lengthy licensing process and high taxes on stakes, can be a significant barrier to entry for many operators, while players are often deterred from regulated operators by the monthly deposit and wagering limits, as well as the need to verify their identity before placing a bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the webinar, Bernd Henning of <a href="https://www.igamingconsult.com/en/">IGamingConsult.com</a> agreed that while steps must be taken to prevent players from using the black market, the main conundrum facing operators is “How can we operate within the confines of the law and still make a profit?”</p>



 Does LUGAS help or hinder? 



<p>LUGAS, which is Germany’s Interstate Gambling Evaluation System, is used to evaluate the data submitted by operators and ensure deposit limits and other regulations are met. It is mandatory for all online gambling operators to connect to LUGAS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a cross-operator database, it includes deposit limits and regulates access to the regulator’s platform. The system enforces a rule that restricts a player to accessing only one platform at a time, coupled with a specific deposit limit. However, the system is not without its detractors, with even the DSWV raising concerns about data protection. A common criticism is that operators themselves have no way of auditing LUGAS, which raises serious concerns about transparency and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gluecksspiel-behoerde.de/de/aufsichtssysteme/technische-richtlinien-und-zugang-zum-testsystem-des-laenderuebergreifenden-gluecksspielaufsichtssystem-lugas">LUGAS</a> appears to be contributing to the growing trend of players turning to the black market. In Denmark, for example, the imposition of a deposit limit led to a significant shift of players to unregulated casinos. However, as soon as this restriction was lifted, players returned to the regulated market. This underlines the importance for regulators to monitor developments in other regulated markets and learn from their experiences with different regulations to effectively navigate the dynamic landscape of online gambling.</p>



 The way forward for regulators, operators, and players. 



<p>The current landscape of gambling regulation in Germany is a valiant, but perhaps misguided attempt to modernize the industry and strike a balance between consumer protection and market openness. However, ironically, it also appears to be driving users and operators to the black market, which suggests a misalignment with the original goal of player protection. A comprehensive re-evaluation of the entire regulatory process may be necessary to achieve the desired results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep players within the regulated sphere, cooperation with established international regulators like the <a href="https://www.mga.org.mt/">MGA</a> is essential. Working together to simplify processes and gain a deeper understanding of the market will benefit German regulators, operators, and players alike. For example, the removal of deposit and wagering limits could help to retain players, while the introduction of a game whitelist could streamline the licensing process for operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ongoing discussions within the German regulatory landscape underline the importance of adapting strategies to adjust to shifting trends and market development. Whether this is done by launching a series of consultations with invested stakeholders like what is currently happening in the UK will ultimately be the decision of German regulators and policymakers. What is clear though is that a collaborative and adaptive approach will be key in creating a thriving, regulated gambling industry that addresses the challenges of an attractive black market.</p>

<p>Today, we announced a new logo for Bluesky:</p>

 Why did we choose a butterfly? 
<p>Well, of course, it flies. But more importantly, it is a symbol of change and transformation. Early on, we noticed that people were organically using the butterfly emoji 🦋 to indicate their Bluesky handles. We loved it, and adopted it as it spread. The butterfly speaks to our mission of transforming social media into something new.</p>
<p>Like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, we are starting to open up. Posts on Bluesky have been public from the start through the open protocol, but today we’re making them publicly accessible through the app. We’re unfolding a little bit at a time, and are excited to bring you along on this journey of metamorphosis!</p>
 What’s in a name? 
<p>The name “Bluesky” was originally a placeholder for the project started by Twitter to build an open social protocol. I decided to keep the name when I was chosen as the lead of the project. It’s memorable and symbolizes the open space of possibilities: the Twitter bird freed from a closed platform to fly in Bluesky’s open ecosystem.</p>

The last slide of the presentation I gave to Twitter in my proposal for how to build Bluesky.
<p>As the project matured, we named the underlying standard the AT Protocol, or atproto. Bluesky, as the more colorful (and less technical) name everyone was familiar with, is also what we named the first app we built on atproto. But Bluesky is not the limit. Many more apps and experiences are already beginning to emerge — there are thousands of custom feeds, dozens of other clients, and atproto will eventually support other apps. We hope that Bluesky, as the first app, will be a catalyst for change and transform how social media works, like a butterfly flapping its wings.</p>
 What if I don’t like butterflies? 
<p>The great thing about an open network is that anyone can build on top of it and customize it further! Maybe you like birds more. Well, someone could build BirdSky, and you could switch to using that and still be in the same network, still have the same friends, and still see the same posts.</p>
<p>The protocol that makes Bluesky, BirdSky, and endless other options possible is also what makes Bluesky “billionaire-proof.” Just like you can change email providers or cell phone carriers and bring all your contacts, photos, or messages with you, in an open network, you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.</p>
 Explore Bluesky 
<p>We built Bluesky to be a home for public conversation — breaking news, commentary and analysis, jokes and more. And we’re taking one step closer to this goal by releasing a public web view, which means that you don’t have to be logged in to view posts on Bluesky.</p>
<p>Starting today, you can easily view Bluesky posts without being logged in. Sharing will be more convenient — whether it's a joke you want to text a friend, or a post you want to embed in an article.</p>

 In November 2022, the European Banking Authority issued its guidelines for the use of remote entry solutions in the banking and financial sector. High-level or substantial identification schemes and qualified electronic signature solutions took the spotlight. So what’s the difference between these two solutions? How do you choose? PVID vs QES: Which solutions are best for banking and financial relationships? 



 A changing regulatory environment: an overview. 



 The six requirements of the Monetary and Financial Code. 



<p>Article L.561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier) sets out six means of customer identification, to ensure that the customer enters into a remote relationship in complete confidence. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking establishment</a> must apply at least two of these measures (generally number 1 plus another complementary measure) in order to comply with local <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">anti-money laundering directives</a>.</p>



 







 European Banking Association recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Since October 2, 2023, the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2022/EBA-GL-2022-15%20GL%20on%20remote%20customer%20onboarding/1043884/Guidelines%20on%20the%20use%20of%20Remote%20Customer%20Onboarding%20Solutions.pdf">European Banking Association (EBA) has been recommending the use of solutions</a> such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes, such as PVID, in order to strengthen the fight against fraud when entering into a relationship.</p>



 The position of the AMF and ACPR in France.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In line with the EBA’s recommendations, the authorities that regulate the French financial market, Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) and L’Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de (ACPR), point out the vulnerabilities notably linked to the first installment in the fight against fraud. However, this third measure remains compliant, and is often perceived as less burdensome in terms of user experience, and simpler for regulated institutions to implement, than the measures outlined by the EBA.</p>



 Focus on complementary entry methods. 



<p>Following the EBA’s recommendations, solutions such as qualified electronic signatures and substantial or high-level identification schemes like PVID are favored by regulators when it comes to guaranteeing a more secure entry into the relationship. But what exactly does this mean? Let’s take a closer look.</p>



 Qualified electronic signature.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> offers the highest level of security and guarantee of all electronic signatures. It reliably identifies the signatory and protects it against falsification or alteration. It uses a qualified certificate issued by a certified supplier and it is a particularly robust solution from an anti-fraud point-of-view, and inclusive from a user experience point-of-view.</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a picture of his or her identity document&nbsp;  The user’s face is then captured on video&nbsp;&nbsp;  Finally, the user signs his or her contract electronically  



 







 PVID certified by ANSSI.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In March 2021, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">ANSSI issued a set of requirements for Remote Identity Verification Service Providers (PVID)</a>. The aim of this certification is to create a uniform, trusted service offering for identity verification providers. This solution is built for security, and is designed to limit identity fraud and advanced forgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does the solution work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The user takes a video capture of his or her document and face.&nbsp;  These captures are then automatically and manually verified by an agent specialized in document and identity fraud.&nbsp;  A file of evidence is built up, and a verdict is reached on the authenticity of these captures and on the identity of the person concerned.  



 







<blockquote><p>Financial operators need to strike the right balance between having a system that filters out as many fraud attempts as possible, while letting legitimate customers through.</p>Baptiste Forestier – Head of Compliance &amp; DPO at Hero</blockquote>



 The choice of solution: PVID vs QES. 



<p>To strike the right balance, both PVID and Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) offer substantial advantages, as mentioned above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-certification-interview/">IDnow is one of the few certified providers</a> of both electronic signature and identity verification solutions who can help you achieve compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our qualified e-signature solution boasts broad geographical coverage and an easy-to-use workflow, while meeting the main needs of today’s financial players: compliance, fraud prevention and an optimized customer experience.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>This 3-part blog series has been written to explore why money in its current form is a primary driver of the metacrisis¹ and what an alternative system could look like. We have divided our reflections into three sections to address the following questions:</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic?  What could a desirable future scenario look&nbsp;like?  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?   Part 1: what are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? <p>The global monetary system sits at the centre of every crisis we face, yet it is often excluded from mainstream diagnostics and potential response strategies. In this blog we will trace a number of issues from the intrinsic qualities of money itself, through layers of the economy such as money issuance rights and the profit motive, to the brutal service level manifestations of monetary colonisation and transactional oppression.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@mrthetrain?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Joshua Hoehne</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><blockquote>1. Money as an intrinsically extractive technology</blockquote><p>In economic textbooks and in the general public discourse, money is often framed as a neutral tool that enables the real economy to function. Perceptions have shifted somewhat following David Graeber’s work highlighting that its origins were bound to social relationships rather than to barter². Despite this, there is still a persistent idea that whilst money might represent underlying social contracts, it is not a powerful force in its own right. In contrast to this benign conception of money, Daniel Schmachtenberger has recently described it as a “unit of game theoretic optimality”³. He argues that it is a uniquely destructive technology for the following reasons:</p>  Money as a highly liquid and abstract value layer: when we exchange goods or services for fiat money (i.e. currency that is not backed by a physical resource such as gold) we are taking complex, entangled values and ruthlessly converting them into a single, indiscriminate and highly liquid token of opportunity. In doing so we are incentivised to consume, exploit and pollute the base layer value of everything.  Singularly upside returns: in an exchange based situation there is a point after which having more of a tangible good or service leads to diminishing returns. In the case of money the opposite is true. Once a base resource is converted into money, it can then be leveraged to generate further monetary returns (e.g. interest, dividends, speculative trading). Thus the liquid token that was exchanged for an underlying resource can self-perpetuate, giving rise to greater claims on other resources and creating an ever increasing cycle of extraction.  <p>As an example, imagine somebody who runs a rose farm and agrees to exchange roses for another commodity such as oil. Having arranged the trade there would be a limit to how many roses would be deemed useful by the supplier of the oil. At this point the roses would have a low liquidity value and there would be a diminishing return on harvesting them. Contrast this scenario with the reality of being able to exchange the roses immediately for money. If the current demand for roses is high, there is a strong incentive to force grow them and sell as many as possible, irrespective of the impact on the intrinsic health of the plants and soil. The money received in exchange for the physical plants can then be used to gain access to more oil (or anything else, including converting the rose farm into a car park if it is more profitable to do&nbsp;so).</p><blockquote>2. Profit as an extractive force that harnesses the liquid optimality of&nbsp;money</blockquote><p>Money can also be understood as the crystallised outcome of profitable activity. Whilst profit generation might be the surface level target, the fundamental goal is to secure the rights over future choices and resources. Profit is money and money is liquid optimality.</p><p>Profit itself is variously described as a distributed signal of value, an appropriate reward, a driver for innovation and the cause of the economic growth obligation. Under different circumstances each of these claims is both true and disputable. If we want to avoid unhelpful, binary reactions to the idea that in its current form profit (and indirectly money) is an extractive force, then these dual ‘truths’ are important to unpack. How would our behaviour change if we understood profit to be a shapeshifting force depending on the&nbsp;context?</p><p>As a signal of value, profit is an important way for people to indicate their preferences and thus collectively shape economic activity. Without such a mechanism we would be reliant on a type of authoritarian centralised planning. In terms of motivation and inspiring progress, it also provides a powerful incentive. However, if we consider how narrowly we define profit can we legitimately claim that it represents value creation? Can a genuine measure of value be bounded by time or geographical context? In an interconnected world, externalities are a delusion yet they are currently excluded from our calculations of&nbsp;profit.</p><p>The way that we define, measure and use profit determines its form. Thus, profit can continue to exist as an extractive claim over undefined future value flows, but it could also be reimagined as a generative tool for decentralised inclusion.</p><blockquote>3. Commercial bank money issuance as a multiplier of future extraction and repression</blockquote><p>The lion’s share of money issued in today’s economy is digitally created by commercial banks in the form of debt. The flexibility of this system has its benefits but its unregulated impact on living systems is profoundly destructive. When debt is issued in this way it creates a future claim on energy, materials and human labour. The right to use the credit (and its associated interest) in the present day creates a future obligation to convert biophysically linked reserves into decoupled monetary units of repayment.</p><p>A second observation is that entrusting the money supply to a niche group of profit incentivised bankers, skews the distribution of who receives funding and thus perpetuates structural inequalities.</p><blockquote>4. Transactional oppression</blockquote><p>In 2010 Wikileaks was permanently blocked from accessing its Paypal account. More recently, a number of journalists and activists have reported having their accounts blocked or removed. A less publicised but equally debilitating phenomenon is that millions of people worldwide are denied the right to a bank account at all. In the UK alone, 1.3 million adults are described as being ‘debanked’ with no access to an account⁴. For some people, this may be a personal choice, but for many others it results from failing to meet KYC (know your client) requirements.</p><p>It is hardly a coincidence that many of the countries with the highest cryptocurrency usage are also amongst the most financially exclusive. For example, Thailand, Nigeria, the Philippines and South Africa all have an uptake of between 19–20% on a per capita basis and an unbanked population higher than&nbsp;30%⁵⁶.</p><p>If money is a social contract, then the ability to transact could be embedded as a fundamental human right, yet our current system ensures that for many this is far from the case. Whilst existing cryptocurrencies offer some reprieve, the dominance of centrally issued and controlled money still forces many communities and even countries into the&nbsp;margins.</p><blockquote>5. Monetary colonisation as a brutal expression of capitalist self-preservation</blockquote><blockquote>Colonialism may be over, but the system that it created — a system designed to siphon wealth from South to North — remains very much in place — <a href="https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2018/10/13/the-case-for-reparations#:~:text=Colonialism%20may%20be%20over%2C%20but,problem%20is%20in%20the%20past.">Jason&nbsp;Hickel</a></blockquote><p>The statues of colonists, slave traders and racists are being torn down across the US and UK. These protests reject past actions and condemn the suffering, extraction and violence on which the wealth of such nations was built. What they perhaps fail to acknowledge is that the colonisation is not something that happened in the past. Instead, it is still actively being deployed as a tactic to ensure the comfort and stability of the countries who hold the greatest monetary&nbsp;power.</p><p>One shocking example of this can be seen in the Franc de la Communauté Financière Africaine (<a href="https://taxjustice.net/2021/03/22/the-cfa-franc-as-a-vivid-symbol-of-colonial-continuities-in-francophone-africa/">CFA Franc</a>) which was introduced to Western Africa by the French in 1945. The fourteen countries that use it today are still required to trade internationally in Euros via the French Treasury. They also continually rank amongst the poorest countries in the world. On a wider scale, the US dollar as the global reserve currency creates multiple advantages for its issuing country. With that privilege comes a responsibility that is rarely acknowledged. MMT (Modern Monetary Theory) has a large following in the US, because for a country that mints the most prevalent global currency, the ability to print money is in fact a viable option to stimulate economic activity. Firstly, they can use it to buy goods and services from foreign countries who have a constant requirement for dollars. Secondly, their exchange rate is extremely resistant to devaluation. For the vast majority of countries that do not have a widely desired sovereign currency, this is simply not an option. On the flip side, when the US, UK or Eurozone raise their interest rates to maintain local financial stability, they are also outsourcing their inflation and often accompanying austerity to countries that hold debt in those currencies.</p><p>In our view, the five drivers outlined above are insidiously powerful forces. Left unaddressed they will render a just transition or even a survivable future impossible. This opens up some difficult questions. If we don’t make the self-sovereignty of money a priority, are inclusivity initiatives such as redistributing philanthropic funds futile? Whilst money exists as a singular, abstractive and indiscriminate medium of exchange, do we have any chance of first repairing and then regenerating our planetary home? As the spread of AI and web3 intensifies, how will this extraordinary technological power be&nbsp;wielded?</p><p>Whether such tools are deployed towards further speculation, extraction and exploitation or in service of our collective vitality is the fundamental question of our&nbsp;time.</p><p>As always, we are sharing these thoughts to provoke discussion and to invite feedback. Some initial ideas for alternative monetary futures are the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>This blog was written by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) under Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB. We aspire to start working on some tangible proofs of possibility for bioregional currencies in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>References:</p>  We are using the term metacrisis to describe the underlying crisis driving a multitude of crises.

<p>Have you been reading about digitally verifiable credentials and wanted to know more about them? Are you interested in digitally verifiable credentials but do not know how to get started? Well, then, you are at the right place – this blog post is all about getting started with verifiable credentials and seeing how they change how credentialing is done.</p>



<p>Credentialing is a simple enough workflow we all understand – an organisation issues the credentials to a recipient. In turn, the recipient can present, share or exchange the credentials to seek new opportunities, services and other things. Today, along with printed credentials, there are digital credentials as well – these are often in PDF and can be easily stored and exchanged. Verifiable credentials improve this workflow – they are secure, tamper-evident data representations that help anyone verify the credentials’ issuer and authenticity.</p>



<p>MARK Studio from Dhiway is a credential lifecycle management platform which empowers issuers to design, issue and manage verifiable documents as blockchain-anchored credentials. Including the blockchain as a system of record leads to immutable records, and thus these are tamper-evident. With MARK Studio, anyone can create certificates online and quickly issue them through well-thought-out steps. Transitioning from traditional print-ready credentialing flows to blockchain credentials could be daunting. So, MARK Studio has a Free plan to try out the workflows before committing to adoption. You can sign up to <a href="https://studio.dhiway.com/auth/register">FREE PLAN</a> and get started. The videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dhiwaynetworks">YouTube channel</a> can help you build and issue your first verifiable credential.</p>



<p>MARK Studio comes “batteries included” with over 60 templates and designs to choose from when creating Learning and Education Records (LERs), Skilling and Knowledge Records and Workplace Experience Records. Starting the credentialing journey with MARK Studio ensures that while you get a feel for verifiable credentials, you look at all kinds of records and data that need provenance – and you are soon on your way to verifiable documents. The verifiable documents issued on MARK Studio help reduce the risk of data abuse and thus add value to your data governance strategies. With secure blockchain-anchored credentials now readily available, you can even look at needs such as temporary passes, event passes and IDs to be designed and issued on MARK Studio.</p>



<p>Verifiable credentials on the CORD network blockchain enable recipients to request, receive, store and exchange a whole set of documents they collect as a learner and in their professional roles. The ease of machine verification, data security and integrity, and combining various sets of credentials into a need-based verifiable document (a “digital resume”) makes it a compelling proposition for all key stakeholders – the issuer, the verifier and the recipient. Today, many organisations are switching to blockchain-anchored verifiable credentials with MARK Studio – sign up and try it out for yourself.</p>

<p>Identity and access management (IAM) is a crucial security component and a business enabler for the modern enterprise — but it’s clear that current systems are falling short on both fronts. Enterprises remain rife with legacy systems, technology silos, and manual and disconnected processes that were never intended to cope with today’s complex identity environment. New threat vectors, often aided by generative AI, exploit the gaps in this patchwork of systems, with increasingly alarming consequences.</p>  
<p>A robust identity security strategy requires the consolidation of a broad set of identity assurance capabilities into a unified approach. A new position paper by industry analyst Simon Moffatt of the Cyber Hut explores the current state of IAM security and proposes guidelines for organizations to build a comprehensive Identity Assurance approach that can tackle these challenges.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Key Findings  
 Enterprises Face Multiple Operational and Identity Security Challenges  
<p>The current technological landscape has become increasingly complex, characterized by hybrid deployments, fragmented technology silos, and inadequate visibility and metrics. Employee onboarding and credential management processes remain manual and disjointed, creating friction and security gaps. The rising volume and variety of remote work and people supply chains puts further strain on systems and business.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Outdated Authentication and Identity Verification Processes Prevalent  
<p>Authentication stands out as a critical pinch point in user interactions, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Many organizations employ multiple MFA solutions without a clear pathway to consolidation or adoption of phishing-resistant passwordless authentication.</p> 
<p>Moreover, the lack of coherence and continuity in identity verification and validation processes severely impacts business and security, leading to issues such as cumbersome employee verification, fraud, credential theft, account takeover, and data breaches.</p> 
 The Need for Converged Identity Assurance  
<p>A comprehensive <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> strategy involves viewing authentication in stages of maturity, moving from siloed and coarse-grained methods to relying on an assured identity that is continually verified. The goal is to reduce fragmentation and trust boundaries, and overlay existing authentication with verified identities on an ongoing basis.</p> 
<p>By embracing a converged Identity Assurance approach, organizations improve identity security, accelerate adoption of Zero Trust principles, improve IAM productivity, and reduce their compliance exposure.</p> 
<p></p>

 What happened? 
<p>On December 16th Truffle Security disclosed a <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of/">Google OAuth vulnerability</a> that allows employees, even after leaving a company, to retain access to applications like Slack and Zoom. The vulnerability arises from the ability to create Google accounts where the email address has the domain of the corporate organization but does not actually belong to that organization. This poses a risk to organizations, service providers like Zoom and Slack, and Google itself.</p>
 How does it work? 
<p>1. First, the user must have an account in your corporate Google workspace, such as <a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a></p>
<p>2. Then the user creates a new personal Google account, using their existing email, but they add “+something” to the user name part of the email, eg. <a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a>. Because Google will essentially ignore anything after the + in an email address, the user will be able to receive all the verification emails in their corporate inbox. (They need to do this in advance of leaving the organization.)</p>
<p>User must click “Use your existing email” and use the alias user+something@example.com</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Now the user can use this google account to sign into 3rd party apps under the corporate domain. This is possible because many of these 3rd party apps only verify that the domain part of the email used when logging into the account is a known corporate account. (<a href="mailto:user+something@example.com">user+something@example.com</a> ⇒ domain = <a href="http://example.com">example.com</a>)</p>
<p></p>
 Was YeshID Affected? 
<p>No, users attempting to use this technique to log into YeshID would not be successful.</p>
 Recommendations 
 Detection 
 
 If your organization has tools to perform an email search (such as the Security Center Investigation Tool in Google Workspace), look for emails sent to addresses containing your domain and a “+” symbol to detect these shadow account creations. 
 Review the user lists in the applications your organization uses to look for accounts with email addresses containing a “+” symbol to detect users who may have exploited this vulnerability. 
 
 Prevention 
 
 If your organization uses applications that allow any user to sign in as long as they are from your domain, consider disabling that feature. For example, in Slack: <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace">https://slack.com/help/articles/115004856503-Manage-how-people-join-your-workspace</a> 
 Switch the application to use SAML for SSO if possible 
 
<p>Regular auditing of your user environment is important and YeshID can help.

<p>Businesses face an ever-expanding array of cyber threats. Phishing, the deceptive practice of tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information, sits prominently at the top. It’s not just about lost data; it’s about lost trust, credibility, and in many cases, significant financial repercussions. Enter Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), an established tool in the cybersecurity arsenal. But as cybercriminals become savvier, the call for more advanced, phishing resistant MFA grows louder.</p>
 
Understanding Phishing Resistant MFA 
<p>Phishing resistant MFA takes the foundational principles of MFA and enhances them. While traditional MFA might rely on something you know (a password) and something you have (a mobile device for an SMS code), phishing-resistant variants add authentication request elements much harder to replicate or steal. This could be a physical device like a hardware token or something inherent to hardware security keys the user, like a biometric detail.<br>
The biometric authentication and login process, for instance, utilizes unique physical or behavioral attributes – from fingerprints to voice patterns. Its strength lies in its uniqueness; while a password can be stolen or guessed, replicating a retina pattern remains profoundly challenging.<br>
Today, cybercriminals employ various tactics to deceive individuals and organizations such as:</p>
 
 Spear Phishing: Unlike generic phishing attacks that target a broad audience, spear phishing is tailored to a specific individual or organization. Having done meticulous research, the attacker crafts a personalized message, making the deceit harder to spot. A typical scenario might involve mimicking communication from a senior executive or an HR representative requesting sensitive data or actions. 
 Whaling: This is a subset of spear phishing but targets high-profile individuals like CEOs or CFOs. Given the potential high return, attackers invest time in understanding the executive’s behavior, likes, dislikes, and even personal schedules, aiming to bypass traditional detection methods. 
 Smishing and Vishing: As mobile usage grows, attackers have begun to target users via SMS (Smishing) and voice calls (Vishing). For example, one might receive an SMS from a “bank” claiming unauthorized activity and requesting immediate action. Vishing attacks, meanwhile, involve human interaction, with attackers using social engineering techniques to extract information over a phone call.<br>
To fully grasp the gravity and evolution of these contemporary cyber threats, it’s crucial to delve into the historical backdrop from which they emerged. Historical Context of Phishing and MFA 
 
 Historical Context of Phishing and MFA 
<p>Over the past few decades, as the digital world has expanded, so too have cyber threats. Phishing began as simple email scams but rapidly evolved, targeting more prominent organizations and employing more sophisticated tactics. In response resist phishing, the cybersecurity industry introduced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to secure authentication and add an extra layer of protection.<br>
Early MFA systems were rudimentary, often relying solely on passwords and security questions. But with the increasing sophistication of modern phishing campaigns and techniques, MFA had to evolve, leading to the advanced phishing-resistant systems we see today.</p>
 
Why Phishing Resistant MFA is Essential 
<p>Recent years have witnessed a surge in phishing attempts targeting businesses, and online services regardless of size or domain. Beyond the immediate financial losses, which can be substantial, phishing attacks erode client trust and tarnish an organization’s image for years.<br>
Furthermore, the data they store grows as more businesses undergo digital transformations. This makes them attractive targets for cybercriminals. Incorporating phishing resistant technologies and security keys into MFA can act as a formidable barrier, significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.</p>
 
ROI of Phishing-Resistant MFA 
<p>When considering any significant change in organizational processes, especially one that involves costs, it’s essential to evaluate the Return on Investment (ROI). With phishing-resistant MFA, the ROI isn’t just measured in monetary terms. Yes, there can be direct cost savings from averting potential cyberattacks, but the intangible benefits are equally vital.<br>
Enhanced brand reputation, infrastructure security agency increased customer trust, and adherence to industry regulations can result in long-term business benefits, from customer retention to easier stakeholder negotiations. In essence, the investment in phishing-resistant MFA could yield returns far beyond the financial.</p>
 
Preliminary Steps Before Implementation 
<p>Rushing headfirst into implementing any security solution without a strategy is a recipe for potential failure. Start with a comprehensive security assessment. Engage experts to understand where your vulnerabilities lie and which assets are most at risk.<br>
An equally critical component is understanding your users. An overly complex system might have substantial resistance, leading to workarounds compromising security. It’s essential to strike a balance – a system robust in its security but user-friendly.</p>
 Best Practices for Implementing Phishing Resistant MFA 
 
User Education and Training 
<p>Technological measures are just one part of a comprehensive security strategy. Your users – employees – are on the front lines. Regular training sessions help reinforce the importance of security. Beyond theoretical knowledge, interactive sessions, such as simulated phishing attacks, can provide practical experience, preparing them for real-life scenarios.</p>
 
Choosing the Right MFA Solution 
<p>The market is flooded with a range of phishing-resistant MFA products. Each boasts its set of features and benefits. While evaluating, look beyond just the security features. Consider the ease of integration into existing systems, how scalable the solution is, its user experience, and its cost-effectiveness. An ideal phishing resistance and solution would align with both your IT infrastructure and budgetary considerations.</p>
 
Phased Implementation 
<p>A phased approach is often more manageable and less disruptive. Begin with the most critical systems that, if compromised, could result in the most significant harm. Parallelly, prioritize high-risk user groups. As you iron out any teething issues and achieve success, expand the implementation to cover more systems and users.</p>
 
Regular Testing and Evaluation 
<p>Implementing a strong phishing resistant MFA isn’t the end. Cyber threats evolve, and your defenses should adapt accordingly. Regularly scheduled penetration tests can provide insights into potential vulnerabilities. Monitoring tools can offer real-time data on the MFA’s effectiveness, allowing for timely tweaks and refinements.</p>
 
Creating a Responsive Support System 
<p>Challenges and uncertainties often mark transition periods. A robust support system can ease these teething pains. Whether through helplines, chat support, or on-ground IT teams, ensure users can easily access assistance. A two-way communication channel can also provide valuable user feedback, refining the MFA system.</p>
 
Ensuring Backup and Recovery Options 
<p>Every system can face hiccups. From a user losing their hardware token to a biometric system failing to recognize a fingerprint, having backup systems in place is crucial. Clear protocols for such scenarios can prevent potential lockouts and ensure continuity of operations.<br>
In addition to these common concerns, addressing the need for offline access is essential, particularly when internet connectivity is unreliable or unavailable, such as during travel.<br>
Here are some strategies to manage these situations:</p>
 
 Offline Access Solutions: Implement offline access features in your phishing-resistant MFA system. This could involve using physical tokens or biometric methods that don’t rely on real-time verification from a central server. For instance, a hardware token generating one-time codes or a biometric system storing validation data locally can provide secure access even without an internet connection. 
 Travel-Friendly Authentication Methods: When users travel, especially across different time zones or areas with limited connectivity, they need reliable authentication methods. Consider providing additional travel-specific hardware tokens or setting up temporary access codes that remain valid for the travel period. 
 Backup Verification Methods: Establish backup verification methods when the primary MFA method fails. For instance, you could use a secondary mobile device as a fallback option or provide a limited number of use-once codes that can be securely stored and used only when necessary. 
 
 Types of Phishing Resistant MFA Tools 
<p>To truly understand the scope of phishing-resistant MFA, it’s crucial to explore the variety of tools available. Hardware tokens, for example, are physical devices that generate time-sensitive codes. While these tokens are secure, they can be lost or stolen.<br>
Biometric systems, on the other hand, offer authentication through facial recognition, fingerprint scans, or even voice patterns. There’s also behavioral-based authentication, which analyzes patterns in user behavior (like typing speed or mouse movements) to confirm identity and to secure their login credentials and credentials. Each tool has advantages and challenges, making it imperative for organizations to choose based on their specific needs.</p>
 
Integration with Other Security Measures 
<p>While formidable and phishing-resistant, MFA can be even more potent when integrated with other cybersecurity measures. For instance, a Virtual Private Network (VPN) adds a layer of encryption and security to data transmissions.<br>
Combining an authentication method MFA with endpoint protection ensures that even if a device is compromised, unauthorized users still need multiple authentication factors to access sensitive data. A multi-layered security approach that includes phishing-resistant authentication methods MFA can create a robust defense mechanism against cyber threats.</p>
 
Enhancing Phishing-Resistant MFA with BlockID 
<p>While phishing-resistant MFA stands strong, its potency is amplified when integrated with other cybersecurity measures. Our BlockID app, for instance, provides a seamless experience in secure digital identity verification, aligning perfectly with the principles of phishing-resistant MFA. When coupled with a Virtual Private Network (VPN), an added layer of encryption and security protects data transmissions.<br>
Further solidifying security, combining a tool like the BlockID app with endpoint protection ensures that even if a device falls into the wrong hands, unauthorized users still require multiple authentication factors to access sensitive data. This combination results in a multi-layered security approach that includes phishing-resistant methods, positioning organizations at the forefront of defense against cyber threats.</p>
 
Addressing Common Challenges 
<p>Change is often met with resistance. Employees accustomed to older systems might view phishing-resistant MFA as an unnecessary complication. Addressing these concerns, clarifying the change’s rationale, and offering training can ease the transition.<br>
On the technical side, the implementation might face hitches like any IT project. It’s crucial to have an IT team well-prepared to address these. Lastly, while security is paramount, user convenience shouldn’t be wholly sidelined. An overly cumbersome system might lead to non-compliance, defeating its very purpose.</p>
 
Benefits Beyond Security 
<p>While the primary purpose of phishing-resistant MFA is to bolster security, its benefits extend beyond just protection. Implementing advanced MFA can signal to customers and stakeholders that an organization is committed to safeguarding its data—a crucial factor in building trust.<br>
Moreover, in some industries, regulatory compliance necessitates specific security measures to prevent phishing,, including advanced phishing resistant MFA methods. Thus, by adopting phishing-resistant MFA, organizations can avoid potential fines from federal agencies and position themselves favorably in the market as trustworthy entities.</p>
 
BlockID’s Role in Strengthening Phishing-Resistant Security 
<p>In the ongoing fight against phishing and cyber threats, robust security like BlockID is crucial. BlockID advances beyond traditional authentication methods of what you know or have, to a more secure paradigm of who you are, thereby enhancing an organization’s phishing-resistant security posture.</p>

				  Remove the need to set up and manage your own mediator so you can focus on helping your customers benefit from verifiable data and identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio Proven® provides customers with powerful, scalable communication features that allow them to cryptographically authenticate the parties in any interaction before data is shared.</p>
<p>This secure, bidirectional communication between people and organizations using mobile devices is made possible by a mediator. It’s like a post office for a decentralized ecosystem: every message goes to the mediator, which is then able to find individual end users to create a secure connection and deliver the message. Mediation drives decentralized communication — and in a privacy-preserving way too, as the “Post Office” can’t open the messages, even if it wanted to.</p>
<p>With a hosted mediator in Indicio Proven®, customers can choose to let Indicio run the Post Office, which makes deploying a verifiable data solution faster, scaling it easier, and managing it simpler.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that while we say “message,” we are not confined to simple texts or written messages. How you use this secure connection is largely limited by your imagination. Among the use cases Indicio has helped facilitate are offering proof of funds for financial transactions, sharing proof of membership for an organization or rewards program, and sharing proof of age for purchasing goods, without actually sharing birthdate or other personal information.</p>
<p>Historically, Indicio has helped customers set up their own mediator for management by their internal teams. Due to customer feedback, Indicio Proven® now provides this feature as a professionally-managed service. This makes Indicio Proven an even simpler and more powerful way to implement decentralized identity technology, enhancing scalability, ensuring uptime, and freeing users to focus on delivering transformative verifiable data solutions to their customers.</p>
<p>Whether your mediator is hosted and managed by your team or Indicio, the messages it delivers are private by design. Each message is encrypted to the end recipient, and is not visible to the mediator.</p>
<p>Who its for</p>
<p>This mediator service is for customers that just want to “set and forget” their decentralized identity solution. Indicio will handle the day-to-day management of any mediation your solution requires and ensure the mediator has the latest updates.</p>
<p>Why use Indicio’s mediator services</p>
<p>Professionally managed: Indicio has years of experience in the decentralized identity field and boasts a 99.97% uptime on our network. You won’t need to worry about the day-to-day specifics of mediation, but should any problems come to your attention you will have a direct line to a team that leads the development of the technology.</p>
<p>Built for scale: The new mediator service has been tested with up to fifty thousand simultaneous connections per customer, and our team can easily scale it to as many connections as you need.</p>
<p>Live message delivery: Often mediators will only allow for a momentary connection to an end user to deliver a message and then sever that connection. Indicio’s mediator service allows for users to stay connected to your service for a set amount of time, resulting in receiving messages faster and a better customer experience.</p>
<p>How to get started</p>
<p>Our team prides itself on setting our customers up for success. We have found a <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">quick consultation with our team</a> to align on goals for your solution to be the most effective way to learn more about Indicio Proven® and how you can best use the Hosted Mediator Service.</p>

				  Rebuilding Trust in the Digital Age: The Emergence of a Trust Layer  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Picture a digital landscape where trust reigns supreme, where every online interaction is as secure as a handshake in the physical world. It’s not just a vision; it’s the focus of our latest report, created in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.cira.ca/en/">Canadian Internet Registration​ Authority</a> (CIRA). In this blog, we unveil the intriguing concept of the internet’s ’emerging trust layer’ and how it will revolutionize the internet, making it a haven of reliability and security.

				 <p>In today’s interconnected world, trust in the digital landscape is more crucial than ever. A secure and trustworthy online environment becomes paramount as we increasingly intertwine our lives with the internet, from personal interactions to complex financial transactions and healthcare decisions. Recognizing this critical need, Continuum Loop, in collaboration with CIRA, has authored a new report, “<a href="https://www.cira.ca/en/resources/documents/state-of-internet/a-trust-layer-for-the-internet-is-emerging-a-2023-report/">A Trust Layer for the Internet is Emerging.</a>”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report, the result of the collaboration between <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellodonnell/">Darrell O’Donnell</a> of Continuum Loop and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueslatour/">Jacques Latour</a> from CIRA, emerges as an essential resource for those innovators and early adopters leading the charge in digital innovation and strategy. It offers a comprehensive exploration of the challenges and solutions in building trust online, tailored to meet the needs of technical and business professionals in internet-centric organizations.</p>
<p>This pioneering document addresses the growing trust crisis in the digital realm, where the proliferation of fakes, frauds, and forgeries has significantly eroded public confidence. Our report highlights the path forward to restore and enhance trust in the internet, ensuring its role as a reliable and safe platform for future generations.</p>
 The Decline of Trust: A Wake-Up Call 
<p>It’s a concerning reality: trust in the internet is at an all-time low. In recent years, Canadians’ trust in the internet has plummeted from 71% to 57%, mirroring a global trend. The increase of fakes, frauds, and forgeries fuels this erosion of trust. This isn’t just a statistic; it has become a call to action. Organizations suffer when trust wanes, with some experiencing dramatic decreases in market capitalization after trust-related incidents.</p>
 Unveiling the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The report introduces an innovative concept: developing a ‘trust layer’ for the internet. This layer is a harmonious blend of technical trust (like encryption and signing) and human trust (like governance). It’s about creating a digital environment where parties can mutually authenticate each other, knowing confidently who they’re dealing with.</p>
 Trust Registries: Anchoring Digital Trust 
<p>A pivotal aspect of this trust layer is the role of trust registries. Trust registries provide authoritative answers within digital ecosystems, bridging the gap between technology and human trust. Furthermore, the concept of Registry of Registries (RoR) is explored to create an interconnected web of trust across various ecosystems.</p>
 From Wallets to Trust: A Paradigm Shift 
<p>Originally intended as an update to the 2019 “The Wallet Report,” the focus of this study shifted to the more critical issue of building trustworthy systems on the internet. It’s a response to the growing awareness that while security is essential, more is needed for establishing trust.</p>
 Navigating the Path to an Enhanced Trust Layer 
<p>The journey to build a trust layer on the internet, as outlined in the report, is challenging but vital. It requires a delicate balance of technical trust and human trust. The report underscores the importance of governance in maintaining trust and the critical role of trust registries in anchoring trust within digital ecosystems.</p>
 A Call to Action 
<p>The report concludes with a powerful message: we can reverse the decline in internet trust. By developing a trust layer, we can once again rely on the internet as a secure and trustworthy platform. It’s a shared responsibility to build and maintain this trust layer, not just for the benefit of digital ecosystems but for society as a whole.</p>
 Rebuilding Trust in Our Digital World 
<p>While the path ahead is challenging, the blueprint for a trustworthy internet is becoming clearer. Through the collaborative efforts of Continuum Loop and CIRA, we have charted a course towards an internet that balances technical trust with human trust, underpinned by the essential role of trust registries. These components are not just parts of a system but the pillars upon which we can construct an inherently reliable and secure digital realm.</p>
 Technical and Human Synergy: The Heart of the Emerging Trust Layer 
<p>The success of the emerging trust layer will not be measured solely by its technical strength but by the trust it fosters in our digital relationships. Developing and nurturing this trust layer is a collective responsibility with significant promise for revolutionizing digital ecosystems and enriching our society.</p>
<p>As we embark on this journey to reforge trust in the digital landscape, we do so with a clear understanding of the transformative potential of the trust layer and trust registries. This report is more than an analysis; it is a call to action for creating a future where trust is the cornerstone of our digital interactions. The time to act is now – to shape a functional and fundamentally trustworthy internet.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 The Internet’s Trust Deficit Needs to Be Repaid: Key trust-related decisions in the internet’s evolution were delayed or ignored, leaving the digital realm needing more essential capabilities to establish trust. 
 The Necessity of Trust Registries: Trust registries, including the innovative concept of a Registry of Registries (RoR), are crucial in creating a web of trust across ecosystems and anchoring the trust layer. 
 Ecosystem Diversity: Each digital ecosystem operates uniquely, and trust registries help unify diverse players and governance structures. 
 Leveraging Existing Systems: Existing systems hold the answers needed to establish trust; the challenge lies in accessing and integrating this information. 
 The Value of Trusted Interactions: Trusted interactions are increasingly valuable, and trust registries are pivotal in driving value up and costs down in the digital landscape.

 BE REALISTIC — DEMAND THE INCORRUPTIBLE!  Make the blockchain safe or lose&nbsp;it Vinay Gupta as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raguel_(angel)#:~:text=XXIII%2C%20Raguel%20is%20one%20of,across%20Jewish%20and%20Christian%20traditions.">Raguel</a><p>I have recounted the history and prehistory of crypto <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-road-to-rwa-f99cac31361d">elsewhere</a> — the path from PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) through e-gold to Bitcoin. Now I want to take a look at what happened next, what went wrong with the Ethereum vision of the future, and how we can turn things around to make the blockchain the powerhouse of the future that it was always meant to be. I need to talk about magic and rules. I’ve seen a fair bit of magic over the years, and I understand when it needs&nbsp;rules.</p><blockquote>I’ve seen a fair bit of magic over the years, and I understand when it needs&nbsp;rules</blockquote><p>Let’s start with a short recap; the first great crypto innovation was<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy"> PGP,</a> which tried to bring true privacy to online communications, then there was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1997/0908/6005172a.html">https </a>that gave us the ecommerce revolution, Amazon and all that. Then, the third innovation came with the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper">Bitcoin white paper</a> that ushered in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin was commonly believed to be a response to e-gold being shut down by the American government; if we want to ask “who is Satoshi?”, then the answer is that somewhere within two handshakes of the e-gold organisations is almost certainly where you find the origin of the Satoshi group — I have my theories, other people have theirs. Anyway, Bitcoin trundles along for a while as an interesting geek thing where a few Bitcoin can get you a pizza, if you know the right nerds, but it’s not much use for anything yet; until Wikileaks. When Wikileaks gets seriously effective at embarrassing governments, banks and various other payment routes shut them out so no one can donate funds to them. Suddenly, the only functional method that can get cash to Wikileaks and can’t be shut down is Bitcoin; people take notice, its value skyrockets to the level where one will buy you a very decent car instead of a fraction of a pizza, and people start to get politically interested in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Now though, we need to think about what was really going on with Bitcoin. What people wanted from the blockchain — and what a lot of them got — was magic, and new&nbsp;rules:</p><p>Magic: “internet money machine go brrrrrr” and folks that were futuristic and lucky got very rich. A real vanguard movement.</p><p>Rules: 1 BTC is always worth 1 BTC. Uncensorable. Free.</p><p>This idea that new rules can make you rich and the money isn’t really coming from anywhere is, unfortunately, the devil’s bargain. Here’s why: printing money makes the other money worth&nbsp;less.</p><blockquote>Printing money makes the other money worth&nbsp;less</blockquote><p>Bitcoin is converting fiat money into Bitcoin, and it’s just increasing the money supply. It’s exactly the same as a central bank printing money. It’s just that bitcoin is printed and handed out to the miners, instead of having a government write enormous bailout cheques to banks under a cover like “quantitative easing”. Bitcoin slowly makes the dollar worth less just as something like quantitative easing (QE) ultimately does. All that QE money invented and dumped onto the market in 2008 to stave off financial collapse eventually fed through to the increase in inflation and so on today — it made the dollar worth less because there was more money circulating. Same happens with Bitcoin. Bitcoin may not be the same as dollars, but it is doing the same thing; ultimately, it is used to buy things so it has the same effect — more money circulating. Now bitcoiners will tell you that’s fine. And, within the scope of human beings exercising their freedom to compute it certainly is. Bitcoin is arguably a free speech issue. I’m good with that, but the money is coming from the dollar getting slightly weaker every time BTC moons. I don’t like this way of making money. I don’t mind people doing it, but let’s call it what it is: crypto-fiat. Bitcoin is a “decentral bank” of the internet. It’s crazy that it works, but it’s another central bank printing money at the end of the&nbsp;day.</p><blockquote>Let’s call it what it is: crypto-fiat. Bitcoin is a “decentral bank” of the&nbsp;internet</blockquote><p>Something else was&nbsp;needed.</p><p>So, people start asking <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">“Why doesn’t Bitcoin implement smart contracts?</a>”, which would make it more than just crypto-fiat, and that question of “Why doesn’t Bitcoin implement smart contracts?” is, to me, the great religious issue of the day. Because if Bitcoin had said “yes” to smart contracts, then there would not be a need for a <a href="https://blockchainlab.com/pdf/Ethereum_white_paper-a_next_generation_smart_contract_and_decentralized_application_platform-vitalik-buterin.pdf">second system.</a> All of the energy behind Bitcoin, all of the energy behind Ethereum, all of the energy behind everything else…It would be the single point of an enormous driven spear. We did not get that, because Bitcoin said “no” to progress, they said “no” to transformation, they said “no” to change. Bitcoin decided that they had evolved as far as they needed to, and that they were going to stay right there. As a result, we have an avant-garde that comes along to do the smart contracts thing, which is Ethereum and all of the things that came after Ethereum, while the old-school Bitcoiners stay with Bitcoin. Whether they turn out to be smart people that stuck to fundamentals, or Neanderthals who evolution ploughed under, is too soon to tell — give it another 20 years, maybe even another&nbsp;50.</p><blockquote>if Bitcoin had said “yes” to smart contracts…it would be the single point of an enormous driven&nbsp;spear.</blockquote><p>The great hope from Ethereum is that Ethereum is more than a central bank. Ether is not money per se: Ether is a tokenized right to future transactions on the World Computer. Watch this 2015 video from the Ethereum Foundation to understand the&nbsp;story.</p><p>Does software create wealth? YES! What we do with spreadsheets can be done by accountants on paper but it takes weeks rather than seconds to run a new financial model. A payment instrument does not create wealth, it just moves wealth around. That’s why ETH &gt; BTC for sure. What we’ve seen for the last 8 years, since Ethereum was launched, is a mad scramble to figure out what to do with the World Computer.</p><p>Generation after generation of cultish new ideas have been pitched as revolutions: ICOs, DeFi, NFTs were the largest waves. All of them, failed experiments. Folks will argue that these things have not failed but here’s a way to think about it: was more money put into these things than taken out? The answer is YES in all cases. Every penny made in DeFi was lost by somebody else, minus some friction which pays for creation of the tech. This is not wealth generating, any more than Bitcoin is wealth generating. Sophisticated mechanisms for moving money around do not CREATE wealth. The financial system does not create wealth other than by investing in the creation of goods and services that people actually need. And, right now, Ethereum is the financial system on bottom-up decentralised individually-superempowered turbo steroids. So, what happened?</p><blockquote>Sophisticated mechanisms for moving money around do not CREATE&nbsp;wealth</blockquote><p>Inside of Ethereum there developed three generations of political vision: these are what I would call the Nouveau Bitcoiners, the Radicalised Canadians, and the heartless Scammers. The Nouveau Bitcoiners are the people who think that Ether is going to be the global currency instead of Bitcoin, they think in terms of freedom to transact and are very much about the idea of a direct takeover from the nation state and a direct takeover from the dollar. It’s “Ethereum is just like Bitcoin, but with smart contracts”. Their vision is “The Ether price climbs and climbs and climbs, until every asset is denominated in Ether”. That is the generation-one political vision of Ethereum. Not many people think like that now, but there are a few of&nbsp;them.</p><blockquote>Inside of Ethereum there developed… the Nouveau Bitcoiners, the Radicalised Canadians, and the heartless Scammers</blockquote><p>The next generation are the Radicalised Canadians, and I would see Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as one of these. The vision here involves things like quadratic voting: you reduce the cost of building new social structures because you can use Ethereum smart contracts to do it. Those social structures control assets and the control of assets using these new social structures enables the transformation of the way society works. This means you can do much cheaper experiments in an evolving society because you use software to run the bureaucracy — you don’t need to build a new government department; you just need the right smart contract and you can do it now. This is expressed particularly well in a book called <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/iRqutFx">Radical Markets</a> by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl. This idea that we can incrementally improve the functioning of the world by putting more and more load on automated bureaucracy rather than attempting political transformation through the ballot box is the “build your way to your own utopia”&nbsp;model.</p><p>I would suggest that the apex of the “build your way to your own utopia” model is all the stuff on network states coming from <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/huUv3pN">Balaji Srinivasan</a>. I went to the network states conference in Amsterdam, and there’s a huge amount of enthusiasm about building what I would call weakly state-like entities (<a href="https://athousandnations.com/2009/04/21/free-guptastan/">WSLEs,</a> or “Weasels”) on the blockchain, You have a cryptocurrency, you have a community, you buy a bunch of land, and you put all of that stuff together into a bundle, and it creates a sort of miniature state-like thing. Of course, there are major potential pitfalls inherent in all this; e.g. depending on where you have your land, your network state DIY utopia can look a lot like reinventing colonialism for the digital age — a bunch of Americans setting up a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%B3spera#:~:text=Pr%C3%B3spera%20is%20a%20private%20city,%2C%20regulatory%2C%20and%20legal%20architecture."> “utopia” in Honduras</a> raises a lot more questions than, say, a bunch of Hondurans setting one up in the US. But a network state doesn’t necessarily need the land, it can have a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-network-state-and-the-digital-hansa-bfccf8df0097">completely virtual existence</a>, there’s lots of enthusiasm about that, and I would say that is the final embodiment of the Radicalised Canadian vision: kind of libertarian, kind of utopian, but a lot more egalitarian than the hard line, currency-driven Bitcoin generation. The DAO people are a big part of that as well, lots of work on DAOs, lots of work on quadratic funding, Gitcoin… All of that is in this bucket that I would call the Radicalised Canadians.</p><p>Finally we have the third generation, the Scammers. A big problem in the space is that the Radicalised Canadians have been unable to fight off the Scammers. I remember when the Scammers arrived: our conferences went from being a bunch of nerds in various-kinds-of-band T-shirts, standing around in their big black boots and yapping to each other about consensus algorithms, to slick computer graphics and really impressive slide presentations fronted by people that had been trained to speak in the Tony Robbins school of sincerity. And when those folks arrived, what you wound up with was a problem; because when you had people coming to find out what Ethereum was, the slick, sincere-sounding guys were the ones they listened to because they knew how to capture attention. The people who understood what Ethereum was truly about, the Nouveau Bitcoiners and Radical Canaidans, were, generally speaking, poor presenters, and they were pushed aside by the people that understood how to sell scams. Those people didn’t really understand what it was they were selling, and they didn’t have to, they just needed to understand what people were buying. All they had to have was a plausible enough story to separate rubes from their money, and those people went through the space like dysentery through a refugee camp. I would suggest that they have destroyed 99% of the value in the Ethereum space over the last, say, 4–5&nbsp;years.</p><blockquote>Scammers went through Ethereum like dysentery through a refugee&nbsp;camp</blockquote><p>I want to repeat that: I would suggest that scammers have destroyed 99% of the value in the Ethereum space… You wonder why the coin is floating around $2,000 rather than $20,000? You wonder why there are only $120bn of stablecoins rather than half the global financial system being on chain? The answer is Ethereum has become synonymous with fraud. If you hear that your cousin has gotten super into crypto, do you think “My god, that’s going to be amazing!” or do you think they’re going to lose their house and their car and you’re going to have to bail them out pretty soon? The fear that we have, that being involved in the blockchain is now a bad thing, that is fear of the grifters. It’s fear that people who don’t really understand the technology are going to be sucked in by slick marketing for a deal that should be illegal, and probably is. That they’re going to get ripped off for everything they own if the Scammers can manage it, and we’ve become so tolerant of this that the culture has terms like “rug pull”. Rug pull means fraud and people should go to jail — rug pull! We have smart contracts that are perfectly capable of making it technically impossible for people to rug-pull, but the general Ethereum user population are so ignorant about what the technology is and how it can protect them that they don’t even insist that the contracts are structured in a way that means they cannot get rug-pulled.</p><blockquote>Ethereum has become synonymous with&nbsp;fraud</blockquote><p>It’s finance minus all RULES and deprived of all MORALITY. In Ethereum right now you are literally seeing what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929#:~:text=On%20September%2020%2C%201929%2C%20top,on%20the%20London%20Stock%20Exchange">Wall Street was like in 1929</a>, rug pulls and all. Finance without RULES and MORALITY is net negative. It’s the fast being predatory and eating the life savings of the slow, over and over and over&nbsp;again.</p><p>It’s violent.</p><p>“No Force, No Fraud” says the Libertarian Golden Rule, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle">Non-Aggression Principle (NAP</a>).</p><p>Does Ethereum live up to that&nbsp;today?</p><p>No. Remember I’m the former Release Coordinator for the 2015 launch. I also wrote the definitive blog post&nbsp;, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains in Context</a>, for the Ethereum launch. I’ve been around. I’ve done cryptographic applications development (against and then for multiple governments) since 1997.&nbsp;. I’m not pleased at how Ethereum is turning&nbsp;out.</p><p>We can do better. We can do a lot&nbsp;better.</p><p>So how did we wind up with epidemic fraud on Ethereum, a technology which was meant to produce an incorruptible global record of who owned what so that we could build a fairer, better global&nbsp;economy?</p><p>It’s your fault: you all got greedy and lazy and believed crappy NFTs had value. They are <a href="https://cheezburger.com/16719877/funny-memes-tweets-that-roast-nfts-crypto">literally laughing at&nbsp;us.</a></p><p>Wilful ignorance of the law created the entire cycle of destruction around NFTs. If there had been a single decent intellectual property licence, commissioned by OpenSea and attached to everything by default then NFTs might not have hard crashed in value as they have. Proper use of law would have protected value which is, after all, the fundamental function of&nbsp;law.</p><blockquote>Wilful ignorance of the law created the entire cycle of destruction around&nbsp;NFTs</blockquote><p>Imagine how different it would have been if they could have said “here’s the OpenSea public licence and the Bored Ape licence, anything which is going to get done on the blockchain with images or art, you have that built in copyright licence by default. If you want a different licence, feel free to upload it, but you will have to have a licence…”</p><p>If they’d done that for intellectual property, then OpenSea would be the world hub for clearing intellectual property rights today, and it would probably still be doing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions a month, and it would have created enormously powerful global liquid markets for IP. You would be able to literally licence a Bored Ape to Disney to do a TV show, rather than the situation right now where nobody can really pin down <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/nfts-and-intellectual-property-what-do-you-actually-own/">what you buy when you buy an NFT</a>. That is the result of a lackadaisical attitude towards the deal; because if you don’t clearly define the terms, then what the hell is somebody&nbsp;buying?</p><p>We went out to build an incorruptible global economy, and what we got was overrun by scammers that subverted that vital global vision and delivered a wasteland of Ponzi schemes and delusional fake assets. The Eloi had a wonderful world full of sunlight and flowers, but the Morlocks still ate them. Ethereum needs a moral upgrade. Maybe instead of moral I should say political. “No force, no fraud” only works if we have a mechanism for punishing those who attempt or commit fraud. Financial products sold by Anonymous Aardvark twitter accounts do not have any meaningful ability to punish fraud. So we get fraud. A lot of really hardcore criminal shit is getting done in the financial markets running on Ethereum.</p><blockquote>Ethereum needs a moral&nbsp;upgrade</blockquote><p>It’s a massive market failure: in a Libertarian society in theory the “Free Market” is meant to self-regulate and create free market justice systems to make trade possible. What we have learned in this near-perfect experiment is that Libertarianism is bullshit.</p><p>Let me say that again: Libertarianism is bullshit, and we’ve proven&nbsp;it.</p><p>What we got on Ethereum was violent, destructive anarchy not a self-regulating borderless global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>It’s bad. To fix this we need to build governance structures on the blockchain which have the ability to impose rules and force good conduct on people. The violent anarchy we have created is so dangerous that ordinary people are getting mugged for everything they&nbsp;own</p><p>Is that acceptable?</p><p>Well, if it is acceptable, we wind up with Ethereum as a <a href="https://screenrant.com/eve-online-largest-pvp-battle-ever/">“Player-Versus-Player (PVP)</a> part of the Great Global Massive Multiplayer Online game (MMO) in which we all participate. All the serious players will only interact with Ethereum when they’re heavily armed, and it’ll be filled with predators feeding on each-other. This is a bad scene; “PVP Ethereum” — the violent, destructive anarchy that we have now — is not fit for running the global economy. It would be a disaster if we took a system this amoral and tried to run the world on&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>It would be a disaster if we took a system this amoral and tried to run the world on&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>Well, if you don’t believe me, look at what happened when someone did try to run the world on it. It is indicative of the age of most blockchain people — they are young — that Russia in the ’90s is ancient history to them, they don’t remember it; but we are old, and some of us used to be Russian; we remember. There, then, communism collapsed, and while the state struggled to catch up, a new kind of money, dollars, flooded in, and Russia became the poster boy for the kind of unfettered free market capitalism that gave Ayn Rand libertarians spontaneous orgasms. No state interference, just money and business. What happened? Oligarchs happened; without effective law to enforce contracts, you only paid the people who would kill you if you didn’t, and killed your creditors if the opportunity arose. As a result the most ruthless, the hardest, and those with access to serious muscle and hardware (basically ex-KGB) cleaned up while everyone else got thoroughly rinsed and ended up near destitute. This only ended basically when the biggest, most ruthless bastard of all, Putin, got the upper hand, ran the oligarchs out of town and co-opted their methods for himself, resulting in a gangster capitalist mafia dictatorship, which is not the outcome anyone else wanted. Libertarianism in practice turns out to be essentially property without rights, it boils down to “it’s mine because I’ve got the biggest gun”, and that’s it. For 90s Russia, read Ethereum; for the oligarchs read the Scammers. Fraud is a form of force, at the end of the day. When scammers deceive people they remove that person’s will and replace it with the scammer’s own&nbsp;will.</p><p>So we have a choice to make: does Ethereum have a productive real future, or does it end up as a nasty, destructive “PVP” wasteland in which predators feed on predators and scammers scam scammers driving out all the perfectly ordinary and legitimate users until there’s nobody but criminals left on the chain. This could become a cultural race to the bottom that transfers all of the public good value of the blockchain directly into the private good pockets of the&nbsp;thieves.</p><blockquote>This could become a cultural race to the&nbsp;bottom</blockquote><p>You think I’m joking. I’m not joking. The future of finance, and the future of the internet, cannot be to create a more dangerous, less fair, more predator-dominated version of the world and then tell people that it’s good for them. It’s not good for them. We’re creating a hell and calling it a&nbsp;heaven.</p><p>Now I did not come into this thing to facilitate the creation of a destructive hell realm and to super-empower predators and thieves. I came into this looking for an international aid transparency technology to help me build my <a href="http://myhopeforthe.world">climate refugee projects</a>.</p><blockquote>I did not come into this thing to facilitate the creation of a destructive hell&nbsp;realm</blockquote><p>We need to turn this thing around. We need to do it now because this Bull Run (if it materialises) looks like it will be the <a href="https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/defi/why-the-rwa-sector-accumulated-5-8-billion-in-3-months/">Real World Assets (RWA) bull run</a>. If people try the same games with RWA that they did with NFTs, if we get runaway fraud, people will start going to jail. The authorities will start prosecuting. If you sell somebody an NFT and tell them it’s “blue chip” and will hold its value you’re probably not committing fraud, it’s what the art world does all the time after all. But when it’s real estate? Cops understand it. If we get any significant amount of actual fraud in the RWA industry, people who have been sold bogus tokens will go and talk to the police. “I was sold this car online and they defrauded me” is a message a cop can understand. It’s not about magic internet $. And it’s not financial regulators looking at mis-sold financial instruments. It’s not the SEC pointing the finger and trying to grab turf from CFTC etc. No, it’s the fucking FBI investigating wire fraud. It’s local police forces dealing with straight up thefts. It’s simple criminal enforcement in many or most cases. Primitive, primal law. “You took my money. You sold me garbage.” We have examples of that dispute going back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_tablet_to_Ea-n%C4%81%E1%B9%A3ir">4000 years</a>. Believe me, the police know how to act on it by&nbsp;now.</p><blockquote>We need to turn this thing around. We need to do it&nbsp;now</blockquote><p>Real World Asset scams are going to face criminal prosecution very&nbsp;fast.</p><p>Wow, that’s going to hurt the rest of us. Are we going to have Ethereum be a “PVP” corner of the internet in which scam artists con the general public, and the authorities keep throwing people in jail for blockchain scams? Is THAT the future that we’ve co-created together?</p><p>We have to get our shit together to avoid&nbsp;it</p><p>I want to propose an idea: I think we really screwed up horribly when we decided that decentralisation is what the blockchain was&nbsp;about.</p><p>I think that was a fundamental error of judgement, and I think it is not too late to fix&nbsp;it.</p><p>What we wanted was systems that were incorruptible, and we thought decentralised meant incorruptible.</p><p>We were wrong: incorruptible trade is the goal, and decentralisation is just one&nbsp;tool.</p><p>We believed and still believe that if you gave the power to the people, then the power would be used wisely. But in fact, what we have discovered is that if you give the power to the people, then the small number of people who are really good at being predators take advantage of the goodwill or ignorance of the rest to cut in and take the power: the scammers, the grifters, they take the power… We worked hard to give the power to the people, and then the scammers and the grifters took it right back off them&nbsp;again.</p><p>It all goes back to the idea of utopias — the internet has always been a utopian idea, a cool, free space, away from regulation and government where people can be excellent to each other and make a new world of equality and self-fulfilment for nerds. Every ten years, another generation tries to create the latest iteration of that, then get burned. Unfortunately something that works purely on mutual trust falls foul of (at least) two fundamental problems. Firstly, assumptions; if the two people in a deal come to it with different unspoken assumptions, grief results. Secondly, the Scammers, if one of the people in the deal isn’t playing fair, more grief results. There needs to be some basic capability that allows for formal agreements that makes the terms of a deal absolutely clear, and will punish scams. Smart contracts only provide one part of what is necessary to make this work in reality: FTX was not a technology problem. Failure to provide scam proofing is what has caused trust to collapse and allowed scams to proliferate, allowed the system to be corrupted. The lack of effective law is what screwed Russia in the 90s, and it will screw Ethereum now. Violent anarchy serves nobody. The locusts move on eventually.</p><blockquote>Every ten years, another generation tries to create utopia, then get&nbsp;burned</blockquote><p>I think that we need to start thinking in terms of the blockchain being about creating incorruptible systems: you get exactly what you pay for, nobody gets in the way, and if they do, the crypto economics or the legals squash them like bugs. That was the original vision of Ethereum, that was what we promised to ourselves that we were going to create back in 2015. If you look at the early Ethereum Foundation communications, incorruptibility is the core theme. That video I embedded earlier, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXv">Ethereum: the World Computer</a>, really expresses this notion of an incorruptible system. An Ethereum where the scammers get crushed like bugs, that is the future, one where you know that if it happened on Ethereum it’s a square and you will get&nbsp;paid.</p><blockquote>We need an Ethereum where the scammers get crushed like&nbsp;bugs</blockquote><p>That is what I’m working towards creating with my company <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>. We have spent years and a ton of money creating a way to build legals into smart contracts in a way that is enforceable in 172 jurisdictions. The Mattereum system makes it possible to buy something on the blockchain and prove you own it in a court of law almost anywhere in the world. It removes misunderstandings and, yes, squashes scammers like bugs. We are mainly using it to ensure someone buying a real world asset like gold or real estate on the blockchain has an enforceable claim to the physical asset in the real world, but it can be used for IP licences for NFTs, almost anything sold on the blockchain. It’s a way of baking incorruptibility into the system to ensure every transaction is&nbsp;safe.</p><blockquote>The Mattereum system removes misunderstandings and squashes scammers like&nbsp;bugs</blockquote><p>So, Mattereum is doing magic with real estate, gold bars, and so on. The NFTs that people buy linked to their RWAs come with legal machinery that behaves properly, so they get what they paid for or get appropriate compensation. Magic. But that magic comes from rules. The Mattereum Asset Passport is a legally binding documentation stack which parcels out the risk associated with an RWA purchase and places the load on knowledgeable, solvent, deal-protecting underwriters. The magic is the rules. And we did not do this alone. The English judiciary (the judges) are very fond of the blockchain as a mechanism for storing legal evidence which can be used in court cases. They see the blockchain as an <a href="http://judiciary.uk/wp-content/upl%E2%80%A6">economic opportunity</a> for the British economy in&nbsp;fact.</p><blockquote>Many people do not realise that English law governs trading in €600 trillion of OTC derivatives annually, in €11.6 trillion in metals trading, in £250 billion in M&amp;A deals, and in £80 billion in insurance contracts every year — just to take a few examples. My hope is that English law will prove to be the law of choice for borderless blockchain technology as its take up grows exponentially in the months and years to&nbsp;come.</blockquote><blockquote>– Sir Geoffry Vos, Master of the&nbsp;Rolls</blockquote><p>Now, you say, “but Vinay, centralisation is the devil”. Well, turns out decentralisation is the devil&nbsp;too.</p><p>If everybody is responsible, then nobody is. Value is bleeding through decentralised systems like coffee through a paper filter. It’s the <a href="https://w.wiki/LdS">Tragedy of the Commons</a> basically.</p><p>Think about that. We could have Ethereum be the world’s most trusted trade environment instead of the destructive shitshow that we have these days. I want this thing to work. The world needs this thing to&nbsp;work.</p><p>We have a limited number of chances to make this thing work because — eventually — the world will simply give up on Ethereum as a fraud-ridden wasteland. That perception is already becoming a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Every fraud on Ethereum profits the scammers and harms/damages the rest of the ecosystem. It’s the scammers or us: and that’s the real zero sum game&nbsp;here.</p><p>We have an absolute imperative to get the scammers out of the Ethereum ecosystem, we have to do this or the ecosystem is eventually going to&nbsp;die.</p><p>To do this the focus has to be on incorruptibility, not decentralisation because incorruptible systems can be used to identify the scammers and kick them off. “Is this thing that you’re doing incorruptible or not?” — “Well, no. It’s really decentralised, but…” — “We don’t care: bam, get off the blockchain, we’re not going to do this!”. It’s that simple — raise the bar. Demand incorruptibility.</p><p>If you’re going to put any money behind any project, then demand incorruptibility; if you’re working on a project, then demand incorruptibility. Take the power away from the administrators so it’s impossible to rug, use smart contracts to lock up all of the value, nail them to the legals — there are excellent law firms that are fully functional now to actually get you what you need for that quickly and at a reasonable price. We can make the blockchain live up to its potential, but if we fail to do it, then it’s going to wind up as another dead&nbsp;end.</p><blockquote>Take the power away from the administrators so it’s impossible to&nbsp;rug</blockquote><p>I’ve seen two waves of crypto innovation wind up in dead ends. The only thing that survived from crypto in the 1990s, even though we had fully functional digital currencies, was e-commerce, and e-commerce did not fundamentally make the world a better place — it made it more convenient, but it did not improve it. The first big wave of crypto innovation is all of the stuff that happened with secure communications — PGP and all that, secure email. Does anybody feel like their communications are genuinely secure? Nope. You don’t trust the software you’re using, you don’t trust the hardware. Most of that innovation was also lost. So if we’re going to make this round of crypto innovation stick, if we are going to make the blockchain work, if we’re going to get power of “These are my keys, nobody else can pretend to be me and nobody else can read my comms…” then we have to change our values. We have to go back to the original vision of Ethereum, we have to focus on the incorruptibility more than the decentralisation, and we have to absolutely stop tolerating the scams. If you see somebody on stage pitching something that you think is a scam, then you call it out, you do what you can to stop it. We need to be Judge Dredd bringing law to the Cursed&nbsp;Earth.</p><blockquote>If we’re going to make this round of crypto innovation stick… then we have to change our&nbsp;values</blockquote><p>Tolerating the scams means giving up on the blockchain because while scams are allowed to thrive unopposed they metastasise and consume all the available space. One reason people largely gave up on email is that for every email from family, there were 10 from Nigerian princes, alleged friends needing you to urgently send money (and possibly lawyers and guns) to get them out of a jam, cute strangers wanting to be your girlfriend, and so on. The same with “The Artist Formerly Known as Twitter”, people are leaving in droves because of Nazis, dropshippers and people shilling blockchain scams. No one is going to find it worthwhile to stay in a space where 90% of the activity is scammers eating people alive, even if it does have the potential to revolutionise the&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>Tolerating the scams means giving up on the blockchain</blockquote><p>We should be revolutionising the world, we should be operating the world’s most honest trade environment — that’s the ETH brand promise. If we can deliver on the Brand Promise of Ethereum: “incorruptible transactions” we have friends all over the world. Everybody that wants to do honest business, to buy and sell in a transparent, honest and fair way, is our friend. You can’t get incorruptible trade with VISA cards and bank wires, so Mattereum is out here building the bridges necessary for incorruptible trade and our objectives are:</p><p>* Save&nbsp;Ethereum</p><p>* Use Ethereum to save the&nbsp;world</p><p>An incorruptible system is a safe system, and the fundamental thing people need is to be safe, on the blockchain, just as much as anywhere&nbsp;else.</p><p>We’re going to need your support to make this happen. I’m hoping to rapidly scale our operations fast in 2024 and bring near-incorruptible systems for real world asset transactions to all of&nbsp;you.</p> Be realistic!

   by Alejandro Leal  In our Artificial Intelligence (AI) journey, much like the timeless question "Quo vadis, Domine?"-meaning "Where are you going, Lord?"-we find ourselves at a crossroads, questioning the direction of our technological trajectory. So as we traverse the AI landscape, we should ask ourselves, "Where is our AI going, and what are the implications for us?"

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>In our Artificial Intelligence (AI) journey, much like the timeless question "Quo vadis, Domine?"-meaning "Where are you going, Lord?"-we find ourselves at a crossroads, questioning the direction of our technological trajectory. So as we traverse the AI landscape, we should ask ourselves, "Where is our AI going, and what are the implications for us?"</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, when the path forward may seem uncertain, well-structured legal frameworks provide a basic roadmap. These frameworks not only provide clarity on the permissible boundaries of AI development and application, but also serve as foresight tools that anticipate potential challenges and pitfalls. As I argued in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/balancing-innovation-and-regulation">blog</a>, law generates a dialectical process wherein the tech industry, responding to legal constraints, presents its antithesis by seeking new solutions, ultimately leading to a synthesis that reconciles legal requirements and fosters human agency.</p>
<p>Consequently, nations around the world are trying to figure out how to adapt to and capitalize on these evolving technologies. Unfortunately, while the impact of AI is global, many countries have yet to publish comprehensive AI regulations and policies. This gap presents both challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>On the one hand, embracing standardized regulations could foster global collaboration, addressing ethical concerns and privacy issues. On the other hand, the absence of clear guidelines may hinder the progress of global AI initiatives, potentially leading to misuse, fragmented approaches, and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Therefore, by exploring and comparing recently published AI regulations, individuals and organizations can proactively navigate the evolving landscape. This approach allows them to stay ahead of the curve, respond resiliently to change, and integrate practices and solutions that may not have been adopted in their home countries.</p>
 Implications of the EU’s AI Act 
<p>On December 8, 2023, after more than 36 hours of negotiations, a political agreement was reached on the EU's Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act. The AI Act adopts a "risk-based approach" that prioritizes the regulation of the use of AI over the technology itself, with the aim of protecting European values and the rule of law. The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20231206IPR15699/artificial-intelligence-act-deal-on-comprehensive-rules-for-trustworthy-ai">legislation</a> sets clear obligations based on the potential risks and impact of AI systems.</p>
<p>Key provisions include:</p>
 
 Prohibition of biometric categorization systems using sensitive characteristics (for example, political, religious, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, race) 
 Restriction on untargeted scraping of facial images for facial recognition databases 
 Ban on emotion recognition in workplaces and educational institutions 
 Prohibition of social scoring based on personal characteristics 
 Prohibition of AI exploiting vulnerabilities based on age, disability, or socioeconomic status 
 Use of biometric identification systems (RBI) in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes 
 Citizens' right to launch complaints and receive explanations about decisions based on high-risk AI systems 
 Transparency requirements for general-purpose AI systems, including technical documentation and compliance with EU copyright law 
 
<p>The AI Act focuses on risk assessments for AI systems, with obligations increasing based on the potential risk to individual rights or health. The agreement introduces transparency requirements for all general-purpose AI models and imposes tougher regulations on more powerful models. In essence, the EU AI Act strategically adapts its regulatory intensity based on the perceived risk levels associated with different AI systems.</p>
<p>By doing so, the legislation seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation, ensuring transparency, and mitigating potential harms arising from advanced AI technologies. This nuanced approach reflects the EU's commitment to responsible AI governance and aligns with its broader initiatives to establish a trustworthy and ethical AI landscape.</p>
<p>The AI Act won't take effect until two years after final approval by European lawmakers, expected sometime in early 2024. Moreover, the AI Act will apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</p>
<p>The law's global influence is expected to extend as a blueprint for other nations navigating AI regulations. However, by not fully banning live facial recognition, the EU's decision has drawn <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/12/eu-blocs-decision-to-not-ban-public-mass-surveillance-in-ai-act-sets-a-devastating-global-precedent/">criticism</a>, with Amnesty International deeming it a "hugely missed opportunity" and expressing concerns about potential global repercussions, particularly in the realm of human rights and civil liberties.</p>
 Decoding the American AI Regulatory Landscape 
<p>The U.S. AI regulatory landscape is characterized by a mix of existing federal and state laws, frameworks from various federal agencies, and a growing number of state-specific laws. It is also characterized by a decentralized approach, in contrast to the EU's top-down approach.</p>
<p>The legislative approach to AI is centered on an "incentive-based" strategy, with policymakers seeking to create conditions that will retain AI developers. The emphasis on incentives reflects a concerted effort to prevent the potential shift of AI development to competing nations, highlighting the delicate balance between promoting innovation and avoiding national security issues.</p>
<p>Despite the polarized and challenging political environment in the U.S. in recent years, both parties in Congress have consistently supported AI governance efforts. This bipartisan commitment reflects a shared recognition of the transformative potential and strategic importance of AI.</p>
<p>While the EU's AI law is in its final stages, the U.S. is unlikely to pass a comprehensive national AI law in the near future. Instead, a flurry of executive actions is expected. The outcome may not be a broad national AI law, but rather a nuanced, domain-specific regulatory landscape that navigates the complexities of AI governance.</p>
<p>For example, in October 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">order</a> on AI. The order mandates prominent AI developers to disclose safety test results and pertinent information to the government. Furthermore, government agencies will establish standards to guarantee the safety of AI tools before their public release, accompanied by guidelines for labeling AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Biden's directive extends the momentum generated by voluntary commitments from major tech companies, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which had pledged to ensure the safety of their products before launch. In addition, the U.S. government is expected to increase spending on AI and AI research, especially in the defense and intelligence sectors.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole, we foresee that while private companies may implement their "responsible AI" initiatives, potential AI trade frictions with the EU may arise. Moreover, concerns linger about enforceability and binding measures, with critics highlighting potential disparities with the more stringent measures adopted by the EU in the recently adopted AI Act.</p>
 Balancing Acts: Concluding Thoughts 
<p>The dominance of major AI players in the US raises concerns about the delayed availability of powerful AI models in the EU, potentially impacting technological and economic development in the region. This dichotomy also underscores the global competition in AI, with China and Russia potentially adopting different, and less democratic-oriented, approaches. The question arises: can safety be adequately ensured through legal frameworks alone, especially when considering the divergent strategies employed by major players in the AI arena?</p>
<p>Exploring this critical angle prompts a deeper reflection on the effectiveness of legal frameworks in balancing safety concerns with the rapid development and deployment of advanced AI technologies, especially in the context of varying global approaches. The global AI debate involves geopolitical competition, national security, and economic competitiveness. Therefore, the answer to ensuring safety in AI may involve a multifaceted approach that goes beyond legal regulations, incorporating international collaboration, ethical standards, and shared best practices</p>
<p>Despite differing approaches to AI regulation, both the US and EU share the common goal of ensuring safe and democratic AI, fostering the potential for aligned transatlantic regulatory approaches. The EU-US Trade and Technology Council demonstrates early success in collaborating on trustworthy AI metrics and methodologies, emphasizing the need for further alignment and knowledge sharing. It is therefore essential that the EU and the U.S. align their approaches in key areas, given their combined influence on global AI governance.</p>

We will answer them below. But first, one a backgrounder to provide&nbsp;context.</p> Background: Focus of Ocean Predictoor / DF&nbsp;Team <p>The main goal of the Ocean / Predictoor / DF team right now is: make it easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a trader, using Predictoor.</p>  Once it happens, there will be strong organic demand for the feeds, which in turn drives sales, which in turn drives predictoor income  This also means we’re spending less time on other potential things: detailed blogs, AMAs, webapp, analytics. Focus&nbsp;focus.  In short, $ success for traders will drive success everywhere else.   Questions &amp;&nbsp;Answers <p>Here are the Q’s, along with our A’s. Some answers won’t have full detail; that’s because we’re focusing on the “make it easy to make $”. Success there will drive the&nbsp;rest.</p><blockquote>How is a transaction counted?</blockquote><p>We submitted a list of smart contract addresses to dappradar.com. Whenever one of those has a tx against it, it’s&nbsp;counted.</p><p>The addresses we submitted are: the Ocean datatoken contracts for each of the 20 prediction feeds, plus a couple&nbsp;more.</p><blockquote>Are the Ocean predictoor ‘farming’ rewards part of the transactions if so how much do they account&nbsp;for?</blockquote><p>Payout of Predictoor Data Farming rewards is a small fraction of txs. However the $ incentive is likely a key driver for near-term traction.</p><p>If you’re a predictoor submitting prediction transactions, you can make $&nbsp;via:</p>  Organic sales  Sales from Predictoor Data Farming&nbsp;rewards  Others’ stake slashed when they are&nbsp;wrong.  <p>Of these:</p>  (3) evens out to about zero if your accuracy is about the same as others, and your <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7">stake doesn’t exceed your cut of expected&nbsp;sales</a>.  (2) is currently the biggest amount. We expect this in the early days, as it’s kickstarting the usage. (How to see: Compare “Autobot: Volumes” for all $ sales, to DF $ budget in Predictoor DF&nbsp;docs)  (1) will ultimately be the biggest amount by far, once it becomes easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a&nbsp;trader.  <p><a href="https://autobotocean.com/volumes">“AutoBot: Volumes” page</a> shows volumes for each&nbsp;feed.</p><blockquote>How many unique addresses are paying for&nbsp;feeds?</blockquote><p>We haven’t computed analytics for that yet. You *could* query the subgraph for yourself, see link&nbsp;above.</p><blockquote>Are there return&nbsp;users?</blockquote><p>For predictoors: Yes. In fact, it seems to be a high % predictoors returning, ie low churn.&nbsp;See</p><p>For traders: We haven’t computed analytics for that yet. What will really make a difference is traders easily &amp; obviously earning $; hence our focus on&nbsp;that.</p><blockquote>Is the overall number of users increasing?</blockquote><p>Yes. See <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor">“DappRadar&nbsp;: Predictoor” page</a>, the “UAW” line on the plot. UAW = Unique Active&nbsp;Wallets.</p><p>&gt; How much revenue are these transactions giving to the Ocean Protocol?</p><p>Fees details: (from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor/pdr-parameters">Predictoor docs</a>)<br>- 0.1% community swap fee<br>- 20% to Ocean Protocol Foundation. (Will be used to further drive Predictoor, and to burn&nbsp;OCEAN.)</p><blockquote>What numbers would need to be met before another say 100 price feeds are added to predictoor (1, 15, 30 min feeds), more token pairs including Ocean (helping increase Ocean volume)&nbsp;etc.</blockquote><p>As mentioned above, we see that the biggest driver of traction will be traders making $. Our focus is to make that easy &amp; obvious. As part of our work, we are exploring other trading venues &amp; pairs. We’re also professionalizing our internal data engineering pipeline, and starting to build an analytics app inspired by my <a href="http://www.trent.st/">previous work</a> on Computer-Aided Design. All of this is already open-source; you can track our progress in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">GitHub</a>.</p><p>Once “making $” is established, then we will scale up accordingly. Way more defi feeds; then beyond to other verticals taking us to 10K+ feeds; <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/meet-predictoor-accountable-accurate-prediction-feeds-8b104d26a5d9#5039">AI DAOs; then building large-scale AIs across those 10K+ feeds.</a> One thing will lead to&nbsp;another.</p> Summary <p>Some recent Ocean tweets have shared some promising traction numbers for Ocean Predictoor, via data on DappRadar and Autobot Ocean. That’s great news! It’s the sign of a growing ecosystem of predictoors and&nbsp;traders.</p><p>To really take this to the next level, the Ocean Predictoor / DF team is working to make it easy &amp; obvious to earn $ as a trader, using Predictoor.

<p>On November 8th, the European Council and Parliament reached a provisional agreement on the new framework for a European digital identity (eID).</p>
<p>Over a decade in the making, we Europeans are now finally taking a fundamental step so that all EU citizens can have a unique and secure digital identity. This is a key advancement for the European Union to be a global leader in the digital identity field, enabling all 27 member states to reap the benefits of digitalisation.</p>
<p>The new European digital identity wallets will enable all Europeans to access online services throughout Europe with their own national digital ID, without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles help to assure that only information that needs to be shared will be shared. Security and privacy are paramount to any electronic identity ecosystem, and I have previously highlighted some of the concerns and trade-offs in the first of this EUDI blog series; <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity">Introducing European Digital Identity (EUDI): The Future of Secure and Accessible Identity</a>.</p>
 Understanding the EUDI Wallet Pilots 
<p>Running in parallel with the legislative track are the actual pilots of the EUDI wallets and end-user services. This is a great advantage from many perspectives, not least striving to avoid the fate of eIDAS v1, which suffered from the ‘chicken-and-egg’ problem from the start. It is surprising how the pilots have flown under the radar despite there being over 250 private corporations and public authorities participating in the four largest pilots alone, supported with €46 million investment from the EU Commission, as discussed in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_3556">Provisional Political Agreement EU Commission article</a>.</p>
 EUDI Pilot Categories 
<p>The pilots can be broadly divided into three categories: User Authentication, e-Signing, and Website Authentication or Qualified Web Authentication Certificates (QWACs). As the last category is outside European control and looking increasingly unimplementable, I will focus initially on the User Authentication and E-Signing.</p>
<p>Beside the QWACs, a wide range of use cases are part of the EUDI pilot projects. These include:</p>
 
 Using the wallets to host user credentials for accessing government services 
 Activating SIM cards for mobile network services – in those countries which forbid anonymous SIM cards 
 Signing B2C and G2C contracts 
 Facilitating travel via digital driving licences and identity documents 
 Presenting educational credentials previously standardised under the Bologna agreement 
 
<p>All together, these use cases highlight the broad applicability of the EUDI. Basic user authentication is but a small part of its capabilities.</p>
<p>The European Commission has acknowledged that a digital identity can be used for much more than authentication to existing services. It frequently plays a part in the EUDI’s wide capabilities, as convenience features even at the highest level. For example, in the <a href="https://state-of-the-union.ec.europa.eu/state-union-2020_en">2020 State of the Union address</a>, the European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, highlighted how users will be able to use the EUDI wallets to file tax returns, check into hotels, rent cars, and securely open bank accounts across borders. Looking further, a <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/pdf/efip/Digital_identity_update.pdf">European Central Bank policy brief on the European Digital Identity Framework</a> suggests that the EUDI wallet will include support for the Digital Euro.</p>
 The Four Major EUDI Pilots 
<p>There are several multi-year pilot projects running, of which the four largest are introduced below. In the first phase, which is currently ongoing, the pilots are centred on individual identities and the most common B2C use cases. After the launch of the EUDI for private persons, it’s expected that it will (at last) be the turn of organisational identity.</p>
 <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EWC</a> – EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The EWC pilot is coordinated by Sweden with the involvement of 18 Member States and Ukraine. It is a major undertaking that involves 15 public entities and 40 private organisations. The pilot is centred around travel and tests the storage and display of digital travel credentials and instant payments. First becoming an alternative to, and later replacing, European passports is not a realistic goal at present. But since a national identity card is a valid travel document within the EU, accepting EUDI as a travel document within the Schengen zone (the 27 European countries that have removed the need for passports and many other types of border control at their mutual borders) would be a much more realistic development.</p>
<p>The Digital Euro will be a central component of the EUDI instant payment system, scheduled to launch in 2027+. The Digital Euro seeks to bring instant electronic payments to the masses. However, it will not be as big of a change in the Nordics as in other countries, due to electronic payments already being the default. The Euro represents not value but debt; most of the European money supply exists purely in the digital domain already.</p>
 <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">POTENTIAL</a> – Pilots for European Digital Identity Wallet Consortium 
<p>The POTENTIAL Pilot is coordinated by Germany and France with the involvement of 17 Member States and Ukraine. It is the largest of the pilots and involves over 50 public entities and over 80 private organisations. The pilot will use the EUDI wallet for several use cases around user authentication including; accessing government services, opening a bank account, e-prescriptions and Digital Driving Licences.</p>
<p>The Digital Driving License is a good example of how having a widely available, strong digital identity opens up a whole range of possibilities for enriching the identity with additional attributes. In this case, using the Digital Driving License to operate motor vehicles within the EU. Every country already has a database of valid licenses granted by the national authorities, so enabling the end user to present this data alongside their digital identity replicates the function of a dedicated physical driver’s license card. This makes tasks like car rental a faster and less error-prone process. It also allows end users to prove both their identity and their vehicle operation licenses online, without the need to send photos of their documents alongside selfies holding those documents to the third party – a goldmine for any identity thief.</p>
 <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID</a> – Nordic-Baltic eID Wallet Consortium 
<p>Interestingly the NOBID Pilot is led by Norway, a non-EU country, with eight member states also involved. Overall, it involves 5 public entities and over 15 private organisations.</p>
<p>The pilot will focus on a single use case: the use of the EUDI wallet for the authorisation of payments for products and services by the end user. Unlike the EWC, it will concentrate on addressing the issuance of wallets, the provision of payment means by financial institutions, and the secure and convenient acceptance of payment in a retail (B2C) context.</p>
 <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU</a> – Digital Credentials for Europe Consortium 
<p>The DC4EU Pilot is led by Spain and involves nearly all other member states, as the pilot trials the use of the EUDI wallet in the educational sector and the social security domain. The pilot project aligns with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/ESSPASS">European Social Security Pass</a> and <a href="https://europa.eu/europass/en/node/2128">the European Learning Model</a>.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/consortium/">tens of universities</a> from around Europe together with government officials and research associations, the pilot is clearly focused on the higher education sector. Technically it is very different from the other pilots, as it trials the use of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure</a> (EBSI) in the context of the EUDI wallet. Educational records could be especially suitable for a distributed database model, because educational degrees are revoked only under extraordinary circumstances and the range of educational institutions is very broad – from small private institutions to massive state-run universities and polytechnics. The project is scheduled to run until April 2025, and they also maintain a handy list of <a href="https://www.dc4eu.eu/outputs/">related acronyms</a> on the project site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EUDI pilots are well underway and will continue to late 2024 with some even heading into 2025. It is clear then that the original 2024 launch date for the EUDI is not tenable, at least when talking about a mass launch. But I do hope that by this time next year, there will be a limited release available in order to truly start exploring the capabilities and practical features of the EUDI ecosystem. The potential scale of the EUDI is immense but is certainly doable – as the credit card industry has proven, for example.</p>

 We sit down with our Brazilian-born, Regional Senior Sales Manager at IDnow, Francisco Martins to discuss what’s next for the Brazilian gambling market, and how gambling platforms can prepare for the new era of gambling regulation. 



 



 In December 2023, the Brazilian Senate finally passed its gambling regulations for sports betting and online casinos. What took so long?&nbsp; 



<p>Until this week, there had been no enforceable or documented Brazilian gambling regulations due to a blanket ban on gambling in the country since the 1940s.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the ban, however, gambling was a prevalent pastime, and casinos were big businesses that pulled in celebrities worldwide. The ban, introduced in 1946, came from President Eurico Gaspar Dutra; a man heavily influenced by his wife, who was a devout Catholic, and thought poorly of games of chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continued pressure from the general populace saw some restrictions lifted in intervening years, such as:&nbsp;</p>



  Legalization of a non-commercial bingo in 1971.<br>  Legalization of horse racing and the betting associated with it in 1984.<br>  Creation of a state-owned lottery system in 1996.&nbsp;  



<p>Poker was exempt from the 1946 ban as it was deemed a game of skill. Alongside the above, social betting and fantasy betting are legal under Brazilian gambling laws; however, they are entirely unregulated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ban was met with strong resistance, and underground gambling soon became a thing. The game of choice to this day is Jogo do Bicho, a simple lottery-style game that began in 1892. Jogo do Bicho began as a fun game played outside a zoo but is now an unofficial yet popular numbers game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Brazilian gambling restrictions only ever applied to gambling operators headquartered in Brazil, the domestic ban essentially provided a window of opportunity operators headquartered abroad to target Brazilian customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Introducing this new regulatory framework has therefore been fraught with difficulties for new and existing operators across the globe. To help meet some of these challenges, a nonprofit organization called ABRADIE was created to ensure the Brazilian gambling and iGaming landscape remained safe and free from corruption.</p>



 What would you say was the main catalyst for change? 



<p>I think there were two main reasons for change: public opinion, and the realization that the Brazilian economy was missing out on major tax revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the first, as online gambling and iGaming grew in popularity, so too did public sentiment toward regulation revision. People began to regard the regulations as archaic, and openly challenged that online gambling should be exempt. In a way, it was, as online gambling and iGaming have been allowed in Brazil, provided the operators were headquartered outside the country. In 2018, the winds of change began to blow in Brazil’s way, and a plan was proposed to introduce new gaming legislation in Brazil. The proposed project allowed basic fixed odds sports betting, but with the caveat that actual legislation was a work in progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The income generated from online gambling in Brazil is predicted to be more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">$1.5 billion in 2023</a> – an increase of over 200% from 2022. Understandably, that’s a lot of tax revenue that the Brazilian authorities are missing out on. Predictions now point toward a sustained period of rapid growth. The Brazilian economy is struggling (having dropped from the <a href="https://brazilian.report/liveblog/2022/03/04/world-biggest-economies/">world’s 7th largest to 13th in just over a decade</a>), and the revenue boost from opening the country up to the iGaming sector is too good to not take advantage of.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also worth mentioning that besides the economic boost, the regulation will also have a positive effect on:&nbsp;</p>



  Safer gambling: Invariably, when regulations are deemed necessary, it is an indication of inherent risk in the industry, for example fraud and other criminal activities. Enforcing strict and well-documented regulations will make the Brazilian gaming space safer and more secure.  



  Attract investors: Establishing online gambling and sports betting regulations opens the Brazil market to new and diverse investors. Setting a framework for gambling regulations ensures a competitive and fair landscape, for new and old entrants, while preventing companies from running unethical practices and promotions to build their iGaming brands.  



 What are your thoughts on the new regulations? Do you think they are clear enough? 



<p>The regulations for sports betting and online casinos are a significant step toward Brazil’s modern online gambling landscape. Casinos will also remain illegal for the time being, but further changes are expected in the coming years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the ban on bonus bets is an interesting decision. Sign-up bonuses are often used by operators to entice customers to register for their platform, however they are also exploited by criminals. [Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/bonus-abuse-gambling/">bonus abuse in our blog here</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new rules also prohibit companies without a license from advertising. The content of advertisements must follow new guidelines, and any company found to be in breach of guidelines will have it removed from the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I do think is smart are the new payment rules that have been designed to try and dismantle Brazil’s huge illegal gambling market. Only operators authorized by the Central Bank can offer payment services, and players are only able to send money to a bank account that is headquartered in Brazil.</p>



 So, what’s new? How can operators comply with the new Brazilian gambling regulations? 



<p>The first requirement is for an operator to be based in Brazil. Foreign operators will be barred from offering regulated gambling. This will ensure the Brazilian government is able to collect the taxable revenue (operators will be liable to pay 12% revenue tax.) Operators are also mandated to meet a range of integrity, responsibility and honesty requirements as proposed by the ABRADIE and IBJR and are therefore required to be a member of a sports integrity body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other requirements operators will be forced to comply with include having a minimum value of share capital and being able to pass several technical requirements.</p>



<p>Players will also be pleased to learn that there will be 15% tax on the amount that bettors win, which is a major reduction on the 30% tax that Brazilian Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad originally said he wanted.</p>



<p>Operators that wish to comply with the new sports betting regulations can do so by getting a Brazilian gambling license, which will set them back BR$30 million (US$6.1 million) for five years of validity. Learn more about the complexities of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/#:~:text=The%20only%20forms%20of%20permitted,to%20be%20active%20in%20Brazil.">Brazilian gambling license structure in our blog, here</a>.</p>



 What challenges do you foresee regarding the opening of the Brazilian market? 



<p>Introducing sports betting regulations in Brazil will not be without its challenges and risks. As the illegal and unregulated gambling industry is already thoroughly established, one of the primary issues that must be confronted is underground gambling and removing the risk of fraud or match-fixing. Brazilian sports have seen their share of scandals and controversies that would make anybody nervous about entering this newly opened market without a rigid and protective framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world of iGaming is driven by the financial aspect. The challenge will be to balance the economic benefits of online betting legislation with the social responsibility to keep everybody safe. Safety relates to being safe from fraud and other financial crime, but also to ensure they engage in responsible gambling. </p>



 How does Brazil’s gambling regulations compare to other markets? 



<p>The best way to understand how to thrive in a new market is to study the landscape of existing markets. The<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/"> UK Gambling Commission</a> has created an established model that makes an excellent study for the Brazilian authorities. Malta is another location that has created a great regulatory model to tackle the challenges of being a smaller location with a heavy reliance on international business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each country in LATAM is adopting and updating its regulations at a different place. Argentina, Bolivia, and Nicaragua are three countries with various existing regulations and are actively working to expand them. Mexico is another that has the framework in place for rapid iGaming growth and would present good case studies, offering realistic region-proof market entry strategies that can be easily customized for the Brazilian landscape.</p>



 What role will technology play in the&nbsp;new era of online gambling in Brazil? 



<p>As further regulatory changes come into play, and new global markets continue to slowly but surely open, one key way that operators can prepare for the future is by incorporating robust identity verification technology. This enables operators to conduct thorough <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer checks</a> and process international and local documents and data, such as the Cadastro de Pessoa Física (Brazilian tax number).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Brazil, gaming operators in Brazil must now adopt identification procedures&nbsp;that verify players’&nbsp;identity. As such, the use of facial recognition technology in identifying the identities of bettors and the amount of  taxation to be paid will become standard practice. Operators must also be able to verify and validate the authenticity of ID, by comparing with available data from public and private databases. </p>



<p>Navigating the online world and covering the range of potential issues is mission-critical for anybody looking to create a new set of iGaming regulations. An online business is present in many countries and, therefore, must be aware of and compliant with the relevant regulations and legislations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with a solid system that can accommodate the different requirements of different regulatory bodies is essential. Anti-money-laundering compliant identity verification and fraud prevention are hot topics and even more prevalent when entering a new market that has been active but unregulated for several years.<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/)"> IDnow has the tools</a> that help make the transition into the Brazilian iGaming space as seamless as possible.</p>



 What’s next for Brazil’s gambling regime? 



<p>Revenue is already up by 200% from 2022 and is expected to double again by 2027. As the industry expands and technology advances, regulations must adapt to remain ahead of the curve, where possible, to maintain player and operator safety. As these laws change and people’s views toward online gambling evolve, so will the different definitions of what is covered. Many Brazilians would love to see casinos return.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By implementing a Brazilian gambling regulation process, the initial upturn for the economy will be immediate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The road ahead of the iGaming culture in Brazil is not without its challenges. Initiating change takes time and knowledge.&nbsp;The online gaming sphere is fraught with complexities, such as ensuring that a solid multi-jurisdictional identity verification platform is in place to protect anything entering the space. Solid identity-proofing systems are imperative for anybody looking to enter the emerging LATAM market, as each new jurisdiction will bring its own requirements. Having a dependable system programmed to deal with a region’s requirements means setting a solid foundation for safe and stable growth in that market.</p>

 Owning Your Digital Identity in the Age of Self-Sovereignty 



<p>Imagine a world where your digital self isn’t imprisoned within the walled gardens of tech giants and government databases. No more surrendering your data for a flicker of online convenience. Instead, picture a universe where you hold the keys to your identity, selectively unlocking doors with verifiable credentials, navigating the digital landscape with unparalleled privacy and security. This isn’t a utopian dream; it’s the dawn of decentralized digital identity (DDID) and self-sovereign identity (SSI), revolutions quietly reshaping the digital landscape.</p>



<p>DDID and SSI stand in stark contrast to the traditional identity model controlled by centralized authorities. In this outdated paradigm, our digital footprints are scattered across the web, vulnerable to breaches and subject to the whims of corporations and governments. DDID and SSI empower individuals to reclaim ownership of their identity data, building a fortress of privacy brick by blockchain brick.</p>



 Breaking Free from the Siloed Self: 



<p>At the heart of this revolution lies the concept of verifiable credentials: tamper-proof digital badges issued by trusted entities (think universities, banks, or healthcare providers) and stored securely on your own device or decentralized networks. No more handing over your entire identity to access a service; with SSI, you simply present the relevant credential, demonstrating your eligibility without revealing anything else.</p>



<p>Imagine applying for a loan without your entire financial history laid bare, or renting an apartment without relinquishing your social media life. SSI grants you granular control, empowering you to choose what you share and with whom.</p>



 The Global Band of Identity Solutions: 



<p>The DDID (Decentralized Digital Identity) and SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) symphony is playing on a global stage, with diverse protocols harmonizing their efforts:</p>



 
 Canada:&nbsp;SecureKey Technologies leads the charge, forging an SSI network powered by blockchain, where governments, corporations, and individuals collaborate to build a privacy-centric future. 



 USA:&nbsp;The Sovrin Foundation champions SSI adoption, while NIST sets the beat of digital identity management through standardized guidelines. 



 Europe:&nbsp;The SSI eIDAS Bridge project acts as a conductor, bridging the gap between traditional eIDAS infrastructure and the dynamic world of decentralized identities. 



 Latin America:&nbsp;Extrimian, powered by the nimble notes of zkSync, partners with QuarkID, a versatile instrument enabling users to manage their credentials on a secure, multi-chain platform. 



 Asia:&nbsp;Japan takes center stage with the “My Number Card” project, showcasing the power of SSI at the national level. 



 Australia and New Zealand:&nbsp;The DTA pilots SSI for government services, testing the melody in real-world scenarios. 
 



 Challenges of the Decentralized Identity System: 



<p>While the tech behind DDID and SSI is captivating, challenges remain. Standardizing the language of identity across different protocols is crucial to ensure harmony. Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape requires careful orchestration. And encouraging individuals to embrace this new paradigm demands education and trust-building.</p>



<p>Yet, the potential melody outweighs the dissonance. As awareness grows and technical advancements diminish the volume of challenges, DDID and SSI are poised to rewrite the identity score.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving in the U.S. signals the start of the holiday shopping season, stretching all the way to Christmas. During this time, businesses offer various deals and incentives, triggering a surge in orders, deliveries, and returns of goods. Unfortunately, this season is also a prime opportunity for attackers seeking to capitalize on unsuspecting individuals, employing identity-based cyberattacks such as phishing to compromise users’ credentials and take control of their accounts.</p>
<p>In fact, the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231115#:~:text=The%20FBI%20warns%20of%20criminals,in%20losses%20over%20%2473%20million.">FBI reported almost 12,000 victims reporting non-payment/non-delivery scams during the 2022 holiday shopping season, resulting in losses over $73 million</a>. This number doesn’t account for organizations that have experienced breaches due to employees falling victim to phishing while using corporate devices for online shopping. Additionally, it doesn’t acknowledge the number of victims who never report these incidents. While education on phishing scams and how to stay safe is a necessary step in helping protect users against account takeover (ATO) and other identity-based attacks, it is not a foolproof way to secure your users and their data.</p>
<p>Most organizations have implemented some form of multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is usually based on SMS/email one-time passcode (OTP) or mobile soft tokens to improve security for their users and customers. At the same time, attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, using tools such as phishing-as-a-service and generative AI. These technologies enable the creation of phishing emails and campaigns that look alarmingly authentic, often evading the most well-trained and vigilant security-aware individuals. In addition, MFA bypass attacks like SIM swap and MFA fatigue/prompt bombing render traditional MFA options vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations need to implement phishing-resistant and MFA bypass-resistant multi-factor authentication to protect their users and customers.</p>
<p>Types of Holiday Scams</p>
<p>Most holiday phishing attacks exploit users’ distractions amid holiday festivities and shopping. This leads to financial losses and identity theft, causing long-term repercussions such as damage to credit scores, mortgages, and more.</p>
 
 Fake promotions – These are emails or advertisements that offer attractive discounts, leading victims to phishing sites that replicate genuine retail websites. Users unknowingly make purchases using their credit cards, only to never receive the items they paid for. 
 Delivery notifications – As online holiday shopping increases, cybercriminals exploit it by sending fake delivery notifications. These messages pressure victims to click on links to resolve supposed issues, such as delivery address or payment of additional fees, often leading to compromised credentials. 
 Fake charities – Preying on the goodwill of people during the holidays, attackers create deceptive websites impersonating charities to solicit donations. 
 Fake order receipts – Cybercriminals mimic well-known, reputable retailers by sending fake order receipts through email. These emails contain links supposedly allowing the recipient to cancel or modify their order, tricking them into visiting phishing sites where their credentials are compromised. 
 
<p>While most attacks are targeted toward consumers, organizations should also be alert. Employees often use corporate devices such as laptops and mobile phones for holiday shopping, potentially risking the compromise of business accounts and applications. In addition, many users reuse passwords across personal and corporate accounts, making them susceptible to credential stuffing attacks.</p>
<p>Phishing-Resistant Passwordless MFA</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication (CBA) with Bluetooth proximity is the highest assurance phishing-resistant MFA option available in the market. It is the most recommended approach to securing access to organizational resources and data for users including employees, contractors, and B2B customers.</p>
<p>For most consumer use cases, passkeys are starting to gain adoption as the phishing-resistant MFA that utilizes a user’s smartphone to utilize cryptographic key pairs when authenticating users to applications or services. Passkeys are generally multi-device enabled with the private key stored across a user’s device ecosystem and in their platform’s cloud account (i.e. iCloud, etc.).</p>
<p>Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication (RBA)</p>
<p>While phishing-resistant passwordless MFA provides enhanced security and protection against ATO attacks, enforcing a risk-based approach can help add additional layers of security while balancing security with user experience, only introducing friction in the process when necessary. Risk inputs like travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, and other external risk feeds such as threat feeds, etc. can help evaluate the risk score of a user during an authentication event, allowing for access to be blocked or requiring the user to use a different 2FA based on risk score thresholds.</p>
<p>Identity Verification (IDV)</p>
<p>Another common entry point for attackers is during password/MFA reset, where they can gain access to a user’s account by triggering a reset and adding additional authenticators to the account. Using identity verification solutions can help combat these attacks. Requiring users to verify their identity with physical credentials such as a driver’s license, passport, etc. can add another layer of defense in securing users against ATO attacks. IDV as a step-up authentication can help protect high-value transactions or out-of-policy/out-of-compliance users.</p>
<p>Combining phishing-resistant MFA with RBA and IDV offers a layered approach with defense in depth against identity-based attacks.

 Making a Human Rights Based Approach to Personal Data&nbsp;Work <p>We (Mydex CIC) have just published a new Paper on how to practically implement <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">a human rights approach to personal data</a>. It’s important because implementing a human rights to personal data does two things: it involves implementing a human rights approach to the person that the data relates to and to the service that the data is being used to deliver. It’s key to actually making human rights happen on the ground, day-to-day rather than just talk about (which tends to happen quite&nbsp;often).</p><p>You might think that peoples’ rights in relation to their data is already covered, dealt with by legislation such as GDPR. To be sure, GDPR lays important foundations creating a number of rights such as the right to access, to data portability, to transparency in how, to object to processing and to be forgotten, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>But in many ways these are just formal rights which have very little impact on what happens day to day. We think a human rights approach to personal data goes much further than formal compliance to GDPR into the nitty gritty of how themes such as Control, Agency and Guardianship work (hence the title of the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">Paper</a>). Here are some of its key&nbsp;points.</p> Is user-centricity a good&nbsp;thing? <p>First off, almost always, slogans like ‘user centric service design’ are a sure-fire sign that a human rights approach to personal data is not being implemented. This is because of the way ‘user centric’ logic works. By definition, a ‘user’ is a person using a particular service. In focusing solely on the interface between the organisational and the individual, it actually ignores the context and circumstances of the individual’s life, quickly turning the attention back to itself. ‘User-centric’ thus becomes a way in which organisations keep examining themselves in their own mirrors: high-sounding rhetoric for their continued focus on their own needs in relation to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>A simple example: a user-centric approach to designing forms will focus on one particular organisation’s attempts to make filling in its particular forms easier, clearer and simpler. This is fine as it goes, but it’s not very far because most individuals needing services need to fill in lots of different forms, many of them completely different in their design, presentation and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Time and time again we have seen projects where ‘user-centric’ service design loses sight of the people it is supposed to serve: the human beings whose lives are much richer, more complicated and difficult than just their one single interface with one particular organisation and one particular service.</p><p>So, for example, a service that is person-centric rather than user-centric might ask ‘how to eliminate the need to fill in forms at all?’ (by, for example, enabling automated API-based processes of data sharing). Or, failing that, how to design forms so that they all look and feel the same no matter what organisation they come from, so that we as human beings don’t have to learn how to navigate our way through, each different form, every&nbsp;time?</p> Is ‘control’ a good&nbsp;thing? <p>‘Control’ over data is another word to be suspicious about. That’s because service providers usually interpret ‘control’ in a very narrow, organisation-centric way. ‘Control’ is interpreted as an individual being able to exercise a little more control over the data that that particular organisation collects about them. This is very different to an individual having genuine, full control over the data by, for example, being able to aggregate data from all the different organisations they deal with, in their own database (such as a personal data store), and to use and share this data as they wish, outside of the systems, restrictions and controls placed upon this data by the organisation concerned.</p><p>A truly human rights approach to data embraces the second, genuine, full interpretation of ‘control’; something that, after 16 years of development, we are now implementing in a number of projects, particularly in health and&nbsp;care.</p> Why agency is&nbsp;critical <p>‘Agency’ is another key concept when it comes to the practical implementation of a human rights approach to personal data. If you can’t actually access and use your data to actually do stuff in your life — to get stuff done — then your ‘rights’ are just formal, not real; and ‘control’ is close to meaningless.</p><p>The locus of such agency isn’t within the systems of this or that organisation; it is within the individual’s life, when they are trying to access, use and share data to better manage the issues that matter to them. This, we believe, is creating a completely different agenda.</p><p>What’s really needed to enhance and enable citizen agency is a personalised experience layer that enables individuals to interoperate with many different schemes and ecosystems via a familiar, consistent interface that becomes second nature to them. Like driving a&nbsp;car.</p><p>Practically speaking, this means each individual should have their own personalised cockpits or dashboards that display the data about their life, their transactions, their accumulated proof points and so on, in the ways that they find intuitive and easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Within this, agency means being able to use your data where and when you want, and to be able to share it easily with whomever you want safely and securely. Seen from this perspective, our society has hardly even begun adopting or implementing a human rights approach to personal data: we have a long way to&nbsp;go.</p> Agency and guardianship: two sides of the same&nbsp;coin <p>Finally, ‘guardianship’ is crucial to both real life control and agency. There are millions of people in the UK today, such as the old, frail or ill, who are not able to act fully and completely on their own behalf: who need help; someone to act for them in ways big and&nbsp;small.</p><p>Perhaps ironically, it is precisely in such situations of real or threatened loss of control and agency that, very often, they become all the more important to the person concerned. They want, as it were, to exercise control over what others are doing for them, when and&nbsp;how.</p><p>This is complex to manage and current ways of handling this complexity struggle with a chasm between highly formal, legal and bureaucratic powers of attorney and the myriad of informal ways that powers are delegated in real life: “Oh love, when you go to the shops, could you buy these items for me? Here’s my&nbsp;card!”</p><p>People need systems and infrastructure that let them handle this formal/informal spectrum quickly, simply and safely. Our Paper explains some of the mechanisms, such as Circles of Support, that we have developed to deal with these issues in a practical way.</p><p>This underlines a key point about most current debates on human rights. What’s needed above all is infrastructure, tools and capabilities that make it possible to embed and crystallise a human rights approach to data in a way that works at the level of daily, practical details. The focus needs to be on practical implementation, not just rhetoric.</p><p>To conclude, change is in the air. Our (Mydex’s) day-to-day work is showing that it is possible to build a personal data ecosystem that is interoperable, flexible, certifiable, scalable and that is also safe, secure and consensual, taking a human rights based approach that results in genuine personal, social and economic benefits. The opportunity is to make a human rights approach to personal data — and therefore to all data-driven services — something that actually does happen, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>P.S.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>As we look towards 2024, the air travel industry is poised for a historic milestone. The latest forecasts suggest that 2024 is set to be the biggest year ever in terms of global passenger traffic volume. This is a remarkable turnaround from the significant downturn experienced in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>For many of us, including myself, this year has been marked by frequent flights. Whether for business or leisure, it seems like we’ve been in the air more often than not.</p>
<p>As air travel volumes continue to soar, the question arises: how can we further improve and streamline travel processes for travelers and various stakeholders? A key component in this evolution is the role of digital identity.</p>
<p>In this latest podcast episode, Dan and I engage in a conversation focusing on the concept of ‘travel credentials’. We delve into how digital identity can revolutionize the travel experience, making it more efficient and seamless for everyone involved.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees includes managing which SaaS applications they need access to and which they need to be removed from. Many small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) do this with something lovingly (or not so lovingly) called The SpreadsheetTM.</p>
<p>A new employee joins the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee left the company? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An employee changed their name? Update The Spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, when the annual access review comes along, everyone asks: How accurate is The Spreadsheet? And as your company grows, the more employees you have, the more applications you use, the more digitally connected you are — the more complicated The Spreadsheet gets.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. It is possible to automate granting and revoking access and permissions by using APIs for many applications. But there are some substantial barriers:</p>
<p>It’s nobody’s job (yet). Small companies are often strapped, and maybe you don’t have a dedicated headcount that can own the process of <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">updating employee application access</a>.</p>
<p>The app doesn’t have an API. With some applications, the only way to update permissions is in the app itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">expensive SSO tax</a> gets in the way. Using automation software like Okta, for example, forces you to implement technological protocols you just don’t need yet. It’s expensive and can be disruptive to users.&nbsp;</p>
 A better way to automate IT permissions 
<p>Because it’s so easy to implement, more modern application vendors have adopted “Sign in with Google,” and they don’t charge for it. This means that if you use Google Workspace, the need for SAML-based SSO (like Okta) is nearly obsolete. And get this — 70% of startups and SMBs already operate on Google Workspace to begin with!</p>
<p>YeshID helps Google Super Admins create a streamlined, repeatable, efficient, and compliant way to manage identities and applications. Using templates, you can automate creating a Google user and putting them in the proper organization and groups. This also triggers the creation of a task list of apps they need access to and automatically sends requests for provisioning to the proper admins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, we’re testing an even easier way to do this: If the application offers the ability to read the list of users on lower subscription tiers, we’ll actually keep the list up to date for you. And soon, we’ll have the ability to add the user for you too (if that capability exists in lower subscription tiers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, we have integrations with Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Once enabled, syncing users from those applications to YeshID can be done with a click of a button.&nbsp;</p>

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF68 is live today, Dec 14. It concludes on Dec 21. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF68   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF68 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

 TL;DR 



 
 Extrimian and zkSync partner to bring QuarkID and decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity to the citizens of Buenos Aires. 



 The pioneering initiative will enable citizens to claim ownership of their documents and personal data and provide greater security and privacy. 



 QuarkID, an open source digital identity protocol, will use zkSync Era to empower users and ensure privacy. 



 The collaboration establishes the City of Buenos Aires as a leader in the adoption of blockchain technologies for the benefit of its citizens. 



 The project aims to expand nationwide, benefiting more than 45 million people in Argentina. 
 



<p></p>



 



<p></p>



 What is QuarkID? 



<p><a href="https://quarkid.org">QuarkID </a>is the Decentralized Digital Identity protocol anchored on <a href="https://zksync.io/">zkSync Era</a>, developed by <a href="https://extrimian.io">Extrimian</a>, and driven by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires and other companies with extensive experience in decentralized technologies and data security. This initiative seeks to put the power of data in the hands of citizens.</p>



 Latin America’s leading Decentralized Identity protocol partners with zkSync to transform Digital Identity in the region, starting with the City of Buenos Aires. 



<p>In the ever-changing blockchain technology landscape, the quest for a billion users remains a constant goal. So what technology or use cases should we push to achieve greater adoption of blockchain technology?</p>



<p>And is that, considering the privacy and digital security needs due to the increase in cybercrime and identity theft that is occurring these days, an identity and private data verification system that puts the user at the center, is imperative.</p>



 What drives this development? 



<p>At the heart of the Web3 ethic is personal ownership and decentralization, principles that extend far beyond financial assets to encompass broader, more practical applications. Today, we are pleased to announce a groundbreaking initiative in this direction: citizen-owned digital identity. Buenos Aires, Argentina, is poised to lead the charge, gradually introducing Web3 identity solutions powered by zkSync Era’s privacy-centric properties.</p>



<p>In the effort to bring Web3 identity solutions to the global stage, it is imperative that privacy remains a paramount concern in technologies that enable personal data ownership. A decentralized world that neglects privacy considerations goes against the very essence of Web3.</p>



<p>We envision a future in which personal freedom and autonomous digital identity empower individuals to securely manage their data.</p>



 Empowering Buenos Aires Citizens with Decentralized and Self-Sovereign Digital Identity. 



<p>Under Argentina’s blockchain-based identification initiative, citizens will gain control over their personal documents, health data and, in the future, payment processing. To build the infrastructure for this transformative program, Buenos Aires has partnered with QuarkID, an open source digital identity protocol developed by Extrimian, Latin America’s leading decentralized identity company. QuarkID uses zkSync Era as its anchor protocol, powering the wallets through which individuals will claim their documents.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“This marks a monumental leap toward a more secure and efficient future for government services in Latin America,” ; “QuarkID fosters closer ties between governments and citizens while introducing digital identity practices and security standards in Latin America.”, expressed <a href="https://ar.linkedin.com/in/guillevillanueva">Guillermo Villanueva, CEO of Extrimian</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The data stored in QuarkID wallets is autonomous, allowing citizens to control the delivery of their credentials when interacting with administrative services. zkSync Era serves as a settlement layer for QuarkID, ensuring that each participating citizen maintains ownership of their legitimate credentials.</p>



<p>While QuarkID makes its debut in Buenos Aires, its architecture is designed to scale globally. Complying with international standards such as W3C, Trust Over IP and Sovrin Foundation, QuarkID is interoperable with networks around the world.</p>



 Leveraging ZK Technology to Empower 650 Million People in Latin America 



<p>While blockchain-based digital identity promises a revolutionary change in data ownership, it often generates controversy as to the true decentralization of these processes. Recent events, such as the Kenyan government’s concerns about data privacy in a biometric cryptocurrency project, highlight these issues.</p>



<p>However, the transparency and security inherent in the cutting edge of Zero Knowledge (ZK) technology, combined with Ethereum, have the potential to dispel such concerns. This partnership unlocks privacy-preserving digital identity enforcement for entire nations.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://zksync.mirror.xyz/w4_Dyhbx1X2BEGpYNCn8rEAS_2uC1hV0qPQl_m5AChk">ZkSync Blog</a></p>



<p>With zkSync and Ethereum as the backbone of this initiative, personal data stored on-chain mitigates identity theft and personal information attacks commonly associated with centralized data storage technologies. zkSync ensures that digital property is trusted, trustless and secure, while prioritizing privacy.</p>



<p>The Argentine government and the City of Buenos Aires aim to establish its digital identity framework as a public good, enabling individuals to seamlessly transact information between government, businesses and their peers.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhfernandez/?locale=es_ES">Diego Fernandez, Secretary of Innovation of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires</a>, emphasizes, “With this development, Buenos Aires becomes the first city in Latin America and one of the first in the world to integrate and promote this new technology and set the standard for how other countries in the region should use blockchain technology for the benefit of their people.”</p>



<p>Read this <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/09/28/buenos-aires-government-blockchain-birth-certificate-zero-knowledge-proofs/">Note to Diego Fernandez in Fortune Crypto</a> to learn more about this alliance and how it will be carried out.</p>



QuarkID decentralized digital trust protocol, and verification of private data



 QuarkID Roadmap 



<p>Beginning in October, residents of Buenos Aires will be able to download a QuarkID wallet to claim personal identification documents, including birth and marriage certificates. QuarkID will be available to all Argentine citizens and will eventually become mandatory nationwide. In November, documents such as proof of income and academic verifications will be available to obtain in QuarkID wallets. By the end of 2023, the government will establish QuarkID’s future roadmap and outline expansion milestones to initially provide its services to more than 3 million citizens.</p>



<p>Buenos Aires is leading this initiative, ushering in a new era of Internet through digital ownership. We hope that nations around the world will look to Argentina as an example of how Web3 identity can thrive at the government level.</p>

 What’s going on with Hollywood and AI or Artificial Intelligence? 



<p>Hollywood has a problem with artificial intelligence and the lack of humanity and individuality it breeds in the industry. The latest outcry from actors has underscored the importance of safeguarding authenticity in the film and television industry. In this context, the use of a decentralized Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) system can be important. This system helps to verify data and identities and to avoid scams and impersonations.</p>



<p>It is time to protect authenticity and identity in Hollywood, preserving the essence of human performance in the digital age. identities and, in the case of Hollywood, preserving the essence of human performance in the digital age.</p>



<p>A Self-Sovereign Identity system ensures reliable verification of data and identities, making a difference in the control of personal data. With Self-Sovereign Identity, we could avoid impersonalization and negative uses of Artificial Intelligence, such as scams and identity theft.</p>



<p>At Extrimian, we are working to promote more sovereign, decentralized and cybercrime-preventing models. Find out what we are doing at Extrimian to promote these models at Extrimian.io Products.</p>



 The Present Conflict and the Relevance of Authenticity: Hollywood and Artificial Intelligence 



<p>In Hollywood, actors who are authentic and convey genuine emotions are key to the success of movies and TV shows. However, the emergence of artificial intelligence has presented significant challenges in terms of impersonation and the generation of fraudulent content. The actor strike shows the concern about losing authenticity and being replaced by technology.</p>



 Data protection with SSI vs. AI 



 Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and the importance of authenticity. 



<p>How can this model solve the problems with breaching people’s identities?<br>SSI is a system that gives individuals full control over their digital identity and the data associated with it. Using SSI, actors and other individuals can create verifiable digital identities that support their authenticity in the entertainment industry. This system uses cryptography and blockchain to protect and validate information, preventing changes and forgeries.</p>



 Data security: Avoiding deception and forgery. 



<p>Using a decentralized, self-sovereign identity system in Hollywood could prevent scams and spoofing when validating identities. This system would enable the creation of verifiable digital certifications that would evidence the effective participation of participants in specific projects.</p>



<p>Such certifications could be employed by production studios and audiences to corroborate the veracity of content, fostering trust and preventing fraud.</p>



 Safeguarding authenticity in the Hollywood industry in the age of AI 



<p>In an age of technological advancements, it is important to address the entertainment industry’s challenges in terms of authenticity and truthfulness. What do you think is the effect of deepfakes and impersonations in the entertainment industry? In what ways do you think identity and data verification can help address these issues? What additional actions do you think should be put in place to safeguard the privacy and rights of actors?</p>



<p>What measures can we implement with respect to this? Self-Sovereign Identity as a tool for AI.<br>It is time to safeguard the authenticity of identities and, in the Hollywood context, maintain the essence of human performance in the digital age. The adoption of a Self-Sovereign Identity system can be crucial to ensure reliable verification of data and identities.</p>



<p>With SSI, we could prevent impersonation and harmful uses of AI, such as fraud and identity theft.</p>

<p>It’s been a busy few months at Ubisecure with a number of presentations at various events throughout Europe – some of which are available on-demand on our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/video-resources/" title="<span>Video Resources page</span>">Video Resources page</a>. It is great to be at the events, hearing from other industry experts, meeting new people, and not least getting direct feedback from live audiences as you present. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our core topics we’ve been presenting is getting great interest and engagement, and that is the notion of Identity Context.</p>
 What is Identity Context? 
<p>In business transactions, Identity Context helps to understand the parties involved in a transaction, including their roles, representative rights, responsibilities, and the nature of their engagement in a specific transaction.</p>
<p>Our work at Ubisecure is driven by our shared vision on the future of digital identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve written in depth about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/true-b2b-iam/" title="highly assured organisation identity">highly assured organisation identity</a>, and how the value of strongly authenticated individual identity is well known. However, it is the act of combining those two identity classes that gives actual context to the potential interaction and defines the rights of the individual. It is this resultant combined identity that defines the Identity Context and enables the presentation of an aggregated/generated set of rights that are appropriate in that context.</p>
 The Value of Context 
<p>We all use the value of Identity Context implicitly, often without realising it, but in those circumstances, it is almost always ‘manually’ or at best with administrative control.</p>
<p>In direct interactions we often add context automatically – consider introducing yourself to a new teacher at your child’s school: ‘Hi I’m X, mother/father of Y’. Adding the parental relationship immediately adds context to the interaction and context to your presented identity. Alternatively, it’s almost certain that the first slide of any presentation you have given has established your Identity Context with the audience by including your name and your job title.</p>
<p>The context allows bounds to be known in the scope of the interaction. Additionally, that context will define rights that the individual can assert because they are acting in that context.</p>
 The Complexity of Context 
<p>Identity Context has value, and we use it already. So, how complex can it be? In short, very complex.</p>
<p>Context is, well, contextual. For a given individual they will operate in many differing contexts at differing times; they may even operate in multiple contexts at the same time. When operating in multiple contexts these can be independent or combined.</p>
<p>Add to this that the rate of change of contexts can be high; either as demanded by external changes, or as demanded by the process itself. A great example of this is privilege application management, where best security practice calls for least privilege by default and shortest possible time of increased privilege. The broader context might not change for several hours, but within that there will be fast-moving point in time contexts (with associated rights) that need to take effect in real time.</p>
<p>The idea of fast-moving context actually meshes very well with the current ‘buzz’ around Zero Trust. Zero Trust is often described as ‘authenticate always, authenticate often’ but in implementation ‘authenticate’ becomes ‘authorise’, noting that you must be known (authenticated) to be authorised.</p>
<p>Authorising often allows for rights to be modified as time and context change.</p>
 The Risks of Context 
<p>Context defines rights, and often responsibilities. In the previous two examples the context was self-declared. Self-declaration is ‘efficient’, but also sits as the root cause for most fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Referring back to our vision, discussed at the start of this blog, for a moment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combine a highly assured organisation identity with a strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>We talk about a highly assured organisation identity and a strongly authenticated individual identity – we actually get most value when that individual identity is highly assured as well. But there is a third item that needs to have an assurance level – the ‘combination’.</p>
<p>The combination is the linkage between the two identity types. In the examples above, we have Parent and Employee as the specific linkage.</p>
<p>The linkage can be self-declared, verbally – “I am the parent of” – which is a low assurance declaration and therefore, a low assurance combination. Alternatively, that linkage can be verified, for example through a birth certificate and passports.</p>
<p>The assurance level of the linkage directly affects the value of the Identity Context.</p>
<p>For a given eco-system, the assurance levels of identities and linkage will be defined by a Governance Framework. We see a great example of this in the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/vlei/">vLEI</a> eco-system (based on verifiable credentials), defined by the GLEIF and supported by Ubisecure. The assurance levels of the organisation, individual and the linkage between the two are prescribed along with process definitions that will, when executed, preserve that assurance level.</p>
 In summary… 
<p>Identity Context enables significant value – we have seen and talked about a Northern European Government case study (see below) that realised a 99% saving from establishing a highly assured Identity Context and then allowing that to be delegated.</p>
<p>Knowing ‘who you are’ is not sufficient, we need to know the rights you have for the given ‘interaction’.</p>

 Why you should Regularly Review your Cyber Security 
 
<p>Cyber security is never done – you need to constantly work to improve your organization’s cyber security readiness.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive-wahlefeld-cyber-threat-landscape">Cyber adversaries never sleep</a> and the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80854/cyber-risks-from-china-how-contract-negotiations-can-mitigate-it-risks">geopolitical tensions across the world</a> are raising the cyber security threat levels.</p>
 
 Technology is evolving 
 
<p>The technology landscape is evolving creating new opportunities as well as new threats.&nbsp; Lange Language Models (LLMs) have evolved beyond what was thought practical only a few years ago and conversational Artificial Intelligence engines are now a commodity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations are adopting these to provide improved efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and a better connection with their customers, partners, and suppliers.&nbsp; However, while LLMs provide <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-lichtenthaler-human-and-artificial-intelligence">great opportunities</a>, they also bring <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/artificial-intelligence-cre23">new cyber threats</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI involves a new kind of development pipeline and current system development methodologies and tools are not yet adapted to this.&nbsp; Can you be sure of the provenance of your training data? Can you trust the shared LLM?&nbsp; Can you be sure that the deployed inference engine has not been poisoned?</p>
<p>LLMs represent an entirely new form of cloud workload.&nbsp; Current Cloud Native Application Platforms (CNAPP) and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81219/cloud-security-posture-management">Cloud Security Posture Management&nbsp; (CSPM)</a> do not cover these.</p>
<p>However, LLMs provide powerful capabilities to enhance the identification of cyber risks, the detection of active threats and the response to and recovery from cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations cannot afford to neglect the new opportunities but must prepare for these new threats. &nbsp;They must also exploit these new capabilities to improve their cyber security.</p>
 
 Standards and Regulations are Developing 
 
<p>The standards and best practice frameworks for cyber security are changing to respond to the increasing level of cyber threats and to incorporate the latest industry insights into how to best respond to these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 27001 The widely used information <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/27001">security standard ISO/IEC 27001</a> was updated in 2022. &nbsp;This new standard includes completely new controls covering - Threat intelligence, Information security for use of Cloud services, ICT readiness for business continuity, Physical security monitoring, Configuration management, Information deletion, Data masking, Data leakage prevention, Monitoring activities, Web filtering and Secure coding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization complies with ISO 27001 you will be required to update your controls to meet the new standard when next certified.&nbsp; Are your IT service providers and cloud services certified to the new standard?</p>
<p>NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) v2.0 &nbsp;- On <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2023/nist-releases-cybersecurity-framework-2-0-draft#:~:text=The%20CSF%202.0%20draft%20reflects,CSF%E2%80%94especially%20for%20creating%20profiles.">August 8, 2023</a>, NIST released a draft of the NIST CSF 2.0, making the most significant revision to the framework since its inception in 2014. The draft includes the CSF itself and a discussion draft of implementation examples. NIST intends to release the final version in early 2024 without issuing another version for public comments.</p>
<p>NIST’s CSF 2.0 version 2.0 introduces significant changes to the cybersecurity landscape to address evolving threats and make the framework more accessible to all types of organizations. The draft reflects community feedback and industry shifts, emphasizes the role of cybersecurity as a key enterprise risk, and expands its scope beyond critical infrastructure. The CSF now includes six core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, recover and the new “govern” function, which focuses on decision making in support of a cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>If your organization bases its approach to cyber security on this framework you need to plan for transition to the updated version.&nbsp; Are you ready for this transition?</p>
<p>EU NIS 2 - In the wake of increased cyber-attacks on national critical infrastructure, authorities around the world are imposing stricter requirements on organizations that their populations rely on for a wide range of essential services, which includes a wide and growing number of private companies that should be preparing now to meet their new obligations.</p>
<p>Notably the EU issued the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive in 2016</a>&nbsp;and the US saw the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a>&nbsp;on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity in 2021. But European authorities are now seeking to go even further with an update to the NIS Directive, known as NIS2, which is expected to go into force by the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, NIS2 has a much wider scope, going beyond the traditional critical national infrastructure providers to include a range of organizations that are essential for the normal functioning of society, which include both EU and non-EU organizations that will have to ensure their compliance in future.</p>
<p>Is your organization <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-digital-frontier-cre23">ready to comply with its obligations</a> under these new regulations.</p>
 
 Reviewing your cyber security 
 
<p>Business objectives, organizational best practices, and technologies are constantly evolving.&nbsp; It is essential to continuously review your organization’s performance in the light of these changes. To support these reviews, KuppingerCole provides Maturity Level Matrices that are specifically targeted to distinct areas of cyber security.</p>
<p>These are based on the five-point maturity scale formulated using the Carnegie Mellon Maturity Index (CMMI).&nbsp; Note that this is currently <a href="https://cmmiinstitute.com/products/cmmi/content-release">being enhanced</a> to &nbsp;include best practices for measuring capability and improving performance in the areas of people management, data management, and virtual work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assessing maturity based on this model is complex and to organizations to accomplish this task for cyber security <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80839/maturity-level-matrix-for-cyber-security">we publish two matrixes</a> that describe the key areas that must be considered when assessing cyber security maturity.&nbsp; There are two matrices one covering cyber security organizational and management maturity and the other technological maturity. These are summarized below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Cyber security organizational and management maturity</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: Cyber Security Technological maturity levels</p>
<p>KuppingerCole provides deep research into all the areas of cyber security.&nbsp; There also are many useful sessions from our cyberevolution event including how the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5421/1">hackers can exploit AI</a>, the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5430/1">regulatory challenges to the financial industry from DORA</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5469/1">practical advice on cloud security.</a></p>

<p>Let’s face it, organizations face many barriers to offering privacy products.</p>



<p>For companies that offer consumers pieces of the privacy and security puzzle, innovating and expanding offerings to adjacent – and in-demand – capabilities is often too expensive, takes too long, and falls outside of the core strength of the company offering the solution.</p>



<p>There’s a wide range of solutions that consumers “should” be using, but rarely are they motivated enough to do the hard work necessary to research, select, purchase, implement, and use all those solutions. Consequently, they use what they have been forced to use because of a security incident or they use the tools that come with their mainstream technology purchases or broader offerings.</p>



<p>Organizations playing in the privacy and online safety arena could benefit enormously from expanding their product offerings to cover adjacent areas – creating an easily acquired and easily implemented “one-stop-shop” where consumers get all they need from a brand they already trust.<br><br>Take these examples:</p>



 
 Insurance companies that offer identity theft insurance could package it with the technological solutions customers need to avoid falling victim in the first place. 



 Technology companies that offer cybersecurity capabilities, such as antivirus and malware protection, could add adjacent privacy and security offerings to complete the picture for consumers. 



 Vendors of specific privacy and online security services, such as credit monitoring, could boost customer loyalty and accelerate customer acquisition by also offering services their customers know they need but haven’t yet found an easy way to adopt. 



 Trusted general providers of goods and services, such as big box retailers and popular associations, could conveniently also offer online security products and services under the one roof, significantly increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br> 
 



 
 <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/11/removing-the-barriers-to-monetizing-privacy/">Read White Paper</a> 
 



 The challenge is real 



<p><br>Most organizations are not equipped to re-direct development resources to new products that fall outside of their established sweet spot. While they certainly could hire, ramp-up, and build these types of solutions from scratch, the time to a viable and profitable product offering may be too much.</p>



<p>But what if there was a way to add attractive and necessary privacy and online safety capabilities to existing products – or even as new products – quickly, easily, and completely and without the burden of developing them in house?</p>



 The solution is Sudo Platform 



<p>Anonyome Labs’ Sudo Platform is an API-first, developer-focused ecosystem that delivers the tools companies need to quickly and completely deliver to their customers the capabilities they need to protect and control their personal information while navigating the digital world. It is a powerful, modular, and quick-to-implement collection of the most important digital privacy and cyber safety tools for either mobile or desktop, and covering:</p>



 
 safe and private browsing including ad and tracker blocking and site reputation services 



 password management, automation, and security 



 virtual private network services 



 safe online commerce through virtual cards 



 a platform for decentralized identity including identity wallets, verifiable credentials services, and all the infrastructure necessary to make it real today 



 compartmentalization across all services so customers can easily partition their online interactions into purpose-specific identities (for example, one each for shopping, socializing, medical, travel, and so on). 
 







<p>Organizations use the set of scalable hosted services at the heart of Sudo Platform to quickly integrate these tools into any of their products or offerings and give their customers seamless access to them.</p>



<p></p>



 Sudo Platform is feature-packed 



<p>Developer-focused documentation</p>



<p>Thorough direction for how to build each of the Sudo Platform capabilities into applications are included in the <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">documentation site</a>.</p>



<p>API-first ecosystem</p>



<p>Sudo Platform APIs power next-generation customer apps with privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity capabilities, to empower organizations to quickly put privacy in their customers’ hands.</p>



<p>SDK source code</p>



<p>Mobile, web and desktop SDKs can be easily incorporated into an existing application or used as building blocks for new applications. Each SDK is built to run natively on all supported platforms, so they have the highest chance of compatibility with a vendor’s applications, independent of the frameworks and architecture they employ.</p>



<p>Available <a href="https://github.com/sudoplatform">SDKs via GitHub</a> include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Sudos SDK&nbsp; 



 Telephony SDK&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Virtual Cards SDK&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Secure ID Verification SDK&nbsp; 



 Email SDK&nbsp; 



 Site Reputation SDK&nbsp; 



 VPN SDK&nbsp; 



 Password Manager SDK.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Sample apps</p>



<p>Using a sample app is the fastest way to see how the Sudo Platform services work and the value they deliver. Vendors can easily explore the technology and imagine the potential for their products, either as an enhancement or brand new offering.</p>



<p>Sample apps are intended to be lightweight reference apps that demonstrate to application developers basic SDK capabilities. <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asudoplatform+sample">Sample iOS, Android, and web apps available include</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Telephony Sample App&nbsp; 



 Email Sample App&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Secure ID Verification Sample App&nbsp; 



 Password Manager Sample App&nbsp; 



 Ad and Tracker Blocker Sample App&nbsp; 



 Site Reputation Sample App. 
 



<p>Brandable apps and UI kits</p>



<p>For the fastest route to market, Sudo Platform offers brandable (white label) apps and UI kits. These enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications which can an organization can quickly brand and deliver to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms.</p>



<p>A UI kit gives access to libraries of advanced software modules with complex data and graphical flows that go beyond basic Sudo Platform service access, including:</p>



 
 complex business logic for data management and functional utilities that span one or more of the Sudo Platform services 



 UI kit, which includes widgets, screens and minor user flows that give recommended user experiences for a feature and can be integrated into your application. 
 



<p>Sudo Platform management console</p>



<p>The management console is where the organization manages administrative users and end users and gains critical insight into the analytics underlying a deployment and into ways to enhance the Sudo Platform experience. It gives insight into:</p>



 
 deployed Sudo Platform services 



 authentication 



 billing 



 entitlements. 
 



 Sudo Platform meets customers’ current and future needs

While collaboration can be one of those “suitcase words” that is full of different meanings depending on the person you ask, it’s an enduring part of most of our work lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Dedicated spaces enabled the kinds of fluid interaction and embodied cognition which, in turn, drives complex projects forward.</p><p>With today's increasingly distributed digital work environments and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/01/why-labor-economists-say-the-remote-work-revolution-is-here-to-stay.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">work from home</a> setups, can elements of dynamic in-person teamwork successfully be recreated online?</p><p>As video meetings and productivity suites become default remote work tools, teams strive to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/revolutionizing-the-workspace/">recreate collaborative dynamics digitally</a>. However, experts argue purely digital collaboration has inherent limits.</p><p>This article explores: lessons from physical group flow, key aspects to replicate collaboration digitally, remaining gaps, and the potential of immersive and distributed platforms still on the horizon, like Holochain.&nbsp;</p> The Magic of Physical Spaces <p>For Hailey Cooperrider, game designer and co-founder of collaborative consultancy <a href="https://amble.studio/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Amble</a>, physical spaces enable a “magic” that digital platforms struggle to recreate.&nbsp;</p><p>She argues spatial dynamics like rooms allow more holistic group participation than 2D screens, stating, “I think being in a space with the whiteboard and having room to collaborate together isn’t just for the creative piece. It’s about dealing with complexity.”</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how “literally, we think, with movement, with our hands, and with other parts of our bodies. And that cognition happens throughout the body.”&nbsp;</p><p>While this radiating, embodied cognition isn’t limited virtually, it certainly thrives in environments where teams can gather together physically.</p><p>When complex creativity and collaboration is required (such as in large groups), in-person spaces currently provide a fluidity that digital tools have difficulty replicating. Large meetings require quick back-and-forth communication among a large number of people — which is more time-consuming on the computer.&nbsp;</p> Bridging Physical &amp; Digital Workflows <p>When considering how to translate collaborative dynamics online, Cooperrider discusses the importance of preserving certain familiar artifacts digitally. For example, she notes that her team relies heavily on Trello's digital task boards to mimic physical sticky notes for project management.</p><p>“We love it, because it just smooths out what would normally be sticky notes, and allows us to bring our own meaning to the lists and the columns," she explains. Rather than prescribe complex new workflows, Trello provides flexibility for groups to organize work their own way.</p><p>Cooperrider also discusses how engineers often focus on operational challenges like reducing friction in workflows. However, she argues digital tools actually work best when preserving existing collaborative platforms and workflows that teams are already familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the Google Suite took traditional formats for documents, slides, and spreadsheets, and made them editable in real-time by multiple users online. Rather than adding complicated features to these tools, it kept them simple — and added the utility of collaboration.</p><p>Cooperrider concludes that "the most revolutionary, powerful, and most popular collaboration tool, it’s the Google Suite.”</p><p>While new technologies open new possibilities, they must also integrate the traditional techniques teams have relied on for years, in order to maximize adoption and usage. The future likely involves blending physical “magic” with virtual capabilities.</p> People-First Tools in a Hybrid Future <p>While digital collaboration tools have delivered immense progress, the next horizons explore decentralized and distributed models giving users more control, as with Holochain. Rather than enforce rigid conformity, the ideal future blends customizable peer-to-peer frameworks with thoughtfully designed physical spaces.</p><p>Tools must smooth, not obstruct, the rituals sustaining teams. And digital interactive spaces should spark the embodied cognition inherent to human collaboration. As remote and hybrid work expand, integrating the digital connectivity teams need with the in-person magic they crave is essential.</p><p>The frontier of collaboration technology puts people before platforms, deepening what is uniquely precious about gathering in rooms with resonant virtual capabilities. In the end, innovation emerges from groups in flow — whether particles across cables or shoulder-to-shoulder around whiteboards</p>

<p>In the wake of the hack at MOVEit and far too many other organizations this year, the secure, user-controlled, privacy-preserving benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) make it a critical component of a modern identity and access management (IAM) architecture.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1248857/moveit-carnage-continues-with-over-2600-organizations-and-77m-people-impacted-so-far.html">one breach</a> alone has impacted 2,620 organizations—including Genworth, antivirus providers Avast and Norton, and the US Department of Energy—and 77.2 million people worldwide. The sheer volume of credentials and personal information compromised through downstream attacks is yet to be determined. But the incident and so many others like it drive home one of the biggest challenges of the digital age.</p>
<p>While centralized IAM consolidated the storage and management of identity data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily, it also created a single point of failure that cybercriminals continue to exploit to gain access to all the resources those credentials are authorized to access. Call us crazy, but at 1Kosmos, we believe a big part of preventing threat actors from stealing and weaponizing credentials and personally identifiable information (PII) is to avoid centrally storing them in the first place.</p>
 IAM Private &amp; Permissioned: Why DLT Is a BFD 
<p>In Parts <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">2</a> and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/ditching-the-feds-why-decentralized-digital-identity-is-key-to-effective-iam/">3</a> in this series, we look at how the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">1Kosmos architecture</a> provides a reliable and secure way to verify the identity of users and<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/"> biometrically authenticate</a> them via decentralized digital identity (DID) mechanisms in our BlockID solution—including a reusable <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">digital identity wallet</a>. The next pillar of our architectural advantage is distributed ledger technology for providing a private and permissioned blockchain that eliminates the centralized PII honeypot for good.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology has several security features that provide a proven way to manage and maintain digital property rights. Think user-controlled data, peer-to-peer, cryptographically secure sharing without an administrative intermediary, and an immutable digital “chain of custody” containing a detailed digital audit log of all user authentications. That makes it an ideal technology for managing and protecting users’ digital identity wallets, which can store a wide range of information—personal details, legal and educational credentials, financial accounts, digital health records, and more. The private and permissioned distributed ledger within BlockID delivers several key advantages, including the following.</p>
<p>Privacy by Design</p>
<p>Without a centralized administration authority, our private and permissioned blockchain technology gives individuals sole access and control of all personally identifiable information. This privacy-by-design approach enables end users to view and approve or reject the sharing of any and all information requested by online services or systems they seek to access. All PII is encrypted end-to-end, so it’s never exposed. Users approve or reject sharing requests directly with the applications and systems they connect to—without a third-party intermediary accessing their data. No external public key server, host messaging server, or other entity can access the keys or plaintext messages.</p>
<p>An Immutable Audit Trail</p>
<p>Like a public blockchain, our private and permissioned ledger retains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all events, enabling visibility to all logins, access attempts, information updates, and shared information related to a digital identity. This private ledger acts as a closed network where information from separate organizations or lines of business can be stored separately—each with its own private ledger. This extraordinary level of audit and visibility helps prevent unauthorized access and fraudulent transactions, providing a high level of assurance for the identity behind the device.</p>
<p>Industry Certification for Unrivaled Performance</p>
<p>We built the first (and only) architecture designed to support and exceed the industry’s strictest standards for security and convenience. Because BlockID follows the W3C specifications and is certified to <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a>, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>, it uses public-private key cryptography to record and access all information. The private keys are stored in the secure enclave or TPM chip of the endpoint or the user’s device, which can be secured to the very highest digital standard of IAL2/AAL2 supported by NIST—ensuring credentials never leave the user’s device and are never stored on a server, eliminating the risk of credentials theft, replay attacks, or even user tracking. The next highest level of IAL3/AAL3 is generally reserved for human verification but can be achieved via agent-assisted authentication through 1Kosmos partners.</p>
<p>Security That Gives the PII Honeypot the Heave-Ho</p>
<p>In addition to the public-private key security used for encryption, signing, and making relationships with other parties afforded by the certifications above, 1Kosmos LiveID biometrics are certified to <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta DEA EPCS</a> specifications, providing assurance of liveness and achieving a false match rate of less than 0.1% at 95% confidence interval. Best of all, our private and permissioned ledger ensures there’s no central honeypot of user PII for hackers to target—further defeating the risk of ransomware and data breaches.</p>
<p>Support for a Wide Array of IAM Use Cases</p>
<p>With irrefutable proof of identity and an immutable, tamper-proof audit log of all updates and access attempts, our private and permissioned blockchain gives organizations the speed and agility they need to focus on building customer loyalty and capture market share from less tech-savvy rivals. In the conclusion of this series, we’ll look at how the 1Kosmos architecture enables reusable, verified credentials across a variety of IAM use cases—from “inferred” identity based on email address or device, to cross-referencing biometrics with government-issued forms of ID, to the very highest levels of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) mandates, and more.</p>

  <p>At Ignite 2022, we announced the general availability of Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA) as part of Microsoft’s commitment to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>. Based on our experience working with government customers, PIV/CAC cards are the most common authentication method used within the federal government. While valuable for all customers, the ability to use X.509 certificate for authentication directly against Entra ID is particularly critical for federal government organizations using PIV/CAC cards and looking to easily comply with the Executive Order 14028 requirements as well as customers who want to migrate from a federated server like Active Directory Federated Server to Entra ID for CBA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, we’ve added many new features and enhancements, which made CBA available on all platforms, including mobile, with support for certificates on devices as well as external security keys like YubiKeys. Customers now have more control and flexibility to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group and select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multi-factor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vimala Ranganathan, Product Manager on Microsoft Entra, will now talk about how these new features will help in your journey toward phishing-resistant MFA.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>--  &nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello everyone,   &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m Vimala from the Microsoft Entra PM team, and I’m excited to walk you through all the new features and enhancements to CBA in detail. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA username bindings CBA added support for three remaining username bindings and is now at parity with on-premises Active Directory. The three bindings that are being added are: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 IssuerAndSerialNumber  &nbsp; 
 IssuerAndSubject  &nbsp; 
 Subject Only  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The username binding policy allows admins to customize how Entra ID will match the certificate being presented by the user with their user account in Entra ID. By default, we map Principal Name in the subject Alternative Name (SAN) attribute of the certificate to UserPrincipalName in the user object. An admin can override the default and create a custom mapping. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Authentication policy rules help determine the strength of authentication as either single-factor or multi-factor.&nbsp;Unlike other authentication methods available in Entra ID, which are either always, CBA is capable of being either. We like to refer to this as CBA being a multi-factor capable authentication method, and the authentication policy rules allow the admin to configure protection levels to determine when Entra ID should consider a certificate to be single-factor or multi-factor. Multiple custom authentication binding rules can be created to assign default protection level for certificates based on the certificate attributes (Issuer or Policy OID or by combining the Issuer and OID).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA Affinity Binding refers to certificate attributes used for validating a certificate for user authentication. As we introduced earlier, there are several ways a certificate can be bound or matched to a user object. Some methods rely on properties of a user’s certificate that are easily reusable. This reusability characteristic is the key indicator to whether a particular user binding method is High (strong) or Low (weak) affinity. For example, implementing a user binding based on SAN Principal Name would be low affinity, whereas a user binding policy based on Issuer+SerialNumber would be high affinity. Entra ID allows admins to set affinity binding at tenant level, as well as create custom rules to use high affinity or low affinity mapping for covering many potential scenarios our customers have in use today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA as second factor will now support CBA as one of the factors to get multifactor authentication (MFA) to access Entra resources. More info at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-certificate-based-authentication-technical-deep-dive#mfa-with-single-factor-certificate-based-authentication">MFA with CBA</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>First factor&nbsp;</p>


<p>Second factor&nbsp;</p>


<p>MFA&nbsp;</p>




<p>CBA with single-factor strength&nbsp;</p>


<p>Passwordless Phone Sign in (PSI)&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CBA as Most Recently Used (MRU) method is set once a user authenticates successfully using CBA, and the user's MRU authentication method is set to CBA. Next time, when the user enters their UPN and clicks&nbsp;Next, the user is taken to the CBA method directly and need not select&nbsp;‘Use the certificate or smart card.’ To reset the MRU method, the user needs to cancel the certificate picker, click&nbsp;‘Other ways to sign in,’ and select another method available to the user and authenticate successfully.

<p>Digital wallets have emerged as a preferred payment method in the Middle East and Africa, and customers are willing to leave their wallets at home rather than their phones. Offering digital payment solutions and pursuing a digital transformation is key for banks to stay competitive.</p>
<p>On November 7, 2023, we hosted a <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/593634?utm_source=Entrust&amp;utm_medium=brighttalk&amp;utm_campaign=593634">webinar</a> with Izabela Morriss, Vice President of Global Channel Sales &amp; Tech Partnerships at CR2, and Andy Cease, Director of Product Marketing Financial Issuance at Entrust. During this engaging thought leadership discussion, we gained valuable insights into the payment preferences of cardholders in the Middle East and Africa, as well as the challenges financial institutions face in offering a digital-first customer experience.</p>
<p>Here is what we heard from them:</p>
 
 Adoption of digital payments in the Middle East and Africa 
 
 
<p>Contactless payments are rapidly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. People love the convenience and speed of making payments with contactless cards and digital wallets.</p>
<p>This drive for convenience is advancing the convergence of speed and simplicity, alongside elevated security measures. Contactless payments, appreciated for their convenience and speed, are quickly gaining popularity in the Middle East and Africa. Globally, demand is also increasing, but it’s particularly flourishing in this region.</p>
<p>In a 2022 McKinsey report, 60% of global respondents said they prefer to leverage mobile wallets for their digital payments. With an 80%-90% smartphone penetration, it’s no wonder customers in the Middle East are seeking out seamless digital payment experiences (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-the-middle-east">McKinsey, The future of payments in the Middle East, 2022</a>). Offering digital payment options is a way for banks and credit unions to answer this demand, differentiate themselves, and be perceived as modern and innovative leaders. If they don’t, they’ll be left behind and viewed as archaic and out of touch.</p>
<p>With quick and secure transactions, customers can easily pay anytime, anywhere, without the need for cash or physical cards. Digital cards are especially relevant for in-store use, but near field communication (NFC) payment from the banking app is a way of answering the need for instant and contactless digital payments.</p>
<p>Izabela from CR2 explained that they see a strong demand for customer-centric digital payment solutions. In both the Middle East and Africa, customers are showing an increasing interest in different payment solutions. They want innovative options and are looking at what is being proposed outside of the region. Customers are seeking secure, convenient, seamless digital payment experiences that align with their diverse requirements, be it for e-commerce, mobile apps, or in-store transactions. This shift highlights the urgency for banks to evolve and cater to these changing needs.</p>
<p>We see the rise of financial inclusion in Africa, characterized by its young population, is at the forefront of the continent’s mobile money transformation. This rise is underscored by a high penetration of mobile devices. Eighty four percent of internet users in Kenya used their mobile phones for payments, mirroring a similar trend where 60% of internet users in Nigeria and across Africa did the same. In 2021, East Africa reported 296 million registered mobile money accounts (<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/27017/mobile-payment-in-africa/">2021 Statista Global Consumer Survey</a>).</p>
<p>These statistics highlight the profound impact mobile payments have on driving financial inclusion, particularly in Africa where there’s a need to reach the unbanked. This trend also presents a significant marketing opportunity for financial institutions. The push toward digital payments in the Middle East and Africa is largely driven by the intent to support financial inclusion. Facilitating banking services through digital channels allows even the unbanked and underserved populations to actively participate in the financial landscape, paving the way for empowered communities and fostering economic growth. In a world where 1.4 billion individuals remain unbanked (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services">World Bank Global Findex 2021 database</a>), the need for a significant shift is necessary.</p>
<p>In Africa, Izabela observes a market dynamic driven by the goal of reaching the unbanked population. There’s a noticeable trend of transitioning directly from mobile phone operator/money transfer services to mobile wallets, bypassing traditional physical payment cards.</p>
<p>The digital-first transformation in the Middle East stems from a demand for convenience, security, and a desire for financial institutions to provide a seamless customer journey. Mobile banking enables them to do that.</p>
 
 
 Why financial institutions want to offer contactless payments and digital card issuance 
 
 
<p>The innovation of tokenization has made digital card issuance possible. Banks want to innovate, keep their customers, and enhance convenience for their customers, ensuring satisfaction at every turn. Security is top of mind for cardholders as well as banks.</p>
<p>Izabela explains that banks in regions such as Ethiopia or Nigeria are particularly sensitive to questions of sustainability. Using tokenization for digital card issuance allows them to reduce their plastic usage, aligning with their sustainability goals.</p>
<p>The economy in Africa is still very cash-driven: 90% of transactions are made with cash (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-future-of-payments-in-africa">McKinsey, The future of payments in Africa, 2022</a>). There is a huge opportunity for banks to shift from cash-based transactions and pave the way for digital transactions. Again, this will also allow them to promote financial inclusion and transparency. Many countries have not fully adopted the physical payment card, and they are expected to skip the issuance of physical cards and directly adopt digital cards. Banks must be ready for this change. Izabela expects that digital wallets will dominate the payment landscape within the next two years. Several African central banks, such as those in Rwanda and Nigeria, are driving a vision of a cashless economy.</p>
<p>Differences in demand can be observed across diverse age groups. However, banks recognize that to stay competitive, they must offer very targeted, personalized customer journeys that cater to the varying demands of all demographics. Offering more capabilities within the mobile banking app ensures that it is at the core of the bank-customer relationship.</p>
<p>Banks can expect increased usage of their card portfolio, earlier activations, and broader outreach to diverse demographics, ultimately leading to higher customer satisfaction. Additionally, cost-saving incentives serve as an important motivator compelling financial institutions to provide digital payment solutions.</p>
<p>Moreover, traditional banks are increasingly feeling the competitive pressure from emerging players like neobanks, which continue to obtain banking licenses, compelling traditional institutions to remain relevant.</p>
 
 
 Challenges for banks to implement this 
 
 
<p>Answering the very diverse demands of cardholders has been made possible by innovations in the payment space during the last few years.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, security is top of mind, both for financial institutions and cardholders. Tokenized cards offer the highest level of security when it comes to payments. Andy from Entrust explained that tokenization enables the consumer to take control again, as the tokens are device-bound or market-bound, offering cardholders a very convenient experience. Tokenization technology, championed by major schemes like Visa and Mastercard, is a necessary prerequisite for the issuance of digital cards. To give a quick explanation: Tokenization substitutes sensitive card data with unique tokens tied to specific devices and use cases. This ensures secure transactions while enabling banks to minimize the risk of fraud. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/tokenization-enabling-the-intersection-of-data-security-and-exceptional-user-experiences/">This article</a> explains the functioning and value of tokenization more in detail.</p>
<p>And of course, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/entrust-digital-card-solution">digital card issuance</a> allows financial institutions to offer a digital-first user and payment experience.</p>
<p>While banks in the Middle East and Africa now want to take active steps toward a digital transformation, they also realize that it is not as simple as it may seem. They want to be innovative, but do not know where to start. Most banks struggle to combine a seamless, digital-first, innovative payment experience with the highest level of security, while keeping integration and maintenance of such a solution lightweight.</p>
<p>Izabela notes that most banks are starting to have a good understanding of tokenization; current operational discussions are around identifying the correct next steps and implementing technology for the benefit of the cardholder. Addressing legacy technology and infrastructure presents a significant challenge for banks. How can they leverage their existing resources to enable a digital wallet effectively? What role does the card management system play? Which tokenization partner should they choose? How can the digital wallet be embedded within the existing banking application?</p>
 
 
 Technology alliance partnership between CR2 and Entrust 
 
 
<p>We know that the digital revolution is here, and that banks need to transform their service model to meet the expectations for convenient banking that offers anywhere, anytime access. This is especially true in the Middle East and Africa. To resolve those challenges together, CR2 and Entrust have forged a partnership. The technology alliance between CR2 and Entrust gives CR2 customers confidence in the security of their digital payments while also providing user-friendly, seamless digital-first experiences.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar: Is this the right time to invest in Identity and Access Management? This week Jesse Kurtto from Ubisecure has joined us to answer this question and discuss the current economic situation. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Today’s guest is Jesse Kurtto. Jesse’s career has gradually arched from the Wild West world of finance, to his current position as a Data Protection Officer and Data Scientist at Ubisecure. Learning Program before learning to read Finnish and visiting 25 countries before 25. He is no stranger to exploring unchartered waters and discovering connections that others might miss. Surrounded by a delicate balance of the latest technology and dozens of carefully tended houseplants, his secret hobby is writing to his beloved snail mail friends across the world. Welcome Jesse.</p>
<p>Jesse: Thank you for the invite, Oscar. Nice to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great having you, Jesse, definitely. We’re going to have a super interesting conversation about the market in Digital Identity and Identity and Access Management.</p>
<p>First of all, we always want to hear more about our guests. So please tell us a bit about yourself and your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. So, like many or even most of us in the digital identity field, I actually never really actively sought to be a specialist, IAM specialist, on purpose. And my personal background is actually nothing technology even, but in finance and investing more specifically. So, a chance encounter and I liked the people who interviewed me and decided to stay for a while, and that while has been over seven years now. And I’m still learning something new every day, checking out how we really the world of digital identity like and frankly haven’t ever regretted decision. No two days have really been the same and the field continues to evolve and develop quite a bit every year.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent and definitely hearing at Ubisecure, we definitely appreciate having this – well call it, like a blend of knowledge – the financial market, not lesser than what you bring with the security and digital identity knowledge, very practical knowledge you also had. So, it’s always super interesting having those conversation with you.</p>
<p>And for the first time here on the podcast, we are going to have that, a bit more financial touch on that – What is coming, especially in this well this year, and I think also the years to come. The previous year and the year to come I think, we are already end of 2023 in which – well the financial situation is not good we’re going to talk about. But of course, no matter how the economy is, the companies organisation has to protect their services, have to upgrade the services, maintain them, so they have to invest some money in that.</p>
<p>So, from the perspective of companies who today need to upgrade their digital capabilities, what would you say is the piece of the current macroeconomic situation that they should know well? So that was at least what they should know well, from what is happening now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Well, first of all, we all know the macroeconomic situation hasn’t really been dancing on the roses over the past few years. But first, we had a massive shock with the COVID pandemic starting from spring 2020. Then we got massive economic stimulus to recover from that slump. And right after we were starting to climb up, then the war in Ukraine saw that all kinds of new problems everywhere around the world seemed to emerge just within three or four months.</p>
<p>The energy uncertainty in Europe and the economy went down the drain, and macroeconomic in quite a difficult situation here in Europe. But we would actually want to have some kind of stimulus in order to recover. But at the same time, we are suffering from quite persistently high inflation, which makes any kind of stimulus package basically equal to pouring more gasoline to the flames.</p>
<p>So, the European bank is really between a rock and a hard place here. And I can only look over the Atlantic to the States and be very jealous how they are able to both fight inflation and with high interest rates, five and a half percent this talking and meanwhile still have a blisteringly red-hot labour market all but there.</p>
<p>So, my first point would be that not all markets are equal. And the second important point is that now is actually a really great time to invest in any digital capabilities, including digital identities. Because now, we are in the middle of a small recession in Europe and investing in recession has historically been the very best time to invest in growth.</p>
<p>And if we think for a while, it actually makes perfect sense. After all, the alternative is to invest in the middle of a growth season when everybody else wants to invest in growth as well. Pushing prices even higher and reducing the availability of experts to help with these transformation projects. But now it’s still for a while kind of a buyer’s market.</p>
<p>So best time to invest in future growth is now.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, time to invest is now.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Okay. So, let’s go into what – because there are many things that the company can invest now and many things that many companies might need. But if you were one of the – chief executive, like CISO, or someone who is top decision makers in companies and there has to be some budget for digital identity. Thinking of – first of all broadly. Broadly but in digital identity, what would be the most important products that today would be the top priority for buying now?</p>
<p>Jesse: Today I would say that the absolute top priority would be – to establish really low friction user journeys from the very beginning account registration to the actual purchase, including solid online self-service. And now this low friction user journey is no way exclusive with security or compliance, but it is actually reaping the benefits of digitalisation. Digitalisation is ongoing, it’s accelerating, it’s unstoppable.</p>
<p>So, the question is for every organisation – should they try to fight this change to the last or embrace it and be among the first to actually reap its benefits. It’s actually interesting because my background in finance, the many finance sector operators were among the first to embrace digital identities, but they kind of stopped it halfway there; “Okay, we can build self-service portals for our users, but for many, many procedures we still require hand signed paper documents being sent via physical mail.” And this is really only reaping a very small part of the benefits of digitalisation. So, there is plenty to go.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Interesting what you say in finance services. That’s correct. For reasons of security had to be always in the latest of technology for security. But some of the process has been, as you say, very old fashioned like the old school, many paper fax I think still use or cheques. So, these kind of.</p>
<p>Jesse: Oh yes, those ones to.</p>
<p>Oscar: Still alive.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And it truly hurts the user experience a lot. It even causes direct missed opportunities. Let’s say new bond is coming to a market and you wish to buy a piece of it and participate. But if it takes three or four days just to do all the paperwork, then the opportunity has simply passed.</p>
<p>Oscar: And indeed, the price changed completely. Okay, so you say that the top is to – the user journey has to be digitalised. So, what is the category of products that address that?</p>
<p>Jesse: Would say a real CIAM system would be the one to go here, and not try to build the user journey from, let’s say 4 to 6-point solutions and then somehow glue them together. I think the best solution would be an IAM solution that’s designed for a whole user journey from the scratch and not something homemade or batched together.</p>
<p>Because when business grows, as it will eventually grow, no recession will last forever. And to user numbers pick up and suddenly there’s a nightmare of issues of having 4 to 6 different vendors and trying to keep their products up and running with ever increasing user numbers. And that again, is doing digitalisation the wrong way, if I may say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. CIAM being – so how, well the evolution of the more broadly speaking, Identity and Access Management. Maybe you can give us an overview of that evolution of the Identity and Access Management, what – how we started and what we have today.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, that’s a very interesting topic. Through the IAM are from big enterprise internal needs at once to employee numbers just grow to a certain level, they can’t be managed with excel sheets or pen and paper before that. But these kind of internal IAM solutions scale and fit really badly for end customer facing journeys. Internal users can always be taught how to use some kind of system, even if it’s not immediately logical or it feels unwieldy.</p>
<p>But for the customers, it’s not realistic to expect that they would spend tens of minutes or even hours to learn how to use some kind of system to log in. And no, they would simply instead put down their laptops, pick up the phone and call your customer service. So, it will actually just cost you more money to have this kind of system.</p>
<p>And now, in the past ten years, there have been massive uptake of different CIAM systems. And lately, let’s say after the pandemic, it’s interesting to see that now the full circle is coming back towards internal users with remote working. Remote working, different kind of partnerships, there are more kind of internal and kind of external users than ever, and trying to keep these as fully separate groups is very challenging.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. So, what about the investment of a company in Identity and Access Management? So what does that imply if the company does not have even, let’s say, a first personal CIAM or open source, something that they started, if they if the company really doesn’t, which actually to me surprise me that, you discover companies don’t have it, don’t have it, almost anything like identity access management and they are looking for some solutions or they are or they know that they need it. Maybe the decision has not come.</p>
<p>So why would you say is important for the buyers to know about the product, the Identity and Access Management product?</p>
<p>Jesse: That’s an interesting detail what you said that there’s still about 20-25% of companies in Europe that do not have any kind of Identity and Access Management system in place. So, one could argue that every IAM’s companies’ worst competitor is doing nothing. But to the question at hand, I’d say scalability is one very important thing, and compliance. If one doesn’t have any kind of identity management system in place, then it’s extremely hard to tell where and by who are the user identities actually stored.</p>
<p>And of course, that is a massive no in the eyes of the GDPR and this kind of adventures just don’t usually end up well. So first job would be to map out how many identities there are in the first place, how it has evolved over the recent quarters and where they are located, how many systems actually are connected, including partners, including systems like let’s say payroll providers, insurance providers, and usually the number is quite surprising. It can often be more than ten individual systems.</p>
<p>And now managing all these identities from a single centralised place is frankly a godsend compared to trying to manage this and plus sprawling network identity some here, some there. And of course, it also brings centralised identity management, also brings massive security benefits. For example, if you wish to revoke the access for, let’s say some external consultants that have already finished their projects, you only have one place to do it or you can even automate it.</p>
<p>But if the identities are in ten systems, 15 systems, then it’s really easy to forget just one. And who knows, maybe five, ten years later, one of those passwords will get breached and now the attacker gets to your system for free.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, what is normally called silos, identity silos. Having so many data repositories and it’s -through the years it’s easy to forget at least couple of those are forgotten but they are still there somewhere in there in some machine, in some server. So, the data is there.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And of course, I’ve heard many times the counterargument that it’s not wise to put all eggs in one basket, but when it comes to information security, we as the defenders must secure every single system that we use. But the attacker only needs to find one weak system to exploit.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, exactly. They can just find the forgotten one, the one that nobody remembers that.</p>
<p>So, what the company – the buyers should ask for a technology vendor? So, for a CIAM vendor? So, what are the most important things that’s should be – has to be asked to the vendors?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would ask them to demonstrate the self-service capabilities first. What exactly the users can and cannot accept less without external help? Meaning customer service assistance. Because that sets quite stringent limits on the benefits of digitalisation. And of course, all the usual user journeys should be handled by the system automatically. So, I would guess that any IAM project touches deeply.</p>
<p>So, I would first describe the challenges we are facing. And then I’d ask vendor to explain, just in plain English, that – how does the solution work and how does it actually solve the challenge that we just presented? And after all, one should never invest in anything that one doesn’t understand.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to address early in any IAM project is to what is actually included in the price and what isn’t. In order to actually accurately measure the TCO and how it would evolve as internal and external user base grows. And for example, there are many vendors out that charge ten to even hundred times for internal users compared to external users, and that’s not usually put on a large print on the front page.</p>
<p>And finally, I would discuss any coming changes in legislation because I would be very interested to know whether any changes will be covered under the current proposal or will it occur additional project and additional costs in the future. Change is, after all, inevitable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think that’s very important. We know in – in the European Union it’s coming the digital wallet that’s going to come in. Well, how many years do you predict at this moment?</p>
<p>Jesse: I’m optimistic and say late ‘24 launch for some countries. ‘25 mass adoption and hopefully organisational identities soon after.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and that’s something that I think very few people would argue that that will be – that will not have some considerable success because there’s a lot of time invested in people preparing all these new standards in this part of the evolution. What we have been seeing before with Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), the wallet itself is something that is already becoming very popular in the commercial side. So that will come in.</p>
<p>Similarly, in other geographies, there will be similar initiatives, there will be new regulations. So that, through all this, the vendor has to offer that, has to tell whether we offer or not. So that’s definitely a good, good aspect you mentioned.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes. And the commission has made clear goals here to avoid repeating the mistakes of the eIDAS 1.0, that was supposed to bring cross-border digital identities to Europe. Well, we all know that it was a commercial failure, but they have really learned from that, and I have great hopes for the EUDI. Both for personal identities and for organisational identities, and especially for the latter one.</p>
<p>I believe that the market is currently suffering from a kind of chicken and egg problem here, that everybody’s waiting for cross-border organisational identities and not building services because they aren’t here yet. So, we might see the floodgates open in the late 2020s.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I also believe that as a lot will change in more or less like the, as you say in the next 12-24 months is going to change a lot, in a good way I believe. So definitely exciting to be at this moment. We’ve been talking a lot about Identity and Access Management, other aspects, other type of technology that are also in the minds of the executives who are going to upgrade their technologies. We hear a lot about passwords in the last year. Well, ‘cryptocurrencies’ is getting a bit more quiet. Today we hear a lot about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Would you recognise some technology that is actually underrated, that not many people are talking about? But these business buyers should be aware, because the impact will be even bigger than those buzzwords. So, what would you say?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would say that the coming EUDI and its principle of Self-Sovereign Identities is something that might cause quite big ripples in the identity landscape. The very basic idea that it’s the end user themselves who collect attributes and control to whom and when they release those attributes. That that is very different from the usual data repository centric view that – okay, we have this database, and we control everything here. Everything is set in stone.</p>
<p>But when the end users actually decide which attributes to release and which not. Then one can’t take for granted that, “Okay, we always have every single field in our database field. Every user record looks similar in a structural level.” That is no longer true and that might cause some changes.</p>
<p>As for technology, I have great hopes for machine learning and especially how it can help accomplish not zero trust, no. But zero friction user journeys. And I don’t mean a strong AI that is still decades into future, if ever. But simple things like; is the user using a different device to log in or the same device as before? And so on.</p>
<p>For example, I have a recently having a quick holiday in the US, and I was frankly quite shocked when I logged into some financial services – using a completely different device that I had never used, on completely opposite time of the day. I was even physically located on a different continent. And no MFA prompts, nothing. Just inputting my password, I was in.</p>
<p>And that’s a lot of missed risk management there, for both parties. For me as an end user and for the financial service provider. And I believe this is something that will change sooner or later. And of course, I would like, as an end user, for this to work for the opposite way as well. That if I’m logging in using the same device, about the same time of the day, from same city that I’ve done it for hundreds and hundreds of times – then perhaps I could be spared the MFA fatigue and just get in with my password managers embraced password.</p>
<p>Oscar: The technology doesn’t bother you when you are in the habitual way of interacting with, let’s say, the banks.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yeah, exactly. It should take always the context of the transaction into account. And frankly, what I would like to see many companies to do is; do a more thorough risk analysis at what they are actually trying to defend against. I can give a real-world example.</p>
<p>About a month ago, I drove to a gas station, put my car to charge, decided that I’ll have a coffee there. Opened the app and saw, hey, there’s an offer for a coffee and a doughnut €1 off. Great.</p>
<p>Okay, it seems that first, I needed to update the app to actually buy. Okay, well, I’ll do it.</p>
<p>Then they wanted to add the credit card directly to the app, alright. Got an MFA from that.</p>
<p>Then when I actually wanted to make the purchase, I got yet another prompt and confirmation, this time from my bank. That – ‘Hey, in order to buy this €3.50 product, would you please update our app again, and use it as an MFA to confirm this purchase’. For the third time.</p>
<p>And by that time, I already got notification that, ‘hey, your car has charged’, and my coffee was called by then and left it there.</p>
<p>So that was the opposite of Zero Friction. That was more of a zero trust like game. But the security solution that’s very fitting for, let’s say, authorising nuclear missile launch, is very different than the security that’s needed to confirm a €3 coffee purchased at the gas station.</p>
<p>And as discussed earlier, I believe this problem stems – that solution was built from very small parts and every individual vendor only looked after their own interest, only want to save their back in case of any kind of misuse. But nobody took a step backwards to actually see; What we are trying to defend against here? What is the attack vector here? That okay, somebody misuses this app and clones this coupon and gets two coffees and doughnuts for a €3 each. Okay, so how much is an attacker willing to put time and money into such attack? I guess nobody stop to think about it. And as a result, the whole user journey was just failure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, complete failure indeed. Very good way to bring back the very first thing you said, User Journey. Yeah, that’s a specific example how things can happen. Sounds like a marvellous opportunity, not to get a deal nice and then becomes complete failure.</p>
<p>Jesse, one final question I would like to ask you is – for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Jesse: I would dream that every executive would dedicate one day, one whole day to actually be an end user for a day and go through their company’s entire flow. All the way from account registration to actually purchasing to product or service that they’re selling. And if there’s time trying out things like forgotten password resets. And then the next day repeating the same procedure for the top competitor and even more importantly, their newest competitor, because that is where the threat of digitalisation is coming.</p>
<p>Oscar: Going to be very revealing.</p>
<p>Jesse: Yes, and it’s important to go through the entire journey. If one, simply takes it piecemeal. And of course, every piece may look perfectly fine. Okay, this works like this. It has confirmations like this. Great. Next piece. Next piece, Next piece. All right. Everything looks fine. But then actually going through the process, one gets hit by four or five different confirmations, forced updates, all kinds of non-user-friendly things, and that won’t fly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely a very good experiment, actionable idea. Absolutely. Well, thank you very much, Jesse for telling us all this about the – how the companies and why companies should invest in the digital identity and why today.</p>
<p>Let us know why people would like to get in touch with you or follow you or learn more about what we are doing. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Jesse: All right. Thank you. First, I would ask everybody to check out <a href="http://www.ubisecure.com/" title="ubisecure.com">ubisecure.com</a>, and see how we are approaching these problems on the market. And if needed, I would be very happy to have a chat, over a virtual or real coffee, and I can be contacted at <a href="mailto:jesse.kurtto@ubisecure.com">jesse.kurtto@ubisecure.com</a> at anytime.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>With our first speakers release, we are letting loose four tech experts from the finance industry. Despite some of the industry-specific challenges, IAM and cybersecurity professionals from finance can offer valuable insights and lessons learned that can be translated to other sectors seeking to enhance their identity and access management practices.</p>
<p>The relevance of identity management in finance</p>
<p>Identity management is integral to financial services for various reasons. Robust systems enhance security by verifying and authenticating user identities, employing methods like multi-factor authentication and biometrics to prevent unauthorized access and reduce fraud. Compliance with regulatory requirements, such as KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (anti-money laundering), is ensured through effective identity management.</p>
<p>Building customer trust is another crucial aspect, because secure identities foster confidence in engaging with digital financial services. Personalized offerings based on accurate customer data, operational efficiency, and streamlined transactions are facilitated by sound identity management practices. In the context of digital transformation, identity management is foundational for seamless and secure digital experiences, including online banking and mobile payments.</p>
<p>Risk management benefits from effective identity verification, helping to identify and mitigate potential risks. Furthermore, in the globalized financial landscape, proper identity management supports cross-border transactions by ensuring compliance with international regulations and standards, fostering trust in transactions across different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In summary, identity management in financial services is not just about verifying who someone is; it's a fundamental aspect of ensuring security, compliance, and efficiency in an increasingly digital and interconnected financial world.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs’&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;offers the key building blocks that empower a financial institution to add valuable verifiable credential (often caller reusable credentials) capabilities to existing KYC and identity verification processes. Sudo Platform includes four ready-to-use, and fully brandable products with more in development:</p>



 
 Mobile DI Wallet: A standalone mobile application for iOS and Android, a user can use the mobile DI wallet for DI interactions and storage: creating and storing cryptographic keys, and creating connections for receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. It interacts with verifiable credential issuers and verifiers and can be used as-is, or branded to match an FI’s existing experiences. 



 Mobile DI Wallet SDK: For customers that want to add the DI wallet functionality to their own mobile application, this native mobile SDK provides the capability for storage, creating cryptographic keys, and establishing connections and for receiving, holding and presenting VCs. 



 Verifiable Credentials Service/SDK: This service provides the ability to establish connections with DI wallets and to issue VCs. It also provides the ability to request and verify presentation proofs from DI wallets. 



 Relay Service/SDK: This service introduces an always-on capability for a mobile DI Wallet. Implemented as a cloud service, the Relay Service provides mediator capability for incoming/outgoing verifiable credential and other messages, so that sending and receiving is not limited to when the client implementations of the mobile DI wallet and SDK are online. 
 



<p><br>As an API-first developer platform, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;includes everything necessary to quickly bring new products to market or augment existing products with value-add privacy and identity protection capabilities. It includes:</p>



 
 Developer-focused documentation 



 APIs 



 SDK source code via GitHub 



 Sample applications for test-to-deploy of various capabilities 



 Brandable white-label apps for quick go-to-market deployments. 
 



<p>You can see in these images how a credit union has used the Sudo Platform sample app and SDK to build a VCs solution within its banking app:</p>



In 4 steps, go from installation of your mobile application to having an encrypted connection with your potential new member. With this channel established you can commence your KYC process.



<p></p>



With an authenticated end-to-end connection established members can complete their KYC proofing with a verified credential issued at completion that can be used for future proofing exercises needs either in branch or online.



<p><br><br>In this example, a customer wants a car loan and the car dealership verifies their account quickly and securely, avoiding additional applications and legacy forms:</p>

<p>In today’s digital age, online authentication has become increasingly challenging. Traditional passwords have proven to be inefficient and under constant cyber-attacks. However, today we have a new way to manage our authentication: self-sovereign identity (SSI). SSI is a model that enables authentication by empowering users by giving them full control over their digital identity.</p>



<p>In this article, we will explore how self-sovereign identity will redefine online authentication, providing a much more secure and efficient solution for protecting our data and privacy in an increasingly digital world.</p>



 The problem with traditional passwords and centralized databases 



<p>One of the main problems with traditional passwords lies in the fact that they are stored in centralized databases. This poses a significant risk because, if an attacker gains access to this database, they can easily obtain the passwords of multiple users.<br>Over the years, we have witnessed many, many cases where centralized databases have been hacked and millions of users’ passwords and private data stolen. </p>



<p>These cyber attacks have exposed the inherent vulnerability of this system. Even if users choose strong and unique passwords, if the central databases do not have adequate security measures in place, they may still be vulnerable to hacking.</p>



<p>In addition, these security measures to protect centralized databases are becoming more and more costly, as attack techniques are becoming more refined, more efficient and more difficult to prevent. If we add to this the explosion of artificial intelligence that we are experiencing, it will soon be almost unfeasible to prevent cyber attacks and fraud on the Internet.</p>



 Self-Sovereign Identity as a method of authentication 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is a revolutionary approach to online authentication that puts privacy and security at the center of its design. Instead of relying on centralized third parties, such as companies or government institutions, self-sovereign identity gives individuals full control over their digital identity. It uses decentralized technologies such as blockchain to provide a secure and trusted system.</p>



<p>In a self-sovereign identity system, users have the ability to create, own and manage their own digital identity. This involves the generation of unique cryptographic keys that are used to sign and verify transactions. These cryptographic keys are stored in a personal digital wallet, which is protected with a strong password or even biometrics.</p>



 Benefits of self-sovereign identity (SSI) 



<p>Self-sovereign identity offers a number of benefits compared to traditional passwords and other authentication systems. </p>



 Some of these benefits include: 



 
 Increased security: by decentralizing identity control, the possibility of cyber attacks is significantly reduced. Cryptographic keys and blockchain technology provide an additional level of security. 



 Enhanced privacy: With self-sovereign identity, users have the power to share only the information needed for each online interaction, without revealing more personal data than necessary. 



 Elimination of passwords: By using cryptographic keys, self-sovereign identity eliminates the need for traditional passwords, which not only reduces the possibility of theft and password-based attacks, but also vastly improves the user experience. 



 Increased convenience: Self-sovereign identity simplifies the authentication process by allowing users to access multiple online services with a single identity, eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords. 
 



 The future of authentication with SSI 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is a promising approach that is redefining the way we authenticate online.

<p>If you are familiar and have been moving for a while in the environment of decentralized technologies, blockchain, crypto, and especially if you are involved in the Ethereum ecosystem and have heard about the recent Merge that the Blockchain did, it is very likely that you have heard about the concept of rollups. But almost certainly also, we said “Oh no, yet another term I have to learn…”. Well, here we are to help you understand it fast, easy and on time so you look like a genius at the meeting with your friends. Here we go:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A rollup is a type of scaling solution that works by executing transactions outside of Layer 1 but posting transaction data on Layer 1.</p>
</blockquote>



 But…Why Rollups? 



<p>First things first. We must understand that blockchains, like Ethereum, can be slow and expensive because the higher the demand, the higher the fee to pay. Having to spend several extra dollars in gas fee, for a single transaction. This in DeFi is a major drawback.</p>



<p>This is where the need for layer 2’s like rollups is born. So, we could say that, rollups process the transactions from layer 1, in another faster blockchain, layer 2. Well, in this system, after processing the information, the transaction data is carried back to layer 1 (mainnet), but at a fraction of the price. In short, this means that we save the waiting time and processing cost of the mainnet. Therefore, and very importantly, users can benefit from the speed and low cost of the rollup, but without giving up the security of the layer 1 blockchain.</p>



 Rollups and the Ethereum scalability solution 



<p>Rollups are one of several scaling systems, which are nothing more than methods to make a slow blockchain faster and cheaper. Other scaling systems are sidechains and stateful channels.</p>



<p>Most scaling products are specifically related to Ethereum, as it is the largest blockchain with smart contracts developed on it. In the recent Merge (successfully completed in September of this year), Ethereum’s main developers sought to improve the speed and costs of the blockchain with a series of updates. These updates will not necessarily diminish the importance of scaling solutions. On the contrary, scaling solutions are likely to complement Ethereum’s updates, so they are not going away.</p>

 What&nbsp;types of rollups&nbsp;are there? 



<p>We could say that there are mainly two types of rollups, Optimistic and Zero Knowledge (ZK). Both, as we said, decrease transaction costs and waiting time. This works in such a way that, instead of waiting for the processing of each particular transaction in Ethereum (for example), several tens of transactions are recorded in layer 2, and then “rolled up” into a single transaction, which then returns as a packet to layer 1 or main blockchain. As you might guess, by returning like this, the cost of that transaction is divided among many users who have their transaction in that “rolled up” packet.</p>



 
 Optimistic Rollups:It is called Optimistic because it is optimistically assumed that all transactions contained in the rollup are valid. Therefore, in these types of rollups, users are given a certain number of days to challenge fraudulent transactions.Because they are all assumed to be correct, processing is faster because the network does not have to waste time confirming things. The disadvantage is that it takes about a week (the time given to dispute the transaction), to officially withdraw your funds from an Optimistic Rollups, as in the well-known Arbirtrum or Optimism. 



 ZK-rollups:ZK-rollups or Zero-Knowledge Rollups&nbsp;use&nbsp;Zero Knowledge Proof&nbsp;to cryptographically determine if a transaction is valid, using only a minimum of information about that transaction.<br>This is an off-chain protocol that operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is managed by on-chain Ethereum smart contracts.<br>As we have seen in other articles, Zero Knowledge Proof, or ZKP, is a privacy-preserving, fast and inexpensive method.<br>Compared to an optimistic rollup, which requires the funds to remain in the network until the dispute resolution or challenge period closes, ZK-rollups allow users to withdraw their funds without so much delay.<br>We can say then, that ZK rollups have an advantage in terms of speed and security over Optimistic rollups. But not everything is so easy, ZK-rollups are more complex in their application and type of technology. 
 



<p>For now, ZK-rollups are used for specific functions or applications. One of the major use cases of these rollups, and the most seen, is the exchange of non-fungible tokens or the transfer of cryptography between addresses.</p>



<p>Read also:&nbsp;<a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/zero-knowledge-proof-and-self-sovereign-identity/">Zero Knowledge Proof and Self Sovereign Identity</a></p>



<p>But there are many advances we see in this area, and many teams are looking to develop tools linked to ZK-rollups. For example Polygon, Scroll and Matter Labs are working on their&nbsp;zkEVMs, which is a ZK-rollup that works identically to Ethereum’s mainnet. The idea then, is that these rollups can support any kind of applications that users want to develop on that layer 2.</p>



 What are the&nbsp;dangers of rollups? 



<p>We have to take into account some security considerations. And is that, while they take many of the security features of Ethereum, not everything is equal.</p>



<p>First of all, we have to take into account that being tools that are in their initial stage, the networks in which they operate are usually still somewhat centralized as there is a development team that maintains partial control, being able to have certain decisions such as turning on and off the network as they deem necessary.</p>



<p>Smart contracts in a rollup is not as finicky as that of a program developed in Ethereum. It may contain bugs because although there are audits and reviews to improve these bugs, if we rely on an external program to manage the transactions that go through the rollup, we can expect certain risks.</p>



<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that some rollups also still use centralized “sequencers” to successfully coordinate transactions on the layer 2 chain. While a sequencer cannot forge or alter transactions, it technically has the ability to censor or reorder them for profit. This does not mean that it will happen, but we should know that it is possible in some cases.</p>



 How to use&nbsp;rollups in Ethereum: 



<p>We could say that Optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups work in an almost identical way in their use.<br>What should happen, is that they can bridge your funds to layer 2, and complete the transactions you need to perform in the rollup (buy and sell cryptocurrencies/NFTs, interact with protocols, move funds between wallets, or any DeFi transaction).</p>



<p>Note that to get started, you must fund your crypto wallet (Metamask, Coinbase, Binance, etc.), with any Ethereum compatible token (ether (ETH) or ERC-20 tokens).<br>Next, you need to change your wallet to operate on layer 2, so you can bridge your tokens to move them from one network to another. Of course, there is an Ethereum transaction fee to pay to move your funds to a rollup.</p>



<p>Once you have completed the transactions, you can then transfer your funds back to Ethereum. This requires you to convert the rollup funds into ERC-20 tokens that are native to the Ethereum mainnet.</p>



 In conclusion: 



<p>Rollups in general are going, if they didn’t make it yet towards decentralization, in some way or another. It is believed that the rollup market will continue to grow due to its economic, time and security benefits for users.</p>

<p>Sacramento – The State of California Department of Motor Vehicles Open Source Mobile Wallet for Decentralized Digital Credentials <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/about/awards/government-eye-on-innovation?utm_source=int-mktg&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=RM_GB_2023_ITDIS_SOC_SOC1_EOI23SOCIALBUNDLE">has been awarded</a> by Gartner for the Eye on Innovation Awards in Government in the category of provisional, state, or regional for 2023. Gartner is an American technological research and consulting firm that conducts research on technology.</p><p>Wayne Chang, Co-Founder and CEO of SpruceID, said: “We are thrilled that California’s mDL pilot was recognized by the reputable Gartner, Inc. for the 2023 Innovation Award. Working closely with the state DMV, we brought Californians a reliable digital credential that is privacy-first and open source to maintain the utmost reliability and interoperability. California is leading the way in delivering high-quality digital services to its constituents; we commend the state for taking this approach, and we appreciate their partnership.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Assemblymember Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles), said: “I am thrilled to see the California DMV’s mDL pilot receive Gartner’s award for public sector innovation. Since fighting for digital driver’s licenses back in 2021 with AB 1503, I have been proud to see the program come to life so that any Californian can store their driver’s license on their phone. Congratulations to the DMV and their technology partner SpruceID.”</p><p>SpruceID has been working with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to bring mobile driver's licenses to residents of California. Earlier this fall, the State of California expanded the initial pilot program to allow California residents <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">to download a mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> on their smartphone through the California DMV Wallet mobile app (compatible with iOS and Android devices).</p><p>The mobile driver’s license is powered by SpruceID’s SpruceKit components and Credible product. SpruceKit is an open-source toolkit for decentralized identity that enables secure wallet construction, and Credible provides entire credential life cycle management–from issuance and presentations to updates and revocation. Both are modular solutions that are made to integrate into existing high-assurance environments with security and privacy at the core.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/credible-introducing-mobile-drivers-licenses/">privacy-first mobile driver's license</a> can be used at participating TSA airport security checkpoints and select retail locations. In the future, the mobile driver’s license can help residents prove their identity online, operate motor vehicles, access health care, secure financial assistance, and verify their age–both in-person and online–while selectively disclosing only the necessary information. <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">Learn more</a>.</p><p><br>NOTE: GovTech to Host Live Webinar this Wednesday, 12/13 on “Getting Started with Digital Identity” Featuring Ajay Gupta, the Chief Digital Transformation Officer for the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">State of California DMV</a>,&nbsp; and Wayne Chang, <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceID</a> CEO.

				  Governing generates an enormous amount of paperwork, so much so, the US employs an <a href="https://www.zippia.com/auditor-jobs/demographics/">estimated 228,000 auditors</a> to keep track of it. Here, we look at how governments can save millions on issuing documents, licenses and permits, while providing a much better experience for citizens.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>A key function of government is issuing permission, either so that citizens are allowed to do certain things — to build, drive, hunt, run a business, travel, or vote — or perform certain jobs according to certain standards, such as food handling. Governments issue a lot of these documents; for example, the US government issued <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/about-us/reports-and-statistics.html">24 million passports</a> in 2023, each of which&nbsp; took an average processing time of seven-to-ten weeks, and cost the person applying $130 dollars.</p>
<p>By issuing these same documents as verifiable digital credentials, governments can not only reduce the cost of creating the passport, and eliminate shipping costs and the waiting time for shipping, it can also simplify the process of renewing and replacing these documents.</p>
<p>The scale of cost reduction rapidly escalates as we move into state-level documents. In the US, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/191653/number-of-licensed-drivers-in-the-us-since-1988/#:~:text=Number%20of%20licensed%20drivers%20-%20United%20States%201990-2021&amp;text=Around%20233%20million%20people%20held,female%20licensees%20than%20male%20drivers">223 million people</a> held valid driver’s licenses in 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/253615/number-of-hunting-licenses-and-permits-in-the-us/#:~:text=Hunting%20is%20generally%20regulated%20on,amounted%20to%20almost%2039%20million">38.7 million hunting licenses</a> were issued in 2023, and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/687993/fishing-license-holders-by-us-state/">over 126 million fishing licenses</a> were issued in California alone in 2023. Each of these documents takes seven-to-ten days to process and ship. Even if the only thing verifiable credentials eliminated was the <a href="https://www.usps.com/business/prices.htm">66-cent cost of mailing the document</a>, they could have saved the government $147 million on driver’s licenses, $25 million on hunting licenses, and California $83 million on fishing licenses. And people would have received their verifiable credential versions instantly.</p>
<p>But verifiable digital credentials offer more benefits than saving on shipping while arriving faster. They can also save time and therefore money when it comes time to audit the holders of these credentials. For example, you need <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/restaurant-licenses-and-permits/">up to 16 permits and licenses to open a restaurant</a>, each of which can be misplaced or lost. Because verifiable credentials are stored securely on a mobile device, they are easy to keep track of and share when they need to be checked. Mobile verification software makes inspection easy, and the tamper-proof way data is stored means that everyone can be sure key documents haven’t been altered or faked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn’t just government inspectors who benefit from this feature. Anyone can easily verify the authenticity and data of someone else’s official documents. This eliminates what is now time-consuming and challenging research and sometimes a fee. For example, it costs <a href="https://washington.licenselookup.org/medical/">$50 and takes five-to-seven business days</a> to verify a Washington state medical license, while verifying a law license requires <a href="https://www.lawyerlegion.com/promote-your-law-practice/directories-by-state-bar#:~:text=Lawyer%20Licensing%20-%20American%20Bar%20Association,practice%20in%20a%20particular%20state">combing the state bar directory yourself.</a></p>
<p>If you would like to see an example of how governments are already adopting this technology with the Digital Travel Credential (DTC)&nbsp;you can read about how the government of Aruba has implemented it to <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">speed up border crossings</a> or watch a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcu76JEaqwI">here.</a></p>
<p>If you have questions about implementing these credentials for your government or organization our team would be happy to help! You can <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">get in touch here.</a></p>

Key findings, indicators, and leading metrics are presented below in corresponding order to the <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/15">data challenge</a> hosted November — December&nbsp;2023.</p> Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis&nbsp;(EDA)  MEV <p>Over 25,000 MEV-related transactions have been executed through Curve. This is better said as game players game the game. Curve MEV basic statistics present an alternative indicator of on-chain movement and behavioral finance. This only accounts for transactions made on blockchain, and is a principal in decentralized finance to consider before further&nbsp;signs.</p><a href="https://dune.com/encrypted_soul/mev-activity-on-curve">Link to dashboard</a><p>A key question presented in exploratory data analysis was to find significant changes in trading volume and identify potential causation.</p><p>The analysis in a basket of reports revealed the same three dates with the most significant changes in trading volume on Curve&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>These dates and their corresponding trading volumes are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>• February 14, 2021: A trading volume of approximately 1.2935 ×&nbsp;1019</p><p>• August 14, 2020: A trading volume of approximately 1.116318 ×&nbsp;1019</p><p>• September 11, 2021: A trading volume of approximately 1.02 ×&nbsp;1019</p><p>These dates are significant as they represent the highest spikes in trading activity, indicating either increased user engagement or specific market events that drove&nbsp;many</p><p>transactions. Further investigation into these dates may provide insights into external factors or internal protocol changes influencing trading behavior on the Curve Finance platform.</p> Post/pre veCRV <p>veCRV (vote-escrowed CRV token) in 2020 brought voting power and enhanced community participation to its ecosystem. Quantitatively, it reduced token circulation by locking CRV into veCRV. Effectively reducing circulating supply drives the long-term alignment of CRV holders and the success + longevity of the protocol.</p><p>The plots below show the daily transaction count and volume around the veCRV launch date, highlighted by the red dashed&nbsp;line.</p> Protocol Averages <p>How did veCRV impact daily transactions and gas prices? The most straight-forward answer, plus statistical proof are shown in this&nbsp;snippet:</p> Trading Moving&nbsp;Averages <p>The 30-day moving average shows a smoothing of the daily fluctuations and indicates a sustained increase in veCRV token holders = There’s a steady increase in the amount of CRV being locked up, showing a growing interest in boosted yields incentive to the veCRV holders and also potentially participating in the governance of the protocol through&nbsp;veCRV.</p> Peak Trading&nbsp;Hours <p>The provided data on hourly trading volume demonstrates a distinct pattern of daily fluctuations. Trading activity exhibits a clear upward trend from the early morning hours, reaching its peak between 14:00 and 17:00 GMT. This period, encompassing the European and American afternoon hours, coincides with the overlap of major trading markets and heightened market activity. The peak trading hours, defined as the periods with the highest trading volume,&nbsp;are:</p><p>● 14:00 GMT to 15:00&nbsp;GMT</p><p>● 16:00 GMT to 17:00&nbsp;GMT</p><p>During these peak hours, trading volume consistently exceeds USD 160 billion, indicating a surge in market activity and investor participation.</p> Project Marinara — DeFi at&nbsp;work <p>A bonus question here entertained a thesis made this year for The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Project Mariana using Curve Finance Technology.</p><p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), often referred to as the “central bank of central banks,” is an international organization that fosters cooperation among central banks and other financial institutions. Established in 1930, the BIS plays a crucial role in promoting financial stability and facilitating international monetary cooperation. So why do they want to use Curve AMM and liquidity dynamic structure?</p><a href="https://www.texasblockchain.org/blog/curve-finance-the-future-for-exchanging-wealth">Image source</a><p>The integration of Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, as exemplified by Project Mariana’s innovative use of Curve Finance algorithms, marks a paradigm shift in the landscape of cross-border financial transactions. The application of AMM mitigates long-standing financial risks by ensuring immediate execution and settlement of trades, effectively minimizing credit and settlement risks. This rapid, real-time settlement model reinforces financial trust and stability, revolutionizing how central banks exchange and manage digital currencies.</p><p>Key benefits from the responses post-experiment include:</p><p>• BIS aims to improve the efficiency and transparency of foreign exchange trading and settlement using&nbsp;AMMs.</p><p>• The use of Curve’s unique bonding curve in Project Mariana to minimize slippage in large transactions.</p><p>• The experiment with wCBDC-based foreign exchange trading and the development of bridges for asset transfers between different wCBDC&nbsp;systems.</p><p>• The use of a modified ERC-20 token standard for issuing wCBDCs, emphasizing interoperability between different central banks’&nbsp;systems.</p><p>An example model made by a data challenge participants offers a fair ground for how to exchange architecture can&nbsp;occur:</p><p>This offers some Potential Benefits…</p><p>Efficiency: Integration can lead to faster and more cost-effective cross-border CBDC transactions.</p><p>Liquidity: Enhanced liquidity in CBDC pairs can mitigate price volatility and improve overall market stability.</p><p>Innovation: Incorporating DeFi technology fosters innovation in the central banking&nbsp;sector.</p><p>And a multitude of Macro Challenges…</p><p>Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring compliance with existing financial regulations and adapting them to the open source “decentralized” nature of DeFi is a significant challenge.</p><p>User Education: Users, including central banks, may need education on the intricacies of decentralized technologies and how to navigate them securely.</p> Summary <p>The Curve Finance Data Challenge report offered in-depth analyses from 34 participants on the decentralized finance protocol. It includes exploratory data analysis, the impact of veCRV on governance, analysis of unusual activities, trading strategies, and the relationship between trading volume and liquidity. The report also examined BIS use cases, and the application of predictive analytics through machine learning, highlighting the intersection of data science and finance. Key findings include insights on MEV transactions, significant changes in trading volumes, the influence of veCRV on transactions and gas prices, and trends in peak trading hours. The report also explores Project Mariana’s use of Curve Finance technology, underscoring potential benefits and challenges in integrating DeFi with traditional financial systems.</p><p>What Protocol would you like to see dove into next?

 How IDnow’s latest collaborative research project, MAMMOth, is making the connected world a safer and fairer place for everyone. 



 



<p>While the ability of AI to optimize efficiencies and improve processes is well documented, there are also genuine concerns regarding its susceptibility to human bias and how unfair data processing can lead to the perpetuation of discriminatory practices and social inequality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow leverages AI in its proprietary algorithms to automate three critical tasks:</p>



<p>1. Capturing and parsing identity documents.</p>



<p>2. Ensuring document compliance and authenticity.</p>



<p>3. Verifying the document holder’s identity, including a facial verification step.</p>



<p>Research conducted by IDnow has revealed demographic biases in facial verification algorithms, primarily linked to underrepresentation of certain ethnic groups. &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Although a manual analysis performed after an automated check can rectify erroneous verdicts, addressing bias in AI-powered services is a priority for IDnow as we want to ensure our clients and their customers have access to reliable and fair tools.</p>Lara Younes, Engineering Team Lead at&nbsp;IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias, IDnow has been collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, as part of the MAMMOth project, for about a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency, the goal of the three-year long project is to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so that they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three use cases have been identified:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Assessment of loan applications.&nbsp;  



  Academic evaluation and visibility of academic work. In the academic world, the reputation of a researcher is often tied to the visibility of their scientific papers, and how frequently they are cited. Studies have shown that on certain search engines, women and authors coming from less prestigious countries/universities tend to be less represented.&nbsp;  



  Face verification applied to identity verification.&nbsp;  



<p>IDnow will predominantly be&nbsp;focusing on the face verification use case, with the aim of implementing methods to mitigate biases found in algorithms.&nbsp;</p>



 Hearing the voice of the under-represented.&nbsp; 



<p>In an effort to provide a tool that meets the needs of those affected by bias, the project has the support of social science researchers at UNIBO, and three associations working to promote the voice of under-represented groups: <a href="https://www.iasismed.eu/">IASIS</a>, <a href="https://donaactiva.org/">DAF</a>, and <a href="https://www.diversitygroup.lt/en/">DDG</a>. Their involvement in MAMMOth enables IDnow to understand the needs and expectations of under-represented groups. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Through a series of questionnaires and workshops, the above partners have collected input from underrepresented groups, especially women and ethnic minorities. Gathered information has revealed apprehensions about being discriminated against by identity verification algorithms, emphasizing the necessity of ensuring algorithm reliability before use. These groups also advocated for human oversight of algorithm decisions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Other concerns included possible data leakage, highlighting the need to address privacy-and-security-related issues when systems are developed. It’s also worth noting that some participants highlighted that human input could also be biased and that responsible AI use could reduce this risk.&nbsp;</p>



 AI for a responsible future.&nbsp; 



<p>At IDnow, we believe the importance of innovation lies in finding solutions to problems that do not yet exist but are sure to impact the future. That is why we have invested heavily in research and AI technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are proud to be a part of such an important collaborative research project. These studies underscore the need for trustworthy, unbiased facial verification algorithms. This is the challenge that IDnow and MAMMOth partners aim to overcome during the remaining two years of the project,” said Lara.&nbsp;</p>

 The next generation wants control over their data for a more transparent lending experience 



<p>Having grown up with the internet, smart phones, and social media, young Millennials and Gen-Z borrowers are particularly savvy about using their digital footprints for their own benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>They embrace technology to streamline everyday tasks and they want to make informed decisions about transactions. As they increase their presence in the workforce, they are becoming the generations poised to drive the future of lending. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences, young people’s voices came through: They want a more transparent, simpler, digitally-enabled lending process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And open banking can make this a reality. Using secure APIs, advanced data analytics, and machine learning, open banking technology allows consumers to safely share their financial data, giving a more up-to-date and holistic view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit.</p>







<p>Most borrowers are already on board. According to our survey, 77% of those ages 45 to 60 and 68% of those over 60 are willing to grant access to their banking data to secure a credit or loan. Among respondents 18 to 29, the number shoots up to 84%.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of younger customers have already linked their accounts while applying for a loan. And, as digital natives, nine out of ten would prefer a loan option with a digital application or approval process.</p>







<p>The consumer base is changing, opening a window for the industry to evolve in step. Today’s borrowers are calling for a new, digital-first era of lending, giving applicants more control over the information used to determine their creditworthiness.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>By allowing consumers to share access to their financial data, open banking can provides a current view of their ability to repay a loan or afford a line of credit for more transparent lending decisions – and a more financially inclusive economy.</p>



 Younger borrowers are embracing digital lending

<p>If asked what job role is most associated with Identity and Access Management (IAM), what would you say?</p>
<p>Most of you might think a highly technical specialist, or an “IT person”. However, many CEOs, CFOs, Customer Service team leaders, HR analysts and other professionals across companies are involved in IAM decision making. But why is this? This blog will explore why it is important for companies to invest more time and effort in ensuring that Identity and Access Management is well understood across various job functions.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s understand what Identity and Access Management is.</p>
 What is IAM? 
<blockquote><p>“Identity and Access management is the people, processes and systems used to manage digital identities and their entitlements throughout their life-cycle.” ~ <a href="https://open-measure.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DIC/pages/1409143/Identity+and+Access+Management">Open Measure Dictionary</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Organisations use IAM software to manage and secure the identities of both internal and external users for their services and applications. There are &nbsp;two main styles of IAM systems, that are currently in use:</p>
 Traditional IAM or Internal IAM 
<p>Traditional IAM takes care of the internal identities, mainly employees but also can include other groups of individuals such as subcontractors and representatives from partners and suppliers. Think of an employee, from their user account creation, granting the right access to perform their job, until the account deletion when the person leaves the company.</p>
 Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) 
<p>CIAM forked from IAM when the number of Internet applications in every company’s data environment exploded in numbers. Such growth was clearly reflected in the number of screen icons in our devices. Companies of all kinds expect that their applications will be accessed by thousands or millions of consumers, citizens, remote workers, and other types of users. These “customers” could be B2C or B2B. Particularly with the innovations in the LEI world, B2B IAM is becoming a hot topic that will bring massive benefits to the B2B world.</p>
 Why IAM matters to everyone 
<p>Not long ago, when you started a new job or became a university student, someone from IT would provide you with access to necessary systems, and a username and password that needs to be changed after the first login. All identity and access management processes were semi-manual and done by the IT team. Today, we have modern identity standards, but often IAM is an area that only a small group of people in the organisation are involved in. With companies embarking on digital transformation, a larger percentage of the companies’ staff is now becoming involved in building new web and mobile services. But unless everyone has an adequate understanding of IAM, these projects are doomed to fail. Therefore, knowing IAM is not only for the IT folks as it was at the beginning of the millennium.</p>
 Who normally sees Identity and Access management on their desk? 
<p>Identity and Access Management is not an everyday task for many professionals beyond the IT team (or IAM team if it exists). However, when the time comes for strategic decisions, there are several people who will have a voice and decision power in how IAM is acquired, planned, deployed, maintained and expanded.</p>
<p>Especially for the biggest decisions involving risk and money, several sub-organisations and functions have the responsibility to build consensus with the IAM team in order to get their own business objectives met. The most critical of these stakeholders are:</p>
 
 Compliance Officers. There is no software that magically makes a company GDPR-compliant. Same with PCI DSS, CCPA and other regulations. Compliance officers use IAM among other tools and processes to fulfil their audits. Undoubtedly the compliance team will have clear requirements about what IAM must offer. 
 The Chief Information and Security Officer. With a large portion of employees working from their home offices, the risks of attacks to the companies’ systems have drastically increased. The Chief Information and Security Officer is well aware that IAM has taken a leading role in the organisation’s security. 
 Customer Service. Since the concept of self-service account management appeared, CIAM has made a tremendous impact on customer service, and there are multiple ways that CIAM can help. Even in a utopian passwordless world, users will need account recovery and might end up panickily calling customer service. And customer service will ask CIAM to help. Find out more about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/resources/ciam-customer-experience-marketing/" title="leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here">leveraging CIAM for more effective customer service and marketing here</a>. 
 Business Development / Umbrella Organisations. New student portals, patient portals, citizen portals, new mobile apps, improved authentication methods for existing applications…; for every new or existing web service, every day a new service is being created or improved, and IAM needs to be in place. That’s why business units must understand IAM very well in order to reach their set goals. 
 Human Resources. Today any HR information system (e.g., SAP SuccessFactors, Workday) is in one way or another connected with the IAM systems, both Traditional IAM and CIAM. There again, several persons in the HR team will have a lot to say about what IAM should do and shouldn’t do. 
 The CFO. We know it well, that IAM is a necessary but also hefty investment for organisations. The Chief Financial Officer will carefully evaluate the financial impact and will ask both the IAM vendor and the aforementioned stakeholders for a clear Return On Investment (ROI). 
 
<p>Most of these people unfortunately only truly care about IAM when an issue arises for them.</p>
 Let’s educate everyone on IAM 
<p>Seeing how relevant IAM is across the functions, shouldn’t we start a crusade to educate more people about it?</p>
<blockquote><p>“30% of the time for an IAM team should be dedicated to education and knowledge transfer to people who are outside of the IAM team, and the rest of the organisation.” ~ <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/iam-uk-public-sector-richard-slater-amido/" title="Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.">Richard Slater on Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With my personal experience, spending time on educating around IAM is realistic and crucial. There are commonplace and unconventional ways to make this happen: presentations, pre-recorded demos, mini workshops, discussions on hot topics. The executive who leads IAM in the organisation has to become a persuasive agent and make sure that these activities happen, and that more people will be converted into IAM ambassadors. Everyone in the company will benefit from it. After all, times have changed, and there is no digital transformation without CIAM.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and Credential Locking, or proof of humanity locking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and credential locking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches, or 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers credential locking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and Credential Locking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>Credential Locking, or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, Credential Locking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a Credential&nbsp;that can be locked with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By locking KEY on their Credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's Credential Locking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By locking their credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have locked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, locking credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens&nbsp;as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Credential Locking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By locking their credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD Credential Locking  
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's credential locking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information to ensure the security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD Credential Locking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By locking their credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>In my research for this blog post, I wondered where the proverb about glass houses and throwing stones originated. I'm unsure whether there will ever be a definitive answer, but <a href="https://www.almanac.com/fact/where-did-the-saying-people-who-live">this one</a> appealed to my education as an English major:</p>
<p>The proverb appeared in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde, written in 1385. Later, George Herbert modified it this way: “Whose house is of glass, must not throw stones at another.” And in 1736, Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Don’t throw stones at your neighbors, if your own windows are glass.”</p>
<p>Then I decided I’d give DALL-E a go at it. I like that it turned out so dramatically:</p>
<p></p>
<p>This image captures quite well the point I’d like to make about breach revelations—piling on the schadenfreude provides little solace when you become the target. And let’s face it, we are all targets now.</p>
 For whom the bell tolls 
<p>When the closing bell rang at the NASDAQ on November 29, 2023, Okta shares (NASDAQ:OKTA) had been devalued by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/29/okta-hackers-stole-data-on-all-customer-support-users-company-says.html">nearly 7%</a> and received <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/okta-hit-with-6-downgrades-following-q3-earnings-4-big-analyst-cuts-3246837">six downgrades</a> from previous estimates, despite the company’s better-than-expected <a href="https://investor.okta.com/news-releases/news-release-details/okta-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-year-2024-financial-results">earnings report</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20231130546/oktas-stock-falls-amid-wave-of-downgrades-now-is-not-the-time-for-profit-push">TD Cowen analyst report</a>, OKTA's financial performance is reflecting “the impact of recent high-profile breaches involving the company’s solutions.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>In reaction, part practical, part penance, Okta stated it would <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/security/okta-s-90-day-delay-on-product-releases-is-a-critical-step-analyst">halt product releases</a> for 90 days (presumably, the time it takes to get one’s security glasshouse in order). Such news may seem like a holiday gift to Okta’s competitors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But, continuing to draw on my English major, John Donne had this <a href="https://allpoetry.com/No-man-is-an-island">great poem</a> a while back about a bell tolling and then Hemingway went on to develop the concept into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Whom_the_Bell_Tolls">novel</a>. This sentiment rings true today, as we step collectively into an era of hyper-exposure to cyber-attacks: everybody’s going to take their turn. From Donne’s poem:</p>
<p>Any man's death diminishes me,<br>Because I am involved in mankind.<br>And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>It tolls for thee.</p>
<p>Speaking of humanity, it turns out the initial account that was compromised was a non-human—or service—account. These types of accounts can be unruly, and they don’t use multi-factor authentication. In a <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@dangoodin/111348246005935166">discussion</a> on infosec.exhange (with Adam Shostack and friends, no less!) commentors offer various summaries on what had just occurred and who was to shame. This one, I think, summarizes it up best:</p>
<p>Yes, let’s all agree, the one-word technical summary is accurate. But—to paraphrase a security professional I discussed the matter with—as large as the providers are these days, you can never be certain you’ll have your bases covered everyone takes a turn, even open-source providers.</p>
<p>And—talk about the mother of all identity providers—the DNA research company 23andMe <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/04/23andme-confirms-hackers-stole-ancestry-data-on-6-9-million-users/">reported a breach</a> in October, as well—and likewise continues to realize new depths of the severity of the attack. And again, lest we forget, this cautionary tale is at least as old as 2011, when KuppingerCole Analysts reported similar findings from the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/rsa-securid-it-will-never-be-the-same-again">RSA SecurID breach</a>.</p>
 Cyberculture and the culture of silence 
<p>So, what is the proper response to getting our security <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-retired-players-agree-to-concussion-lawsuit-settlement-0ap1000000235501">bell rung</a> (as the NFL calls it)? Well, first and foremost, it’s important to talk about it openly. That’s not an easy topic for discussion with investors, customers, and competitors looking on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BeyondTrust, which <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">reported</a> the breach on October 2nd 2023, was likely the first customer to speak up about it, because the attackers had finally showed up at the company’s door (front door in this case). Still, Okta took more than two weeks to admit to the breach. Oddly, even now, BeyondTrust’s detailed timeline of the breach provides a lot more specifics than you can find on Okta’s security blog.</p>
<p>There’s a reason the mantra of physical security states, “if you see something, say something”—the social alert draws in a community to restore safety. For example, BeyondTrust reveals that the attacker requested a HAR file archive (HTML backup) for the ostensible purpose of troubleshooting the website. Obtaining the file, the hacker then reused a session cookie from that HAR file to attempt a replay attack on a web service, which BeyondTrust easily blocked. Undeterred, the attacker then switched to using API calls instead. According to BeyondTrust:</p>
<p>API actions cannot be protected by policies in the same way as actual admin console access. Using the API, they [the attackers] <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/okta-support-unit-breach">created a backdoor user account</a> using a naming convention like existing service accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is great intel on how the threat actor conducts business and everyone should be put on notice. Still, valuable time was spent in a moment or two of silence. Why?</p>
<p>The culture of silence needs to go. We need to swap notes. Safety is a collaborative effort, because we can’t know in advance where the next threat will originate or where it will propagate.</p>
 Going to production requires oversight 
<p>The interesting thing about this breach is that it started with a service account and then moved to human accounts. One way this happens is by not hardening the system sufficiently when moving from development to production environments. The Okta Developer portal makes it easy for developers to get moving on projects but will need a thorough security review when deploying applications.</p>
<p>Also, the LDAP interface is typically enabled by default even when not in use, heightening the risk level. Access control policies for sensitive apps and admin accounts are often not adequately designed to limit risk exposure to breaches.</p>
<p>Okta is now critical infrastructure and needs a run book that ensures security is maintained. One of the shocking findings in the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/CSRB_Lapsus%24_508c.pdf">report on Lapsus$</a> breaches “organizations did not always consider third parties and BPOs in their risk management programs.” Communication with third parties is necessary preparation for moving to production, as well.</p>
 How to learn from—rather that gloat over—others’ mishaps 
<p>Proposals for avoiding and dealing with breaches were plentiful at our recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">Cyberevolution</a> conference. For example, we <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5434/1">heard from</a> Michiel Stoop of Philips, who spoke on “How to Minimize the Blast Radius of an Attack?” In this case, the approach was to minimize access from privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Jorge Monteiro of Ethiack pointed out that it’s actually a good idea to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5439/2">attack yourself first</a>, in his presentation titled “Autonomous Ethical Hacking for Accurate and Continuous Security Testing.”</p>
<p>Emergency preparedness is often overlooked in cybersecurity, with the majority of the attention going to prevention and detection. But, if we already agree that we are all simply waiting our turn to be attacked, it seems only obvious that we prepare plans for that inevitable moment.</p>
<p>One proposal we covered at Cyberevolution is the practice of developing and training on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5468/3">tabletop exercises</a>, which was covered in a panel titled, “Arresting Disaster: Driving Incident Response in Cyber-Regulated Europe in an Age of AI Threats,” which included participants from ArmorText and the law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring.&nbsp;It’s important to recognize that even your messaging platforms like Teams, Slack, or Zoom become compromised in a breach and so your team will need an out of band “break glass” communication that also meets legal requirements of various governments.</p>
<p>Independent of the measures taken to reduce risk and mitigate cyber disasters, the common thread through all these measures is to communicate openly and quickly with the cyber security community. We’ll all fare much better against attackers as we open channels for honest, detailed, and actionable information.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>With employee identity risk and fraud on the rise — to the point that the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI has issued a public warning</a> — it’s crucial to ensure that employees are who they say they are. Is the person you interviewed the same person you actually hired? Is the person logging in a legitimate employee? Is the person requesting a credential reset in fact the owner of those credentials? Robust identity proofing helps you answer those questions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Understanding Identity Proofing and Why It’s Needed  
<p>What is identity proofing? Identity proofing is the process of verifying and validating the identity of individuals accessing digital systems. It ensures that the identity exists and that the person claiming the identity is the real owner. Employee identity proofing is a fundamental aspect of safeguarding sensitive information, intellectual property and overall organizational integrity. It addresses one of the major security weaknesses in most IAM systems — the fact that authentication only validates that the credentials being used to access systems are valid. It cannot ensure that the person using those credentials is the legitimate holder, and further that the legitimate holder is actually who they claim to be.</p> 
 Workplace Identity Fraud Escalating  
<p>The rise of remote work and the increase in attacks on identity processes underscore the critical need for reliable methods of verifying and validating employee identities. Using credentials obtained by brute force attacks, phishing, AitM attacks, social engineering and other methods,&nbsp; cybercriminals can readily gain unauthorized access to systems and networks. Sometimes the attacks aren’t particularly sophisticated, but exploit gaps in verification processes to perpetrate identity fraud.</p> 
<p>Consider the case of the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">attack on MGM resorts</a>. Armed with publicly available details, attackers impersonated an employee and convinced the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. From there they could wreak havoc, stealing sensitive data and deploying ransomware that shut down operations for over a week.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>MGM Resorts attack flow</p> 
<p>By implementing stringent identity proofing protocols, organizations can ensure regulatory compliance and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other malicious activities.</p> 
 Key Components of Identity Proofing for the Workforce  
<p>Worker identity proofing should include multiple verification methods to increase the security of the proofing process. The methods used will depend on the situation and context. Ideally all components are connected both to each other and to your other identity security tools and systems.</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Document verification determines whether a document — such as a passport, driver’s license or other official document — is authentic or not. This can be done either in person or digitally. Your document verification process should include technology that is able to detect forgeries or alterations.</p> 
 Location Detection  
<p>Location detection is an important aspect of online identity proofing. Is the employee in the geolocation you expect them to be? If not, this may require further investigation. It’s important, however, that your location detection adheres to global regulations.</p> 
 Facial Recognition With Liveness Detection  
<p>Facial recognition uses facial biometrics to determine if a person matches the identity they are claiming. Usually the person will take a selfie as part of the identity proofing process. Liveness detection is a critical feature when using facial verification in order to detect spoofing tactics such as a photo, video playback or even a mask.</p> 
 Live Video Verification  
<p>Live video verification adds an additional layer of security to the identity proofing process. It takes place face-to-face over a video conference, between the employee and their supervisor or an authorized agent and includes questions and actions designed to confirm liveness and detect signs of spoofing or coercion.</p> 
 Chat Verification  
<p>In some cases, such as a lower risk scenario, chat verification may be sufficient. It also may be used as part of a more comprehensive identity proofing flow. Effective chat verification combines AI and human interaction.</p> 
 Attestation  
<p>Attestation by a responsible party of the identity proofing results is a critical part of the process. This creates an official trail for audit and compliance purposes. Your identity proofing software should retain the attested results, not the employee’s sensitive data.</p> 
<p>The integration of these diverse methods creates a comprehensive identity proofing ecosystem, enhancing cybersecurity measures and safeguarding organizations from unauthorized access and data breaches.</p> 
 NIST Identity Proofing Guidelines&nbsp;  
<p>Identity proofing holds a critical role in IAM. Under the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Identity Guidelines, <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-63a.pdf">NIST SP 800-63-A</a> covers enrollment and identity proofing. It outlines a general identity proofing flow and describes three different security levels based on the strength of the type of evidence gathered as well as the verification processes used.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity Assurance</a> Level 1 (IAL1): This level does not require the user to be linked to a known, established real-life identity. It uses self-asserted attributes — in other words, no identity proofing.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2): IAL2 introduces the requirement for strong proof connecting the user to a valid, real-world identity. It supports a wide range of identity proofing methods, allowing for either remote or in-person validation. This includes government-issued documentation as well as biometrics;&nbsp; proofing cannot rely on knowledge-based techniques.</p> 
<p>Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3): IAL3 is the strictest identity proofing level, requiring user presence and biometric verification.</p> 
 Best Practices for Effective Workforce Identity Proofing  
<p>Many companies verify a worker’s identity at the time of hire and stop there. Make sure your identity proofing strategy addresses all key workplace scenarios and times of increased risk of fraud. Below are some of the most critical moments to address.</p> 
 Employee Onboarding  
<p>Before giving any new hire access to corporate systems and data, HR teams need to ensure that the person they are onboarding has a credible identity and is the legitimate owner of the identity they are claiming. They also need to verify that the new employee is in fact the person that was interviewed for the role. This means elements of identity proofing need to come into play before a candidate steps a real or virtual foot into the office. It’s also crucial to securely tie the new employee’s verified identity to IAM systems using non-phishable methods.</p> 
 Credential Resets  
<p>In many organizations, identity proofing stops at HR’s door. The newly minted employee is provisioned with a digital identity and from that point on verification involves validation of that digital identity — there is no process for ensuring it ties back to the real world holder of that identity. This leaves them vulnerable to social engineering attacks that target the credential reset process. For example, an attacker with the right information can claim to be an employee with a new phone that needs to enroll in MFA on their new device.</p> 
 Changing Roles  
<p>A change in roles often provides an employee with access to systems previously out of reach. Before granting those elevated privileges, organizations should make sure that the role change is legitimate and the user is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p> 
 Elevated Detected Risk  
<p>When identity monitoring systems detect potential risks, re-proofing may be indicated depending on the risk level and threat type. For example, if a user attempts to log in from a device that is not in proximity to their computer or engages in other suspicious activity, they could be automatically prompted to provide proof that they are the valid credential holder.</p>

   Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a system architecture guiding tech choices, not a software or service. It prioritizes the individual, allowing them to control their own information. Blockchain technology, as a decentralized database with data spread across nodes, seems a fit for SSI as it ensures accuracy and security. However, it has limitations like being computationally expensive and complex.

<p>For many in the identity industry, hearing “self-sovereign identity” (SSI) automatically makes you think “blockchain.” And, if you’re like me, as soon as you hear blockchain, you think it’s too darn early to play the blockchain drinking game and move on. In the early days of SSI, most of the discussion was, in fact, about identity on a blockchain. That association did a disservice to the concept of SSI. SSI is no more dependent on using blockchain technologies than a passport is dependent on a particular type of paper.&nbsp;</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>SSI is an architecture that guides technological decisions. It is not a piece of software to install or a service you can purchase. In an SSI model, the individual is the single most important entity in a transaction. That individual controls what happens with their information. For people to trust the individual’s information, there needs to be some measure of both technical and societal trust in the veracity of that information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the puzzle the technology has to solve. How do you create a digital identity with information that has been verified (or possibly asserted) by a third party (like the government), that allows an individual to control what information is shared, does NOT allow the third party to know about the transaction, and yet can be verified as accurate by whoever is receiving the data from the individual?</p>



 What is a Blockchain? 



<p>Several features associated with blockchain technology suggest it is a good fit to solve that problem. At its most basic, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a distributed database with data spread across any number of nodes in a network. Enough math is involved to guarantee that the information in those nodes can only be altered with a clear record of who modified it and when.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the right technology, such as a digital identity wallet, an individual can share this cryptographically secure information with any other interested party. Suppose that information was initially issued by a known, trusted entity, and the data cannot be changed (only added to in a visible way). In that case, no one needs to check back with that issuer to see if the information is accurate. The issuer will, in fact, have no idea that this information was shared at all. The individual is in control, and privacy is preserved. Win!</p>



<p>You might find this article interesting if you’d like to read more about how SSI and blockchain can transform society.</p>



 Other Options for SSI 



<p>We have some obvious wins here by using blockchain technology to support SSI. Why isn’t it the One True Way? Because blockchain has some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/04/14/the-5-biggest-problems-with-blockchain-technology-everyone-must-know-about/?sh=5c35504c55d2">significant limitations</a>. For one thing, it is computationally expensive (which means slow and power-hungry). It is also far more complicated than is actually required for most use cases (if you haven’t seen Figure 6 in this&nbsp;<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2018/NIST.IR.8202.pdf">NIST publication</a>, it sums this argument up nicely).</p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a fundamental part of the SSI model. There is an entire&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/">registry</a>&nbsp;of possible methods to use and support DIDs. Some are blockchain-based, but others rely on the&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;specifications. There are options; it is better to understand your current infrastructure, what problem you’re trying to solve, and decide what technology you need to support. Don’t try to make your problem fit the tool, especially when other tools are available.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>SSI’s core principle is about enabling individuals to own and control their digital identities. This architecture can be implemented through various technologies, not limited to blockchain. Blockchain offers a way to decentralize and secure these identities, but it’s not the only method to achieve the principles of SSI.</p>



<p>And if you play the blockchain drinking game, too, I hope you read this late in your day and have a designated driver to get you home.</p>

 A Just Transition Plan for London Borough of&nbsp;Newham Chigwell Road in East London. Photograph: Jack Dredd/Rex/Shutterstock via the&nbsp;Guardian<p>The London Borough of Newham is one of over 300 of the UK’s total 382 local authorities to have declared a climate emergency since 2019. Following these declarations, many local authorities have adopted the Climate Action Plan as a format for translating recognition of risk into action and transformation. From June to October 2023, our team from Dark Matter Labs and colleagues at Arup collaborated with the London Borough of Newham to consider how a new generation of Climate Action Plans might increase the scale and pace of impact, in the face of the climate emergency.</p><p>Newham’s Just Transition Plan, the first outcome of our collaboration, explores innovative approaches to the document’s foundational principles, format, and scope. This article will present the Just Transition Plan as a model for future innovation around local authority climate action, and share what we found in working closely with those seeking to drive systemic change in&nbsp;Newham.</p> Centring justice in Newham’s climate transition <p>Newham, in East London, faces a unique intersection of climate and socioeconomic risks for a UK local authority area. Newham residents currently have the highest rate of death attributable to air pollution in London, and is among the six London boroughs most exposed to flood and overheating risks as temperatures rise. From March to May of 2020, Newham’s Covid-19 mortality rate was more than double England’s average. Today, about one quarter of Newham residents are paid below the London living wage, and one in two children live in poverty, with under-16s making up more than 20% of the population. More than half of residents were born outside of the UK (as of the 2021 census), and Newham is the UK’s most ethnically diverse borough. Newham also has the highest number of households in temporary and non-secure housing in the UK; average rent represents about 65% of wages, compared to the UK average of around 30%. These risks and vulnerabilities situate Newham’s 350,000 residents at the forefront of present and future needs across climate mitigation and adaptation. On the other hand is the sense of opportunity in the borough, on the basis of the youth and diversity of its population. The expansive thinking and leadership within Newham Council enabled a tangible understanding of how the climate emergency is already affecting residents.</p><p>Since 2021, London as a whole and Newham in particular have witnessed increasing evidence of the entanglement of climate risks. Everyday but profound stressors like growing heating bills, and extreme weather such as the July 2021 floods and 2022 heat waves, which resulted in over 3,000 deaths across the UK, have made plain the urgency of systemic action. When we began this work in June 2023, the prospect of another dangerously hot summer was hanging over our work. In each of these scenarios, the intersectionality of the lived experience of climate change was unmissable: people of colour in the UK are four times as likely to live in areas at high risk of extreme heat. The council’s existing Climate Action Plan, as with many others, focuses on a list of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This, however, does not address the reality of Newham residents’ present critical needs and their likely, iminent intensification. A plan for a Just Transition would need to target intersectionality to increase equity in the borough through every single recommendation, while also reducing emissions.</p> Recalibrating our focus in the local authority context <p>With our colleagues in Newham Council, Dark Matter Labs and Arup adopted a cross-disciplinary lens driven by a particular focus on governance and urban climate risks. Early interviews with officers in the council, local leaders and experts from within our organisations outlined one of the defining tensions of this piece of work: local authorities have high and well-informed ambitions, but are working within an extremely challenging context, with limited resources. This dynamic makes system-scale innovation, sustained investment in transition causes, and transformative leadership by councils profoundly difficult. Recent research from <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/promotional-materials/section/youve-made-a-climate-action-plan-what-next-guidance-for-local-governments">Arup</a> outlines an alternative framing: while less than 5% of a borough’s emissions are typically directly attributable to council activities, it can influence as much as 70% of emissions through procurement, policy, jobs, place-shaping, partnerships and community engagement. Local authorities must act, but also influence and convene to affect emissions reduction, and so too the other elements of a Just Transition. In designing the plan, we highlighted ways Newham Council could further grow their influence and work with the borough’s committed community members and other stakeholders.</p><p>A few other shifts in focus were crucial to our efforts. Concepts such as emissions scopes are a poor fit for the scale and interconnectivity of urban boroughs, and can result in a blame game of emissions sources. A reliance on difficult-to-attain emissions data can undermine the ability of local authorities to pinpoint effective levers and enact meaningful climate action. We worked with Newham Council to understand their emissions holistically while they are compiling a nuanced borough-wide picture.</p><p>Estimates suggest that less than 10% of global climate investments go toward adaptation (source: <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/">Climate Policy Initiative</a>), but the case for adaptive measures is stronger than ever. We know that actions which integrate mitigation and adaptation create value, reduce risk and future costs, encourage future investment, and improve quality of living. In Newham, increasing the capacity for adaptation could be incorporated into the more expansive idea of future-readiness: where institutions, infrastructure and individuals are prepared for the volatile futures expected from a world that has warmed on average by 2°C or more. We similarly identified the need for longer-term, recurring, blended and strategic investment to enable whole-place transformation and reduce financial risk for the&nbsp;Council.</p><p>Ultimately, the plan needed to affirm and support Newham’s officers and politicians. We worked with the Council’s Climate Action Working Group and consulted findings from citizens’ meetings to ensure the plan helped to articulate and advocate for their everyday experience and existing programmes, rather than just another thing to do. As a result, we targeted the idea of a next-generation document committing to climate action in Newham: one which was ambitious and informed, reflective of the urgency of this moment, and oriented toward the potential of collective action.</p>Shifts that might define next-generation climate action by local authorities<p>The 3–6–5&nbsp;plan</p><p>Our plan was structured into three parts, each framed by a set of questions:</p> 3 Principles <p>How can a local authority address the entangled targets of a Just Transition: to increase equity, to build future-readiness, and to meaningfully reduce emissions?</p> 6 Futures <p>What specific risks does Newham face, and what levers will enable these to be addressed in order to bring about a Just Transition? What defines the positive place futures we want to bring to fruition?</p> 5 Enablers <p>How can this be accomplished? What action would enable the council and the borough to reach climate targets, support the work that’s already taking place, and maintain momentum in the Transition? How would we need to work differently and collaboratively to make this&nbsp;happen?</p><p>These three components give structure to our more detailed recommendations for Newham, each functioning differently within the context of the plan. While the principles emerged early in our research and guided the formation of the rest of the plan, the futures and enablers were the result of sustained engagement with council data and expertise.</p><p>The 6 Futures, which direct council departments toward visions of the transition in play, takes on some challenging areas, such as Newham’s property and social housing portfolio, which is associated with a majority of emissions in the council’s direct control. Equally important in this section was building on areas where Newham is already a leader, such as in its pioneering work around school meals, and the recent commissioning of micro-forests across the borough. Finally we were very aware that climate action plans can easily turn into lists of hundreds of actions. We sought to focus on the main actions where there would be significant impact across the principles if focused resources were brought to&nbsp;bear.</p><p>Our approach to the Just Transition was to recognise that much of the space for proposition was around capacity, resources, and governance within and between the council, civic society, businesses and institutions that had an interest in the borough. The 5 Enablers give shape to possible forms of governance and finance innovation for Newham, with a view toward capturing the maximum potential of the borough’s leaders across sectors and communities.</p><p>What’s next?</p><p>Since the plan’s launch by the Council on 5 December, it is available to examine more closely <a href="https://www.newham.gov.uk/council/just-transition-plan">here</a>. In <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications/promotional-materials/section/youve-made-a-climate-action-plan-what-next-guidance-for-local-governments">“You’ve Made a Climate Action Plan, what next?”</a>, our colleagues at Arup pose the crucial question in the document’s title. For Newham, our collaboration to date represents tracks laid for the longer-term processes and effort which will be required to sustain momentum for the Just Transition. We look forward to continuing our collaboration, and developing future work to support the borough’s important work to increase equity, grow future-readiness, and reduce emissions.</p><p>Work by Emma Pfeiffer &amp; Dan Hill, in partnership with The London Borough of Newham&nbsp;Council</p>

 How open banking paints a more nuanced picture of borrowers  



<p>Even in the best economic circumstances, loans are often a necessity, especially for critical purchases like homes and cars.  &nbsp;</p>



<p> For some insight into the lending landscape, Mastercard surveyed 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The upshot: 89% have been adversely affected by economic pressures, and nearly half are struggling to get the loans and credit they need. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditional credit scores do not always reflect an applicant’s ability to make payments. Individuals with thin or no credit history can struggle to qualify for credit. Young adults on their own for the first time, gig workers who deal mostly in cash, new Americans and retirees with a single credit card and no loans can struggle to qualify for leases, credit cards and mobile phone contracts. </p>



<p>To most consumers, change is overdue — 87% believe the decisioning process should make it easier for responsible borrowers to prove their ability to repay. </p>







<p>Open banking could help provide that missing piece. By choosing to share their bank account data, applicants can paint a more complete picture of who they are. Real-time insights into their accounts — such as a thin credit borrower’s biweekly deposits, cash flow or consistent payments for bills like utilities — offer an up to date, more comprehensive view of their financial health. &nbsp;</p>







<p>This shift in consumer mindset opens new horizons for lenders, allowing them to champion more inclusive processes. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking has the potential to accommodate millions of thin-credit applicants who have previously had difficulties accessing the benefits of the financial system. Consumers have spoken. They want the next evolution of lending to prioritize transparency, accessibility and empowerment for consumers worldwide to build a more inclusive digital economy where everyone thrives. &nbsp;</p>



 Digital lending is on the rise 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While Identity and Access Management (IAM) long ago gave IT teams tighter controls against unauthorized access to digital services, it hasn’t exactly been bulletproof.</p>
<p>Yes, IAM consolidated the management and storage of user data and enabled login credentials to be associated with user roles and permissions easily. But it also created a single point of failure that hackers have proven painfully adept at exploiting to gain access to all the resources a user is authorized to access.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/journey-through-identity-models-centralized-federated-decentralized">Federated</a> identity management was supposed to fix that by involving a third party in the management of IAM. Instead, it retained all the dangers of centralized identity while extending the potential blast radius of compromised credentials to vast, interconnected networks. Meanwhile, the global cybercrime economy now tops $7.8 trillion a year. The good news: Decentralized digital identity (DID) management has emerged as a superior approach to managing user identity — if you have the right architecture to support it.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Password or a Pretty Face 
<p>In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we shared the contours of the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a>, which employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with up to 99.6% accuracy. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/possession-is-nine-tenths-of-the-flaw-why-device-based-biometrics-dont-cut-it-for-iam/">Part Two</a>, we showcased how we go above and beyond mere logins by binding identity to a biometric stored within a digital wallet. Yet, as solid as these architectural pillars are, we know that decentralized identity models offer a way to keep these and other personal identifiers and information far more secure than traditional user stores — centralized, federated, or otherwise.</p>
<p>To that end, let’s look at why we designed our architecture to support <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/decentralized-digital-identity/">a reusable identity wallet</a> that enables users to securely gain access to corporate systems using identity details that remain under their own control instead of being stored centrally on servers where they can be altered, misapplied, become inaccurate over time—or be swiped, ransomed, or leveraged to commit fraud.</p>
 Decentralized Identity: What’s In Your Wallet? 
<p>In our view, decentralized digital identity isn’t just important to modern IAM. It’s essential because: 1) it replaces platform-specific user stores that are hard to integrate because of proprietary technologies embedded deeply within those very same platforms, and 2) it replaces incomplete user personal identifiable information (PII) scattered across multiple business applications to one version of the truth managed directly by the user.</p>
<p>By leveraging advances in smartphones, cryptography, and blockchain technologies, our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID solution</a> leverages the 1Kosmos architecture to establish high-assurance trust online in a way that balances security, privacy, and convenience. This enables organizations to confidently accelerate user onboarding and activation of digital services, protect digital accounts from unauthorized access (AKA account takeover), prevent transaction fraud, improve the user experience, and more. Specific features include:</p>
<p>A Reusable Identity Wallet</p>
<p>End users gain secure access not just to corporate accounts and systems but also to digital analogs of verified government-issued ID cards, driver licenses, passports, social security cards, and more—anytime, anywhere, from any device. Users also control what personal information they share with digital services in a manner consistent with emerging <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> frameworks.</p>
<p>Portability and Interoperability</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers the only solution certified to the highest FIDO, NIST, UKDAITF standards for interoperability and security and provides an SDK along with off-the-shelf APIs to simplify data sharing and integration.</p>
<p>Verifiable Claims &amp; Credentials</p>
<p>A way to digitally present in real time claims for a virtually limitless number and variety of machine-verified credentials and safely store them so they’re ready to reuse on-demand with user consent.</p>
<p>These features produce enormous benefits for organizations and end users, including the following.</p>
 Rapid Remote User Onboarding 
<p>The 1Kosmos digital identity wallet organizes and stores information gathered, triangulated, and validated during the identity-proofing stage of self-service user onboarding. This includes attributes from multiple, proof-able sources—and enables a wide variety of applications that require identity verification without requiring physical, in-person presence. Think worker and contractor onboarding, applications for government services and documents, and compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) mandates.</p>
 Security Backed by Public Key Cryptography 
<p>Our digital identity wallet consists of a decentralized identifier along with the cryptographic public-private key pair. Personal information about the user and their credentials are stored within the wallet and require the user’s private key and biometrics to read data from it. Because the private key never leaves the Secure Enclave within the device and the biometric can be authenticated with the highest digital standards available, this approach vastly exceeds the security achievable through passwords, traditional forms of multifactor authentication, and unverified device-level biometrics. In turn, this reduces cyber threats related to credentials stolen through phishing attacks, data breaches, and more.</p>
 User Convenience With Just the Right Friction 
<p>When data from the digital wallet needs to be presented—during login or in the event of step-up authentication—the wallet holder must present their biometric and consent to share that data. When approved, the private key is presented as a credential to unlock the wallet and share the data. The private key never leaves the device and hence the risk of compromise is dramatically minimized. Best of all: There are no passwords to remember or clumsy OTPs to enter.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials for a Zero-Trust World 
<p>Verifiable credentials are a standardized means of issuing and presenting claims about one’s identity—driver’s license, passport, college qualifications, gym membership, etc. Other types of information, such as educational certificates and vaccination records, for example, can also be added to the wallet to make the user’s identity-proofing process indisputable in any number of use cases. The identity wallet can make assertions about identity or credentials that are cryptographically verifiable by the receiving party—without the actual data being revealed. The major cryptographic element used by decentralized identities is known as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/security-glossary/zero-knowledge-proof/">zero knowledge proof (ZKP)</a>. Zero Knowledge proof measures an information request while protecting user privacy.</p>
 Blockchain: This Is Just The Beginning 
<p>In Part Four, we’ll click further into how the 1Kosmos architecture leverages distributed ledger technologies (DLT) to eliminate the centralized PII honeypot while increasing business ability and speed.</p>

Residents in North East London who are part of the <a href="http://www.power.film">POWER</a> — a ‘show &amp; do’ project to kick start a “grassroots Green New Deal”. Photo credit — Hilary Powell and Dan&nbsp;Edelstyn We need to rethink our approach to retrofit. <p>If you know anything about <a href="https://www.cse.org.uk/news/what-is-retrofit/">retrofit</a>, you’ve probably heard this line plenty of times. The UK has one of the oldest and leakiest housing stocks in western Europe, and we need to retrofit 27 million homes by 2050 — approximately 1.5 homes per minute for the next 27&nbsp;years.</p><p>This is necessary not only to reach our legally binding Net Zero targets but to ensure healthy, comfortable and affordable homes in a rapidly changing&nbsp;climate.</p><p>You may also know that progress on retrofit is stalling. Each winter millions of UK residents experience the physical and mental health effects of living in damp, mouldy and expensive homes. Overheating is increasingly becoming an&nbsp;issue.</p><p>There’s a lot of discussion about the multiple barriers to retrofit and why it’s often left in the ‘too hard to do’ pile: it’s expensive, disruptive and even if we can afford it, many of us simply don’t have enough trust in a good outcome to start the journey. It’s also clear that existing government-funded retrofit programmes have under-delivered and under-spent.</p><p>Yet our research with HEAL and London Councils found that people up and down the country aren’t waiting for government action. Building on the existing fabric of community groups, cooperatives, community land trusts, neighbourhood regeneration initiatives and other social infrastructures, people are organising themselves to make their and their neighbours’ homes healthier and more climate resilient.</p><p>Communities are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RetrofitBalsallHeath/">sharing information</a>, <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">organising entire streets and neighbourhoods to retrofit together</a>, <a href="https://edinburghtoollibrary.org.uk/charitable-programmes/tooligan-initiatives/etl-retrofixers/">offering simple DIY retrofit measures for free</a>, <a href="https://www.power.film/about">turning their homes into power stations</a> and <a href="https://locohome.coop/">forming local cooperatives</a> that bring together householders, building professionals and tradespeople to generate retrofit demand and deliver high quality home improvements.</p> Putting residents and communities at the heart of&nbsp;retrofit <p>We believe that neighbourhoods can drive forward a nationwide movement to accelerate the uptake and delivery of retrofit and make our homes, communities and social infrastructure more fit for the future. Empowering people to retrofit together and transform their neighbourhood will provide significant other benefits, including good quality local jobs, better health and wellbeing, stronger local economies and community wealth and resilience.</p><p>A community-powered retrofit approach proposes four fundamental shifts in the way retrofit programmes are designed and delivered:</p><p>Individual customers → collective mobilisation</p><p>Design approaches that bring people&nbsp;together</p><p>Extractive finance and grants → local economic&nbsp;value</p><p>Invest in our local economies and communities</p><p>Standardised process → user centred&nbsp;journey</p><p>Design the retrofit offer around the resident experience, not around a Net Zero policy objective</p><p>Focus on ‘measures’ delivered → focus on&nbsp;outcomes</p><p>Contract for actual objectives — healthier and more comfortable homes and reduced carbon emissions</p><p>The focus of community powered retrofit is to mobilise local residents, communities, and stakeholders to be an integral part of designing and delivering retrofit programmes. At present most retrofit programmes view so called ‘community engagement’ as a cost line to be minimised. However there are significant benefits to investing in a place-based, community-powered approach:</p>  Significantly increased participation and power of collective action  Unlocking latent capacity, developing local skills and supply&nbsp;chains  Achieving replicability and economies of scale through co-location, bulk purchasing or typological approaches and potentially reduced disruption  Developing locally relevant responses that maximise co-benefits  Greater continuity and less dependence on (often inconsistent or shifting) policy  <p>Retrofit Balsall Heath is a partnership of local groups in the inner city neighbourhood in Birmingham. It has been incredibly successful in signing up households to participate in the City Council-led programme of ‘Local Area Development Scheme’ grant-funded retrofit works. The approach has involved mobilising a coalition of local community and faith organisations to galvanise support on a street-by-street basis and seeking to support the process throughout where feasible. Although the constraints of the programme design and funding has created issues, the approach has demonstrated that there is demand from residents for improvements to their homes. Traditional approaches using letter/leaflet drops typically achieve very low response rates and don’t build the trust that is needed for residents to stay the&nbsp;course.</p>A ‘street cake’ made by a resident of Link Rd. in Birmingham as part of a co-creation week around neighbourhood climate transitions hosted by CIVIC&nbsp;SQUARE<p>We propose five key building blocks to growing a community-powered retrofit movement. Each of these can — and should — be adapted to the unique context of each community and neighbourhood and its housing characteristics, history, ownership and local&nbsp;wishes.</p>  Movement building<br>Community members and leaders come together to set the vision and communicate the foundation for neighbourhood transformation and a shared mission for better homes and futures. This builds knowledge and trust, develops neighbourhood-level infrastructure for communication, engagement and action and encourages collective action. In <a href="https://oldhamenergyfutures.carbon.coop/">Oldham</a>, Carbon Coop worked with local people to establish a citizen-led approach to transform their neighbourhood and energy system. Groups also need to learn from each other. We’ve been working with many others in establishing the <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-2023-7aec7fbb992f4a4a97ca7d969a48b216">Retrofit Reimagined Festival</a> as a vehicle to build this movement.  Training and upskilling<br>Every community initiative integrates a plan for professional development of community members and upskilling of existing tradespeople to contribute to delivery of neighbourhood retrofit. This demonstrates that retrofit can support the local economy and provide good jobs, helps people to start on the journey to becoming skilled professionals and amplifies existing and latent talent among community members. Civic Square has initiated a <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Neighbourhood-Trade-School-111b0cf89ad34e35aa7f64da612a03e1">local trade school</a> in Birmingham to develop both the ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ skills needed to support neighbourhood transitions. <a href="https://wecanmake.org/">We Can Make</a> has established a local factory to construct building components and a parallel skills programme. <a href="https://b4box.co.uk/">B4Box </a>is an integrated training provider retrofitting homes in areas affected by fuel poverty, training local people particularly those who face challenges in finding&nbsp;work.  Whole life design and journey planning<br>Residents, builders, planners, architects, building surveyors, placemaking and energy system professionals work together to design individual and collective neighbourhood transformations toward holistic long-term goals rather than quick fixes. There are many technology platforms to support this such as <a href="https://furbnow.com/">Furbnow</a>. For centralised grant-based programmes, successful delivery should be based on outcomes rather than on&nbsp;inputs.  Making finance work for places<br>Community groups can advocate for community wealth building approaches and explore options for local finance, including community energy, solar and other forms of cooperatives, collaborations with credit unions and fair and low-cost financing such as municipal bonds. There are successful <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/power-station">crowdfunding </a>and <a href="https://www.ethex.org.uk/invest/people-powered-retrofit">share&nbsp;offers</a>.  Local transition entities or coalitions<br>Retrofit programmes will take many years to deliver, and existing or new community-based entities should be established to support the area-based approach. These should be governed inclusively to provide access to all parts of the community and help to retain local control and economic benefits. Carbon Coop, Energy Communities Tipperary Coop and Cosy Homes Oxfordshire are demonstrating approaches in this space. Many community-owned energy cooperatives provide retrofit support to their areas, for example SELCE, West Oxford Community Renewables and Low Carbon West Oxford amongst&nbsp;others.  <p>There is no one-size-fits all approach to community-powered retrofit. However there are some concrete actions that can be taken&nbsp;now.</p>  Residents and existing community groups can establish forums to share knowledge and skills, approach their local authority and explore existing funding such as the <a href="https://energyredress.org.uk/">Energy Redress Scheme</a>. There are already over 400 community energy groups in the UK, many of which are involved in retrofit activities.  Local government and philanthropic funders should look to initiate or strengthen street or neighbourhood-scale projects&nbsp;by:    Identifying current community activity in retrofit or parallel domains (e.g. greening and gardening projects)  Working with local organisations and areas with known strong social networks to design, trial or build up existing street-scale schemes  Committing additional resource to support existing communities to build capacity and develop resilience for sustained action  Partnering with a broad range of cross-LA departments and agencies to develop skills, organisational and technical capacity  <p>3. All layers of government can enhance existing programmes by:</p>  Building trust and capacity in community partners and supporting new initiatives so that they are ready for future investment  Developing a spatial focus aligned to community partners  Including community partners in the bidding process from the&nbsp;outset  Understanding where CPR principles could integrate with grant programmes and in-house borough retrofit programmes  Partnering with trusted community-based intermediaries to expand the reach of existing programmes increasing uptake  Encouraging collaboration and co-design to ensure longevity of scheme measures and interventions available  Retrofit Balsall Heat — Neighbours attending a Housing protest march campaigning for retrofitting and better housing standards Working collectively is the only way to&nbsp;work <p>Retrofit is challenging. Acceptance of change accelerates when people see and experience change together, learn from each other and see the benefits that the change is bringing. By building momentum from the ground up across our cities, towns, villages and communities, we are planting the seeds for demand, building trust and shaping an approach to retrofit that will not only improve our homes and reduce carbon emissions but build social resilience and reframe the narrative around the climate transition as a pathway to a better&nbsp;future.</p><p>We are hoping that the next phase of Community Powered Retrofit will work with existing community groups to develop a replicable model and resource to enable and empower community retrofit groups around the country. We are looking for funders and existing groups to help bring this to life.

<p>In a world inhabited by a multiplicity of truths, how may we develop mechanisms to orient positively therein?&nbsp;</p><p>This article explores knowledge graphs as a tool for sensemaking and epistemic pluralism. Data is not neutral. It is contextual — collected under particular conditions, by particular people. And when we gather data together and attempt to make sense of it, we add meaning to it to produce an insight. Insights can then be repackaged as new data points within a layered graph. Rather than seeing these insights and data points as neutral fact, we explore the way that knowledge is a diverse field, with overlapping interpretations. By building tools that let us see these divergences and track their origins, we believe that we can better enable community and society level sensemaking.</p> Making Sense of Contextual Data <p>Raw data points alone are meaningless without interpretation. They exist as inert quantifications exerting only the direct geometries of their measurements and have no further relation to reality. The quantity of lead particulates in public water systems alone is insufficient to derive meaningful action. First, we must also understand that lead particulates are dangerous to humans when consumed and that humans are dependent on public water systems to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>Insights — defined for this post as artefacts of knowledge — are always in relationship to an ontology; they exist within a framework for sensemaking reality. Thus data points and their descendant insights can be divergent across ontological frameworks. The challenge then — for us as a collective species interdependent with the natural world — is to develop a system within which we can make decisions that benefit us as a whole and enable us to cohere towards some common goal, despite our differing opinions, interpretations, agendas, and means of engaging reality. What is more, we must be able to transcend a mono-ontology to truly understand the complexities in the hearts and minds of the entities that inhabit Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>It is the composition of measurements into published, opinionated claims that thread the fabric of a ‘knowledge topology’ upon a distributed library of available data.</p> Gesturing Towards Pluralistic Knowledge&nbsp; <p>Recognizing the pivotal role of cogent insights in informed decision-making, it becomes imperative to establish a system that can both acknowledge and effectively evaluate a diverse array of perspectives, especially when they range from congruent to starkly divergent. This necessity stems from an understanding that our collective perception of the world is inherently pluralistic, encompassing a spectrum of contexts and ontological frameworks where multiple rich contexts and ontologies need to be able to coexist and organise towards a future that is inclusive, yet coherent, interdependent, self-aware, and common enough such that we can avoid undesirable internecine interactions.&nbsp;</p><p>It is here that a set of tooling in support of a healthy, composable and pluralistic Data Commons is described, or more accurately, a set of tooling to enable data commoning! This tooling extends the distributed data storage, query, and analysis modules described in part one of this blog series.&nbsp;</p> Adapting our collective lens for knowledge <p>The authors do not intend to describe a specific implementation. Rather, this post serves as an investigation into praxes of pluralism and knowledge integration. The exact form of these praxes codified into a product are not the focus of this enquiry, and rather we wish to draw attention to the dynamics this tool may embody.&nbsp;</p><p>While modern science boasts remarkable capabilities in accurately measuring various aspects of our world, this informational chapter of the Anthropocene has repeatedly shown that absolute truth is elusive. This observation does not undermine the pursuit of objectivity in our understanding of reality. Instead, it highlights that the perspectives that shape our collective cultural narrative are diverse and often lead to substantial variations in our conceptual models of reality. This diversity underscores the importance of acknowledging and designing an effective lens for the plurality of views when engaging in our collective quest for knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Consider the following diagrams, where two polar (and very generic) ontologies are described. The authors do not intend to provide an argument for either ontology, but rather give them by way of example. The first is a theistic epistemology, the second is an atheistic epistemology. The nodes in both diagrams are shared data points. The highlighted edges represent the structural relationships between the nodes for each epistemology. The semi-opaque edges represent an opposing ontology and have been rendered for the purpose of demonstrating the pluralism that is the thesis of this post.&nbsp;	</p>Figure 1: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their theistic ontology.Figure 2: A subgraph of the global knowledge graph where the highlighted edges defined by the community determine the structure of their atheistic ontology.<p>In the above two diagrams, four configurable ‘insights’ are represented by very simplified nouns. Further, the use of simplified concepts such as God, Humans, Big Bang and All Life are intended to represent more complex composable insights and have been selected for their capacity to demonstrate how the epistemological topology of a community can vary despite using the same nodes. Specifically, it is the relationships between the nodes — their relative structure — that determines their framing and ultimately their meaning within a system of knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of the above illustrations is to demonstrate that even with some shared understanding of a set of data points (where both ontologies acknowledge the existence of “humans”), it is the relationship of these data points to other data points that define their ontological framing.</p> Epistemic Pluralism and Peer-Based Graph Structures <p>Software can act as a bridge connecting us to — and mediating our interactions with — the physical world. It can also oversimplify and potentially degrade our experience of reality. This dichotomy underlines the importance of our mission: to design technological solutions that enrich, rather than diminish, our engagement with the world. Our aim is to ensure that these technological interventions augment our understanding of reality, maintaining its depth and complexity in a way that unlocks the rich and existing knowledge mappings that percolate in our brains, epigenetics, culture, and shared interpersonal space.&nbsp;</p><p>With the above framing in mind, we can begin to gesture towards a pluralistic knowledge graph of insights; a multiplicity of complex claims with directed links (references) to the datasets upon which the claims are based.&nbsp;</p><p>Enabling pluralism within a tool for knowledge is non-trivial. The challenge is to determine and promote synthesis and coherence across an agent-centric knowledge mapping tool.&nbsp;</p><p>The reader is encouraged to imagine a graph-builder of sorts, where participants provide insights via some medium as nodes in a graph. These publications will bear some epistemic relationship to other publications. They may be direct responses, endorsements, or rebuttals but they may also have less explicit relationships such as semantic similarity or geopolitical proximity. It is this metadata, the edges of the graph or in other words its relational structure, that represent the social relations through which we have collectively archived and evolved our various cultures for millennia.&nbsp;</p> Designing for Protocols &gt; Platforms&nbsp; <p>This blog post does not delve into the specific design or user experience (UX) of the proposed tool. Instead, our focus is to conceptualize its potential functionalities, particularly when implemented as a protocol for safely sharing data and insights across software ecosystems. We envision it as a flexible module or wrapper, designed for integration by other developers, rather than as a standalone platform. This approach considers an inter-platform collaborative model. A key aspect of this model is the 'safe answers' concept as examined in part one of this blog series, which negates the need for centralized server access to raw data. Instead, it enables communities to retain custodianship over their data, allowing external organizations to send localized algorithms to peer networks. These algorithms can then query data, with granular control over the opacity of the data being used for computation. This means that the return of the algorithm can optionally expose the raw data it is using, or provide some ‘insight’ pertaining to the data. For example, a security camera may expose to a querying party the amount of people who walked past the camera, and not the identity/profile of the individuals walking past. This method fosters a decentralized and secure approach to data analysis and sharing.&nbsp;</p> Finding Integration in Pluralism <p>While there is something just and encouraging about an ecosystem aimed at mapping the pluralistic epistemics that percolate throughout the world, there are also risks therein. What is important is that we avoid a set of disintegrated ‘knowledge’ feedback loops, echo chambers, where those embroiled in misguided or harmful informational clusters are never exposed to counter-arguments or differing schools of thought. It is important that we identify mechanisms through which to measure how coherently any given network’s graph of knowledge integrates with the other graphs in the ecosystem. To achieve this, we endeavour to draw from Integrated Information Theory (IIT).&nbsp;</p><p>IIT, initially formulated to describe consciousness, posits that a system possesses consciousness to the degree it possesses 'Phi' (Φ) — a measure of its intrinsic cause-effect power. It is a system's ability to integrate and differentiate information. Adapting this to our knowledge graph setting, we can interpret 'Phi' as a measure of the extent to which knowledge from one epistemological network is both differentiated from and integrated with another. The higher the Φ, the more integrated (and thus potentially coherent) the knowledge graph is with the broader knowledge ecosystem.</p><p>In practice, Φ along with more traditional graph analysis techniques may be used to reveal areas where connectivity can be enhanced, subsequently tuning search and discovery algorithms. This is crucial in a world increasingly fragmented by differing worldviews, as it enables us to identify points of convergence and divergence across knowledge systems. By analogizing Φ in IIT to the integration of knowledge across different epistemic frameworks, we establish a quantitative measure and orienting function to shift the knowledge network toward greater coherence.</p><p>Just as IIT posits that conscious experience arises from the integration of differentiated information within the brain, we posit that a coherent and functional knowledge ecosystem could emerge from the integration of differentiated insights across various epistemological networks. We suggest that a healthy knowledge graph, like a biological mind, is not just a repository of information, but a dynamic, integrated network capable of evolving and adapting to its environment.&nbsp;</p> Embracing the Dynamics of Knowledge Integration <p>The journey through the realms of data, insights, and knowledge graphs has elucidated the intricate and dynamic nature of knowledge itself. We believe that the concept of a pluralistic data commons, as explored in this article, is not just a theoretical framework but a necessary evolution in our approach to understanding and navigating the complex tapestry of global information. The notion of knowledge as a static, singular entity is a relic of the past. Today, we are called upon to recognize the fluidity and multiplicity of knowledge, shaped by diverse perspectives and evolving contexts.</p><p>This blog post describes praxes for knowledge mapping in a manner that aims to embrace epistemic pluralism, and resists the idea that we as a species can arrive at a positive orientation through a homogenised narrative. Rather, we believe that it is in the intersection of a diversity of narratives that we may come to a model of integrated knowledge. These praxes are important when considering the applications that may sit above the distributed storage layer we described in our first blog post. It is insufficient to merely ‘capture’ data. Data requires contextualisation and application, and it is in these later steps that the capacities and implications of the data becomes apparent. Here we must ensure that our endeavours to synthesise and unpack data are done in an inclusive and life-centric manner, and thus it is important that the communities using the distributed storage tool have the means to find the degree of integration in the knowledge artefacts derived from a given set of data.&nbsp;</p><p>The notion of measuring the integration of knowledge, borrowing from Integrated Information Theory, offers a promising path forward. It allows us to quantify and visualize the interplay of different knowledge systems, identifying points of convergence and divergence. This, in turn, can guide efforts to enhance connectivity and coherence within the global knowledge ecosystem. Such an approach recognizes that the health of our collective understanding is not just in the accumulation of data or insights, but in the integration and harmonious interplay of diverse epistemologies.</p><p>Ultimately, the success of this endeavor will depend on our collective willingness to engage with and evolve differing viewpoints, to challenge our own assumptions, and to remain open to the evolving nature of truth. The creation of these knowledge ecosystems is not just a technical endeavour but a cultural and intellectual one, requiring ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and a shared commitment to exploring the multifaceted nature of reality. As we forge ahead, let us embrace this complexity, not as a hindrance, but as a rich tapestry of human experience and wisdom, from which we can all learn and grow.</p>

 The travel and mobility industries have been anything but stationary over the last year. As we move toward 2024, let us look back at 2023 to reflect on changes and predictions that will drive these industries into the future.&nbsp; 



 



<p>Mobility and travel are industries on the move, literally. Individuals from all walks of life have an almost daily need to get from point A to point B. Our needs, our finances,&nbsp;our environments and even our <a href="https://brilliantio.com/how-does-culture-affect-travel-and-tourism/">culture dictate how we move</a> in our lives, and as times change so we must follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People are traveling more frequently than ever, the only difference is how they are traveling. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/features/mckinsey-center-for-future-mobility/our-insights/european-mobility-finance-a-25-billion-euro-growth-opportunity">McKinsey is seeing developments</a> in full-service leasing, new-car subscriptions and financing for used cars as potential core mobility-finance markets by 2030. Furthermore, micromobility will continue to grow and contribute 5% of total revenue in 2030 compared to 1% in 2023. An additional niche area which will see some growth beyond 2030 is electric vehicle charging infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As consumers are delighted about the variety of mobility trends on the horizon, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-mobility-evolves">respondents from a McKinsey survey</a> found that almost one-third plan to up their use of micromobility over the next decade and 46% have already switched to more sustainable modes of travel with an interest in shared autonomous vehicles. But whatever the mode of transport, safety is key, and the increased need for identity verification has become clear along with the desire of growing digital services.&nbsp;</p>



 Wheels of regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The travel and mobility industries have seen some exciting developments and steps forward this year, thanks largely to the increased adoption and implementation of identity verification solutions across the entire user journey. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, 2023 could also be characterized by a series of significant stops-and-starts. The most pivotal event in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility industry</a> occurred in September when, following an overwhelming vote to ban e-scooters in Paris, the French capital was cleared of the vehicles overnight. The main reason for the ban was safety concerns, following a streak of accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This set the wheel in motion for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">strengthening of micromobility regulation</a> in different cities around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Right now, the market can be <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/electric-kickscooters-have-come-of-age-regulators-have-taken-notice">split into four types of cities</a> ranging from unregulated, where e-scooters can be implemented without any limitation or regulation, to complete bans, where e-scooters are not allowed, such as in Paris” stated Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two regulatory archetypes, in-between no regulation and complete ban, carry certain stipulations such as an age verification process, speed limits, restricted numbers of operators and areas in which to park.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ramifications of the Paris ban are likely to be felt for the next few years as each country and city decides its stance on micromobility. Opponents to the ban argue that it was a step back for sustainable transport, and that there are benefits to embracing a clear micromobility strategy that includes faster, more convenient, eco-friendly forms of transport that can help reduce urban congestion, and offer transport options to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other changes likely to affect mobility in 2024 include ongoing digital transformation efforts, across every step of the user journey highlighting this need for progress.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Processes remain old school in car rental agencies who are now facing strong competition from fully digital car rental companies, so digitalization will play a major part in the development of the car rental space.</p>Edouard Baussier, Global Mobility and Travel Sales Director at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Consolidation will also play a role in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/mobility-report/">future of mobility</a>. “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) will become key</a>, as it will provide a new way to plan a full trip [whether bus, train, e-scooter, e-moped, bike, car or taxi] from one platform and one user experience.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Traveling digital.&nbsp; 



<p>When reflecting on 2023, it didn’t come as much of a surprise to Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow that, much like mobility, digitalization within the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel industry</a> played such an important role.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Covid acted as a wakeup call that there was an urgent need for digital services in the travel and mobility sectors, and that the travel industry, in general, had been very lax in dealing with these topics for decades.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Travel &amp; Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>Michael explains that the major challenge facing the sector is that there is “a shortage of skilled workers and increasing customer expectations on the one hand, and low margins, rising inflation and conservative strategies on the other. Digitalization should be driven forward more rapidly, but most travel and hospitality companies still behave hesitantly and adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ approach.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the digital skepticism of some travel and hospitality companies, Michael has no doubt that digitalization in every area of the tourism value chain, and user journey, will continue to be the driving force for hotels, airlines and other travel businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-digital-identity-improves-passenger-journey/">Seamless travel, digital check-in processes and digital identities</a> are hot topics that will simplify travel experience in the short and long-term. It is an ongoing process and courageous companies that prioritize digital projects and implement them ASAP will be able to gain a market advantage and be more successful in the future. Plus, IDnow will be there to support them.”&nbsp;</p>

 A side of hospitality.&nbsp; 



<p>Along with mobility and travel comes their partner, hospitality. Where would travel be without hospitality to lend a hand? Due to the increase in travel, hotels and rental companies are back to business but with a few more challenges on their plate. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Many hospitality businesses have seen a surge in fraudulent attacks in recent years. Coming in a variety of different forms, the most significant include loyalty card programs which fraudsters have developed a liking for and is <a href="https://www.cybersource.com/en-us/blog/2020/loyalty-fraud-how-real-is-the-threat.html">projected to reach a market value at over $11 billion by 2025</a>, as well as the ever-present credit card fraud which the airline industry is also heavily impacted&nbsp;by&nbsp;with <a href="https://chargebacks911.com/travel-forecast-2023/">IATA totaling the loss for airlines at $1 billion a year</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud is everywhere, no matter the industry. Unfortunately, hospitality is feeling the effects due to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-protect-owners-guests-holiday-rental-scams/">lack of protection and high turnover rate compared to other industries</a>. And it isn’t just a loss in revenue but also reputation. Luckily, thanks to identity verification, chargeback and credit card fraud can be minimized, improving security of both the hotel and the guest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/optimizing-the-online-travel-booking-experience/">from reservation</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/leveraging-digital-check-ins-hotel-operations/">check-in</a> to payment. &nbsp;</p>



 



 

 



 To the reusable future.&nbsp; 



<p>As the travel and mobility industries take stock of 2023 and look to the coming year, digitalization will play an ever-increasing role, especially through the use of reusable digital identities. While they can be applied in almost every industry, reusable digital identities are already taking off&nbsp;within the travel sector where airlines and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have already showcased their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">Proof of Concept – End to End Digital Identity initiative</a> near the end of 2023 in collaboration with IDnow. With such developments arising in travel, digital identities (travel credentials, boarding passes, visas, etc.) will be stored in digital wallets, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>, ready-to-use within seconds making the future of travel much more pleasant and stress-free. The possibilities of tomorrow are only a [digital] wallet away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Contributions by: Sam Gbafa (Product Prototyping), Wayne Chang (Strategy), Parke Hunter (Content &amp; Editorial)</p><p>Picture this scenario: You're a politician running for state office. It's been a long campaign, and the polls are very close — a virtual tie. It's the night before election day when most of the ballots come in.</p><p>You get a call in the middle of the night, and it's the head of your campaign. There seems to be a fake story about you spreading like wildfire that has come out of nowhere. What's worse is that there’s also a video of you confirming and apologizing for the fake allegations spreading alongside, coming from a verified account with a name spelled in a way that looks visually identical to yours! Your campaign manager has already started damage control. You know that this will be disproven, as the allegations are obviously false. But the election is tomorrow– is there enough time? If only people could see that that apology video is fake and didn't come from your campaign. Your campaign manager asks: how should we move forward?</p><p>Enter a world with content authenticity…</p><p>In a world driven by content authenticity, there is a verifiable way to prove any content's author. In the campaign example, you would have set up a system where you registered digital credentials, including your mobile driver’s license, .gov email, and a state credential that includes your current title to create a verifiable online digital identity.&nbsp;</p><p>Every message, video, and post by the campaign has a small reference with it that can be retrieved and verified by platforms, allowing them to give you a special verification symbol with all of your content. Anyone can check this verification and pull down the original content you posted. Social media platforms would instantly make it clear that the apology video didn't come from your campaign. This fake story is still out there, but its power is diminished.</p> An Introduction to Content Authenticity <p>Throughout time, the ways in which we’ve encountered news and information in the media have shifted dramatically. With the proliferation of AI, social media platforms, and influencers, it’s become a challenge to weed out the truth from misinformation. Not being able to verify the legitimacy of content is problematic, especially when it comes to political news or government information, as portrayed in the example above.</p><p>Multiple organizations are currently working on tech approaches to solve this problem by adding a layer of trust and verification to the content we consume. This layer of trust and verification added to content is called content authenticity. At our core, SpruceID’s mission is to let users control their identity and personal data across the web in a way that facilitates trusted interactions. As a result, contributing to the future of content authenticity, powered by trusted digital identity, is important to us.</p> The Rise of Digital Content, Platforms and Publishers <p>From relying on a few major news providers to the rise of citizen “journalism” on social media platforms—the internet has made it easier than ever for anyone to have a global reach. With this new power, it becomes more challenging for information consumers to differentiate what is real from what is fake.</p><p>To combat this, platforms have traditionally used verification of notable figures. Tools like the Twitter Blue Checkmark or the Verified Badge on Instagram give users a clear way to know who to trust. However, there have proven to be issues with this approach, including platform risk (as seen with Twitter’s recent changes to verification), bias and discrimination (such as a political campaign being unable to make verifiable statements due to their political opinion), and legitimization of harmful entities if someone can game the verification system to post with authority. These platforms also have the power to allow verified posts to look different and appear more frequently. By modifying their platform, they can increase or decrease trust in “verified” content with their audience.</p><p>Currently, these platforms have to design and build their own verification systems, and they are not interoperable with one another. There isn’t a clear way to say that the identity of “The New York Times” on Facebook is the same as that on Twitter (besides the recognition of that entity’s name). These platforms have, in part, understood their responsibility to inform people of what can and cannot be trusted. They have done so with different approaches, including <a href="https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction?ref=blog.spruceid.com">community notes</a> on Twitter and fact-checking on Facebook.</p> Approaching Solutions&nbsp; <p>Today, we’ve begun to see political figures address the danger of deepfakes and the need for a solution to AI-generated content. On October 30th, 2023, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_JLkU5xF2Y&amp;t=3s&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">President Joe Biden spoke out</a> about signing an executive order on artificial intelligence, which is the first of its kind for the U.S. Government. He stated:</p><p>“With AI, fraudsters can take a 3-second recording of your voice can generate an impersonation good enough to fool you; it’s mindblowing…I said, ‘when the hell did I say that?’”</p><p>With an open <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">executive order</a> calling for technology to solve this problem of verifying who is saying what, this currently remains a pressing issue. We believe that one way to approach this issue is by introducing a way to verify who posted what content by tying said content to the poster’s verifiable identity using digital credentials.</p> SpruceID Proof of Concept <p>In order to demonstrate a potential solution for content authenticity, we created a proof-of-concept using our SpruceKit open-source libraries. We recently presented this proof-of-concept in Washington D.C. at <a href="https://dcfintechweek.org/agenda-2023-2/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">D.C. Fintech Week</a> to show what a solution could hypothetically look like. Here, we’ll break down the technology in our proof-of-concept and describe how these tools can be used to verify content and build trust across all platforms.</p> Key SpruceKit Components for Content Authenticity <p>This proof of concept uses the following technologies we’ve developed as part of SpruceKit, our open-source libraries. We will reference these tools in our walkthrough below:</p><p>SpruceID Libraries used in this demo:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebase</a> is a tool that allows you to run a credential issuer. Rebase lets you run a witness that can programmatically examine multiple proofs from someone requesting a credential, verify those proofs, and then issue a credential.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Kepler</a> is a data storage system where you permission who has access to this data with your Ethereum keys. You sign in with your Ethereum keys, and that signature permits the app you are using to access and store data.</p><p>Other technologies used:</p><p><a href="https://attest.sh/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Attestation Service</a> is an infrastructure for making attestations on or off of a blockchain about anything. We use it as a place to make attestations.</p><p><a href="https://base.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Base</a> is the blockchain we are using for this demo. It allows for low-cost attestations (100s of attestations per dollar). Someone must pay this fee for a transaction to be posted as a public blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://web3.storage/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">web3.storage</a> are tools we use to store and retrieve data verifiably. IPFS summarizes the file into a Content ID, which can then be used to retrieve that file. It does this in a way so that it’s verifiable that the file you upload is the file you retrieve. We use web3.storage as an easy way to interact with the IPFS network.</p> Content Authenticity in Action <p>In this walkthrough, we’ll break down how to both create and verify Content Authenticity claims in order to make a statement or claim and then “stamp” that claim (with a high assurance credential such as a mobile driver’s license or a .gov email) so that your audience can be confident that it was you who made it.</p> 1) Account Setup and Adding Credentials <p>When you land on the Content Authenticity page, you can either create a Content Authenticity claim or verify one. First, let’s create a claim.</p> <p>To create a Content Authenticity claim, you will first need to sign in. We use Sign-in with Ethereum to connect to Kepler in order to store and retrieve data associated with our account. This data includes the credentials we have and any files we have uploaded.</p> <p>If this is your first time interacting with your account, you’ll need to create a data vault with Kepler (our data storage system). This second signature request creates a place where your data is stored.</p> <p>If you have no credentials, you can easily create them. Our Rebase issuer powers the process of creating credentials. To create a credential, select “issue first credential,” and you’ll be taken to the following page.</p> <p>From here, we'll choose the Email credential.</p> <p>In the process of adding a credential, you prove two things: </p><p>1) you are in control of the keys you want to associate with the email </p><p>2) You control the email you want to associate with the keys. </p><p>If both of these are verified by the witness, then it will issue you a credential. Going through the steps here proves these things to the witness. In step 1, you say what email you’ll be using. Step 2 prompts you to sign a message with the email and Ethereum public key in it. This message and signature are cryptographically verifiable, and the witness checks that. Lastly, you are sent an email with a unique challenge to the email provided. If you have control of this email account, you can respond to the challenge correctly. Providing this proves access to the email. Once proven, the witness will issue you a credential that says your email is the same as your Ethereum public key. This credential is an important pillar in our content authenticity solution, as it anchors the cryptographic signer to other identities.</p> <p>Once they are added, any credentials you have, such as your Twitter handle, email address, etc. will be displayed under the Credential section below.</p><p>In this example, the issuer is the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but there can be many other credential issuers, including your organization, your government, or a club you are a part of. These credential issuers may have other requirements besides the simple proofs to issue an email credential. Our demo trusts credentials issued by the Spruce Rebase Demo Witness, but ultimately, a user may have different trust models, such as trusting an issuing key that belongs to the New York Times or the California DMV.</p> 2) Upload Your Content <p>Upload a file to IPFS and get its content identifier to accompany your claim. This identifier is both a cryptographic hash of the content and a way to retrieve the content from the IPFS network. Anything uploaded is public and irreversible.</p> <p>Select the file, and then you can make claims about that content.</p>  3) Make a Claim About Your Content <p>Once you have your credentials and have uploaded the content you want to make a claim about, you can use this tool to make those claims!</p> <p>First, select the credentials you want to use in order to make a claim. I’ll select my GitHub and email accounts.</p> <p>Then, you select the file you want to make a claim about.</p> <p>This flow supports <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Content Credentials</a>, an effort by the <a href="https://c2pa.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity</a> to develop technical standards for certifying media content's source and history (or provenance). Some <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/leica-launches-worlds-first-camera-with-content-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">hardware</a> and <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/content-credentials.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">software</a> support content credentials, which prove the source and modifications to an image. You can export those and add them as part of this optional step. Depending on the use case, having that cryptographic verification of where an image came from is just as necessary as who is posting it.</p> <p>The uploader can add additional claims you want to make regarding the image. This example demonstrates making a claim about the SpruceID logo.</p> <p>Review and submit the transaction to the blockchain. This page lets you preview the data and submit it to the blockchain. You can go back and fix any errors. Once it’s submitted, it can never be undone. It will be public and permanent.</p><p></p> 4) Verifying a Claim <p>You'll be sent to the verification page once a content authenticity claim has been posted. This page is the public page that others see when examining this content. </p> <p>This page verifies the data and includes cryptographic checks about the credentials, the issuer of those credentials, and the identity of the poster of the claim to ensure they all add up. It also retrieves and displays the content so you can see the content about which a claim was made.</p> Watch a Demo <p>This demo walks you through the same steps above to recap how one would create and verify content authenticity claims.</p> What’s next for Content Authenticity? <p>From the increasing need for solving content trust and verification to our hypothetical example of how this problem could be addressed today, it’s difficult to say exactly how the world will tackle this complex problem. SpruceID has the knowledge and expertise to help tie provable high-assurance identity attributes (such as a mobile driver’s license) into content that is put out to the public in order to elevate the level of trust in the person or entity making the statement. Empowering users to control their identity and personal data across the web is woven into our DNA. We’re excited to share this proof-of-concept to help shape a future with trusted identity and interactions online.</p> <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/digital-identity-now-and-future/digital-identity-today?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More about Digital Identity</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Earlier in November 2023, we <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">announced</a> the auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies to automatically protect tenants based on risk signals, licensing, and usage. This is to remind you that Microsoft will begin automatically protecting customers with Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies. These are policies that Microsoft creates and enables in customer tenants. The following policies will be rolled out to all eligible tenants:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Policy&nbsp;</p>


<p>Who it’s for&nbsp;</p>


<p>What it does&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for admin portals&nbsp;</p>


<p>All customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers privileged admin roles and requires multifactor authentication when an admin signs into a Microsoft admin portal.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users&nbsp;</p>


<p>Existing per-user multifactor authentication customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy applies to users with per-user multifactor authentication and requires multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It helps organizations transition to Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>




<p>Require multifactor authentication for high-risk sign-ins&nbsp;</p>


<p>Microsoft Entra ID Premium Plan 2 customers&nbsp;</p>


<p>This policy covers all users and requires multifactor authentication and reauthentication during high-risk sign-ins.&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll begin a gradual rollout of these policies to all eligible tenants and notify in advance. Once the policies are visible in your tenant, you’ll have 90 days to review and customize or disable them before we turn them on. For those 90 days, the policies will be in report-only mode, which means Conditional Access will log the policy results without enforcing them. For more information refer to the blog, “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.”  &nbsp;</p>

<p>Update on Azure AD Graph Retirement&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June of 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> that described the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will be done with incremental steps. We’re committed to supporting our customers through this retirement and migration to Microsoft Graph, and we’re committed to increased transparency and communication as we work through this change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Retirement: Stage One &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement will begin later in 2024. We’ll share a specific date in a subsequent update, with a minimum of three months of advance notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once we enter this first stage, applications that are created after a specific date will encounter an error for requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net/">https://graph.windows.net</a>). We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph at this point, and we’ll provide an optional configuration to allow applications created after this point to resume use of Azure AD Graph APIs for an extended period. If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must begin planning to avoid interruption. This optional configuration can be set on an application after it is created, and the configuration change will be done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll provide more detailed guidance on the timeline for this plan and on configuring the optional configuration in our next update.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I find Applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs? &nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re working to deliver a new experience to help our customers identify applications in their tenant that are using Azure AD Graph APIs. This will be enabled through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-use-recommendations">Microsoft Entra Recommendations</a> experience. We’re expecting to enable this experience in the first months of 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to audit logs behavior for custom security attributes&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning in October 2023, changes were made to custom security attribute audit logs for general availability that might impact your daily operations. If you’ve been using custom security attribute audit logs during the preview, here are the actions you must take before February 2024 to ensure your audit log operations aren't disrupted:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use new audit logs location.&nbsp; 
 Assign Attribute Log roles to view audit logs. &nbsp; 
 Create new diagnostic settings to export audit logs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/custom-security-attributes-manage#changes-to-audit-logs-behavior">Changes to audit logs behavior</a>.  &nbsp;<br> </p>
<p>Changing sign-in audience for new applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will change the default value of 'signInAudience' property in app registration from 'AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount' to 'AzureADMyOrg'. Our analysis shows that most new applications do not ever support users outside the application tenant. This will improve latency and security of apps. For more information on application sign-in audience, refer to the documentation <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0#signinaudience-values">application resource type - Microsoft Graph v1.0 | Microsoft Learn</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling app instance lock by default&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting March 2024, new applications created using Microsoft Graph application API will have “App instance lock” enabled by default. The capability called App instance lock for workload identities was launched in September 2023. This feature allows app developers to protect their multi-tenant apps from attackers tampering with critical properties. Applications created using Entra ID portal already have the setting enabled by default, and going forward, it will be enabled for other app creation surface areas such as MS Graph, PowerShell, and SDKs. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-configure-app-instance-property-locks">How to configure app instance property lock in your applications | Microsoft Learn</a>.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>My Account is replacing legacy profile page&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-new-feature-and-change-announcements/ba-p/3796396">announced</a> the legacy profile page will be replaced with a new, modernized experience. This is a reminder that My Account (<a href="https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com/">https://www.myaccount.microsoft.com</a>) will replace the existing Profile page (<a href="https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile">https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r#/profile</a>) by January 2024. My Account enables customers to manage account details, language and privacy settings, security information, and more. My Account has been around for several years and has all the functionality of the legacy profile page. This deprecation is moving customers to a better and more modern experience. No actions are required by the customers, as customers will be automatically directed to the new My Account experience. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, we talked about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">the risks that come with granting OAuth tokens without restraint</a> across your organization and mentioned two ways to manage this process:</p>
 
 You can periodically check your Google admin console to see what permissions are authorized and manually revoke access where needed.&nbsp; 
 Or you can also easily track this information with YeshID.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of access to your Google Workspace, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions granted to third-party applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And today, we’re making it even easier to gather those insights and take immediate action with new data visualization capabilities in YeshID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s explore how data visualization can play a pivotal role in mitigating risks like data exposure and unintentional oversharing of permissions. We’ll introduce you to our new visualization tool along the way.&nbsp;</p>
 Our risk representation of OAuth scopes&nbsp; 
<p>Humans are really good at pattern recognition, and seeing things drawn or color-coded can help us quickly grasp a concept. In this case, we can use data visualization to provide a granular representation of OAuth scopes (the permissions granted to applications), breaking them down into easily digestible components and allowing you to pinpoint areas of high risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This clarity enables informed decision-making when it comes to understanding exposure from connected applications and adjusting permissions to align with organizational security policies. YeshID’s data visualization breaks OAuth scopes into a digestible color-coded graph so you can easily pinpoint areas of risk. We use <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/production-readiness/sensitive-scope-verification">Google’s sensitive/restricted scope classification system</a> to categorize granted scopes on a green, yellow, red basis. Find an anomaly? We also make it easy to revoke or block access.</p>
 Not just a pretty picture 
<p>Once you have an idea of what looks suspicious, YeshID makes it easy to act with options to revoke, block, or manage applications.</p>
 
 Revoking a third-party application’s access essentially invalidates the access that your users have granted to an application. However, this is temporary and your user could grant permissions again. We allow you to mark it as ‘Forbidden,’ and we will highlight it if access has been regranted. 
 Blocking an OAuth token goes a step further by preventing the associated application from requesting access to the user’s Google Workspace data altogether — a cumbersome process <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en">when done through the Admin Console</a>. 
 
<p>Here it is in action.</p>
<p></p>
 Try YeshID now 
<p>Data visualization within YeshID transforms the complexity of app access management into a visual narrative that’s easier to grasp at a glance. By harnessing the power of visualizations, you can navigate the challenges of OAuth tokens, enhance security measures, and foster a culture of awareness and responsibility among users. <a href="https://yeshid.com/visualization/">Learn more</a>.</p>

<p>“Social media really, really helps to connect. There are so many places I’ve gone to and they already know me,” Kisakye&nbsp;says.</p><p>Kisakye is a 30-year-old budding musician in Kampala. She juggles a full-time office job with performing at restaurants and bars on the weekends and weekday evenings. She posts videos of her singing on Instagram and YouTube to promote her talent and get gigs. Kisakye’s positive experience of social media’s impact on gaining visibility and earning an income with creative work are echoed by many youths&nbsp;today.</p><p>As Kisakye’s experience highlights, digitalization is transforming the culture and creative industries. Digital platforms, like Instagram, offer young artists new ways to produce their work and reach a broader range of audiences and consumers within and beyond&nbsp;Uganda.</p><p>A shift to online markets gives creatives <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/104121621556036559/pdf/Cities-Culture-Creativity-Leveraging-Culture-and-Creativity-for-Sustainable-Urban-Development-and-Inclusive-Growth.pdf">greater independence</a> from traditional intermediaries and middlemen (such as publishers or galleries), making the sector a more viable income source for talented youth. Alice, a young creative who trained as a lawyer but today runs a digital content company, shared how she started by publishing blogs&nbsp;online:</p><p>“I started with a blog on WordPress. Just writing simply for the sake of writing because I enjoyed it. Later, I started to really think about what I could do with the space and community I had created not just to provide information and entertainment but also be able to make a living for&nbsp;myself.”</p><p>As digitalization presents new avenues for income generation, young creatives like Kisaskye and Alice have more agency and confidence to chart new paths. Kisakye plans to leave her office job in the future and says social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube will be a central part of her career as a musician.</p><p>But before she quits her job, Kisakye says she needs skills that will support her music career. She wants to learn how to sing better, how to produce music, and how to use digital platforms to reach even bigger audiences. She needs more knowledge about copyright issues and protections. Kisakye is already trying to learn new skills&nbsp;online:</p><p>“I went to YouTube before I did a show and there was this lady telling us how to sing, how to create more space for your vocals. I did it and realized that I had more space to really let my voice move. And, then I realized, ‘oh my gosh, there’s so much I could&nbsp;learn.’”</p><p>Alice, who has considerable experience as a content creator, wants to learn better financial management practices:</p><p>“I think the management of finances is definitely a hard part because now you are working for yourself and you need to know how to move your money and grow it. Building long-term strategies, specifically financially, is a tool we could all&nbsp;use.”</p><p>Together, the skills Alice and Kisakye refer to are what <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/">Caribou Digital </a>refers to as <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/skillsforadigitalage/">skills for a digital age,</a> a diverse set of skills that go beyond digital skills (using digital platforms, coding, or e-commerce selling) and include others like financial management, business management, project management, and communication skills. These are some of the technical, digital, and soft skills needed to thrive on digital platforms.</p><p>Kisakye, Alice, and 35 other Ugandan creatives shared their experiences as part of Caribou Digital’s research on how young people in the culture and creative industries are navigating and adapting to digitalization-driven changes, with a focus on skills, in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation. They are poets, illustrators, cartoonists, performance artists, writers, podcasters, visual artists, filmmakers, fashion designers, and gamers, all between ages 18 and 35 and based in&nbsp;Kampala.</p><p>Caribou Digital conducted this research in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation under their Young Africa Works initiative, which aims to enable 30 million young Africans, 70% of whom will be women, to access dignified and fulfilling work by 2030. The Foundation views the creative industry in Africa as one of the pathways to employment for young people, particularly if they have the right&nbsp;skills.</p><p>The research includes four&nbsp;outputs:</p>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Skilling-Ugandas-young-creatives-for-a-digital-age-A-way-forward.pdf">Overall Executive summary: Skilling Uganda’s young creatives for a digital age: A way&nbsp;forward</a>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Skills-for-a-digital-age-for-Ugandas-young-creatives.pdf">Findings: Skills for a digital age for Uganda’s young creatives</a>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Skilling-Ugandas-young-creatives-for-a-digital-age-Recommendations.pdf">Skilling Uganda’s young creatives for a digital age: Recommendations</a>  <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ugandas-culture-and-creative-industries-in-a-digital-age-A-landscape-review.pdf">Uganda’s culture and creative industries in a digital age: A landscape review</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/ugandas-young-creatives-a-case-for-more-skills-for-a-digital-age-da0f331f2b25">Uganda’s young creatives: A case for more skills for a digital age.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>For anyone <a href="https://community.openai.com/t/how-can-you-protect-your-gpt/500642">paying attention</a> to the OpenAI DevDay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk">announcements</a> a few weeks ago, Gizmodo’s recent article “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/security-vulnerabilities-openai-chatgpt-custom-gpt-1851057912">Be Careful What You Tell OpenAI’s GPTs</a>” shouldn’t come as news. (To refresh everyone’s memory, “GPTs” were announced as OpenAI’s platform for building custom agents that can be shared as apps with other users.) It was clear from the demos and presentations that the GPT Store will expose to the public your prompts, the “Knowledge” files you upload, the APIs used for “Actions,” and any metadata your GPT employs. YouTube videos like <a href="https://youtu.be/gEf0BPkqQSM">this one</a> even demonstrate in detail how shockingly easy it is to acquire this information with a few simple hacks.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious security concerns, it also invalidates any commercial value promised by the GPT Store because there can essentially be no proprietary intellectual property—the GPT Store will simply become one giant copy machine.</p>
<p>But then, maybe we don’t need the GPT Store to be so much an innovation center as a relationship store (as in “storage” in this case). This is something I proposed at our recent cyberevolution conference in my presentation, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5437/3">Thanks to AI, the Future of Security is Collaborative</a>.” It’s a concept that bears repeating in this context.</p>
 The App Store was Never Actually About You, Anyway 
<p>Apple is lauded profusely for its human-centric design. But I posit that it merely seems user-friendly—it’s actually a developer-centric design with enough glitz to retain the attention of us normals. As Exhibit A, I offer the home screen of the iPhone. Let’s say you want to send your friend Sam a message; the first problem you’re confronted with is which messaging app to use. In your mind, you have to work through a matrix, which looks something like this:</p>



App
When to use
Why use it now?

<p>Table 1: A rubric for deciding which messaging app to use right now (e-mail apps excluded)</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, I prompted Stability.ai’s DreamStudio to generate a phone with only messaging apps on the home screen (no need to reverse-engineer the prompt, I provide it for you). The “message” of the image is of course to satirize the consternation this screen evokes in the human who faces so many nuanced options simply to message a friend. I think DreamStudio got this one exactly right because the text under the weird icons isn’t even intelligible 😀.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, who actually benefits from the App Store approach? It’s clearly not the user. Unsurprisingly, App stores are for the sellers and the apps represent a relationship between you and the developer. If you want to chat with a friend, you’ll first need to figure out which of your developer friends you want to broker that message.</p>
 Not Apps, not GPTs—GPme 
<p>I got an e-mail from OpenAI on December 1st, reiterating the company’s desire to empower “builders” with more tools and announcing the launch of the GPT store “early next year.” (Note: e-mail seems a rather old-fashioned way to communicate information about GPTs; but it’s ubiquitous, so I guess that’s the kind of calculation they made in the marketing department.) In case you didn’t get the message, here it is:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Short and to the point—not even any mention of Sam Altman. Perfect. But the e-mail reinforces the point that OpenAI is courting “builders” (erstwhile developers) rather than the natural inhabitants of AI space: personas.</p>
<p>Whether the economic incentives of OpenAI will prove sustainable for builders remains to be seen; but the platform can already support persona-to-persona relationships on the internet. Let me explain.</p>
<p>In my cyberevolution presentation, I introduced a new species, one that lives natively on the internet: Homo ex machina. I asked ChatGPT for a definition and got a surprisingly well-thought-out response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Homo ex machina" is a Latin phrase that could be translated into English as "Man from the machine." This phrase seems to be a play on the term "deus ex machina," which means "god from the machine" and refers to a plot device where a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by an unexpected intervention. "Homo ex machina" could imply a human being emerging from or created by a machine, possibly referring to the concept of artificial intelligence or cybernetic organisms in a philosophical or literary context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view, GPTs shouldn’t be viewed as a kitchen appliance like Talkie Toaster or a sentient being like I, Robot, which are separate from natural persons; rather, they should make natural persons more like an internet-native version of Iron Man. DALL-E seemed to get it right away—on the first prompt.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DALL-E prompt: A human with a superhero suit on that bestows god-like powers</p>
<p>A GPme (working title) is a personal power up that combines your humanity with superpowers. Your apparent intelligence will be near genius level; your knowledge will be encyclopedic; your linguistic skills will extend to fluency in dozens of languages; your creativity will be unbounded. You may even become a decent driver.</p>
 How GPme Storage would Foster Trustful Relationships 
<p>What we really want those icons on our home screens to represent is the totality of our relationships—our relationships to other people, other GPme’s, groups, businesses, governments, and even our enemies. Behind each of those social emoticons lies an avatar representing our personal interests in that relationship. The GPme would retain all the history, all the promises, all the aspirations as well as an accounting of the contributions made and the current status of the relationship. In this way, relationships will become more symmetrical, fair, and trustful.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A GPme for All Seasons</p>
 GPme’s also change the game for decentralized identity 
<p>For the decentralized identity crowd out there (including all the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a> folks), take notice: by using GPTs (or similar agents such as Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio">CoPilots</a>) as a relationship aggregator rather than an app store, we have the beginnings of a new type of decentralized identity. It’s not a wallet, it’s not a self-sovereign identity (SSI), and it’s not a decentralized identifier (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>). Instead, we have a (for lack of digital term) fully fleshed out GPT relationship store, which provides a way for individuals to maintain the totality of their relationships with the assistance of powerful AIs. And beyond providing mere channels for connectivity (as messaging apps do), these GPT relationships could function as a trust base.</p>
<p>This in turn would form a network of decentralized trust anchors consisting of persona-to-persona relationships. In this context, the identity data and metadata wouldn’t need to be directly tied to the natural persons who own or operate these personas, enhancing privacy tremendously.</p>
<p>Returning to SSI, ledgers have an important role to play in GPT relationship stores. Whereas apps are at risk from information exposure, revealing information about your GPT relationships turns out to be very helpful from a trust perspective. In fact, information about your GPT relationships should be public, and verifiable, like on a ledger. This approach enables reputation and cost signaling, which are proven to foster interparty trust (see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-future-of-security-is-collaborative-cre23">my cyberevolution slides</a> for references as well as my recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti">Advisory Note</a> on distributed identity).</p>
<p>In summary, using swarms of GPme’s, natural persons can empower GPT actors to both protect them in a hostile, foreboding internet while engaging in meaningful and productive relationships.</p>

 We interview experts from the world of financial services, crypto and gambling to discover some of the year’s major regulatory and technological surprises, and the trends awaiting the identity verification sector in 2024. 



 



<p>We click, we scroll, we awkwardly stare at the camera, and we do that ‘press, but don’t actually press, just lightly rest it upon the side button thing’ every single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we approach 2024, it’s no exaggeration to say we spend most of our lives online; personally, and professionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, we’re probably not too many years away from our digital selves becoming more trusted and, in a way, able to do more than our soft, fleshy human forms. Able to register, transact and be recognized quicker and more effectively online than in person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every industry has gone digital. Fact. It’s not even a controversial and outlandishly sci-fi statement to make anymore. We buy, we sell, we save, we transact, we subscribe and gamble – all online, often without physically interacting with another person, whether in person or online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if we’re spending more time online, then it’s important to be able to prove our identity – that we are who we say we are, and that the people we’re interacting with are who they claim to be. This is where industry regulations, rules and established processes like identity verification data and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> come into play. Laws ensure online users behave in a legally binding and appropriate way.</p>



 Accountability vs anonymity. 



<p>But, what about an internet user’s right to remain anonymous and even more importantly, their right to privacy? &nbsp;</p>



<p>The desire for anonymity may not necessarily be rooted in the wish to engage in illegal activities away from prying eyes, but more as a genuine concern for how their personal identifiable information and other important data could be hacked and tracked or even used for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How to balance accountability with anonymity has been a conundrum since the internet was first invented and is a recurring bone of contention whenever new regulation or frameworks are created. The ongoing, fractious exchanges on the details of the proposed Electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS 2.0) have been testament to that. More on that later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite tech titans’ claims to the contrary, there is no simple one-size fits all answer to the question of how to offer both anonymity and privacy. If there was, organizations would never be fined for internal failings like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">AML</a> and KYC deficiencies; users would never fall victim to fraud; and the internet would be a wonderland, free from financial crime, scams and hate speech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it’s not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A potential answer lies in the balancing act between the needs of the corporation and the needs of the consumer, in the open and ongoing dialogue between regulatory decisionmakers and industry insiders for the common purpose of a secure and attractive marketplace, and in the clever deployment of technology that can optimize processes while ensuring a superior digital customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog, we speak to our Spotlight Interview alumni, as well as IDnow’s own experts to discover the sector developments that have surprised them in 2023, and what trends they predict will have the most impact in 2024.</p>

<p></p>
 
 



 Is that the real you, or is that just your identity? 



<p>The global digital identity solution market is projected to grow from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/digital-identity-solutions-market-247527694.html">$34.5 billion in 2023</a> to a staggering $83.2 billion by 2028. The main reasons for the growth are the increasing usage of online services (across an ever-expanding range of sectors and use cases); the introduction of more cost-effective AI/ML-powered services; and the rise in SME adoption of identity management solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of 2024. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are simply staggering.</p>



 Is traditional banking dead? 



<p>Unsurprisingly, considering how important identity checks are in heavily regulated industries like financial services, the banking sector performed the lion’s share of identity verification checks in 2023 (37 billion), which is more than half of the global identification market. The days of visiting branches to verify your identity to open a bank account, or make a transaction payment are nearing the end, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb3f99a2-bd4c-4ba1-8cb9-432ecfbf73ab">closures of approximately one in eight bank branches</a> in the UK in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>In 2023, we’ve seen a lot of interest in FinTechs, including neobanks. The digital-only trend has certainly not gone unnoticed by traditional banks, which are now looking into what technologies and what partners can do to help them improve aspects such as user experience.&nbsp;</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Global Head of Crypto and FinTech at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>The use of technology to optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience and ultimately reduce fraud has become pivotal, regardless of the sector, but especially in financial services. Financial services are often at the forefront of technological innovation and leading the charge toward safer and more secure environments for transacting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Little wonder then that the global growth in volume of identity verification checks has been <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">driven largely by banks adopting stronger biometric identity</a> verification methods in a bid to combat fraud, in particular account takeover and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/card-not-present-cnp-fraud/">card-not-present fraud</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It will come as no surprise that financial services continue to be the industry most exposed to fraudsters,” said Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow. “Fraudsters and the technology at their disposal are becoming increasingly more sophisticated.”</p>



 The never-ending cat and mouse game of fraud prevention. 



<p>The amount of money lost to fraud is staggering. In the UK alone, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">approximately £3 billion is lost every single year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Lovro said that there were three things that surprised him:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“First was the rapid rise of social engineering, from phone calls to SMS, emails, phishing, everything has increased. The second surprise for me is that physical document fraud has almost completely disappeared – it’s not zero, but it’s a very steep curve down. Unfortunately, the quality of fraudulent documents has improved dramatically, with hologram production at such a high level now that they’re more difficult to detect.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third development that surprised Lovro in 2023 was how innovative many fraudsters have become regarding the use of synthetic fraud, synthetic identities and deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I thought it would take another few years before we got to this stage. Up until very recently, synthetic fraud was very rudimentary, but it is getting much better and more sophisticated.</p>Lovro Persen, Director of Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>As identity verification methods like liveness checks are known to prevent spoofing and other types of fraud, organizations that have not been using biometric verification methods in 2023 should be doing so in 2024 to protect their business, their customers, and their reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the use of the latest forms of identity verification technology can certainly help organizations learn more about their customers, and thereby prevent fraud in the process, there are certain types of social engineering fraud, like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> that take advantage of human emotional frailty, so are harder to safeguard against.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ex-police officer and self-professed fraud nerd, Paul Stratton agrees that the increase in social engineering is a worrying trend that will unfortunately continue into 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Romance and ‘repeat victimization’ fraud (e.g.: a romance fraud victim is steered into investment fraud) will continue to prosper. Breaking the cycle of manipulation and coercion is almost impossible when that person believes it is all legitimate… This is when banks and financial institutions must step in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/"> Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator</a>, who also dedicates a lot of her time researching and helping to prevent human trafficking, it’s also important to factor in the link between social engineering fraud, and human trafficking violations.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Today, highly organized scam compounds run rampant in countries like Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar and force ‘workers’ to groom, manipulate and defraud victims of romance and investment scams worldwide.</p>Jinisha Bhatt, AML and crypto fraud investigator.</blockquote>



<p>“The larger the pool of financial fraud victims, the higher the demand for scam factory workers. This is a machine that continues to feed itself at an insurmountable cost to human beings on each end of the cycle. While we focus our efforts on preventing pig butchering scams, we must also continue to enhance international cooperation among law enforcement and strengthen measures to impose human rights-related sanctions against entities and individuals who profit from this crime.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever the reason banks or any organization chooses to overhaul their customer onboarding process and internal controls, an identity verification platform that can address the aforementioned three driving forces: optimize operational efficiencies, enhance customer experience, reduce fraud – will further accelerate the mass adoption of digital identity verification services.</p>



<p>As consumers become more wary about sharing their PII data due to privacy concerns or the risk of data breaches and the rise of identity theft, synthetic identity fraud or account takeover there is a need for organizations to switch their focus from frictionless user journeys to optimized user journeys with ‘good friction’ that not only deters fraudsters but also increases consumer confidence and trust in the organizations onboarding process. It is a balance between convenience and security for consumer confidence that needs to be carefully managed.</p>



 Play time’s over: The year that crypto was forced to grow up. 



<p>As a sector that by its very existence questions the limitations of established systems and structures, it is understandable that many crypto firms experiment with new ways of doing business, with some even making the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">risky decision to forgo traditional KYC checks</a> altogether. While 2023 proved an important and somewhat stabilizing year for the evolution of the industry, with both the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets regulatory framework</a>,( MiCA) and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed regulatory regime,</a> taking significant steps toward completion, it was also a somewhat unsettled year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think what surprised me most about 2023 was the sheer level of turbulence. In fact, there is still ongoing litigation with many major crypto names. Reassuringly however, this hasn’t halted innovation, which is what crypto is all about. We saw the likes of Worldcoin launch, which is a new take on identity and proof of personhood, so it’s these kinds of developments that show that crypto is making significant strides in the right direction,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d153b0-0c28-4946-acbe-2e93329bca52">convict the founder of FTX of money laundering</a> and fraud sent shockwaves through the industry and should act as a warning shot that the upstart industry of crypto needs to play by the established rules of financial services, especially regarding Anti-Money Laundering directives, and KYC processes. Is play time over for crypto? If not, then the days of transacting in complete anonymity, without restrictions, and of celebrities promoting unregulated platforms, certainly are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the digital identity verification industry, and to an extent, the wider technological community is sure to admire the innovative steps taken by crypto to think outside the box in 2023, regulatory bodies are losing patience. And with 2024 likely to be the year that the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer of Funds Regulation</a>,&nbsp; MiCA, and the UK’s equivalent will be implemented, that patience is sure to be tested more than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some argue that existing and upcoming crypto requirements are too harsh, prohibitively so, especially the UK’s financial promotions regime for crypto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of crypto firms currently perceive <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-promotions-uk-crypto/">financial promotions</a> as a massive burden and barrier of entry to the UK market. I hope the restrictions are softened somewhat in 2024, otherwise what we may find is a reduction in number of crypto firms in the UK market, which may, in turn push crypto users to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/">either grey market platforms or to offshore operators</a>, which would surely put a dent in the UK’s plans to become an international crypto hub,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In general, though, Jason remains optimistic about the state of crypto in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re on the cusp of new individuals and new flows entering the crypto space, which will be a very beneficial development and hopefully lead to a more positive crypto environment in 2024. Also, in March of next year, we will see the bitcoin halving, which is an exciting time for the crypto market, because the rate of supply of newly mined bitcoin is halved.”</p>



 



 

 



 



 Regulatory reflection: Betting on an online future. 



<p>Creating regulatory frameworks that not only protect the consumer, but also provide an attractive environment for operators is essentially the role of regulation, and regulatory bodies from around the world have certainly been busy this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the above crypto frameworks to the reassessment of existing gambling regulations in as disparate markets as the UK and Curaçao, 2023 has reminded every industry, especially gambling, of the importance, and opportunity of regularly updated regulation. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“One of the major surprises in the gambling industry for 2023 was that Brazil is now firmly on track to regulate both sports betting and online casinos, it’s the right thing to do because regulating the full portfolio of products will be critical to the success of the Brazilian market, including the ability of the authorities to clamp down on the grey market of operators that choose not to apply for a license,” said Martin Lycka, SVP American Regulatory Affairs and Responsible Gambling at Entain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Elsewhere in LatAm, Peru and Chile have been exploring regulation in 2023, and I do think that North American markets and regulators will also be keeping a close eye on proceedings too.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our own gambling expert, Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk agreed with Martin regarding the sunny outlook for the LatAm online gambling market and expressed his pleasant surprise at the pace of gambling regulation in Brazil.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflecting on 2023, Roger did admit that not all surprises were of the positive variety.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>One of the major surprises for me was learning of the increasing numbers of German players that were migrating to the grey market, due in part to the high tax rates subjected to regulated platforms, and other player restrictions.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Director of Global Gambling at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Such restrictions include 5 second spin durations, €1 stake limit, and €1000 max deposit per month across all licensed operators. In a bid to cut costs, operators who are compliant and licensed in Germany may decide to either pull out of the market, reduce their sponsorship budget (which will negatively impact grassroots sports), or focus on other markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a lose-lose, and not a great situation for the German economy, but I remain positive that German regulators will take the time to assess the situation and perhaps reevaluate its tax strategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the battle currently being waged on black market gambling in Germany in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">blog, ‘Exploring black market gambling in Germany.’</a></p>



<p>Roger also believes that while the UK market is doing the right thing by <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">running a series of consultations</a> on revisions to its online gambling regulation, like proposed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/reimagining-affordability-financial-risk-check/">financial risk checks</a>, he did worry about the impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, much like the player exodus in Germany, I fear that 2024 may see UK players start to gravitate to the grey market unless upcoming regulatory changes are attractive to both the market and players.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can regulation ever have a negative impact upon a market’s growth? For Martin, it’s a delicate balancing act.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It might be stating the obvious, but if regulations are introduced and it’s required to be implemented, then it’s for good reason in the long run and is money worth spent. But there is a fine line to tread between overly onerous regulation that may not be adding any value, and regulation that is efficient.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the gambling industry can teach us anything, it’s that the pace at which the digital world moves means the need for agile, and regularly updated frameworks and guidelines is paramount to ensure industry players operate in a fair and transparent environment.</p>

 Balancing act: The role of regulation. 



<p>Whatever the industry, there is perhaps no regulation or requirement as important in the digital identification space as KYC. This is why KYC, in some form or another, is mandatory in most industries, including financial services, crypto, gambling, among others. Despite its origins dating way back to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjpis-F6rGCAxX8X0EAHTPAAoQQFnoECBAQAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dowjones.com%2Fprofessional%2Frisk%2Fglossary%2Fknow-your-customer%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DKYC%2520regulations%2520originated%2520from%2520years%2Cand%25202008%2520global%2520financial%2520crisis.&amp;usg=AOvVaw2o_D_jE3NQ3Ig7i62H2uso&amp;opi=89978449">1970, with the passing of the Bank Secrecy Act</a>, KYC regulations and requirements are regularly updated, with most notable and significant revisions occurring following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 2008 global financial crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Changes to the KYC process can also occur whenever changes to associated regulations like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> are made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jinisha has been pleasantly surprised by some of this year’s developments regarding AML and is eagerly awaiting the domino effect of clearer and more consistent legislation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“After hundreds of iterations to AML regimes and endless conversations on beneficial ownership registries, it seems that the global financial crime sector is ready to mobilize support for effective ‘transparency’. As per <a href="https://transparencycanada.ca/news/billc42updatesnovember2-2023">Transparency International</a>, 132 countries have made commitments to beneficial ownership registries. Many G7 and G20 countries have adopted the ‘Open Ownership’s Beneficial Ownership Data Standard’ to ensure their national registries are interoperable with the rest of the world’s. These standards will eventually help us uncover connections between opaque shell corporations, sanctions evaders, and PEPs across the world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the concept of AML and KYC has remained the same over the years, the importance and how they are used has changed dramatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Banks are beginning to understand that KYC checks can be seamlessly integrated into the client onboarding process, eliminating the need for customers to feel burdened by them,” said Vivek Mishra, Operations Manager at WNS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Digital identification solutions are also increasingly being used to enable customers to authenticate their identity online without submitting any physical proof. The focus on the customer experience is a good thing, since it indicates that banks are beginning to prioritize their clients at last. Additionally, it implies that KYC checks are getting more successful and efficient, which is excellent news for banks and their clients,” said Vivek.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The increasingly multi-purpose use of KYC, the current and second iteration of eIDAS, and national AML laws are just three regulations and requirements that have greatly improved safeguards in digital transactions for regulated market sectors in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow, said that although many positive steps were taken this year, she stressed the importance of careful route-planning and ongoing collaboration with relevant stakeholders to ensure that the European Union gets important regulation like eIDAS 2.0 right.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>There is still more that needs to be done and the challenge is to support an aligned framework that remains reliable, innovative and secure. IDnow fully supports the call for building a more harmonized framework that addresses interoperability, innovation, and most importantly – security.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director of Global&nbsp;Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Rayissa added that future frameworks should therefore factor in the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Identification that can be reused across borders and sectors (public and private)<br>  Establishing standards for developments in technology with appropriate levels of security<br>  Continued collaboration between the public and private sectors&nbsp;  



<p>For Viky Manaila, President of Cloud Signature Consortium, the next few years will prove crucial for the global digital identity landscape.</p>



<p>“eIDAS 2.0 regulation and its evolution during the trilogue surprised everybody in the identity ecosystem, with positive and less positive amendments. As it comes close to the final destination, the next period will be critical for defining the implementing acts, the standards in support of the new services and certification scheme with cross-border interoperability in mind.”</p>

 2023: The year when digital identity became must-have. 



<p>This year’s growth in popularity of identity verification solutions can partly be attributed to the adoption of additional new use cases, for example in facilitating remote recruitment. In fact, 2023 could be categorized as the year that organizations began to unlock, or at least peek through the peephole into the future of how digital identity verification could potentially be used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some EU states have made significant developments in their own digital identity systems, such as <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202310/ukraines-digital-identity-app-growing-and-becoming-an-inspiration-for-other-countries">Ukraine’s digital identity app, Diia,</a> which is used for storing biometric passports, tax IDs and driver licenses, to access private and public services, others are taking a much more considered approach to modernizing their identity landscape. For example, the UK has <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">introduced the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> – a set of rules and standards for identity verification service providers to follow in order to offer certain use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although each country will naturally have its own idea of how it wants its citizens to use their digital identities, the future success of digital identity and the digital wallet will invariably be linked to its interoperability, across sectors (public and private), and across regions. For that to happen, however, a standard and generally agreed-upon course forward needs to be set, which of course requires intensive discussions from all interested parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) published a technical report analysing selective disclosure and zero knowledge proofs for the EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sebastian Elfors, Senior Architect at IDnow, who co-authored the <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_tr/119400_119499/119476/01.01.01_60/tr_119476v010101p.pdf">ETSI paper</a>, said: “The report has received tremendous interest from the industry, with constructive feedback from the self-sovereign identity community and experts in W3C, GSMA, and several other standardization organizations. The EU Cybersecurity Agency (ENISA) and ETSI and CEN remain on standby to provide the relevant standards and certification schemes for the EUDI Wallet and Qualified Trust Service Providers under eIDAS 2.0.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remaining cautiously optimistic on the future of digital identity, Viky said: “The new commercial models for services around identity proofing, and verifiable credentials on top of the Wallets have the potential to unleash the missing part of digital transformation. If these services are customer-centric designed, they will take off. Otherwise, they will become just another type of digital platform asking for all sorts of personal information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although 2023 has seen the ongoing development of pivotal regulations like eIDAS 2.0, alongside the introduction of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/world-coin-crypto-iris/">new ways of identifying customers, such as iris scans</a>, the pace of development in the digital identity space hasn’t suited everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I’m surprised by how many times I still have to enter passwords given that Apple, Google and Microsoft are all implementing the passkeys standard. Only yesterday it took me three guesses to remember my telco password and I had to do a password reset on one of my American bank accounts. Please make it stop!</p>David Birch, global advisor and thought leader in financial services.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>However, David did admit that the upcoming ISO mobile driving licence, which both Google and Apple have added to their wallets is sure to accelerate adoption and put Wallets fairly and squarely in the public discourse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumers will rapidly become comfortable with this mode of presenting standardized credentials in both face to face and remote environments,” added David.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although it’s difficult to predict the future of digital identity verification with any kind of certainty, it is highly likely that it will continue to be used for ever-increasing and multi-purpose use cases, and that any changes that do occur will be precipitated by a combination of technological advancement, regulatory input, fraud trends, and, of course, consumer preference.</p>



 Risks vs rewards: AI and the modern workplace.&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a reason why <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-67271252">Collins Dictionary named AI</a> the word of the year in 2023. Artificial intelligence was on the lips of every organization (and unfortunately every fraudster) this year, and with good reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The potential of generative AI, in particular, has many organizations salivating over their budget sheets due to AI’s ability to automate, augment and accelerate working processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a safe bet, therefore, that industries will continue to experiment with AI-powered processes in 2024. In fact, many industries are already reaping the benefits of AI to increase automation, reduce costs and offer more accurate and streamlined identity verification methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vivek certainly recognizes the value in doing so: “I anticipate that as banks and other financial institutions strive to increase their efficiency and security in 2024, AI-powered KYC and banking solutions will become even more widely adopted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s important to not delegate all tasks to AI. Yes, AI and technology in general, can be used as a competitive advantage, but success in 2024 and beyond will almost certainly come from the clever combination of humans and technology, and recognizing the relative merits of both. In identity verification, this may mean AI is reserved for simpler data-scouring tasks, freeing up resources and enabling staff to concentrate on more difficult jobs, like performing manual identity verification checks on high assurance use cases, or delivering more personalized, superior customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, AI has also been weaponized by fraudsters. While in the past, cybercriminals needed a certain base level of technical skills to produce fake documents or websites, AI-augmented fraudsters can utilize generative AI to create authentic-looking documents, videos, images and audio. A trend that will continue in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I expect to see an increase in the use of AI for fraudulent purposes, which makes the innovative use of AI to combat it, and fingerprint scanning and biometric analysis all the more important, alongside human input,” added Lovro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is your organization prepared for the future?</p>



 Inclusivity and accessibility: Making the connected world a safer, fairer place. 



<p>As our digital identities become more established and entrenched in regulations and legal frameworks, it’s important to remember the importance of collaboration on the common goal of making a safer, more secure online world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, IDnow made significant strides toward making the connected world a safer place, becoming the only European identity verification provider to be awarded two certifications for the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/pvid-certification-idcheck-io-and-videoident/">French remote identity verification standard known as PVID</a> (prestataire de verification d’identité à distance) at ‘substantial’ level. We also became certified by the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/diatf-certified-framework-identity-verirification-provider/">UK’s Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework.</a> </p>



<p>IDnow prides itself as being at the very forefront of innovation in identity verification, and believes that with a layered, holistic approach to identity, businesses can elevate trust and empower experience across the customer journey – no matter the region, industry, or required regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Research and Developments teams have been hard at work throughout 2023; contributing on projects as far ranging as a toolkit to identify and mitigate biases in AI algorithms to the verification of optical variable device (holograms). Our Product team has also been working tirelessly to update, improve and optimize our digital identity verification services, making them the most complete IDV solutions on the market. Such updates include IDnow’s&nbsp;360 Signals, which detects attempts of repeat fraud, by collecting risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources to detect single and serial fraud attempts in real time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have some exciting upcoming developments, including paper photocopy detection, automatic bank account ownership verification and plans to implement WCAG Level AA to ensure our services can be used by people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inclusiveness and accessibility will continue to be an important topic in 2024 and beyond, and <a href="https://www.bundesfachstelle-barrierefreiheit.de/DE/Fachwissen/Produkte-und-Dienstleistungen/Barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz/barrierefreiheitsstaerkungsgesetz_node.html">organizations will soon be legally required</a> to provide a certain level of accessabilty in their solutions or face legal reprecusssions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many factors that lead to inequality in identity verification. Age, disability, neurodiversity, lack of docs for proof or identity or lack of photo are all problems that identity verification providers must improve to provide access to digital services for all. Bridging these gaps requires inclusive design, technological adaptations, and policies addressing diverse accessibility needs, to ensure equitable digital service access for all. IDnow’s video verification enables organizations to improve inclusivity, accessibility, safety, and convenience for all their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have valued and trusted relationships with various international police and counter fraud organizations, including INTERPOL, and the French Scientific Police (the forensics arm of the police) with whom we exchange knowledge and share best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is these relationships and these industry insights that allow us to move quickly and keep abreast of industry trends and developments to offer a comprehensive&nbsp;multi-jurisdictionally compliant identity verification solution. For example, in preparation for the opening of the Brazilian online gambling market, we integrated <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/automated-cpf-database-checks-brazilian-gambling/">CPF database checks</a>. Our market-leading identity verification services enable our clients from a variety of sectors to benefit from our proprietary fraud prevention technology and regulatory expertise to provide peace of mind that wherever they operate, and in whatever industry, they can do so compliantly.</p>



 



 

 



 



 The sky is the limit? 



<p>Another major milestone for IDnow in 2023 included the launch of ShopIdent in gas stations throughout Germany. The on-site identification solution enables customers to activate pre-paid SIM cards, open bank accounts, or verify driver’s licenses directly from their local gas station.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, perhaps the most exciting project that we were involved with in 2023 was assisting the International Air Transport Association (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/iata-first-integrated-journey-digital-identity/">IATA) in creating the first ever integrated digital identity travel experience</a>, streamlining the process from flight shopping to arrival. In the Proof-of-Concept trial, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a> was used to store and present digital travel credentials, such as boarding passes and digital visas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We look forward to 2024 with optimism and excitement for what the future holds. While the future of digital identity verification may be uncertain, one thing’s for sure, the sky is no longer the limit.</p>

<p>I am very excited to announce that 1Kosmos is an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/integrating-amazon-cognito-with-1kosmos-blockid-for-enhanced-security-and-user-experience/">official AWS Cognito Passwordless MFA partner.</a></p>
<p>Amazon Cognito places the utmost importance on online account security. To bolster the protection of account holders, starting in 2024, Amazon Cognito made it a goal to expand its multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements, ultimately partnering with 1Kosmos to help the Amazon Cognito team reach its customer security initiatives.</p>
 A Better MFA 
<p>It’s no secret that MFA significantly augments the security of web and mobile applications by necessitating additional identification methods beyond just a password. By implementing various forms of MFA organizations can effectively mitigate the risks associated with user account takeovers, phishing attacks, and password breaches.</p>
<p>To take things a step further, users can elevate their account security through biometric authentication features like TouchID (fingerprint), FaceID and LiveID (a 1Kosmos architectural advantage). Additionally, it offers one-time passwords (OTP) through SMS and email, time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) via a linked mobile authenticator, and push notifications. This flexibility empowers Amazon customers to select the MFA methods that best align with the requirements of their application ecosystem.</p>
 User Experience is Important 
<p>The team at Amazon Cognito places delivering a seamless user experience high on its list of requirements, and that is why partnering with 1Kosmos was a perfect fit. The 1Kosmos MFA capabilities provide a diverse array of authentication choices to accommodate a broad spectrum of users and devices, all with a similar user experience. The 1Kosmos BlockID and Amazon Cognito partnership strikes the right balance between security and usability when developing customer-facing applications.</p>
 Easy Access to Passwordless 
<p>1Kosmos is a trusted AWS Partner and AWS Marketplace Seller offering BlockID and passwordless MFA solutions to elevate online account security. The platform boasts FIDO2 and NIST 800-63-3 certifications, further affirming its reliability. Amazon Cognito customers can easily deploy and directly acquire BlockID through the AWS Marketplace, enabling the implementation of a phishing-resistant passwordless MFA solution.</p>
 Identity Verification 
<p>An optional capability of the 1Kosmos platform, 1Kosmos BlockID provides organizations an automated and cryptographically secure way to verify a virtually unlimited array of identity details including government issued ID, education qualifications, healthcare data, financial account details, and other third-party machine-readable personal information while respecting an individual’s privacy. This provides progressively higher levels of identity assurance for authentication and digitally transforms a broad range of business processes such as worker or contractor onboarding, new customer account origination, and provisioning of digital services.</p>
 Combination of Verification and Authentication 
<p>This capability of the BlockID cloud service has been meticulously crafted to combat identity impersonation, thwart account takeovers, and prevent fraudulent activities, all while offering a user-friendly and frictionless login experience.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID leverages identity-based verification to transparently authenticate users, effectively shielding against account compromises and fraudulent activities. The result of implementing BlockID identity verification with the integration of Amazon Cognito enables organizations to have a higher level of assurance for the users they have under management.</p>
 Privacy by Design 
<p>The 1Kosmos decentralized private blockchain technology empowers individuals with exclusive access and full control over their personally identifiable information, ensuring a privacy-centric design. This approach allows end users to review and authorize or decline the sharing of their data with online services they want to utilize. All personally identifiable information (PII) undergoes end-to-end encryption, guaranteeing that it remains shielded from exposure. Users can directly grant or deny sharing requests to the applications they connect with, without any involvement of third-party intermediaries, such as external public key servers or messaging hosts, ensuring that their data, keys, and plain text messages remain inaccessible to these entities.</p>
 More About 1Kosmos 
<p>Our platform encrypts and securely stores biometrics and ID data within a private, permissioned blockchain, safeguarding user data against potential breaches. BlockID is not only certified to NIST Identity Assurance Level 2 but also compliant with Level 3, showcasing a steadfast commitment to upholding and advancing identity assurance and regulatory compliance.</p>

<p>Effective collaboration is essential for organizations to innovate, make decisions, and drive progress. Over the past few decades, digital technologies have dramatically expanded how we are able to collaborate remotely.&nbsp;</p><p>The introduction of tools like email, instant messaging, wikis, and video conferencing enabled new ways for distributed teams to communicate and work together.</p><p>More recently, all-in-one SaaS collaboration suites from vendors like Slack, Microsoft, and Google have been widely adopted by companies looking to centralize their key business applications.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as remote and hybrid work environments become more prevalent, teams are finding that centralized legacy models for digital collaboration have limitations. This is driving the exploration of distributed and decentralized frameworks that offer greater <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/walkaway-or-why-forking-matters/">control, transparency, and flexibility</a>.</p> The Rise of Centralized Collaboration Suites <p>In the early 2000s, the rise of software as a service (SaaS) paved the way for full-fledged collaboration suites delivered through the cloud. Vendors like Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce began providing bundled productivity and communication applications all under one platform.</p><p>According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, “When I started, I was at Microsoft, right? And collaboration was easy. It was all through the intranet on a centralized server.”&nbsp;</p><p>Over the last decade, this market has continued rapidly expanding. Tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Workspace have become essential platforms that consolidate messaging, video meetings, file sharing, knowledge management, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>While early digital tools enabled discrete modes of teamwork, these centralized suites aim to be comprehensive one-stop shops.&nbsp;</p><p>In the interview, Tien notes that customers are looking to “integrate [tools] with all your different infrastructure, your compliance, and your tools.” For many organizations, adopting an integrated SaaS platform became the obvious path forward as remote and hybrid work began accelerating.</p><p>However, concerns and limitations around relying solely on centralized providers have started to emerge.</p> The Emergence of Distributed Collaboration <p>While centralized systems have become popular, some organizations are exploring alternative distributed frameworks for collaboration. According to Ian Tien, CEO of Mattermost, "The biggest one is, and I'm sure you see it all over the place is this: How do I take these new sorts of LLM AI models and use them to accelerate my work?"&nbsp;</p><p>Tien also states that "the core of it is that when you take the information, let's say, and just like your workplace communications, right, it's not that valuable."&nbsp;</p><p>However, he notes that aggregated data from collaboration tools can provide insights companies may want to keep private. Holochain and other distributed projects aim to give users more <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/what-is-digital-identity/">autonomy and control</a> over their information.</p><p>LLMs combined with generative AI harness enormous amounts of data. While the systems can’t understand data like a human can, they can still create generalizations based on the extremely large datasets.&nbsp;</p><p>If Slack were to implement an LLM model with generative AI, it’s unclear whether your data would be used in conjunction with other company’s data.&nbsp;</p><p>With distributed models, validation happens at the app level between users rather than via centralized consensus. This enables customized security policies tailored to specific collaboration use cases.</p><p>As remote and hybrid work expand, teams want the flexibility to collaborate effectively while maintaining autonomy over their systems and data. Distributed models provide an alternative approach with transparent peer-to-peer connections.</p> What the Future Holds <p>While centralized suites solved many early collaboration challenges, new needs are emerging around flexibility, transparency, and control. Ian Tien summarizes this well:</p><blockquote>"The future of digital collaboration will require increased transparency around data provenance and usage. How can we enable explainability around why systems make certain determinations? What audit trails exist to show the origins and lineage of data used for collaboration?&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>“Users want more clarity not just on what algorithms decide but the underlying data and logic driving those decisions. As collaboration platforms leverage more AI and machine learning, robustly documenting data provenance will only grow in importance. Companies want to ensure they can control and account for how data gets managed in collaborative processes."</blockquote><p>Distributed collaboration frameworks like Holochain offer an alternative paradigm with direct peer-to-peer connections instead of intermediary servers. This agent-centric approach gives users autonomy while still enabling effective teamwork across organizations.</p><p>There are still challenges to making distributed collaboration <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/becoming-viable-seeds-to-saplings/">seamless and scalable</a> for the mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>But with the right blend of usability, security, and customizable control, these emergent technologies could empower teams with a new generation of tools for digital teamwork. The ideal future likely incorporates both centralized and decentralized elements across hybrid technology stacks.</p>

				  Indicio Proven™&nbsp; now provides a privacy-preserving way to record, share, and verify educational achievements.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, Dec 5, 2023, <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the world’s leading world’s leading provider of digital trust solutions, today announced the addition of the <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges</a> 3.0 digital credential format to Indicio Proven™, Indicio’s flagship product for creating and communicating verifiable data.</p>
<p>Open Badges is a powerful digital format for recording educational achievements, skills, and other accomplishments. Increasingly popular as a standard, Open Badges are shared on social media and stored and managed on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>The addition of Open Badges into Indicio Proven, the leading software for enterprise adoption of verifiable credentials, makes it possible for the badge to be directly held and controlled by the person who earned the achievement in a wallet on their mobile device instead of being forced to access their records through a third-party provider or platform.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven makes holding, sharing, and verifying an Open Badges credential truly portable. Now, anyone using the same open-source issuing software can create an Open Badges credential, anyone with the app can receive and share an Open Badges credential, and anyone with the verification software can verify the source and the integrity of the data in the Open Badges credential.</p>
<p>By removing the need for a centralized Open Badges Platform, users have control over their privacy, they can consent to share Open Badge data in secure, privacy-preserving ways, and they — and not the platform — fully own their Open Badges credentials. Indicio will be the first to use the new Open Badge verifiable credentials, issuing them&nbsp; to those who complete training and workshops in the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-academy/">Indicio Academy</a> training and workshops.</p>
<p>“Combining the Open Badges format with a verifiable credential releases its full power,” said Heather Dahl, CEO and co-founder of Indicio. “Similar to the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">Digital Travel Credential we developed on ICAO standards</a>, we’re creating simple ways for our customers to build seamless processes with verifiable data. The Open Badges format is a great way to share and verify detailed academic records and information about skill sets. But now we’ve freed Open Badges to be even greater — to take advantage of interoperable, open-source technology, to be used in faster, more private, and more secure ways, and, of course, to be a record of achievement that can be owned and verified forever.”</p>
<p>Technical details</p>
<p>Indicio’s unique approach combines open-source verifiable credentials based on the W3C Verifiable Credential Data and 1EdTech Open Badges 3.0 (OBv3) standards with open source technologies from Hyperledger Foundation. This enables people to hold the records of their educational achievements in a digital wallet under their own control in perpetuity. These JSON-LD based credentials can be used to easily share verifiable information on social media, when applying to a job online, or with any verifier using open source verifiable credential technology to read the badge.</p>
<p>Open Badges can be issued using Indicio Proven for a wide range of participatory, educational, and learning scenarios and can be verified by ACA-Py and AFJ based agents. Badge types include:</p>

<p>As another year draws to a close, it’s time to start thinking about what trends and challenges may face us in 2024. Next year promises to be a pivotal moment in the evolution of identity management and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). As we grapple with the challenges posed by sophisticated phishing attacks, deepfakes, and the ever-expanding influence of AI, the need for innovative solutions has never been more critical. This blog post explores the emerging trends that will shape the identity landscape, from identity inclusion and access movements to the intersection of AI and security.</p>
<p>Inclusion and Access: Bridging the Digital Divide</p>
<p>The fusion of our physical and digital lives requires a fundamental shift in how we approach identity. As we move toward a future where digital identity underpins social and economic mobility, the importance of inclusivity cannot be overstated. In 2024, there will be a heightened focus on ensuring secure and convenient identity verification, both online and in-person.</p>
<p>Regulatory Surge in the Cyber Risk Landscape</p>
<p>With the Biden administration’s landmark Executive Order setting new standards for AI safety and security, 2024 is poised to see a regulatory surge. Chief information security officers (CISOs) will need to prepare for continued AI regulation, new post-quantum guidance, and anticipated legislation around Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. As guidance from governments increases, businesses must adapt their cybersecurity strategies to navigate a patchwork of regulations and ensure the security of customer data.</p>
<p>AI-Powered Phishing and the Banking Dilemma</p>
<p>The age-old threat of phishing takes on a new dimension in 2024 as AI-enabled phishing becomes more sophisticated and widespread. The financial industry faces a dual challenge with AI. While AI presents opportunities to enhance customer experience and reduce costs, it also intensifies the arms race with hackers. The scalability and effectiveness of AI-driven attacks means that financial institutions must continuously innovate their security and risk management strategies to ensure continued security to their most important assets: PII data and monetary instruments.</p>
<p>Post-Quantum Cryptography: A Looming Challenge</p>
<p>While post-quantum cryptography may not be a top priority for many CISOs today, its existential threat cannot be ignored. In 2024, businesses, especially in the banking sector, must upgrade their cryptography to post-quantum standards. The long data retention mandates in banking make it imperative to prepare for “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” quantum attacks (in which encrypted data that is stolen now could then be accessed once a suitably powerful quantum computer is available), even if quantum computers are not yet a reality. Failure to do so could have repercussions for decades to come.</p>
<p>Open Banking and the Cybersecurity Wild West</p>
<p>Open banking regulation is set to accelerate in the U.S., posing challenges and opportunities for financial institutions. While consumers seek convenience, banks must navigate the potential threat to direct customer relationships. The cybersecurity landscape will undergo growing pains as open APIs introduce new access points and players. Collaboration with regulators and fintechs, combined with advancements in identity verification, is crucial to ensuring the privacy and transparency of financial ecosystems.</p>
<p>Simplifying Tech Complexity for Enhanced Security</p>
<p>Banks face a growing challenge in managing the complexity of their tech stacks, particularly in the realm of identity verification. Fragmentation increases the risk of attacks, making it essential for institutions to consolidate vendors and streamline their ecosystems. Vendor consolidation not only adds an extra layer of protection against bad actors but also facilitates a more seamless experience for consumers.</p>
<p>Biometrics: Striking the Balance Between Security and Convenience</p>
<p>Advancements in biometrics offer a transformative solution to balancing security and convenience in the digital realm. Banks will increasingly use biometric technology, smartphones, and document recognition to enhance security measures. By adopting innovative solutions, institutions can create a system that deters fraud without frustrating users, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>As we embark on the journey through 2024, the intersection of identity, AI, and cybersecurity will define the technological landscape. From changes in how we view identity to the regulatory surge in AI and the ongoing challenges of phishing and post-quantum cryptography, businesses and individuals alike must stay vigilant and adapt to these transformative trends. It’s a year of innovation, adaptation, and collaboration as we navigate the complexities of the digital age.</p>

 Introducing Multi-Party Approval for On-chain Agreements 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in November of 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Welcome to the November edition of the Product Newsletter, where we highlight the product team’s latest upgrades each month.</p>
<p>This month we are discussing the implementation of the multi-party approval feature, an enhancement of the already existing Conditional Transfer Feature.</p>
 We Upgraded The Conditional Transfer Feature 
<p>In our ongoing efforts to streamline and secure the movement of tokenized securities, we recognized a crucial need for our clients:&nbsp;a system that requires approvals from multiple parties before a transfer can proceed.</p>
<p>Our previous&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/security-tokens-conditional-transfer/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8COCRyIXJFk84a0AvtQsPi2B4w9GRwb6NUlUQ5AlZWZTu4ZrU5yaThZsOrBbLwo_YWYfAZ">conditional transfer feature</a>&nbsp;only allows issuers or agents to have one&nbsp;single-party approval. By adding the&nbsp;multi-party approval&nbsp;feature we create a flexible transfer approval process, catering to the diverse needs of our clients.</p>
 The Multi-Party Approval Transfer 
<p>Multi-party approval transfer elevates the transfer validation process by requiring multiple approvals.&nbsp;Issuers gain the flexibility to&nbsp;create custom approval workflows, tailoring the process to fit their specific transactional needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, as&nbsp;multi-party approvals are set up at the smart contract level, approvers have the freedom to choose their preferred wallet solution in order to approve or disapprove transactions, be it multisig wallets, self-hosted wallets, or hard drive wallets.</p>
<p>It’s designed to provide a&nbsp;unified, on-chain agreement signing process, which further streamlines operations, ensuring transparent and immutable recording of approvals on the blockchain. This feature aims to not only&nbsp;streamline the complex token transfer process&nbsp;but also&nbsp;enhance counterparty interactions&nbsp;in asset management.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			 How it Works: 
 
 Setting Up:&nbsp;Issuers, their agent, or equivalent set the rules for each multi-party approval transfer, including who needs to approve it and in any specified order.<br>
Types of approvers:<p></p>
 
 
 
 Recipient of the transfer 
 Custodians of the seller and the buyer 
 Any other approver the issuer or compliance agent wants to appoint 
 
 
 
 
 Initiating Transfer:&nbsp;When an investor requests a transfer, it’s held in a ‘pending’ state, awaiting approvals. 
 Multi-party Review:&nbsp;Issuers and appointed parties review and&nbsp;approve or disapprove&nbsp;the request. 
 Completion:&nbsp;Once all approvals are in place, the transfer is automatically executed, ensuring both security and efficiency. 
 
<p>Please contact us if you are interested in learning more or trying out this feature.</p>

   Background&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many customers face challenges in managing their Conditional Access (CA) policies. Over time, they accumulate more and more policies that are created ad-hoc to solve specific business scenarios, resulting in a loss of overview and increased troubleshooting efforts. Microsoft has provided <a href="https://aka.ms/ca-zt">guidance</a> on how to structure your Conditional Access policies in a way that follows the Zero Trust principles, using a persona-based approach.&nbsp;The guidance includes a set of Conditional Access policies that can serve as a starting point. These CA policies can be automated from a CI/CD pipeline using various tools. One such tool is Microsoft365DSC, an open-source tool developed by members of the Microsoft Graph Product Group, who are still actively involved in its maintenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft365DSC can automate the configuration of various Microsoft 365 workloads, including Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access policies. The diagram below illustrates the role of Microsoft365DSC as a tool for automating Microsoft 365, complementing the automation of Azure that’s typically achieved using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and/or Bicep templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has already been documented how you can use Microsoft365DSC to automate and maintain your Conditional Access policies. Two such sources are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/integrating-with-azure-devops/">Integrating with Azure DevOps</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/ConditionalAccessGovernanceAndPrinciplesforZeroTrust%20October%202023.pdf">Github Conditional Access for Zero Trust Resources</a>&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These solutions work, but they need to either use a self-hosted agent with a managed identity in Azure DevOps or use a shared secret, and neither of the two solutions are optimal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We aim at being able to do the automation from Azure DevOps using a Microsoft-managed agent for the CI/CD pipeline and no shared secrets. The introduction of Workload Identity Federation with Azure DevOps can help us do exactly that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting Started&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution we’re aiming at is depicted in the figure below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea is to have our CI/CD pipeline files hosted in the Azure DevOps repository and make values in an Azure Key Vault available in the pipeline based on configuring Workload Identity Federation between the Azure DevOps project and Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steps to do this are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Configure a service connection the Azure DevOps project settings as shown below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recommended choice can be selected; however, it would automatically create a service principal in Entra ID with permission to the whole Azure subscription that you specify in the settings. To adhere to the principle of least privileged, we suggest using the manual configuration, which means that you manually create the service principal and only assign it permission to the Key Vault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Create an Entra ID App Registration using Federated credentials as shown below:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Add application permissions to the service principal for it to be able to create and update Conditional Access policies. Permissions may include: Policy.Read.All, Policy. ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess, Application,Read.All.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Create a Key Vault in a distinct resource group in an Azure subscription. This subscription should be specifically designed to manage sensitive identity-related workloads. Ideally, it should be located under the “Platform” management group within the “Identity” subscription, provided are adhering to the Enterprise Scale landing zone architecture as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/">documented here</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Create two certificates in the Key Vault, one certificate that will be used to sign Microsoft365 configurations and one that will be used to authenticate Microsoft365DSC tools to Entra ID. See below.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. In the Key Vault access control, assign M365DSCWorkloadIdentity the “Key Vault Secret User” role for it to be able to read secrets that you create.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you should have the basic prerequisites in place for you to create or change your CI/CD pipeline to take advantage of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline definition 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We suggest using a multi-stage pipeline defined in an YML file in your repo, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/caautomationpipeline.yml">specified in this example YML file</a>. When utilizing Microsoft365DSC, the Conditional Access policies that we aim to configure or enforce within our Entra ID tenant should be clearly defined in our repository. Also, as a prerequisite, you need to configure the groups that you refer to in the Conditional Access policies definition either manually in the portal or using automation described in the referenced GitHub resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This information should be contained within a file, which could potentially be named ‘ConfigureCAPolicy.ps1’. The content for this file can be generated through various methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Create your Conditional Access policies in the Entra ID portal and use export-m365DSCConfiguration as documented here: <a href="https://microsoft365dsc.com/user-guide/get-started/snapshot-of-existing-tenant/">Taking a Snapshot of Existing Tenant - Microsoft365DSC - Your Cloud Configuration</a>.&nbsp; 
 Create it manually using any editor.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/ConfigureCApolicy.ps1">Here’s a sample of a Conditional Access policy</a>. You will notice that the file must define that we want to authenticate using the certificate. You can get a full list of the Conditional Access policies in Microsoft365DSC format based on the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/tree/main/ConditionalAccessSamplePolicies/Microsoft365DSCCAPolicies">persona-based approach configured for Zero Trust here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Build Stage 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pipeline for building the solution is divided into two scripts. First, we import the certificates from the Key Vault into the Windows based CI/CD pipeline agent and compile a Microsoft365DSC configuration file into a MOF file that is to be pushed to our Entra ID tenant in the deploy stage. The reason for having this is two scripts is just for ease of debugging. You may choose to combine them into <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/prep.ps1">one script as shown here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/build.ps1">second script here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Deploy stage&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now have our artifacts stored in Azure DevOps and would like to deploy them to our Entra ID tenant. This is done in the deploy stage where the deploy.ps1 is called. The content if <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ConditionalAccessforZeroTrustResources/blob/main/TechCommunityreferences/deploy.ps1">deploy.ps1 is located here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Final comments&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information provided, you should now have a clear understanding of how to automate your Conditional Access policies within Entra ID and manage changes using Azure DevOps, all without the need to store shared secrets within Azure DevOps. We strongly recommend that you experiment with this process and utilize the resources mentioned in the article for more detailed information about the configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we primarily focus on implementing this process through Azure DevOps, it's important to note that GitHub Actions also supports Workload Identity Federation. This provides an alternative solution if you prefer GitHub over Azure DevOps.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today’s interconnected digital landscape, where applications seamlessly integrate to enhance productivity, is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, information is more accessible than ever, requiring switching between apps and services, ostensibly increasing productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the importance of robust identity management cannot be overstated, and if you’re not careful you can lose track of who, what, and where you’ve authorized permissions — and with companies under 2,000 employees <a href="https://youtu.be/s149kAiuCns?t=44">averaging more than 73 SaaS app integrations in 2020</a>, it’s clearly a growing problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s crucial to recognize the potential risks associated with <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth (Open Authorization)</a> grants and how they impact your organization’s data security. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the intricacies of OAuth and shed light on the vulnerabilities that may lurk beneath the surface.</p>
 Broad OAuth access can mean identity sprawl 
<p>Many applications today build on top of each other, using the data from one to power the other. A common example is Google. Google is not one thing; it’s Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc. And for each of these services, Google has a fine-grained API that engineers can use (usually read-only or read-write) to integrate with their products. OAuth is the standard authorization technology across services and is part of what makes an “interconnected” internet experience possible. For example, YeshID Onboard leverages OAuth APIs from Google, Slack, Zoom, and other platforms <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">to streamline identity management</a> for your organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the devil is in the details when it comes to OAuth scopes, which are the permissions granted to applications. An alarming aspect is the breadth of these scopes. Some vendors offer OAuth APIs in an all-or-nothing approach, which hampers the ability to employ least-privilege access principles. This contrasts with providers like Google Workspace, known for their granular scopes, allowing for more specific permissions like manipulating mailbox settings, accessing sensitive files, and even user impersonation. However, granularity does not inherently mean restraint; vendors may still request more permissions than necessary, increasing potential risks.</p>
<p>Complicating matters, the risk of data exposure and account takeover is substantial if an OAuth-integrated application is compromised. This situation is akin to any custodian acting on our behalf; the extent of the compromise is proportional to the level of trust and access we’ve granted. So understanding the granularity and necessity of OAuth scopes is crucial in safeguarding your organization’s sensitive information. It’s imperative to assess not just what permissions are possible, but also what permissions are truly necessary for the task at hand</p>
 OAuth can introduce unintentional vulnerabilities 
<p>One of the major risks lies in users granting OAuth access without fully comprehending the implications, which can lead to unintended vulnerabilities. Consider the scenario of a vulnerability in a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism</a> that allowed unauthorized access using Google credentials. Users, in their quest for convenience, might inadvertently expose sensitive company data by granting access without due diligence.</p>
<p>The accidental use of work credentials in personal applications further exacerbates the problem. This unintentional mingling of professional and personal spheres can result in a breach of company data, underscoring the need for user education on OAuth access and permissions. Here’s an example of what you might wind up with.</p>
 Navigating OAuth security concerns 
<p>Enhancing the security of your accounts can be achieved by clearly understanding the difference between “session length” and “grant validity period.” In OAuth, permissions granted to applications often allow extended, but not indefinite, access to company data, raising potential security concerns. This issue becomes particularly critical when applications with extensive permissions retain this access for prolonged periods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To mitigate risks like unauthorized access, data exposure, and account takeover, it’s essential for leaders to proactively manage and monitor these OAuth grants. Regular reviews and audits of the grant validity periods are key practices in ensuring these permissions are necessary and relevant, and in maintaining the overall security and integrity of your organization’s data. <br>
<br>
Here’s a look at the OAuth request lifecycle to illustrate the issue:</p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to do this is by <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en#zippy=%2Cgmail-high-risk-oauth-scopes%2Cdrive-high-risk-oauth-scopes">using your Google Workspace console</a> and navigating the following path: Security &gt; Access and Data &gt; API Controls &gt; Manage third party app access &gt; View list. There, you can view apps with access, revoke access if needed, and just get a general view of what’s going on in your app environment. Check out the video below, where I walk you through it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the other hand, you can also easily track this information with YeshID. Our intuitive dashboards present a comprehensive overview of app licenses, showcasing the interconnected web of permissions across different applications. This helps leaders easily identify which apps or services have broad access to sensitive data and understand the potential risks associated with each OAuth grant.</p>
<p>As leaders in the SMB space, it’s imperative to understand the intricacies of OAuth and its potential risks. By educating users, understanding OAuth scopes, and implementing security measures, SMBs can fortify their identity management practices, ensuring a robust defense against the evolving landscape of digital threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>YeshID is your partner in this effort, showcasing the identity sprawl within your organization and aiding in the vigilant management of OAuth access.

				 <p>In the inaugural episode of the <a href="https://untrustables.io/">(un)Trustables Podcast</a>, we delve into the fascinating landscape of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity (NDI) project. This groundbreaking initiative introduces Bhutan’s “edge wallet,” a highly secure mobile wallet designed to safeguard what Bhutan refers to as ‘foundational digital identity,’ the first verified credential issued to citizens.<br><a href="https://untrustables.simplecast.com/episodes/ep001-bhutan-has-launched-a-national-digital-identity-program">Listen to the full episode</a></p>
 The Birth of Bhutan’s National Digital Identity 
<p>Our conversation with Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments, reveals the genesis of Bhutan’s NDI project. This audacious endeavour embodies the vision of Bhutan’s monarchy, aligning perfectly with the principles outlined in the SSI book by Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed. The aim is clear: to create a citizen-centric digital identity system that empowers individuals and streamlines their interactions with the government and private sector.</p>
 Building Blocks of a Bhutanese Digital Identity 
<p>Bhutan’s digital identity framework is a marvel of innovation. It includes unique identifiers, permanent and current addresses, and other critical data points that form the bedrock of citizens’ digital identities. Beyond foundational identity, the NDI opens the door to many use cases, spanning government services and commercial applications.</p>
 Empowering Bhutanese Citizens with Digital Convenience 
<p>The NDI project isn’t just about innovation; it’s about transforming the lives of Bhutanese citizens. It eliminates time-consuming journeys to government offices, saving citizens valuable time and resources. Even in remote areas, the NDI project enhances accessibility, simplifying processes with mobile solutions.</p>
 Drummond Reed’s Perspective on Bhutan’s SSI Journey 
<p>Renowned digital identity expert Drummond Reed shares his initial astonishment at the audacity of Bhutan’s plan to implement a self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution at the national level. He reflects on Bhutan’s forward-thinking approach and alignment with the SSI book’s principles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did research and then we read the SSI book which Drummond and Alex wrote, and we just felt so strongly that it’s exactly the vision of His Majesty, our King. We said, why don’t we just build the book? That was kind of our starting place. Since then, we embodied the principles. We really thought about what the idea of the book is and how it should benefit people. We wanted it to be very citizen-centric. – Jacques Von Benecke, Chief Technology Officer at Druk Holding &amp; Investments</p>
</blockquote>
 Crafting Legislation and Governance for Digital Trust 
<p>Translating the SSI book’s vision into tangible legislation was a crucial step. Jacques explains how this process, guided by Drummond Reed and informed by extensive consultation with experts, culminated in the unanimous passing of an Act in Bhutan’s parliament. This legislation ensures a citizen-centric approach to digital identity.</p>
 Building an Ecosystem for Digital Trust 
<p>Drummond underscores the importance of creating a comprehensive digital trust ecosystem involving various stakeholders. Bhutan’s NDI project serves as a blueprint for other nations seeking to embark on similar digital identity journeys, emphasizing the collaborative nature of such transformative endeavours.</p>
 Addressing Device Accessibility 
<p>Inclusivity is a priority for Bhutan’s NDI project. Jacques outlines Bhutan’s strategies to ensure device accessibility for all citizens, including a fund to provide devices to families without them. For those in remote areas without mobile coverage, a unique biometric verifiable credential bridges the digital divide, enabling access when they visit friends and family with smart devices.</p>
 Digital Horizons Unveiled 
<p>Bhutan’s NDI project is a testament to the transformative power of digital identity. It offers citizens convenience, efficiency, and accessibility while laying the foundation for a more connected and digitally empowered society.</p>
<p>As we conclude Episode 1 of the (un)Trustables Podcast, we invite you to stay tuned for future episodes where we continue to explore digital trust and transformation worldwide.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Earlier this year, Wenjing and I delved into the fascinating intersection of Digital Trust and Generative AI in an SSI Orbit podcast episode (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/digital-trust-in-the-age-of-generative-ai/">here</a>), which serves as an excellent primer on the subject for those unfamiliar with it. Since that episode, the landscape of generative AI solutions has undergone significant transformations, prompting us to record a follow-up discussion.</p>
<p>In this Part 2 episode, we were joined by Sankarshan, who co-chairs the ‘AI and Metaverse Task Force’ at the Trust over IP Foundation, alongside Wenjing. His insights added a valuable dimension to our conversation, particularly as we tackled prevalent misconceptions in the field of AI.</p>
<p>One key misconception we discussed is the belief that AI systems are purely statistical and random. We emphasized that, in reality, the world itself is inherently statistical, and AI systems are designed to mirror human decision-making processes, which are also based on statistical reasoning.</p>
<p>Another topic we explored is the common overestimation of AI’s logical reasoning capabilities and the underestimation of the constraints within AI systems. This discussion led us into the realm of AI governance. We debated the suitability of non-profit models for managing emerging technologies like AI, considering their capital-intensive nature and ongoing maturation. Examples like <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/our-guide-to-openai-sam-altman-and-what-the-heck-happened-34da070b">OpenAI </a>and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/signal-operating-costs/">Signal</a> were brought up to illustrate these points.</p>
<p>We aimed to focus part of the discussion on identifying practical solutions and low-hanging fruits for building digital trust tools. These tools are crucial for consumers to discern truth in an era increasingly dominated by generative AI-driven content. Additionally, we delved into strategies to mitigate and prevent the risks of AI abuse, especially as AI systems become more integrated with our daily lives.</p>
<p>A topic that resonated with me was the importance of provenance and authentication in AI systems, especially in content creation. We underscored the need for more robust tools to authenticate AI-generated content. However, we also acknowledged the limitations of current tools in ensuring provenance and their inability to address all security risks comprehensively.</p>
<p>Our discussion also touched upon the influence of human nature on AI development and governance. We pondered whether the current ideal-driven structures would evolve towards more traditional capitalist models, accompanied by regulation. This led to a broader conversation about the purpose of technology, which usually gets categorized as ‘a benefit to mankind’ by its creators. Yet, the complexity of implementing this ideal becomes apparent when considering who should govern these technologies and how they should be regulated.</p>
<p>This podcast episode not only sheds light on the complexities of digital trust in the age of AI but also opens up avenues for further exploration and discussion. As we move towards 2024, these conversations are more relevant than ever, guiding us towards a future where technology is both a tool for advancement and a subject of thoughtful governance.</p>
 
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Wenjing, Sankarshan and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 OpenAI Drama – Discussion about the recent OpenAI drama, including Sam Altman’s firing and rehiring, and Microsoft’s involvement. 
 AI Governance and AI Misconceptions – Why we should focus on AI governance rather than getting caught up in daily news and doom scenarios. Discussion about misconceptions in AI, specifically statistical and computational misconceptions. Exploring practical solutions for digital trust in AI. 
 Provenance and Authentication in AI – The importance of provenance in AI applications, such as robotics or content creation. Challenges in authentication and the need for stronger solutions. The applicability of these solutions across various domains. 
 Content Authenticity – Defining content authenticity and its governance. The distinction between machine-generated and human-verified content. 
 Digital Trust and Content Authenticity – Discussing digital trust in the context of AI. Separating protocols from end-user platforms. The role of content authenticity in digital trust. Examples of current approaches to content authenticity on the internet. 
 Truth and Trust Registries – Human pursuit of truth and the influence of context and consumption. The role of trust registries in providing inputs for trust decisions. The need for widespread inputs to aid in making trust decisions.

<p>As part of ongoing support, we are releasing two service patches against SSO 9.2 and SSO 9.3. Found within both of these patches are several corrections against SAML authentication-related issues. The SAML authentication issue has existed for a number of years, but was uncovered with improvements to SSO cacheing performed in SSO 9.2. Specifically, the Microsoft service SignIn with SAML, has permitted non-uniqued entityIDs to exist. Our improvement to caching uncovered this potential minor configuration issue, which is fully corrected in the patches.</p>
<p>Additionally, for SSO 9.2.1, we have included the recent update of OpenLDAP 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 libraries. For any customers using LDAPS, we encourage you to install one of these latest service patchs.</p>
<p>Please find the SSO 9.2.3 and SSO 9.3.1 patches at: <a title="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/" href="https://downloads.ubisecure.com/">https://downloads.ubisecure.com/</a></p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your Identity Platform in a timely manner. Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility, security, and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.</p>

<p>Keeping up with the latest security challenges can feel like you are running a race that has endless hurdles. From rapid advancements in technology – rendering old hardware obsolete – to increasingly stringent requirements and regulations, the time and costs can quickly become enormous.</p>
<p>Many of these challenges are related to the migration of compute, storage, and backup services to cloud services. Picture this, you have moved your databases to the cloud. But are you in control of your encryption keys? Do you know who has a copy or could access a copy?</p>
<p>Today’s solutions offer your organization a choice of how to most effectively secure your encryption keys. You can select a solution that allows your organization to secure your keys in an on-premise HSM or one that allows your organization to protect your keys via a secure connection to a cloud-based HSM with an HSM-as-a-Service (HSMaaS) offering such as Entrust’s nShield-as-a-Service solution.</p>
<p>Entrust recently partnered with TechValidate to conduct a survey to understand how companies view and are implementing HSMaaS solutions.</p>
<p>From On-Premise to the Cloud</p>
<p>For years, the best practice was to use an HSM deployed on-premise. Concerns about security of software based key storage, separation of keys, and sovereignty requirements made it the only viable option. Over time, as-a-service HSM offerings appeared in the market offering lower costs, and a level of security comparable to on-premise HSMs, with more flexibility and quicker implementation.</p>
<p>The Survey Says</p>
<p>Today’s organizations are looking to save time and money. The survey showed that 57% of organizations said a key reason for considering subscribing to an HSMaaS offering is to reduce IT management costs. Further, 69% of respondents said that their organizations would realize reduced spend on physical infrastructure. The next closest benefit noted was improved efficiency with 46% of the respondents selecting that benefit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The focus on saving time and reducing expenses has also been a significant driver of cloud adoption. With the rise of cloud service providers, as-a-service-HSM offerings evolved even further. Leading cloud service providers offer their own unique approach to securing your encryption keys. While these offerings provide convenience and cost-effective solutions, they do not always meet internal security requirements set by some organizations adding further to the complexity involved when deciding how to store your encryption keys.</p>
<p>In addition to saving time and money, HSMaaS solutions like Entrust nShield-as-a-Service provide the same level of support for a wide range of applications. This is something that was also reflected in the survey results. Respondents indicated that once onboarded, they would leverage an HSMaaS solution for a variety of functions.</p>
<p>The top functions ranked were public key infrastructure (PKI), which was mentioned by 60% of respondents followed by key management which was selected by 57% of respondents. Data encryption/decryption and digital signatures were also mentioned by nearly half of the respondents (49%). These results reinforce the similarities in functionality between on-premise HSM and HSMaaS offerings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Important Cloud Key Management Considerations</p>
<p>Saving time and money are necessary criteria when considering implementing an HSMaaS solution. However, they are not the only considerations you should have when deciding what as-a-service HSM offering to use when storing your encryption keys. It is important to also consider:</p>
 
 Security – Make sure you understand how the HSMaaS offering works. Are you sharing the cloud-based HSM with other users or is it for your exclusive use? This is often referred to as single-tenancy vs multi-tenancy. You must ensure that you chose the right solution to match your risk profile and requirements. 
 Sovereignty of keys. Can the HSMaaS provider guarantee what country or region your keys will physically stored in? Will you be compliant with the regulations affecting your organization? 
 Integrations and the compatibility of the key management software with other vendors. Does it integrate with the other products and services used by your organization? 
 Ease of comprehensive key management for the entire organization. Does the solution give you the ability to rotate, generate, discard, and easily access information required during an audit? 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>When evaluating these considerations and HSMaaS solutions, partnering with a company that understands your holistic security and encryption needs will simplify this process. While cost is always a driving factor, ensuring you are in control of your keys is the most important. Ensuring where your keys are stored for key sovereignty requirements, the available integrations and the key management capabilities need to be carefully reviewed. The right keys need to be stored in the right places, using a solution that will protect your business and significantly enhance your organization’s security.</p>

<p>With credential stuffing attacks on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/23andme-credential-stuffing-data-stolen/">23andMe</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/no-okta-senior-management-not-an-errant-employee-caused-you-to-get-hacked/">Okta</a> just the latest breaches to make headlines in recent weeks, the push for biometrics-based authentication is gaining momentum for Identity and Access Management (IAM).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem: Biometrics aren’t all created equal. Yes, device-based biometrics such as Touch ID, Face ID, and Windows Hello can help reduce the threat of password-based account takeover (ATO). But they can still leave IT guessing about the identity behind the device. While hardware tokens and Apple, Microsoft and Google’s decision to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/google-makes-passkeys-the-default-sign-in-method-for-all-users/">passkeys the default</a> for logins are also helpful, they really only confirm possession of a device or biometric and assume (but don’t validate) identity. Thankfully, it doesn’t have to be this way—if you have the right IAM architecture.</p>
 IAM More Than Just a Device: Enabling F-Word Free Authentication&nbsp; 
<p>Whether it’s <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202303/public-schools-in-denver-colorado-hit-with-breach-fingerprint-scans-grabbed">fingerprints</a> or <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202308/heres-the-newest-camera-hack-fraudsters-are-using-to-beat-facial-recognition">facial recognition</a>, that which is stored can be stolen or spoofed by cybercriminals to infiltrate corporate systems. Hell, even without a hack, traditional forms of biometric authentication only confirm the person accessing an account is the same person who initially enrolled to do so—but not whether that person is really who they claim to be. This matters when enrollment fraud leads to more than <a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/javelins-identity-fraud-study-highlights-the-changing-nature-of-fraud/">$3.2 billion</a> in losses annually. For me, “fraud” is an f-word that typically leads to others we could all do without. That’s where 1Kosmos comes in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity-Backed Biometrics &amp; Modern IAM Architectures 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we saw the urgency of finding a way to easily and accurately verify and authenticate identity in a way that can’t be vouched for by mere password, one-time passcode, or a static (and spoofable) biometric. That’s why we set out to modernize IAM by combining strong identity verification and authentication within a unified architecture. One that offers unrivaled identity assurance behind each device used to access online services, along with a seamless account enrollment and authentication experience. In <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-a-difference-identity-makes-why-iam-keeps-falling-short-and-how-to-fix-it/">Part One</a> of this series, we provided an overview of this architecture and the pillars it’s built upon. In this post, let’s double-click on a core pillar: <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometric-based user authentication.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">1Kosmos architecture</a> employs automated, digitally verified identity to confirm user claims and credentials with 99.6% accuracy, stores them under user control, and binds them to an identity wallet and biometric with liveness detection. This gives IT the security and control they need while providing users with a seamless login experience. The benefits are threefold:&nbsp;</p>
<p>High Assurance</p>
<p>Biometrics verified through liveness testing deliver the highest digital identity assurance possible and enable fast, frictionless multi-factor authentication. When matched to a verified identity, they eliminate fraudulent identities hiding behind valid credentials.</p>
<p>User Convenience</p>
<p>Physical attributes used for biometric authentication are not vulnerable to damage and unexpected alterations. They provide quick, user-friendly authentication with or without passwords.</p>
<p>Flexible Use Cases</p>
<p>Whether the use case demands a fingerprint, voice match, a live biometric or other identifier, the 1Kosmos architecture provides affordable authenticators that adjust to varied and evolving business needs.</p>
 Building Bulletproof Biometric Authentication 
<p>We didn’t just follow the most effective approach to identity-backed biometric authentication. We defined it. 1Kosmos offers the only IAM architecture built with four crucial elements of identity-backed biometric authentication:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certification to FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3 and UKDIATF Standards</p>
<p>Our BlockID platform is certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/">FIDO</a>, <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST</a> and <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/kitcp-06-01-certificate-1kosmos/">UKDIATF</a> standards, having undergone rigorous testing to verify quality coding and ensure the use of common devices to authenticate users. When combined with a verified identity, you’re talking about unmatched security and convenience. BlockID supports USB keys, keycard authentication, fingerprint readers, and hardware tokens and provides a robust framework to implement or augment passwordless authentication without being forced into using a single provider. With identity-backed biometrics, you also benefit from stronger security using physical traits. Think fingerprint scan with a USB security key or FIDO-compliant facial recognition, for instance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>iBeta Certified Biometrics</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, biometrics can improve security by replacing or augmenting the use of passwords, but they can also be subject to theft or spoofing. iBeta is an independent, NIST-accredited biometrics testing lab that has developed certification programs to verify biometric applications to recognized standards to prevent these things from happening. When enrolling with our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">BlockID</a> solution, the user can perform an advanced form of biometrics called a liveness test that prevents false facial verification using a photo, video, mask, or other substitute for an authorized user’s face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometric Encryption</p>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/12/what-is-biometric-encryption/">Biometric encryption</a> leverages a biometric template and public-private key pair to encrypt and decrypt personally identifiable information for authenticating a user and sharing data with an online service. This approach relies on the uniqueness of biometrics to ensure that hackers can’t reverse-engineer a password or key. Without the biometric and matching private key, all data in the digital wallet isn’t accessible, usable, or even legible. There’s no central storage of user biometrics, ensuring these biometrics remain private. Biometric authentication is easy to use and requires little, if any, user training.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flexible Levels of Identity Assurance</p>
<p>With BlockID, you determine the type of biometric appropriate for a given application and the level of identity assurance appropriate to the business risk. For <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/customer-onboarding-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/know-your-business-compliance-guide/">Know Your Business</a> (KYB) standards, Identity Assurance Level 2 can be achieved using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/live-id/">LiveID</a> and identity verification using government-issued credentials, such as a driver’s license or passport. A liveness test confirms a user’s facial match to the enrolled biometric and verified documents in real-time.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Lesser forms of identity assurance can be achieved using information from banking, telco, or corporate databases or through “inferred” identity based on access to an email address or logged-in device, as appropriate for the intended use. For additional use cases, 1Kosmos can also verify a user’s social security number (SSN) against the SSA, a driver’s license against the American Association of Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), a passport against ICAO or the US Department of State, or verify a user is indeed a physician by validating their NPIN (National Physician Information Number).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As documentation and accounts are enrolled, the location and phone number are verified against the issuing authority. The user’s LiveID scan is then validated against the picture extracted from the documentation. Once complete, their biometrics are captured, and the data is encrypted with the user’s private key and stored within a private and permissioned blockchain.</p>
<p>An Unbeatable Advantage&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Part Three, we’ll drill down on another core pillar of the 1Kosmos architecture: decentralized digital identity and how it provides users with secure anytime, anywhere access to ID cards, driver licenses, social security details, and more through a reusable identity wallet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  Die Abkündigung von SAP Identity Management (SAP IDM) stellt Unternehmen vor eine kritische Herausforderung. Die bisherige Lösung erreicht das Ende ihres Lebenszyklus, und Organisationen müssen sich nun die Frage stellen: Wie kann trotzdem weiterhin Compliance aufrechterhalten werden?  Die Gewährleistung der Identitätsverwaltung unter Berücksichtigung der gesetzlichen Bestimmungen entwickelt sich zu einem zentralen Anliegen für Fachleute im Bereich Informationstechnologie. 

In diesem Kontext suchen Unternehmen nach effektiven Wegen, um die bisherigen Ansätze und Verfahren aus dem SAP IDM-Umfeld auf andere Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)-Systeme zu migrieren. SailPoint und IBM präsentieren innovative Ansätze, wie moderne Technologien eingesetzt werden können, um IGA-Systeme zu erweitern und deren Vorteile optimal zu nutzen. Dieser Schritt eröffnet neue Wege für Unternehmen, um ihre Identitätsmanagement-Strategien anzupassen und den Herausforderungen des Endes von SAP IDM proaktiv zu begegnen.

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Heather Flanagan, Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and David Birch, Principal at 15 Mb, author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. 
<p>This is the 100th episode of Let’s Talk about Digital Identity – in this special episode two of our most popular guests, Heather Flanagan and David Birch, rejoined the podcast to explore what is exciting them in passwordless, identity wallets and digital money.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“Passwords have got to go. As we’re moving to passkeys, I think there’s always room for improvement on – even on them. If nothing else, focusing a little bit more on the user experience so that people will have a better understanding of what this means.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Heather Flanagan, Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and choreographer for Identity Flash Mob, comes from a position that the Internet is led by people, powered by words, and inspired by technology. She has been involved in leadership roles with some of the most technical, volunteer-driven organisations on the Internet, including IDPro as Principal Editor, the IETF, the IAB, and the IRTF as RFC Series Editor, ICANN as Technical Writer, and REFEDS as Coordinator, just to name a few. If there is work going on to develop new Internet standards, or discussions around the future of digital identity, she is interested in engaging in that work.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: This is episode number 100 of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And for this special occasion, we have invited back Heather Flanagan, and David Birch.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>We have invited back to the show two of our most popular guests. So, these two guests, let me introduce them is Heather Flanagan. She is Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting and Acting Executive Director for IDPro. Hello, Heather.</p>
<p>Heather Flanagan: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Nice having you back.</p>
<p>And our second guest is David Birch. David Birch is an author, advisor and commentator on digital financial services. He is Principal at 15 Mb, his advisory company. Hello, David.</p>
<p>David Birch: Hi. Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a real pleasure having you both for this special episode, a bit different style, so being out of our usual script. But yeah, hearing a little bit more about yourselves.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to hear something in particular, because we want to hear something – a moment in your lives. So, what I want to hear – think of one specific moment in your career in which you told yourself, “Yes, this is why I love working in the identity industry.” Which moment would it be? Who wants to start?</p>
<p>David: Well, and it’s a bit self-centred, but probably when my publisher agreed to publish my first book. I thought I had some interesting ideas about identity – I mean you always think that your ideas are – but when you get that kind of validation that your ideas actually are interesting to other people. That really did change my career. Yeah, otherwise, I probably would have just carried on being a pretty average consultant and carried on in payments and banking. So yeah, it’s – but I put it all down to my publisher.</p>
<p>Oscar: Which one was this book? Tell us which book was this.</p>
<p>David: Identity is the New Money. It was Diane Coyle, the Economist, who encouraged me to publish it. So yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t have anything. I’ve been actually thinking about this question for a while, and it’s really hard to point to any one thing, because there were no lightning from the sky moments. It’s just, it’s always been such a foundational aspect of everything that I’ve ever done since I started in tech in the mid ‘90s. Where the first question was always – when you’re taking over something from a bulletin board system to an email server, “Who can access this? What permissions do they need to have? How do you set up accounts for them?” That was where everything always started. So, no one moment, it’s all of the moments.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, that’s great that there are several exciting moments. I’m sure for all of us, it’s been like that. Several moments in which we feel that this is exciting to be in this industry. But thank you for sharing that with us.</p>
<p>Being already towards the end of this year 2023 – so there are some keywords which were buzzing in the last years. But some of these buzzwords today are more reality, we have access to those. What do you think, what you feel about these technologies or techniques. And let’s get started with passwordless. So, if I ask Heather, what excites you today about passwordless?</p>
<p>Heather: I’m really excited about the fact that the technology itself is solid, the standards themselves are really, really well-done. But as excited as I am, I am concerned. Like at all the new modern technologies, I look at them and go, “Wow, that’s really cool.” and little anxiety making because for passwordless, what I observe is when you actually get out of the tech field and talk to my mother, she doesn’t trust it because it’s too easy.</p>
<p>And so, I do wonder about as bad as passwords are, the friction that they add, it’s something that people can wrap their heads around. Whereas they don’t understand the magic that’s happening behind the scenes that makes passkeys better. And if they don’t trust it, they won’t use it. And if they don’t use it, we lose out on all the benefits. So, one of the things I’ve been trying to think about for you know, the future is OK passkeys are amazing, but how can we make them less magic scary?</p>
<p>David: I’m a bit frustrated with it really, because I’m extremely lazy. And so, you know, like eBay, for example, uses passkeys, the whole thing works perfectly. So as soon as I go to a site, as in fact I just did 10 minutes ago to look at something and it’s log back in. I’m like, “What I have an account? I didn’t even know I had the account.” And then I had to remember the password. And of course, I didn’t get it. So, I had to click on, I forgot my password, and then I got the password reset. And then I put in the new password. And it said, “You can’t have a new password that’s the same as the old password.” And we just go around in this loop. And it drives me crazy. I’m like, “Why can’t you just all implement this?” Despite the fears of your mom, which I mean I can’t discount those because they’re real. The sooner we make people stop using passwords, the better.</p>
<p>I was reading a fantastic story in the Insider this morning. Did you see this story about the Zelle fraud on Insider? It’s typical kind of thing, you know, guys getting some work done by a contractor. The hackers get into the contractor’s email account, they send him a thing to send money to a different account, which is the hackers’ account. And they make off with all of the money. And so, they go and talk to the contractor and said to him, “You know, did you know that your email has been compromised, you should change your email password.”</p>
<p>And the guy, it says in the article, “We may as well have been speaking Romanian.” The guy had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. Because he’s a normal person. He doesn’t care about all of this stuff. You don’t say to people, “Oh, here’s a car, would you like a seat belt with it? Or would you like a piece of string that you could attach in, you know, particularly opt in place.” You know, as a society, it comes to a point where you say, “I’m sorry, not wearing seatbelts, there’s just too many people dying. So, cars have to have seatbelts. And you have to put the damn things on. End of story.”</p>
<p>And I sort of feel we’re getting to that point. Fraud and scam, it’s just so completely out of control. And this thing about whether you know, you need to put people in charge of their own data and so on. I just don’t believe that for a moment. I just don’t. Most people don’t have the persistent competence that – including me, by the way, I’m not casting the first stone, I’m one of those people that lacks the persistent competence to make this happen. There are reservations but passkeys are a billion times better than passwords, and we should make people use them. I’m sorry, you got to stop pandering to populism.</p>
<p>Heather: No two ways about it – Passwords have got to go. As we’re moving to passkeys, I think there’s always room for improvement on – even on them. If nothing else, focusing a little bit more on the user experience so that people will have a better understanding of what this means. And when they click this button, why would they click this as opposed to clicking something else that might be a phishing site that they wouldn’t recognise. So, it’s an ongoing education.</p>
<p>David: Then you sort of think of contactless as the, you know, in the early days of contactless people, “Oh, it’s too scary.” And in some parts of the world, it appears to be witchcraft, that you can pay for things by not touching it with your card and this, people are going to come and steal all the cards. And there are going to be people of Eastern European origin on the subway system, putting their hands inside your clothes to read your cards and all this. Remember all of this stuff that was going on?</p>
<p>And now, you walk into a store, anywhere in the world. I’m not talking America, I’m talking about developed countries, of course. You walk into a store anywhere in the world, and there’s that little contactless symbol and you pay, and you go, and no one thinks anything about it anymore. It’s a bit different in America. In America, you have to look for the till and where’s the sign? And then you have to press some buttons. And then sometimes you have to sign something as well. It’s baffling. I don’t understand any of it.</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, the day you understand what happens in the United States will be a marvellous day. Because nobody understands what happens.</p>
<p>David: No, it’s mysterious. But the point is, generally speaking, you know, we came up with this symbol, and everybody knows, you tap your card there, and it works. And guess what? All of your money isn’t stolen by Eastern European fraudsters. So, they’re not all Eastern European, obviously, other fraudsters are available. Because the corollary is going to be basically, people like us will start using passkeys, and so all the fraud will transfer onto people like your mom. That seems a little unfair to me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, seeing that you are excited indeed with passwordless. But of course, there are some concerns and some things to improve. Absolutely. Interesting what Heather said that, yeah, some people have been using password for so long, but that anything else feels like how do you say the…</p>
<p>David: An improvement? Real security? System-wide integrity? I don’t know, what’s the word you’re searching for there? I don’t know.</p>
<p>Oscar: How you say the…</p>
<p>Heather: Magic.</p>
<p>Oscar: Magic. Yeah, magic.</p>
<p>David: So, I’m excited as Heather is, I’m probably just a bit more militant on how quickly we should be pushing it out.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, we’ll see what comes in the next year as how it really rolls out. But the next one is about identity wallets. So, what excites you today about identity wallets?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, I have a list on that one. I’m particularly excited over how – as much as I worry about people not understanding the magic, they do understand the concept of flipping through a wallet to get to the right card, the right credential, the right thing they need and then using it and giving them that level of control is a vast improvement, I think over some of the other technology has been going on today.</p>
<p>I’m watching what’s happening in Europe quite closely because I think that – how the governments are handling digital wallets and digital identity is a very interesting model. I will be curious to see how other countries do it. How they do it well, how they do it poorly. And if there’s some way we can actually – I’d love to standardise ‘what’s a wallet’, you know. That’s one of my little pet peeves, there is no standard for a wallet. There’s standard for credentials, but there’s not a standard for ‘what is a wallet’.</p>
<p>David: I mean, it’s interesting to see what the Open Wallet initiative and various other people are doing in this space. I agree with Heather. I think as much as the technology is important, and certainly, in technological terms, the wallet is the sort of crucial pivot between the kind of online and offline world. It’s very central to the next phase of evolution of commerce. A lot of it has to do with – in fact, we won’t even call our wallets now identity wallets, we just call them wallets. But if you actually open up my wallet, I mean, I won’t do it over there. If you open up my wallet, it has no money in it. Everything is in my wallet, it has to do with identity, driver’s licenses and loyalty cards. And my wallet is already an identity wallet, we just don’t call it that.</p>
<p>So, extending that wallet across sort of virtual and real world seems to me, pretty straightforward. But of course, that does rather interestingly open up what I think will be quite a vicious battle about who’s actually going to control those wallets. Because certainly, Heather mentioned kind of the European approach. They’re very, very unhappy with the idea of big tech controlling those wallets. We’re very unhappy with the big tech or big government controlling the wallets. People like me will prefer that it was regulated institutions – banks primarily, that control those wallets. Other people think banks should be absolutely the last people to have any sort of control over those wallets. So really, I’m not smart enough to figure out like the end dimensional gameplay as to how this is going to work out. But it’s pretty serious. It’s pretty serious.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, people understand the concept of a wallet. But what we’re talking about in today’s world is that, you know, “how many wallets are you going to have to carry?” Because there may be one that’s issued by big tech, perhaps via your browser or via your mobile device. But then, you know, as governments are saying, “No, we’re going to issue something that’s completely separate and have its own app, and what is that going to look like. And then how are people supposed to be able to find the credential they need across 2, 3, 5 different wallets?</p>
<p>David: No, I agree with you completely on that, Heather. But I think there’s another level of complexity there as well, which is – because is the wallet going to be like if you imagine there’s some kind of standard wallet, is that wallet the app? Or is that wallet, essentially the underlying SDK the apps plug into?</p>
<p>So, my British Airways app and my Barclays Bank app, they’re all actually the same wallet underneath. They’re all plugging into the same wallet. But is it going to be like that? Is there going to be like a travel industry wallet? Or is British Airways going to have its own wallet? That’s really hard to know. I would think, and this comes from kind of what I think is a reasonably rational calculus. The credentials that are going to be in those wallets are the embodiment of individual reputations.</p>
<p>My British Airways credential is the embodiment of my relationship with British Airways, that I want to take and show to other people. It’s not obvious to me that British Airways would benefit from owning the wallet, because they’d have to maintain it and upgrade it and whatever. They’re having enough trouble just with their own website to do that. On the other hand, I can see why they’d be nervous about just handing the whole thing over to Apple and Google, because then they’ll end up paying a tax, which I’m pretty sure they don’t want to do. So, I don’t know how that’s going to work out. But I listen to a lot of smart people about this. It’s a very fascinating topic to me.</p>
<p>Heather: I talked to Don Thibeau and Juliana Cafik and a couple others about “what was the Open Wallet Foundation trying to do?” And they’re trying to work towards interoperability in code and maybe a standard will come out of that someday when they see what works and what doesn’t work. But at the moment, they are not standardising wallets. They’re just…</p>
<p>David: No, that’s true. There’s…</p>
<p>Heather: They’re just putting together a platform to try and make it work together.</p>
<p>David: But as you pointed out earlier on, some of the components are standardised. We have VCs, we have MDL. We’ve got MDL 7 and 9 coming in a few months, a year or something. So I mean, there is some pretty useful standardisation going on anyway.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, more in the credential format space.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That might give us enough interoperability to get started.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. Indeed, it sounds like it’s…</p>
<p>David: I’m a naturally simple and optimistic person. Heather’s looking at all the nuances here. And that’s why she’s so, that’s why my superficial, cheery approach to this – it’s not washing with her I can see it from her face.</p>
<p>Oscar: You seem to be both excited about identity wallets, I think.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I think wallets are really interesting topic for the coming year.</p>
<p>Heather: Huge potential.</p>
<p>Oscar: You, David, mentioned that as far as I understood, you don’t carry cash anymore, that was my understanding how you have your wallet, your real wallet without cash.</p>
<p>David: No, actually, I mean I don’t carry my real wallet, it’s in the drawer over there. So, I had an interesting conversation with somebody last week about premium cards. That’s how interesting my life is, Heather. I just, I benchmark, I had an interesting discussion with someone else last week about premium cards. This is a tragic trajectory of my life.</p>
<p>But I have this fancy new American Express Platinum Card, which is made out of some sort of metal. I don’t know if it’s actually platinum, but it’s sort of metal. And it’s really fancy and heavy and solid and whatever. And I couldn’t even tell you where it is. It’s in the house somewhere. I haven’t the slightest idea.</p>
<p>Oscar: Don’t activate it.</p>
<p>David: No, no, because as soon as I got it, it’s on my phone. I only ever use it on my phone. I don’t know where the actual card is, I have no interest in that. I’m going into London in a minute, I have a ring. So, the ring I use for getting on the subway and bus because I don’t always want to take my phone out. But if I’m paying in a restaurant so I got to use my phone. I think the days of physical wallets, I mean, lots of people keep saying, well, there’s going to be a backlash at some point, and people are going to want to use cash, sort of the way they want to use vinyl records, I suppose. But I think that will just be like a few hipsters. I don’t think it’ll be the rest of us.</p>
<p>Heather: I don’t trust having network access consistently enough to go without some kind of physical something. Do I use my wallet on my watch and my phone more often than not? Well, when I’m in Europe, yes. When I’m in the US, maybe. I don’t count on it. I don’t think I can count on it yet. So, there’s always the physical components that I think I have to have.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I would say that’s an interesting argument in favour of using offline verifiable credentials. And it’s also a crucial argument in favour as to why Central Bank Digital Currency should operate offline. So, I mean, I agree with you about that. As to the state of things at the moment, well, if the transit gates fail and can’t go online, they have to fail open, it’s a public safety issue. You can’t fail transit gate shut. So, they have to, they should have – I can always get home, you know, but it’s never happened. But when push comes to shove, I’ll get home, so I’m fine.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and that related to my last question, but just to hear what you liked the most. So, what excites you about this digital money that we were already starting to discuss?</p>
<p>David: I’d say there’s probably three things. I mean, Heather’s going to disagree with me on every single one of them, which is why it makes for an interesting conversation. But I’d say there’s probably three things.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is digital money, well, certainly digital currency is the subject of irrational delusional comment by conspiracy theorists, which makes for entertainment. So, I get emails, “oh, you know, Central Bank Digital Currency is the mark of the devil. And we know this because Bill Gates implanted microchips in us through the vaccine, and the microchips are going to steal the digital currency from unvaccinated people and send it through the 5g towers to Satan.” Or somebody, I can’t remember exactly, I don’t remember. But you get emails like this, which add to the gaiety of the nation.</p>
<p>So, the first thing is, there are parts of America where non-existent digital currency is already being banned. So, this is all getting a bit, sort of witch trail-y, so that’s quite entertaining.</p>
<p>The second thing is, and I wasn’t joking about that offline point, which is any scale digital currency in any developed country, even where you have networks and infrastructure has to work offline. It’s the crucial design requirement of it. If you’re going to have a cash substitute, it has to work offline. And that, for me, poses very interesting technological problems, all of which I think, have already been solved. But nonetheless, it’s really intellectually interesting, so I sort of like that.</p>
<p>And the third thing is, I think a lot of people look at digital currency as ‘the thing’. Like, you know, we need digital currency. And that’s it. I mean, what we need is a platform for innovation and development. Digital currency in itself is sort of not that interesting. As we’ve just established, I can already buy milk in the supermarket without using physical cash. So that’s not, but this idea of permissionless innovation that you could bring into our space from the cryp– because digital it doesn’t involve any credit risk, you see. So, you could imagine a situation where as long as you’ve got an approved chip in your iPhone, or something, they’re certified as being capable of storing digital dollars or something like that, then you can use the API to do whatever you like, there’s no credit risk involved. So, allowing people to experiment with interesting new things – micro payments, and Escrow and blah, blah, blah. On top of it is really where it’s at. And that’s why, you know, I get it a bit when people say, “Well, what are the sort of key uses?” Well, I don’t know, I’m too old. Give it to some kids in a garage and let them come up with something.</p>
<p>Heather: OK. So, for one thing, I really want to see your emails about this because they sound hilarious. I admit, I’m absolutely a digital currency sceptic. For one thing, as David has said, right, you don’t generally need to carry cash now anyway, so what is it getting you? And everything I understand about it is like, “Well, yes, but then you’ll be able to transfer money quickly without the bank getting in the way.” And I’m like, “Hmm, you say the bank getting in the way and verifying the transaction is a bad thing.” “Oh, but it’s expensive.” And I’m like, “Well, that’s a different problem, not just because the banks are charging a lot.” So that’s like a completely different problem to solve that it’s not a technology problem at all.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’m definitely not convinced. Having the permission to innovate and work with this kind of currency, to me in a way, that’s like saying, “Yup, let’s turn this into a barter system, except you’re bartering these digital currency components.” “OK. Go for it, go to town.” That’s just people agreeing with each other. And it’s a completely different system in the same way that a barter system is completely different with my cash system.</p>
<p>David: That’s a really interesting point. And I don’t mean that in any sort of patronising sense, I really mean that because you’re right, of course. And what that means is, if this stuff worked, then downstream you could imagine an environment where if you and I engage in some sort of transaction, right, I’m going to pay you to write something or you’re going to pay me to come and speak or something like that. My, you know, supercomputer at the end of a wire, it can be a through my mobile phone, my giant killer robot artificially intelligent wallet will negotiate with your super intelligent giant killer robot Terminator wallet to exchange baskets of tokens to an agreed –</p>
<p>The idea that you would need money as an intermediary when you have that kind of barter that works. I think that’s really, that’s as a very interesting point. So, if our super computers could agree on these baskets of assets to exchange, which sounds weird when its people talking about it, but it’s a few nanoseconds for super computers. Why would you turn those assets into dollars or something in the first place? Why wouldn’t you just swap the assets around?</p>
<p>So, I actually rather agree with that point. But I think that’s much further downstream. I think, in the short term, you see the demand for dollar stable coins in particular, as an indication to me that a lot of people around the world and in America, for that matter, wants to hold digital dollars. They would find digital dollars useful to do things with that you can’t do with regular dollars, and I sort of agree.</p>
<p>So, I can see sort of both things. But to me, the short term and the long term are quite different there. Because I probably do drink my Kool Aid, and I’d probably do think that that’s kind of a stupid expression actually it’s, don’t drink that Kool Aid because everybody that drank the Kool Aid died, didn’t they? Or am I getting the stories mixed up?</p>
<p>Heather: I wasn’t going to say it.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, no, I think they did. OK, that’s a bad example. But the point is, I think in the long run, you might well be right. I think in the short term, digital currencies, I think would add to the net welfare. I mean, I can imagine, you and I agreeing to something, and the money just goes from my digital wallet to your digital wallet. It never goes anywhere near the banking system. It just goes over Bluetooth or whatever but yes. It is exciting. That’s true.</p>
<p>Oscar: Heather, what’s not so exciting to digital money?</p>
<p>Heather: We’ll see.</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ll see. We’ll see. Anything else that it’s for you is exciting?</p>
<p>David: What’s not working digital money, you know, these answers are intertwined, because the thing that’s broken in digital money at the moment, is identity, not the payment bit. Like the reason why you’ve got Zelle frauds and authorised push payment frauds and these massive crypto scams going on all the time. It’s because nobody knows who anybody is. It’s not because the payments don’t work properly. It’s because identity doesn’t work properly.</p>
<p>If the identity, you know, I’m going to sound like a broken record on this one for the teenagers there. I’m going to sound like a vinyl implement that used to go around whether it has a scratch in it. So, this sort of needle would prompt up, down and come back to this, I have to talk them through this metaphor. But I’m going to sound like a broken record on this. Because if you fix the identity problem, payments are easy.</p>
<p>If you know the reputation of all of the counterparties in a transaction, then pricing the risk in that transaction is easy. And that’s kind of what we should be aiming for. The next phase of evolution is really about identity. It happens that I think, and I can’t prove this with any kind of actual analysis, this is just my sort of crackpot theory about this. But actually, if central banks do drive forward with digital currency, digital currency doesn’t work unless you have digital identity. You can’t give people wallets unless you know who those people are. You can’t maintain limits on personal holdings unless you know who’s got the wallets. There must be an identity system for the currency system to work. So it could be that Central Bank Digital Currency actually turns out to be a vector for people like Heather to actually get something done about wallets and digital identity. So, there’s an interesting interrelationship there.</p>
<p>Heather: They are certainly tied together. There’s no two questions about that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Anything else that you think that is exciting today in the identity world that we have not covered?</p>
<p>David: Well, there’s two things I’m excited about today. I can tell you what I was doing before I came on this call. So, one is – I’m very excited about only because I’m not a normal person. I’m very excited about ultra-wideband technology. So, all iPhones for a while, you know some of the top end Samsung’s you know Apple Air Tags, things like this, they all have this thing in them called you UWB, Ultra-Wideband which a lot of people kind of overlook a little bit because we focus everything on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. But when Bluetooth and Wi Fi came out there were actually three wireless standards. There was Bluetooth, UWB and Wi-Fi. And UWB never really got used because the Wi-Fi chips got cheaper much quicker, and everybody just started building Wi-Fi into things. And meanwhile Bluetooth ranges went up.</p>
<p>But ultra-wideband, which is short range, medium speed that uses this pulsed radio. Because of the way it works, it can only tell where things are, this is how Air Tags work. But it can also tell whether you’re moving towards something or away from it. So, this idea of having a phone that knows you’re walking up to the point-of-sale terminal or knows you’re walking up to a door. And the way that Apple are part of this digital car keys alliance, which I’m very interested in with Google, and I think BMW and people like that.</p>
<p>So, this idea that you have one technology like this, which locates you, you’re walking towards the POS terminal, and then it flips to Bluetooth to execute an actually secure transaction with real cryptography, and real keys. I’m really interested in that at the moment for a variety of different ways. So that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>And the second thing is, and I think we have touched on this before, we think of identity as being about people. But actually, everything needs identity. And when everything has an identity, working out how to get both privacy and security in that environment is really rather complicated. It’s very intellectually challenging. And that’s what I’m spending the rest of my time on with another startup at the moment. So yeah, there’s no end of things to be excited about in this space, honestly. And frankly, figuring out how people can log into their bank account without password is the least interesting of the things that’s going on at the moment.</p>
<p>Heather: Probably the most interesting thing that I’m trying to stay on top of right now is watching the standards development space, because that is like one of my favourite things to do. Because I might also be a little bit of a strange person. So, standards development space, seeing how ISO, the IETF, the W3C, as well as some of the smaller standard’s organisations like the OpenID Foundation, the Decentralised Identity Foundation, Trust Over IP, how they’re all circling closer and closer to each other and sometimes hitting each other, bouncing off.</p>
<p>You know, it’s becoming a really dense space to try and follow and understand what’s happening with W3C verifiable credentials? How do those relate to the ISO MDOC standards, and what’s happening with the IETF’s OAuth and CBOR and you know, all of these different standard’s groups are all starting to get closer and closer at nibbling down this problem. And they’re never going to succeed because they’re reaching the point where it’s not a technical problem anymore. It’s a societal problem. And the regulators are starting to move ahead of them and saying, “No, this is what, you know, we need to happen. And it’s not about technology, as much as it is sometimes about the society and the cultural requirements.” So, seeing these organisations tighten up, it’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>David: I was just going to ask you, because I’ve sort of lost the thread on this a little bit, because unless you follow it with minute detail every day, you don’t. I wonder if the whole kind of MDOC thing doesn’t have its own momentum. So, in other words, in a lot of circumstances, you can see why people are going to go to MDOC and MDL part 5, even for something that’s not a driving license, just because. It reminds me a little bit, and here’s another one of the teenagers, it reminds me of X.500. Because having spent part of my young life, she doesn’t even know what X.500 is, how he’s been part of my – X.400 was the ISO messaging standard that existed before the internet and that no longer exists. And X.500 was the directory standard for that. And that no longer exists. An X.509 was the standard for exchanging public keys in that directory. And X.509 version 3 is how everything works on the internet.</p>
<p>So, the whole of X.400 has disappeared, the whole of X.500 disappeared. And I just wonder if MDL isn’t going to be in the same place, like people are going to end up using MDL just because it exists. It may not be the optimum for a lot of the appli– but it doesn’t matter. The format exists. Wallets can understand it. Apple and Google Wallets can understand it. The MDOC stuff will carry on standardising, and I think maybe a lot of stuff will just get sucked into that.</p>
<p>Heather: What’s getting complicated about it – is the MDL standards. They are in their own way the X.509 to the modern world. They’re specifying a credential. This is a discrete concrete, and this is what this is supposed to be used for. It is your driver’s license. It is your identifier. Verifiable credentials using W3 capital V, capital C verifiable credentials. That’s not what they are really, those are much more generic thing that’s actually more an authentication thing. So, the fact that they’re hitting each other in the ways that they are is very interesting and a little disturbing. And the fact that the browser vendors are debating within themselves, which one they’re going to support when ultimately, they serve different purposes, I worry that we’re going to be driven towards…</p>
<p>David: No, no, I… your analysis is spot on. I agree with you completely Heather. I’m just saying that in practice, what seems to be happening is like people like me would say, “Well, actually…” you know, use the canonical example going into the bar, you know, people like me would say, “Well, you should be presenting an ISO W3C verifiable credential that says that you’re over 18 or over 21. So, I’m going…” But that doesn’t exist. The standard for the credential exists, but the contents, whereas on MDL, OK, that’s not really what it was meant for. But actually, demanding to see your MDL driver’s license, I can do because the standard exists. And I, you know, so I agree with your analysis. I’m just saying I wonder if actually, well, Trust Over IP and all these other things are kind of circling around, bumping into each other. MDOC is just steadily progressing, you know.</p>
<p>Heather: Told you Oscar, I told you, you’re going to have all sorts of fun things to talk about.</p>
<p>David: He’s going to get very bored on our – just our island, Heather. Like after the plane crashes, we’re going to be fine. He’s going to be, I don’t know what he’s going to do all day, making those little token at men or something.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fantastic. Hearing all this from you. You’re definitely super passionate about – many of these things that you’re talking about, frustrated about some of them, but yes, super excited about most of them. So, thank you very much for joining us in very special episode for us. So, thank you very much. And please tell us how people can learn more about you, Heather?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, easiest thing is – go to LinkedIn and find me there. I check it every day. It’s one of my major social media accounts.</p>
<p>David: Yeah, I mean, I spend more time on LinkedIn now since Twitter kind of went all weird. So, I mean, I’m on LinkedIn too. But it also you can just look up www.dgwbirch.com.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, thank you very much. So, let’s see how exciting comes the next coming months, years and yeah, how all the things we were discussing today will roll out. So, again, thanks a lot and all the best.</p>
<p>Heather: Great. Bye</p>

   Evaluate your access management (AM) strategy with guidance from Gartner 

<p>Access management (AM) has become instrumental in fueling business growth while protecting against modern attacks. Today's economic environment makes AM even more critical, with enterprises seeking a converged access management solution that can address myriad use cases for multiple populations. But what capabilities should you prioritize for your organization?</p>

<p>The 2023 Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Access Management report is a technical companion to the Gartner Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management. While the Magic Quadrant provides an overview of a vendor including its market share, Critical Capabilities is purely a technical analysis of a vendor's products and services.</p>

<p>This year Gartner scored 11 vendors against four common use cases, including workforce access management, business-to-consumer access management (B2C), business-to-business access management (B2B), and application development.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce that ForgeRock received the highest scores in two of these use cases, namely B2C and B2B customer access management.</p>

 11 critical capabilities to consider for your 2024 roadmap 

<p>In addition to the four use cases, Gartner outlines a set of critical capabilities essential for any organization's access management strategy:</p>

  Core Access Management 
	 User Authentication 
	 Authorization and Adaptive Access 
	 Portable Identity Integration 
	 Business to Business 
	 Business to Consumer 
	 Customization and Extensibility 
	 API Access Control 
	 Threat Reporting and ITDR 
	 Resilience 
	 Ease of Deployment 
  ForgeRock understands your business to the core 

<p>Our commitment to simplifying complex user journeys can be a differentiator for your business. We support various delegated administration approaches for B2B capabilities, all orchestrated seamlessly through <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, our comprehensive catalog of global and regional cloud identity provider connectors, integrations with government IDs, customizable consent flows, self-service social identity registration, and a <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/marketplace/">marketplace</a> featuring a wide array of identity verification providers and wallets make us a solid choice.</p>

 We give you ultimate control 

<p>Customizability and extensibility are paramount for large enterprises and their unique use cases. Our solutions offer the flexibility and power required for different <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments">deployment models</a>, while our Intelligent Access orchestration (“Trees”) and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/sdk">SDKs</a> simplify integrations for developers. We also provide robust support for integrations with both our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-gateway">identity gateway</a> and third-party API gateways.</p>

 Deploy identity your way 

<p>ForgeRock embraces flexibility when it comes to identity deployment. Whether you prefer a fully cloud-based approach, on-premises solution, or a hybrid environment for gradual migration, we've got you covered. Recognizing the challenges of migration from legacy solutions, we've introduced <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/modernize-iam">pre-configured accelerators</a> to facilitate co-existence with, and migration from, Oracle Access Manager and Broadcom CA SiteMinder to the ForgeRock Identity Cloud.</p>

 Ultimate security without sacrifice 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">ForgeRock Autonomous Access</a> employs a unique blend of AI, machine learning, and pattern recognition to detect threats at the identity perimeter. Notably, we've addressed the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-attackers-are-circumventing-mfa-and-how-stop-them">rising challenges in MFA</a> with features such as MFA push authentication with context and push authentication with number matching, enhancing both security and user experience. ForgeRock also supports <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> capabilities through FIDO2 WebAuthn standards and passkeys within the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a>.</p>

 ForgeRock and Ping Identity: A Winning Combination 

<p>I'm thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html">Ping Identity</a> received the highest scores in one use case and the second highest in the three other use cases in the Gartner Critical Capabilities for Access Management research. To us, this recognition underscores Ping Identity's excellence and deep understanding of the AM market. Read more on Ping's performance <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2023/ping-identity-leader-gartner-critical-capabilities-access-management-2023.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The results of the Gartner research speak for themselves. And now, by uniting together as <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/lp/pingandforgerock.html?utm_source=forgerock&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=forgerock">one company</a>, we are able to offer customers greater choice and flexibility to address their unique use cases for all identity types. We're confident that with our strong product offerings reinforced by our years of experience, we can help you become better positioned to innovate your identity roadmap today and well into the future.</p>

<p>I invite you to download the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-gartner-critical-capabilities-access-management">Gartner Critical Capabilities report</a> to gain deeper insights into access management capabilities and how you can elevate your IAM strategy.</p>

 The future of digital finance is evolving, and it’s happening just in time 



<p>Over the last few years, the move to digital finance has accelerated. Consumers are adopting emerging financial apps and services, empowering them to take control of their financial health. The same technological leaps that are enhancing payments, financial management and banking are also changing lending for the better, and they couldn’t have come at a more opportune time. </p>



<p>That’s because consumers are feeling the impact of economic uncertainty and worry about the effect that it may have on them. In a 2023 survey, Mastercard spoke to 7,600 consumers across the United States, Canada, the U.K., Australia, France, Germany and Spain about their recent financial experiences. &nbsp;</p>



<p> Over 89% of respondents say that they’ve been negatively affected by economic uncertainty. &nbsp;</p>







<p>At the same time, whether they’re making big purchases like homes or handling everyday needs like transportation or food, consumers worry that they won’t be able to borrow what they need. &nbsp;</p>







<p>Open banking data can help consumers get to the bottom of these challenges.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>For starters, open banking allows consumers to permission access to their bank account, allowing lenders to augment their credit decisioning models with real time information that gives a better view of the consumer’s ability to repay a loan.&nbsp;That’s important because 95% of those who have been denied a loan in the past two years want more insights into the lending process. People are willing to share secure access to their bank account data, if it means better interest rates, instant approval for a loan, improved chances of being approved for a credit card or to secure an increase in the limit on a credit card.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>Lenders benefit, too. By augmenting traditional credit models with open banking, they can improve operational efficiencies, lower costs and create innovative new lending models that can give consumers the credit they deserve, when they need it.  &nbsp;</p>



 The world is going digital 



<p>The data revealed in Mastercard’s Lend Report shows global consumer support for a more transparent, digital-first approach to lending. Read more about the future of lending in Mastercard’s Lend Report <a href="https://www.finicity.com/future-of-lending-report/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/certificate-solutions/learn/certification-authority-authorization">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)</a> was mandated for TLS certificates in September 2017. The primary purpose of CAA is to allow the domain owner to authorize specific CA(s) to issue TLS certificates for their domains. It also prevents other CAs from issuing TLS certificates for those domains. CAA limits the risk and scope of certificate issuance to only approved CAs.</p>
<p>When the Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) Requirements were introduced in July 2021, CAA was included with the “issuevmc” record. It was important to have a new record, so TLS CA authorizations would not impact VMC issuance.</p>
<p>With the introduction of the <a href="https://cabforum.org/smime-br/">S/MIME Baseline Requirements</a>, there is now a place to provide standard requirements for S/MIME certificate issuance. One goal was to extend CAA to email addresses for the issuance of S/MIME certificates. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9495.html">Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Processing for Email Addresses- RFC 9495</a> has just been published to support this requirement and provide the “issuemail” record to permit CAs to issue S/MIME certificates.</p>
<p>The standard CAA record form for email addresses would look like this:</p>
 
 mail.client.example &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAA 0 issuemail “authority.example” 
 
<p>The “authority.example” identifying domain value would be provided by the CA in their CPS. The Entrust CAA identifying domain is “entrust.net”.</p>
<p>Domain owners are encouraged to use CAA to streamline the CAs that can issue TLS, VMC, or S/MIME certificates for domains. From a risk mitigation point of view, this stops CAs from issuing requests that have not been approved. An unapproved CA request could come from an attacker or could also come from a colleague who is not familiar with your CA selection process.</p>
<p>Note; There has been no CA/Browser Forum ballot to date, so the S/MIME Baseline Requirements have not been updated to require CAA to be checked before issuing S/MIME email certificates. We expect a CAA checking requirement to be added to the S/MIME BRs within the next year.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In the second release cycle of 2023, we have updated our SSO to include Client Credentials Grant. &nbsp;In addition, we have performed several corrections and improvements as well as regular security updates and life-cycle management on the Identity Platform. For full details, please review the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9084600321/Identity+Server+2023.2+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
 Features 
 Client Credentials Grant with OIDC (OpenID Connect) 
<p>In brief, the Client Credential Grant permits an application (or client) the ability to request an access token. This token is used instead of having the application configured with an administrator password, thus being more secure.</p>
<p>Ubisecure’s <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9138405377/Client+Credentials+Grant+reference+-+SSO">Client Credentials Grant</a> implementation supports two key use cases for the flow.</p>
 
 Authorised Access use case, also known as Common flow – the Client’s access token is used to impersonate the client and request resources from other servers or applications. 
 A lessor used, but available within the specification, configuration method is the Single application use case. In this flow a server is using its own credentials to access local resources on the same server, requiring user’s access rights. 
 
 Improved Stability 
<p>Also found in this development cycle are several smaller stability improvements. Memory and cache cleaning improvements will help environments with very long uptimes or very high utilisation for SSO. For CustomerID we have resolved a number of registration work-flow errors that could result in additional manual clean-up requirements of the LDAP directory.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>With the CI running updates continuously for many of the utilised third-party libraries, we have been able to focus on additional security items. We have updated OpenLDAP MDB to 2.5.16, which includes OpenSSL v3 – an essential update as OpenSSL v1 is no longer being maintained. This OpenLDAP update has been backported to IDS 2023.1 release (SSO 9.3, in SSO 9.2.3).</p>
 Improved Information 
<p>Addressing a concern raised by a number of customers, we’ve also reorganised the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20232/pages/9103376399/Change+Log+-+Identity+Platform">Change Log for Identity Server</a>.&nbsp;With this new format, you can quickly see which version of SSO should be grouped with which version of CustomerID and if there have been essential patches to each core application.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>Over the coming winter, we will be focusing on essential improvements around Swedish BankID, namely the support of the required animated QR codes. We’ll also be performing essential life-cycle management updates – we expect you to be able to see these clearly on a new area of the Developer Portal that will help to illustrate the overall system requirements and maintenance for your on-premise environment; note that using our Identity Cloud will ensure that all of the life-cycle management and upgrade requirements are fully managed by Ubisecure’s Operations Team.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>In my presentation at the KuppingerCole's <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution 2023 conference</a> in Frankfurt, entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/beware-of-easy-paths-cre23">"Beware of Easy Paths: The Journey Towards NIS2 Compliance",</a> I focused on the complexities of the revised Network and Information Systems Directive (NIS2) issued by the European Union. While I am neither a lawyer nor an auditor (so they might be important peers to talk to on your NIS2-journey), my focus is on the practical implications of this crucial piece of cybersecurity legislation. As a critical component of the EU's cybersecurity strategy, NIS2 extends its influence across various essential sectors, encompassing energy, transport, banking, and health. This directive marks a significant shift in the cybersecurity landscape, setting forth new challenges and requirements for organizations, particularly for medium-sized and large companies, as they strive to align with these evolving regulations.</p>
 Understanding NIS2 
<p>NIS2 is a pivotal piece of legislation issued by the European Union, aimed at fortifying cybersecurity measures across its member states. This directive serves as a cornerstone in the EU's strategy to enhance resilience and response capabilities in the face of growing cyber threats. NIS2 applies broadly within the EU, encompassing a variety of sectors deemed critical for the economy and society. These sectors include energy, transport, banking, health, digital infrastructure, and public administration, among others.</p>
<p>Crucially, NIS2 came into force on January 16, 2023. However, its practical application involves a multi-stage process. First, member states are required to transpose the directive into national law. This aspect underscores the need for harmonization of cybersecurity standards across different jurisdictions while allowing for some degree of customization to address national specifics. Second, the organizations within the scope of NIS2, particularly those categorized under <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80065/kritis-understanding-and-protecting-critical-infrastructure">KRITIS</a> (Critical Infrastructures), are mandated to comply within a 21-month period. This staged approach aims to provide a structured and feasible pathway for entities to adapt and align with the directive's requirements.</p>
 The Scope and Impact of NIS2 
<p>NIS2 significantly expands the framework of cybersecurity obligations compared with its predecessor. It encompasses a wider range of organizations by categorizing them as either "essential" or "important" entities. This distinction is critical, as it brings a greater number of companies under the purview of NIS2, particularly those that were not previously subject to such stringent cybersecurity regulations.</p>
<p>For essential facilities, the level of criticality and obligations is higher. Important institutions, although new to this level of regulatory scrutiny, now also fall under the ambit of NIS2. This expansion significantly broadens the range of affected companies and organizations, moving beyond the traditional sectors of critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>Moreover, NIS2 introduces specific thresholds for determining which companies are considered medium-sized or large, making many more companies subject to these regulations. &nbsp;Medium-sized companies are defined as having 50-250 employees and a turnover of €10-50m and/or a balance sheet of less than €43m.&nbsp; Large companies are those with more than 250 employees and a turnover of €50m and/or a balance sheet of €43m. The implications of these thresholds are substantial, especially for medium-sized companies, which may find themselves grappling with a massive tightening of cybersecurity requirements.</p>
 Requirements and Enforcement under NIS2 
<p>NIS2 introduces a blend of specific and generic requirements to ensure comprehensive cybersecurity across various sectors. Article 21 of NIS2, for instance, lists several specific mandates, particularly focusing on risk management, incident response, authentication, and other measures. However, NIS2 also emphasizes adherence to current best practices, certifications, and a generally high and appropriate level of security. This dual approach allows for flexibility while maintaining a baseline of cybersecurity standards.</p>
<p>The enforcement of NIS2 is marked by firm oversight and significant sanctioning power. Supervisory bodies are designated at the national level to monitor and enforce compliance. This includes strengthened supervisory measures ensuring entities' adherence to cybersecurity protocols and the introduction of severe penalties for non-compliance. Cross-border collaboration is a key feature, enhancing cooperation between member states for consistent enforcement. And requirements for transparency and disclosure are stipulated, mandating clear communication regarding cybersecurity incidents and measures. NIS2 encourages initiatives exceeding minimum requirements, fostering a culture of cybersecurity excellence, and promotes public-private partnerships to enhance overall cybersecurity resilience.</p>
 Focusing on Compliance: A Tailored Approach 
<p>From KuppingerCole’s perspective, a key aspect of complying with NIS2 is recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, no matter what vendors, consultancies or whoever tells you. Each organization must define and implement NIS2 compliance in a manner that reflects its unique context and challenges. This tailored approach is crucial, considering the diverse range of sectors and company sizes affected by the directive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image: NIS2 - From Initial Assessment to Continual Implementation</p>
<p>Organizations should prioritize a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, as advocated by NIS2. This involves not only identifying and assessing cyber risks unique to their operations but also developing bespoke strategies to mitigate these risks. Compliance, therefore, becomes a dynamic and continuous process, necessitating ongoing adjustments and improvements in line with the evolving cyber threat landscape and organizational changes.</p>
<p>Key areas of focus include risk management, incident reporting, supply chain protection, and cyber hygiene. Each of these areas requires a detailed and customized strategy, taking into account the specific needs and capabilities of the organization. For instance, incident reporting protocols must be efficient yet sensitive to the particular operational context of the business.</p>
 Practical Implementation Strategies 
<p>For practical implementation, especially for SMEs, the focus should be on developing manageable and cost-effective cybersecurity strategies. SMEs often face resource constraints and skill gaps, making it imperative to find solutions that balance cost with effectiveness. Simplifying compliance processes and tailoring strategies to the operational realities of SMEs can significantly aid in meeting NIS2 requirements. Collaboration and community initiatives can also play a pivotal role, allowing SMEs to pool resources and share knowledge to enhance their cybersecurity posture collectively.</p>
<p>In summary, the implementation of NIS2 demands a thoughtful, customized approach, particularly for smaller organizations facing unique challenges in their compliance journey.</p>
 Navigating NIS2 Compliance 
<p>NIS2 marks a significant shift from the conventional checkbox compliance to a more integrated approach, embedding cybersecurity, compliance, and resilience into the very fabric of organizational processes. It prompts a departure from the simplistic, procedural adherence to regulations, focusing instead on a comprehensive assessment of risks. The directive advocates for a customized journey to compliance, one that is not generic but tailored to the specific needs and risk profiles of individual organizations, underscoring the need for a strategic and nuanced application of its mandates.</p>
<p>In addressing NIS2 compliance, it is clear that a uniform solution is not feasible. Each organization must approach compliance in a manner tailored to its unique context. Seeking assistance from a range of professionals, including peers, consultants, analysts, lawyers, and the enforcing bodies is advisable for navigating this complex regulation. Collaboration with these experts can provide the necessary insights for effective compliance strategies.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole Analysts, we focus on offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-nis2-directive-who-what-and-how">realistic strategies for NIS2 compliance</a>. We understand the challenges involved and aim to provide pragmatic solutions, recognizing that each organization's journey towards compliance is distinct.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while the path to NIS2 compliance is intricate and requires a bespoke approach, there are <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/advisory">resources</a> available to guide organizations through this process, ensuring a secure and compliant digital environment.</p>

<p>To find out more, check out <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/how-you-can-use-sudo-platform-digital-identities-and-decentralized-identity-capabilities-to-rapidly-deliver-customer-privacy-solutions/">how you can use Sudo Platform to rapidly deliver customer privacy solutions</a>.</p>



 <br>Sudo Platform combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of SDKs 



Figure 1: Sudo Platform



<p>Sudo Platform is built for developers by developers.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Sudo Platform is a set of scalable hosted services that provide the capabilities to an enterprise developer. You can integrate these hosted services with your systems to provide entitlement, federated single sign-on, and other integrations that allow your existing customers to seamlessly access the Sudo Platform services you want.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform hosted services are also integrated into various third party systems such as cloud providers, telephony carriers, banks, payment processors, blockchains, and more. These hosted services are deployed individually for each of Anonyome’s consumer-facing customers/partners, completely separating them from other customer/partners’ data and services and providing the ability to customize that environment for the individual organization.</p>



<p>Above the hosted services sit SDKs, documentation and sample apps distributed through GitHub which allow Sudo Platform customers to quickly develop applications using Sudo Platform services. This software is open source so you can quickly become productive. All Sudo Platform SDKs are offered in Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript, which means you can freely enhance any of your web, mobile or desktop products that make up your full software suite.</p>



<p>If you’d prefer a faster route to market or lack the internal expertise or capacity to create and deploy applications to end users, we also publish UI kits that enable easy setup, configuration, and consumption of platform SDKs into unbranded applications that can be quickly branded and delivered to market on mobile, web, and desktop platforms. This rapid white label offering is very attractive to organizations that want or need to move quickly.</p>



<p>A UI kit gives you access to libraries of advanced software modules with complex data and graphical flows that go beyond basic Sudo Platform service access. The first library contained in a UI kit is the core library, which provides complex business logic for data management and functional utilities that span one or more of the Sudo Platform services. The second library contained in a UI kit is the UI library, which has widgets, screens and minor user flows that give recommended user experiences for a feature and can be integrated into your application. UI kits are supported across Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript/TypeScript.</p>



<p>An unbranded application (or white label application) allows you to take advantage of fully developed and supported applications for web, mobile and desktop platforms. Our unbranded apps deliver an optimal user experience of Sudo Platform services, and you can add your logo, color palette and other branding requirements. Once complete, you simply add your new apps to your product portfolio for fast deployment and integrate them with your user management and accounting systems.</p>



 Sudo Platform keeps up with the privacy landscape 



<p>We can only achieve privacy if Sudo Platform products and services adapt to the ever-evolving data surveillance landscape. We have built Sudo Platform offerings against enhancement roadmaps and with a philosophy of continuous development so it stays abreast of user needs. Each release incorporates the latest support for all mobile, web and desktop platforms and features regular security updates for packaged software dependencies.</p>



<p>The Sudo Platform GitHub site is shown below. We include our SDKs and sample apps (including source code) to make it easy to leverage the capabilities into your applications.</p>

<p>The instructions for how to build Sudo Platform capabilities into your applications are included in our documentation site:</p>



Figure 3: Sudo Platform documentation



<p>You can find more information about Sudo Platform in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/">documentation</a>, open source <a href="https://github.com/sudoplatform">SDKs</a> for mobile, web and desktop, and official <a href="https://github.com/search?q=org%3Asudoplatform+sample">sample applications</a>.</p>



 Getting started takes just 4 simple steps 



 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create an account 



<p>Start by creating an account so you can access, configure and integrate Sudo Platform services into your products.</p>



<p>Creating an account is simple. Each Sudo Platform account has two key characteristics:</p>



 
 complete account isolation 



 feature service customization. 
 



<p>Unlike accounts with traditional multi-tenant SaaS companies, Sudo Platform accounts are individual and isolated from others within the system so that core services and data are unique to each deployment. In real terms, this helps to eliminate any risk of information cross-contamination within our internal systems.</p>



<p>Each Sudo Platform account is unique for each customer based on individual need. When you create a Sudo Platform account, your selection of features and any subsequent configuration makes your deployment different from other customers’ deployments on Sudo Platform. This means:</p>



 
 You only pay for what you need. 



 The deployment is implemented against your compliance, data and location requirements. 



 You have clear visibility into what you are developing against. 



 Manage your account with the Sudo Platform management console<br><br>The management console lets you manage your administrative and end users, gain critical insight into the analytics underlying your deployment, and explore ways to enhance your Sudo Platform experience. 
 



<p>Your Sudo Platform management console is a real-time reflection of your deployment. It lets you view and alter the features that back the integrated products and affects how your services interact with Sudo Platform. This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>

This means you can easily adapt your customers’ experiences with Sudo Platform features and your existing authentication, subscriptions, billing and entitlements systems.</p>



 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start with a sample app or go straight to SDKs 



<p>Once you have your Sudo Platform account, why not check out what it can do? You can do this via a sample app or jump right into integration with our SDKs.</p>



<p>Using a sample app is the fastest way to see how the Sudo Platform services work and the value they can provide. You can easily explore the technology and imagine the potential for your products, either as an enhancement or brand new offering.</p>



<p>If you dive right into integration with our SDKs, you’ll find they are designed for seamless integration with all your existing and new applications. Each SDK is built to run natively on all supported platforms, so they have the highest chance of compatibility with your applications, independent of the frameworks and architecture you employ.</p>



<p>To integrate with the platform you’re developing on, simply use the appropriate package manager (see table below) and add a dependency to the Sudo Platform SDKs you need for your project. If you need help using one of the listed package managers, refer to its documentation.</p>



PlatformPackage manageriOS (Swift)Cocoapods: https://cocoapods.org/Android (Kotlin)Maven Central: https://search.maven.org/Javascript/Typescriptnpmjs: https://www.npmjs.com/



<p>See our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started">documentation</a> for more information.</p>



 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain your Sudo Platform application 



<p>Maintaining a Sudo Platform application is an important exercise once you have integrated our SDKs. Everything you need to know each release to plan or automate how you pull in fixes, updates and new features is available in GitHub and the Sudo Platform documentation.</p>



 Changelogs 



<p>Changelogs for all Sudo Platform SDK releases are available in the associated GitHub repository. Within these changelogs there is information about each release, including:</p>



 
 a description of changes that are newly available 



 an indication of SDK versions that are compatibility breaking 



 a description of fixes that are available 



 assets associated with a release. 
 



<p>To access this changelog information for each release, simply go to the appropriate GitHub repository and click the ‘Releases’ link in the right pane:</p>







<p>The next page gives you access to the changelogs associated with each release of the SDK:</p>







 Versioning 



 Rules 



<p>Our versioning adheres to semantic versioning-like rules so integrating up-to-date releases into your CI/CD development pipelines is easy. Introducing Sudo Platform products from official release repositories into your dependency pipeline and adhering to versioning rules ensures constant compatibility with the services in your Sudo Platform deployment.</p>



<p>The rules in Sudo Platform versioning are:</p>



 
 MAJOR version when incompatible API changes are released 



 MINOR version when backwards compatible functionality is released 



 PATCH version when backwards compatible bug fixes are released. 
 



<p>If we deviate from these rules, we will let you know in the documentation as soon as possible so you can adapt.</p>



 Compatibility 



<p>Another important consideration is the compatibility of the version of the SDKs your application uses and the version of the SDKs supported by the services within your Sudo Platform deployment. Ignoring the compatibility of your application’s SDK versions can cause your application to stop functioning correctly or completely.</p>



<p>We have an API that lets you verify the general compatibility of your application against your deployed instance. This API gives you information about the compatibility status of your application and any features that are incompatible. As a result, you can design your application to appropriately respond to this API based on your needs and the overall scenario:</p>



 
 understand the compatibility of an application during development 



 inform a user about the need to update their application installation to a compatible version 



 gracefully disable select functionality of the application based on the nature of the compatibility issue. 
 



<p>You can find specific guidance on each platform’s implementation of this API and some sample code in our <a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/getting-started#verifying-the-app-compatibility-with-backend-services">documentation</a>.</p>



 Those 4 simple steps achieve 3 big rewards 



 
 You access a unique, comprehensive, performant, scalable, and secure way of introducing privacy-first services and paradigms into your products.<br><br> 



 You get the services and development building blocks you need to build solutions that meet your users’ demands quickly, seamlessly and with future vision.<br><br> 



 You deploy cutting-edge capabilities across communication, collaboration and commerce, and integrate them into your products and processes so you can:
 
 enhance your users’ privacy 



 fill gaps in your product portfolio 



 help mitigate the ever-increasing threat of data surveillance.

<p>To act in the world we must first make sense of it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the world is complex, containing an amount of information exceeding the processing capacity of any individual or group. Adequate sensemaking in the context of complexity and info-abundance therefore requires the ability to process and analyse data. </p><p>We refer to this capability as data-driven sensemaking.</p><p>Yet, today the means for data-driven sensemaking are unevenly distributed. In our essay, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/issues/issue-02-territories-of-transition/data-commoning-as-a-territory-of-transition/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Politics of Data: Data Commoning as a Territory of Transition</a>, we described how data is shaping the landscape of power, perpetuating and amplifying asymmetries. Unsurprisingly, the principal beneficiaries are large corporations and state actors with the financial and technical resources required to undertake data collection, processing and analysis at scale. As with ‘natural resources’ and ‘labour’, the dominant economic and cultural logics of today regard data as another resource to be extracted, siloed and abused in service of narrow objectives and/or for the benefit of a few.</p><p>While data alone cannot orient us, it can help to reveal new possibilities and trajectories. Yet, data only realises its potential as a coordinative aid if it is able to flow freely through our digital territories. Practices of data sharing are important — surely — but data must also be capable of transmutation; of undergoing a kind of alchemical process of reconfiguration and recombination in the midst of varying contexts. This conception regards data — or information — as a living process rather than a static object or resource. Data is made more contextually relevant when the logics and infrastructure we employ to generate, channel and transform data support these kinds of evolutionary dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this series of posts and the technical interventions described, we are seeking to understand and embody this conception of data as a living process, and to articulate interventions intended to help unlock data toward greater service to life. In other words, like many in the Holochain ecosystem, we are endeavouring to engage in data commoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we will introduce the technical stack for a data commons, discussing data collection, discovery, and analysis; considering distributed computing and large language models; and proposing an algorithm library for analytic tools. We then go on to discuss the social effects of narrative and to think about how data and sensemaking could be reframed to support a generative future. Finally, in part two of this article series we will dive deeper into knowledge graphs, so don’t forget to read that article as well.</p> The Data Commons Stack <p>The capacity for commoning derives in part from maintained symmetry in power dynamics preventing data from becoming a source of extraction, enclosure, and ultimately tragedy. Consider that, the moment we click 'send' or 'save', our tweets, notes, and messages are expedited to a remote data warehouse controlled by the respective platform provider. Here our data becomes a means by which platforms increase revenue and market dominance rather than as a means for collective sensemaking. The digital spaces where we gather, lauded as the 21st century ‘town squares’ are, in truth, more like vast feudal estates. The conversations occurring within are, in many respects, the property of our digital usurpers rather than the domain of public knowledge.</p><p>Yet we remain hopeful that these power asymmetries can be mitigated — even corrected — given the right cultural and technological conditions. We’ll begin by addressing the technological dimension and speak to the cultural dimension toward the end of this post.&nbsp;</p> Layer Zero <p>Agent-centric, peer-to-peer (P2P) frameworks like <a href="https://holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> support data commoning by providing certain assurances with respect to access, control, and provenance of the data we collectively generate. On the one hand, local-first storage affords us privacy and control with respect to our personal data whilst distributing and validating shared data among peers allows more flexible, selective means of data access. Here, data can be stewarded and evolved in a cooperative manner with reduced risk of extraction and exploitation. With these foundations, it becomes possible to support what we call 'generative information ecosystems': spaces in which information evolves toward greater complexity, relevance, and integration.&nbsp;</p><p>While Holochain's agent-centric architecture and data integrity mechanisms provide essential ingredients toward data sovereignty, it does not automatically grant the capability to discover and derive insights from data. Hence, an initial focus for our team at Arkology Studio is developing a suite of modules for data discovery and analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>For us, important sensemaking occurs in the context of our lived realities; human beings embedded in community and specific bioregions, rather than just the halls of academia and research laboratories.&nbsp;Hence, the hope is that the affordances of open, data-driven sensemaking tools can be matched with the orienting/decision-making capacities of grassroots organisations and communities attending to local challenges. By empowering local actors to share, discover, and draw insights from data, we may see connective tissues expand, and local solutions spread and adapt to new contexts.&nbsp;</p><p>The following diagram offers an initial high-level overview of a ‘data commons stack’, indicating the five functional categories or ‘layers’: collection, storage, discovery, analysis, and knowledge. </p>Figure 1: high-level systems overview of the ‘data commons’ stack<p>While the diagram above depicts a linear progression for illustrative simplicity, in actuality there exists a variety of feedback loops between the many subsystems. Note, for example, that published insights at the knowledge layer may themselves become data points in the data storage layer, to be included in later analyses (this unlocks, for example, interesting possibilities for narrative analysis, which we investigate in part two of this article series). Furthermore, there exists a feedback loop between our understanding of the world and our behaviour in the world. In other words, knowledge can engender change in material reality, which in turn may affect our understanding of said material reality. It is these sorts of feedback loops which reveal the complex, dynamical nature of a data commons and, if supported, enable it to adapt to evolving contexts.</p> Collection <p>Since data-driven sensemaking is impractical without a diversity of data, methods for channelling and/or exposing data from a multitude of sources is paramount. On the one hand, this involves developing standardised, consensual methods for data collection from applications, including IoT devices, traditional web apps, and other Holochain apps: what we term ‘data channels’. Data entering the ecosystem from the ‘outside’ (i.e beyond the data-sovereign membrane) is always mediated through an agent (e.g. a human or IoT device), who submits the contents along with a record containing metadata that can be recognised and validated by other agents (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s validation rules</a>). In other words, we record the provenance and context associated with any data point. Since other Holochain apps are already operating within their respective data-sovereign membrane, and self-host their own data, participants in those networks may reveal relevant data to the data commons ecosystem for query. As for storing all this data, Holochain already provides us with mechanisms for distributed data storage (see <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain’s DHT</a>), with capacity scaling linearly with the number of peers.&nbsp;</p> Discovery <p>With a data commons, one is presented with the challenge of effective data discovery. Since those who control the map control the territory, it is important to mitigate against monopolies on discovery mechanisms. Google’s search engine dominance engenders a kind of monoculture with respect to the very way we discover new information. Since search/discovery algorithms privilege certain data over others by design, it may be necessary to mitigate against algorithmic monopolies by encouraging a multiplicity of discovery services. Since the data commons is essentially a giant peer-to-peer (P2P) network composed of human and non-human agents, it may be useful to conceptualise these services as ‘personal agents’ who crawl the data commons on our behalf, surfacing data relevant to our needs. Imagine, for example, that you are undertaking interdisciplinary research on a controversial topic and are aware of potential biases. Here, you may be inclined to engage a search agent proficient at discovering diverse/divergent viewpoints. Furthermore, agents may operate on our behalf even when we are not actively engaged in search/discovery. For example, you may initiate an agent to notify you of regional climate events or the latest research results in cancer treatments. Since the way we acquire data is an essential step in data-driven sensemaking, it is important that we have the means to parameterize and personalise data discovery in accordance with our intentions and aspirations.</p> Analysis <p>One of the first and most exciting mechanisms for sense-making that becomes available to participants of the data commons can be conceived as similar to both <a href="https://openpds.media.mit.edu/?ref=blog.holochain.org">SafeAnswers</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation?ref=blog.holochain.org">secure-multiparty computation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, ‘safe answers’ refers to the ability to perform computation on user data without revealing the raw data itself. The analyst is responsible for sending an inspectable analysis algorithm to the agent whose data is being processed for insight. This way, all computation is performed locally on the machines where the data is stored (the machine of the agent on a Holochain network). The analyst receives only the return of the algorithm and has no access to the raw data itself.&nbsp;</p><p>One can imagine the unlocking potential of this type of distributed computation when it comes to personal or sensitive data. This is demonstrated by an example pertaining to personal health data. On the one hand, it can be very useful to understand, say, the amount of people in a given area who are predisposed to cancer. The disposition may be informed by genetics, lifestyle, and other factors. In a traditional data relationship between an app user and a company stewarding their data, there is no assurance that the company will not use/sell their data in a compromising way, such as to an insurance firm that may increase the excesses to the user given their predisposition. By running an algorithm on the devices of the users who are being considered in the analysis, it becomes possible to undertake sensitive and important investigations without creating a honeypot of compromising data.&nbsp;</p> Algorithm Library&nbsp; <p>A library of datasets alone is necessary yet insufficient for effective sense-making. Tools are required to effectively traverse and distil the meanings and implications contained within the datasets in order for the data to affect meaningful change in the world. In order to unlock the agentic capacities of groups endeavouring to common around data towards data-driven sensemaking we are proposing a library of open-source algorithms aimed at crowd-sourcing data-science expertise in order to make data-driven sensemaking more accessible to less data-literate folk. By introducing algorithms into the data commons ecosystem, our intuition is that a data commons is not just informed by inert data points, but rather is the interaction of these data points and the actors that engage with them towards distilling an understanding of reality. In this way, it can be useful to think of this project as a praxis for data commoning, more than simply a 'data commons'.</p> Large Language Models <p>The speed of Large Language Model (LLM) development is overwhelming, with a multitude of new tools being released that are changing everything from education, to search engines, to AI assistants. Without dedicating too much of this text to this topic, it is important to indicate the possibilities for organisations and communities to develop specialised agents fine-tuned on the capacities of the data that they are commoning around. In some ways, a generative model trained on a given set of data is a codified narrative; an artificial agent acting on behalf of the semantic patterns that inform it.&nbsp;</p> Narrative Ecosystems &amp; Cultural Evolution <p>The transformative potential of a given technological ecosystem is <a href="https://consilienceproject.org/technology-is-not-values-neutral-ending-the-reign-of-nihilistic-design-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">limited by the values and ontologies</a> associated with the dominant cultural environment in which their activity is based. Hence, while we think tools that improve our capacities for sensemaking are important — especially when grounded in data-sovereign infrastructure like Holochain — they are not panaceas. Responding to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kBoLVvoqVY&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">poly/metacrisis</a> requires a transformation of the dominant culture, not merely technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In light of this, Arkology Studio has been collaborating with <a href="https://culturehack.io/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Culture Hack Labs</a> to advance a set of tools for narrative research. For Culture Hack Labs, effective system change necessitates understanding the narrative forms and narrative ecologies that perpetuate social and ecological breakdown. Here, <a href="https://www.culturehack.io/curriculum/curriculum/introduction-to-narratives/module-2-introduction-to-narratives-2/?ref=blog.holochain.org">narratives can be understood</a> as “interpretive social structures that frame our experience and function to bring meaning to our everyday reality, guiding our actions and decisions.” In other words, one can transform culture by intervening at the level of narratives.&nbsp;</p><p>The narrative, ‘data as resource’, reflects the tendency of modern, industrialised societies to regard nature — including her living creatures and material output — as something to be exploited for human benefit (or, rather, for those with the means to exploit her first). Through this framing, data is something to accumulate (‘big data’), gatekeep (e.g. academic journals), and exploit (e.g. behaviour profiling to sell ads). Contrast this narrative with ‘data in service to life’ or ‘data as living process’, which invites us to consider data and its associated processes as a fundamentally cooperative dynamic.&nbsp;</p><p>In recognising the power of narratives to guide cultural evolution, we have begun to explore what meaningful narrative interventions could look like in the context of a data commons. In particular, what would it mean to meaningfully shift narrative ecosystems toward more life-affirming frames without necessarily prescribing, in a top-down manner, the frames themselves? Is it conceivable, in other words, that the very insights generated within a data commons might help steer society toward a more generative future?&nbsp;</p> What’s Next? <p>In part two of this series, we investigate this question through a speculative discussion on the ‘knowledge’ layer of the Data Commons Stack. Specifically, we explore how to represent knowledge in a manner that is pluralistic rather than homogenising, and how we may more readily perceive the influence and evolutionary potential of the narratives that live within and amongst us. We propose a toolkit that draws from the knowledge emerging out of cooperative communities and allows the construction of agent/community-centric knowledge graphs; networks of insights built upon a shared node library and structurally arranged to represent the epistemic geometries of their ontological framing.&nbsp;</p><p>Our inquiry also leads us into a discussion on knowledge discovery and the risks of epistemic pluralism; in particular, how we might use open discovery patterns and quantitative measures from Integrated Information Theory to move us toward more integrative frames.</p> Guest Authors <p>This guest post, the first of two articles on data commoning, was written by Ché Coelho and Ross Eyre of Arkology Studio.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/arkology/about/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Arkology Studio</a> (‘architecture’ + ‘ecology’) is a transdisciplinary design and software engineering studio whose mission is to support the development of commons-oriented socio-technical interventions for systems change. </p>

			 Gonzalo García Arahuetes is a Back-End Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-garcia-arahuetes/">Gonzalo García Arahuetes</a>, and I was born in Segovia, Spain. I work as a Back-end Developer at Tokeny, although it would have been crazy for me to think of such a job some years ago, since my initial formation had nothing to do with computers. I started Law and Business Administration studies in Madrid but soon changed it for Humanities and moved to Barcelona for my master’s degree. Although I did a lot of research on Literature and Philosophy, I eventually started some courses on Digital Humanities, focused on database maintenance and data management, and this is how I became more and more curious about technology and its ethical and political implications. With that in mind, I started another master’s degree in Web Development and began to study the consequences of blockchain for economies and individuals.</p>
<p>I love keeping those two paths alive, as I regard them as complementary. While my professional career is devoted to web development and tech-related issues, I am still working on a Ph.D. thesis on Peter Sloterdijk’s early work, and I dedicate a great deal of my free time to books, writing, and research.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>I was working for a small start-up as a Full-Stack developer. One day, I saw a job offer from Tokeny for senior developers. I applied, specifying that I was not a senior at all but that I had plenty of curiosity for the blockchain world and was eager for an opportunity like this. Of course, I expected no response, but Luc himself, the CEO, replied! We had a very pleasant meeting, and he told me that all he wanted were ‘smart and motivated people.’ The process took some time because Tokeny was opening its Spanish office in Barcelona, but joining this team was the perfect decision for me.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Luc wanted a team of ‘smart and motivated people,’ and I think that is what he got! Working at Tokeny means sharing time and goals with some of the most fun, skilled, and professional people I have met. On top of that, it is a company committed to remote work, which makes life so much easier for all of us in terms of schedule and location. In a few words, I would say that Tokeny always considers the workers’ necessities in the first place.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life?  
<p>My family is at the top: my wife Yaos and my little Lila, who was born in June. Other than that, I am very passionate about many things: books, films, my guitars, my friends, cooking, sports… In this regard, being passionate about something reveals its ambiguity (for the word ‘passion’ has a very ancient origin, always related to suffering): I love all these things, but often, it is demanding to keep up with them and not end up frustrated or exhausted.</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I am rather cautious when it comes to making long-term plans for my life, not to mention having big dreams about changing the world. I always remember Walt Whitman’s beautiful verses: “The Earth, that is sufficient, I do not want the constellations any nearer, I know they are very well where they are, I know they suffice for those who belong to them.” In my opinion, being focused on big dreams and aims keeps us from noticing that sometimes we are just carried away. Knowing that the tide is dragging you may or may not make a better swimmer out of you, but at least you will take it easy and stop worrying about reaching a certain place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>My personal view is that we are on the verge of mass adoption for blockchain technology. Given that scenario, being part of a company so involved in the transformation of the entire financial industry is a thrilling and adventurous experience. There is so much yet to learn and to witness!</p>
