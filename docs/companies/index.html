 The American Airlines 787-9 takes flight with Thales’ AVANT Up Inflight Entertainment (IFE) system, the first in the carrier’s order of 30 new aircraft. 
 The IFE system features the best picture quality on any aircraft, with stunning 4K HDR ultra-responsive touchscreens for seamless navigation, along with 60W USB-C and USB-A fast charging for customer devices, and the ability to pair a Bluetooth device. 
 American is the first carrier in the Americas to fly with Thales’ award-winning user interface for passengers with vision assistance needs. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>On 5 June 2025, American’s premium Boeing 787-9 aircraft, equipped with Thales' AVANT Up inflight entertainment (IFE) system, made its debut on its inaugural flight from Chicago O’Hare to Los Angeles followed by its inaugural Flagship Suite® service from Chicago O’Hare to London Heathrow. American Airlines, the first oneworld alliance member to introduce this IFE system, expects a total of 30 of these premium aircraft to join its fleet by 2029.</p>
<p>Premium onboard passenger experience</p>
<p>American has introduced a premium passenger experience for customers travelling on their new aircraft equipped with Thales’ AVANT Up IFE. This is the first premium Boeing 787-9 featuring spectacular 4K QLED HDR displays that deliver a cinematic experience at every seat. Navigating American’s vast catalogue of entertainment options is easy with Thales’ ultra-responsive touchscreens.</p>
<p>Thales’ seatback displays feature a Bluetooth connection for passengers to pair a device. The system is equipped with Thales’ power management solution with USB-C and USB-A fast charging that supports up to 60W of in-screen charging capacity, ensuring passengers’ devices arrive at their destination fully charged.</p>
<p>Unique passenger experiences at every seat</p>
<p>AVANT Up provides a wide range of digital services and applications, enabling American to provide a premium entertainment experience to all customers flying on the new 787-9. Passengers can enjoy more, such as an interactive Watch Party, a Picture-in-Picture viewing experience, and action-packed console gaming.</p>
<p>Accessible travel for all</p>
<p>American is the first carrier in the Americas to fly with Thales’ award-winning user interface for passengers with vision assistance needs. The user interface supports audio-cue navigation assistance, voice metadata feedback, touch and swipe gesture controls, and a large selection of audio-descriptive content to create a more inclusive and accessible travel experience for all.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Every aspect of our new 787-9 is designed to feel premium in nature,” said Heather Garboden, American’s Chief Customer Officer. “Everything our customers see on board was designed with customers in mind — from the design details to Bluetooth connectivity and state-of-the-art entertainment.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“For nearly 15 years, American Airlines has trusted Thales as their inflight entertainment provider. This enduring partnership reflects our shared commitment to create extraordinary inflight experiences, and we are thrilled to power American’s premium travel with the cutting-edge AVANT Up.” Niels Steenstrup, Chief Eexecutive Officer, Thales InFlyt Experience </p></blockquote>

 On June 17, the United States Senate voted to pass the GENIUS Act, legislation that aims to create a regulatory framework for the oversight of stablecoins, by a comfortable margin of 68-30. With a number of Senate Democrats joining the majority Republican party in voting for the bill, attention now turns to efforts in the House of Representatives.

   Since I wrote last week about MCP and the need for a more structured standards development process, this week I feel like diving into what it means to build an open standard. Unfortunately, "open standard" is a term that often gets thrown around and means entirely too many different things.

<p>“Since I wrote last week about MCP and the need for a more structured standards development process, this week I feel like diving into what it really means to build an open standard.“</p>



<p>Unfortunately, “open standard” is one of those terms that gets thrown around a lot and often means entirely too many different things. For some, it just means the spec is readable online. For others, it’s about process transparency or whether the license is royalty-free. Depending on who you ask, “open” might refer to access, governance, IP rights, implementation freedom, or all of the above.</p>



<p>This fuzziness isn’t just academic. In the world of digital identity, especially as we build wallets, verifiable credentials, and cross-border trust frameworks, how we define and implement open standards will directly shape who gets to participate, how systems interoperate, and whether anyone can avoid vendor lock-in.</p>



<p>So, let’s unpack it. What is an open standard? And why does it matter so much right now?</p>

 What does “open standard” actually mean? 



<p>Ask five people what makes a standard “open,” and you might get five different answers.</p>



<p>Some will say it’s all about access: It’s open if you can download and read the spec without paying. Others will focus on governance: It’s open if the development process is public and inclusive. Still others might zero in on intellectual property: If you can implement it without navigating a minefield of patents, it qualifies.</p>



 The ITU-T’s Definition 



<p>The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx">ITU-T</a>, a United Nations-recognized standards body, offers a fairly comprehensive <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/ipr/Pages/open.aspx">definition</a>. According to them, open standards are:</p>



<p>“Made available to the general public and developed (or approved) and maintained via a collaborative and consensus-driven process. They facilitate interoperability and data exchange among different products or services and are intended for widespread adoption.”</p>



<p>They expand this definition to include concepts like transparent development, due process, balanced input, fair access to intellectual property, and long-term maintenance. It’s a solid framework, widely used in international policy discussions.</p>



<p>But there’s another approach that resonates more strongly with how the Internet itself was built and continues to evolve.</p>



 The OpenStand Principles 



<p>In 2012, five key organizations—the IEEE, IETF, IAB, W3C, and the Internet Society—affirmed a shared set of values known as the <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bp-openstandards-20120920-en.pdf">OpenStand Principles</a>. These principles describe the processes that gave us the web, email, DNS, and secure communications protocols. In other words, they’re battle-tested.</p>



<p>The OpenStand Principles emphasize five core commitments:</p>



 
 Cooperation – Standards organizations should respect each other’s autonomy and work together. 



 Adherence to core development principles – Including due process, broad consensus, transparency, balance, and openness. 



 Collective empowerment – Standards should support innovation, interoperability, scalability, and benefit humanity. 



 Availability – Specifications must be accessible and implementable under fair terms, from royalty-free to FRAND. 



 Voluntary adoption – No mandates, no lock-in. Market success is determined by the quality of the work, not regulatory decree. 
 



<p>These principles prioritize practical interoperability, technical merit, and inclusive participation, not just public availability.</p>



<p>And yes, I’ll admit I’m biased. My work and the ecosystems I care about have benefited enormously from the OpenStand model. It’s one of the reasons the Internet scaled globally. Go, team Internet!</p>



<p>So, while the ITU-T definition is solid, OpenStand captures something deeper: a living, working model of how open collaboration can shape resilient, scalable infrastructure.</p>



<p>That model, of open, resilient collaboration, is directly relevant to digital identity.</p>



 Why this matters for digital identity 



<p>Digital identity isn’t just another software problem. It is critical infrastructure that sits at the intersection of public services, private platforms, and individual autonomy. It needs to work across borders, industries, and decades (there are so many dimensions) and do so securely, ethically, and interoperably.</p>



<p>Open standards are the only viable foundation for that kind of future. And I doubt many people would argue that point. Of course, that is only true until you ask what “open” means.</p>



<p>As our systems evolve, it’s clear that not all “open” is created equal. The technical community frequently uses the term, but how it plays out in practice depends heavily on the organization behind the spec, its governance structure, and who gets a say.</p>



<p>Let’s look at a few examples from the current identity landscape:</p>



 ISO/IEC standards are authoritative but not always accessible 



<p>The ISO <a href="https://www.iso.org/stages-and-resources-for-standards-development.html">standards process</a> is generally respected and deeply formal. Specifications like <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IE</a><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">C</a><a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html"> 18013-5</a>, which governs mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), influence national legislation and industry roadmaps. In some countries, these specs are published for free if required by law. Others adopt them by reference without making the actual text available. In most cases, you’ll need to pay to read the document.</p>



<p>Participation isn’t open in the way many expect from Internet standards. To shape an ISO spec, you need to be part of your country’s official delegation or aligned with a recognized partner organization. It’s possible, but it’s <a href="https://www.iso.org/get-involved.html">gated</a>. And that makes it harder for smaller implementers, civil society groups, or under-resourced countries to engage meaningfully.</p>



 FIDO2: open specs from a closed process 



<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance</a>, whose work underpins passkeys and other strong authentication technologies, operates with a “pay-to-play” model. To <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/members/working-groups/">participate</a> in discussions and vote on specifications, you must be a paying member of the FIDO Alliance.</p>



<p>However, once published, the specifications are free, publicly available, and widely adopted. In that sense, FIDO hits an important open standards benchmark: interoperability is possible without licensing barriers or paywalls. But governance remains closed to non-members, raising questions about transparency and balance.</p>



 OpenID4VC: open contributions, gated decisions 



<p>The <a href="https://openid.net">OpenID Foundation</a> is producing specifications for verifiable credentials and decentralized identity (e.g., <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID4VC</a>). Their process is somewhat hybrid: anyone can join the mailing lists, submit proposals, and contribute to discussions. However, only members can vote on final decisions, and membership requires payment.</p>



<p>This model blends inclusivity with formal governance. It’s more open than ISO but still includes structural limitations that can shape who ultimately steers the spec.</p>



 W3C Digital Credentials API: public input, but participation friction 



<p>Then there’s the <a href="https://w3.org">W3C</a>, where the <a href="https://w3c-fedid.github.io/digital-credentials/">Digital Credentials API</a> is currently under development. It started in a Community Group, a setting where anyone could join calls, propose changes, and contribute. But Community Groups can’t produce official <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#rec-track">W3C Recommendations</a>. The work had to move to a formal Working Group to do that.</p>



<p>In a W3C Working Group, you either need to be:</p>



 
 A member of a W3C Member organization (which usually involves a fee), 



 Or an invited expert (which requires an application and approval). 
 



<p>The general public can still file GitHub issues and read the documents. That’s more openness than many standards bodies offer, but it’s not full participation. There’s friction between visibility and influence, especially for newcomers or smaller players.</p>



 So… what counts as “open”? 



<p>With so many variations on “open,” it’s easy to fall into a purity trap where only the most idealistic, frictionless processes count. But that’s not realistic or fair.</p>



<p>Creating standards—real, robust, production-ready standards—takes work. Not just from the people writing specs or implementing test suites but also from the organizations that host the mailing lists, convene the calls, maintain the repositories, manage intellectual property frameworks, and, yes, pay the legal bills.</p>



<p>All of that takes resources. And as much as we’d like to imagine that open standards are forged purely through the goodwill of the global community, the truth is that most standards efforts today rely on a mix of volunteer labor, organizational backing, and structured funding models, some of which include paid memberships.</p>



 A new balance test 



<p>So no, we can’t simply demand that every standard be written by volunteers and hosted for free. That’s not how sustainable infrastructure gets built. But we can and should ask hard questions about transparency, participation, and accessibility.</p>



 
 Is the spec publicly available without a paywall? 



 Can you implement it without having to negotiate a license? 



 Are diverse voices meaningfully represented in its development? 



 Do the outcomes reflect shared infrastructure goals or just strategic product roadmaps? 
 



<p>We don’t need to shut down funding models. But we need to ensure those models don’t shut people out.</p>



<p>The goal isn’t to achieve some idealized version of openness. It’s to build systems that are accountable, adaptable, and inclusive. Standards that reflect a common foundation, not a competitive moat. And that’s a goal we can work toward, even in a world where time and money are very real constraints.</p>



 Open-ish is still better than closed 



<p>As much as we can and should debate the limits of openness in today’s standards processes, it’s worth remembering that things could be a lot worse. While many digital identity specifications land somewhere in the middle, open to read, semi-open to influence, gated in terms of governance, that’s still miles ahead of truly closed standards.</p>



<p>And yes, closed standards still exist, even in 2025.</p>



<p>Some of the world’s most critical systems rely on technical specifications that aren’t publicly available, freely implementable, or open to broad contribution.</p>



 Closed doors in standards 



<p>For example:</p>



 
 National identity systems in some countries are developed behind closed doors. Portions of India’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar">Aadhaar</a> system or certain Gulf nation digital IDs may be guided by specifications that are either not published or only accessible to government contractors. That makes transparency, auditability, and public trust harder to achieve. 



 Vendor-specific federation protocols have a long history in enterprise environments. Before the rise of open federated identity standards like SAML or OIDC, systems like Microsoft’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adfsod/204de335-ea34-4f9b-ae73-8b7d4c8152d1">WS-Federation</a> created tightly coupled, proprietary identity flows. While still in use in some legacy contexts, these are controlled by the vendor, not a neutral standards body. 



 Biometric matching algorithms and data formats are another example. Many face or iris recognition technologies rely on proprietary encodings that are patented, licensed, or simply undisclosed. Even when governments use them, the standards involved may not be publicly accessible, let alone reviewable. 



 Even account provisioning APIs between enterprise SaaS providers can resemble closed standards. If your identity team has ever tried to automate user provisioning without access to well-documented SCIM endpoints, you’ve probably run into a “standard” that’s really just a private interface. 
 



<p>In that light, the “open-ish” systems start to look less like compromise and more like progress.</p>



 Schrödinger’s standards, both open and closed? 



<p>Yes, it can be frustrating that you need to be a member to vote at the OpenID Foundation. Yes, it’s not ideal that the FIDO Alliance limits participation to paying organizations. And yes, W3C Working Groups aren’t truly open in the democratic sense once you leave the Community Group stage.</p>



<p>But in all these cases, the resulting specifications are:</p>



 
 Freely available, 



 Implementable without proprietary dependencies, and 



 Increasingly shaped by diverse, global input. 
 



<p>That’s not perfect openness, but it’s a long way from closed. And it’s a path we can keep improving.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com">Spherical Cow Consulting</a>. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down the evolving world of digital identity — from credentials and standards to browser quirks and policy challenges.<br>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



 



  What Is an Open Standard? 



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Last week, I explored the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and why we need a better approach to standards development. Today, let’s dive deeper and ask a foundational question: what does it mean to build an open standard?</p>



<p>The phrase “open standard” is used often — and differently — by many:</p>



 
 Some say it simply means a spec is publicly readable. 



 Others emphasize transparency, royalty-free licensing, or governance processes. 



 Still others point to access, IP rights, or implementation freedom. 
 



<p>[00:01:17]<br>And this isn’t just a philosophical debate — it affects real-world outcomes in digital identity systems, from wallets and credentials to international trust frameworks. Open standards define who participates, how systems interoperate, and whether we avoid vendor lock-in.</p>



 



  Defining “Open” — Multiple Perspectives 



<p>[00:01:41]<br>Ask five experts, and you’ll get five different definitions:</p>



 
 Access-focused: If the standard is free to read, it’s open. 



 Process-focused: If it’s developed publicly and inclusively, it’s open. 



 IP-focused: If anyone can implement it without licensing hurdles, it’s open. 
 



<p>[00:02:10]<br>The ITU-T, a UN-recognized standards body, defines an open standard as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Made available to the general public, developed via a collaborative, consensus-driven process, facilitates interoperability, and intended for widespread adoption.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>They also stress:</p>



 
 Transparent development 



 Due process 



 Balanced input 



 Fair IP access 



 Long-term support 
 



 



  The OpenStand Principles: Internet DNA 



<p>[00:03:01]<br>Another influential model comes from the OpenStand Principles, endorsed in 2012 by:</p>



 
 IEEE 



 IETF 



 Internet Architecture Board 



 W3C 



 Internet Society 
 



<p>These organizations helped build the foundational architecture of the internet.</p>



<p>[00:03:31]<br>OpenStand emphasizes:</p>



 
 Cooperation between standards bodies 



 Foundational principles: transparency, consensus, balance 



 Collective empowerment: interoperability, innovation, benefit to humanity 



 Availability: fair access, voluntary adoption 



 Success through utility, not mandates 
 



<p>[00:04:14]<br>This model values technical merit, global scale, and inclusive participation — not just a downloadable PDF.</p>



 



  Why It Matters for Digital Identity 



<p>[00:04:35]<br>Digital identity isn’t “just software.” It’s infrastructure at the crossroads of:</p>



 
 Public services 



 Private platforms 



 Personal autonomy 
 



<p>It must work across borders, industries, and time, and do so securely, ethically, and interoperably.<br>And for that, open standards are non-negotiable.</p>



 



  Examining the Standards Bodies 



<p>[00:05:14]<br>Let’s look at how open actually plays out in the real world:</p>



 



  ISO 



<p>[00:05:17]<br>The ISO/IEC standards process is formal and respected. Specs like ISO 18013‑5 (for mobile driver’s licenses) guide legislation and roadmaps.</p>



 
 Pros: Highly structured; impactful. 



 Cons: Often behind a paywall. Participation requires national delegation or official channels — not easy for small players. 
 



 



  FIDO Alliance 



<p>[00:06:12]<br>Known for passkeys and strong authentication, FIDO uses a pay-to-play model.</p>



 
 Participation requires paid membership. 



 Specs are free to access and implement once published. 



 No licensing restrictions = a big plus for developers. 
 



 



  OpenID Foundation 



<p>[00:06:52]<br>Behind OpenID Connect and now working on OpenID for Verifiable Credentials.</p>



 
 Mailing lists are open. 



 Only paying members can vote. 



 All specs are freely available, making this model more inclusive than ISO, though still tilted toward funded voices. 
 



 



  W3C 



<p>[00:07:34]<br>W3C’s Digital Credentials API is a good case study.</p>



 
 Community groups are fully open — but cannot produce official standards. 



 To become a W3C Recommendation, work must move to a Working Group. 



 Working Group participation requires either:
 
 Organizational membership (with dues), or 



 Invitation as an expert 
 
 
 



<p>Public input is welcome, but influence is limited.</p>



 



  Balancing Idealism and&nbsp;Practicality 



<p>[00:08:32]<br>So, what really counts as open?<br>There’s a danger in idealism — assuming only frictionless, volunteer-driven models are acceptable.</p>



<p>[00:08:59]<br>In reality, standards require:</p>



 
 Legal review 



 Infrastructure support 



 Paid staff 



 Long-term maintenance 
 



<p>We can’t demand “free everything” — but we can demand fairness in access and influence.</p>



<p>Ask these questions:</p>



 
 Can you read and implement the spec without legal or financial barriers? 



 Are diverse voices represented? 



 Does the result serve shared infrastructure, or just a vendor’s agenda? 
 



 



  When Standards Aren’t Open 



<p>[00:09:35]<br>Not all standards are even partially open:</p>



 
 Some national ID systems are built on unpublished specs. 



 Many biometric formats are proprietary and patented. 



 Even SaaS provisioning APIs are often undocumented and closed. 
 



<p>[00:10:09]<br>So yes — some open processes have flaws. But compared to that? Even “imperfect open” is progress.</p>



 



  A Positive Example: The Cyrus Foundation 



<p>[00:10:46]<br>A good example of a modern, open-leaning approach is the Cyrus Foundation:</p>



 
 Building an open‑source digital identity wallet 



 Prioritizes public standards like:
 
 OpenID for Verifiable&nbsp;Credentials 



 FIDO2 



 ISO 18013‑5 
 
 
 



<p>[00:11:31]<br>Their code and process are public and transparent, with contributions welcomed from across the ecosystem.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Full disclosure: I serve as an advisor to Cyrus — but only because they’re getting it right.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>[00:11:47]<br>The point isn’t that Cyrus is unique. What matters is their model — balancing practicality with open values, avoiding reinvented cryptography, and treating identity infrastructure as a shared foundation.</p>



 



  The Path Forward 



<p>[00:12:08]<br>And the good news? This future is already happening. We just need to keep showing up for it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a> today announced new detection and response capabilities in the <a href="https://www.imperva.com/products/api-security/">Imperva Application Security</a> platform to protect against business logic attacks, such as Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) - the leading threat in the OWASP API Security Top 10. By integrating real-time detection with automated mitigation of risky APIs, BOLA attacks, unauthenticated APIs, and deprecated APIs, Imperva Application Security platform delivers comprehensive protection against unauthorized data exposure and other complex business logic vulnerabilities across cloud and on-premises environments.</p>
<p>APIs have become the backbone of modern applications, enabling businesses to seamlessly connect services, optimize operations, and deliver personalized experiences at scale. According to Imperva Threat Research, <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/the-state-of-api-security-in-2024/">APIs accounted for 71% of all web traffic</a>. More recently, the team observed a sharp rise in API-directed attacks, with <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/2025-bad-bot-report/">44% of advanced bot traffic targeting APIs</a>, compared to just 10% targeting web applications. This shift underscores how attackers are increasingly exploiting API endpoints that manage sensitive and high-value data. </p>
<p>Why BOLA is a Critical Business Risk</p>
<p>BOLA occurs when APIs fail to properly verify whether users are authorized to access specific data objects. This allows attackers to manipulate requests and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. As the leading OWASP Top 10 API threat, BOLA exposes businesses to significant risks, including data breaches, compliance failures, and loss of customer trust.</p>
<blockquote><p>“API security is no longer optional - it’s fundamental to maintaining business continuity and trust,” said Tim Chang, Global Vice President and General Manager of Application Security at Thales. “Imperva Application Security bridges the gap by delivering a fully unified platform that identifies business logic threats and actively blocks malicious sessions, setting a new benchmark for API protection.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Empowering Enterprises with a Unified, Flexible, and Privacy-First Solution</p>
<p>Imperva Application Security integrates advanced threat detection engines with automated inline responses and flexible deployment options, enabling security teams to detect and respond to API attacks like BOLA without slowing development or disrupting the user experience. For customers who want to protect their API infrastructure, Imperva Application Security delivers the following benefits:</p>
 
 Unified Platform Architecture: Manage API discovery, risk assessment, detection, and mitigation in a single console, eliminating tool sprawl and operational friction across cloud and on-premises environments. 
 Real-Time BOLA Detection: Hybrid behavioral and rule-based engines analyze API request patterns, scoring anomalies, and flagging endpoints for immediate action. 
 Automated Response and Remediation: Integration with Imperva Cloud WAF and WAF Gateway enables a variety of response actions, including inline mitigation actions such as automatically blocking malicious API traffic in real-time. Integration with security automation tools ensures rapid incident orchestration. 
 
<p>Advancing the Imperva Security Anywhere Vision</p>
<p>The integration of API detection and response into Imperva Application Security is foundational to the Imperva Security Anywhere vision, which provides scalable, end-to-end protection for applications and APIs across any environment. This unified solution provides enterprises with a comprehensive view of automated threats targeting APIs and the necessary tools to protect those APIs. </p>
<p>Detection and response to deprecated APIs, unauthenticated APIs, and BOLA attacks are now available as part of Imperva Application Security. </p>

  Thales Launches File Activity Monitoring (FAM) to Strengthen  Real-Time Visibility and Control Over Unstructured Data
prezly

Tue, 06/24/2025 - 09:00


             
 New capability gives instant visibility to detect misuse, enforce compliance, and strengthen data protection across on-premises, hybrid, and multicloud environments. 
 Continuous data discovery, classification, and monitoring forms the foundation of effective Data Security Posture Management, while simplifying compliance and flagging unauthorized activities that lead to data exposure. ​  
 FAM’s built-in GenAI tools and centralized management streamlines audit reporting, accelerates threat response, reduces operational complexity across enterprise data lifecycle. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p><a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a> today announced the launch of <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/data-security/file-activity-monitoring">Thales File Activity Monitoring</a>, a powerful new capability within the Thales CipherTrust Data Security Platform that enhances enterprise visibility and control over unstructured data, enabling organizations to monitor file activity in real time, detect misuse, and ensure regulatory compliance across their entire data estate. As the only integrated platform provider that secures structured and unstructured data, Thales provides comprehensive monitoring and auditability for data types that were previously difficult to track. </p>
<p>In today’s evolving threat landscape, organizations must gain tighter control over unauthorized access and misuse of unstructured data, which according to IDC represents 90% of all worldwide data. File Activity Monitoring enables security teams to analyze and monitor the activity of unstructured data, including unexpected copying, downloading, and sharing of files such as emails, chat logs, media files, and application logs that can contain sensitive data. Real-time alerts, analytics, and encryption tracking further accelerate threat insights and protect sensitive data across the enterprise. This reduces exposure risks, supports compliance with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, and strengthens organizations’ overall data security posture. </p>
<blockquote><p>“Thales’ innovative approach to File Activity Monitoring tackles key challenges like blind spots in hybrid environments, offering real-time visibility and smart anomaly detection — a potential game-changer for teams overwhelmed by false positives. By striking the right balance of depth and simplicity, FAM shows promise in helping us strengthen the SOC without added complexity. With tighter SIEM integration, it can sharpen response and let teams focus on what matters most. We’re excited to see how FAM evolves and enhances our data security.” Leila KUNTAR, Principal Information Security Engineer, Amadeus, said. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“As unstructured data grows rapidly across distributed environments, organizations need more integrated ways to track and safeguard their most sensitive information,” Todd Moore, Vice President of Data Security Products at Thales, said. “With File Activity Monitoring, Thales reinforces its leadership in enterprise data security by delivering real-time insight, intelligent automation, and unified visibility through a single, powerful platform.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Thales has been a leader in digital security for decades in structured database activity. Building on this extensive expertise, customers can expect the same world-class experience that they’ve had with Thales, now extended to encompass unstructured data protection. </p>
<p>File Activity Monitoring strengthens DSPM by enabling security teams to:</p>
 
 Discover, classify, observe, and control sensitive data across on-premises, hybrid, and multicloud environments 
 Pinpoint where sensitive data resides, who has access, and whether it's properly secured, in real time, allowing detection of suspicious behavior including unauthorized copying, downloading, or sharing 
 Transform static classification into dynamic risk intelligence through behavioral context 
 Apply strong encryption and other remediation techniques, including reconstruction of incidents quickly with audit logs in the event of a breach or policy violation and enabling strong encryption, to protect compromised or at-risk data 
 
<p>Built-in GenAI tools simplify audits, boost response, and cut complexity</p>
<p>To further simplify compliance and security operations, File Activity Monitoring includes a Generative AI-powered Data Security Assistant. This integrated chatbot helps teams query audit data, generate custom reports, and streamline compliance workflows, reducing the burden on IT and security professionals and making it easier to meet regulatory obligations.</p>
<blockquote><p>“As technology evolves rapidly, our controls must be flexible enough to keep pace without adding complexity,” Moore said. “Automation and intelligence help overwhelmed security teams scale operations and focus on what matters most. With tools like our chatbot, they can ask natural language questions and get instant, actionable answers, accelerating response times and improving operational efficiency.”</p></blockquote>

  As UK regulators intensify AML oversight, capital markets firms must modernize their compliance strategy. This guide breaks down 2025 expectations and offers practical solutions using iComply’s AML platform.

<p>As regulatory scrutiny rises across the UK capital markets sector, firms must implement more robust AML screening protocols. This article explains the evolving expectations of the FCA and implications of MiCA for UK intermediaries, offering actionable insights on how iComply can help automate ongoing monitoring, meet PEP and sanctions requirements, and demonstrate audit-ready compliance.</p>
<p>Capital markets firms in the United Kingdom—from investment banks to securities dealers and private wealth managers—operate under one of the most stringent regulatory frameworks in the world. In 2025, this framework is expanding again, and firms face increased expectations for anti-money laundering (AML) screening, politically exposed person (PEP) monitoring, and transaction risk management.</p>
<p>The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has made it clear: compliance isn’t just about onboarding—it’s about continuous monitoring, proactive alert management, and having defensible audit trails.</p>
<p>At the same time, the European Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), while not directly applicable in post-Brexit UK, is setting a high bar across the continent. UK regulators are watching closely and signalling similar expectations, particularly for firms interacting with cryptoassets, cross-border flows, and high-risk jurisdictions.</p>
 New AML Challenges for UK Capital Markets in 2025 
<p>1. Increased Regulatory Scrutiny The FCA’s updated financial crime guide and Dear CEO letters in 2024 emphasized that firms must:</p>
 
 Demonstrate effective AML policies in practice, not just on paper 
 Screen customers and counterparties against updated sanctions and PEP lists 
 Have systems in place for continuous monitoring and adverse media alerts 
 
<p>2. Cross-Border Exposure and MiCA Influence While MiCA is EU law, its implementation is reshaping expectations globally:</p>
 
 Crypto custody, exchange, and tokenization platforms must adopt bank-grade AML processes 
 UK firms with EU branches or EU clients must match or exceed MiCA standards 
 Regulatory equivalency will be increasingly important for cross-border capital flows 
 
<p>3. Data Management and Audit-ability Legacy systems often lack clear audit trails, slowing down internal reviews and exposing firms to enforcement risk.</p>
 What the FCA Expects 
<p>From 2025 onward, UK capital markets firms are expected to:</p>
 
 Conduct real-time sanctions screening across all client relationships 
 Implement PEP and adverse media monitoring for ongoing due diligence 
 Automate AML escalation and disposition processes 
 Maintain complete records of screening decisions and risk scoring logic 
 
<p>Firms that rely on outdated or manual processes will struggle to meet these expectations and may face increased supervisory pressure.</p>
 How iComply Helps Firms Stay Ahead 
<p>1. Real-Time Global Screening iComply integrates with leading global watchlists to screen entities and individuals for:</p>
 
 Sanctions (UN, OFSI, EU, US, etc.) 
 Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) 
 Adverse media and criminal proceedings 
 
<p>2. Risk-Based Workflow Automation Risk scoring and escalation logic can be customized per firm policy, allowing for:</p>
 
 Differentiated workflows by client type or geography 
 Automated alerts for matches, updates, or changes in status 
 
<p>3. Audit-Ready Reports and Logs All screening activity is logged with timestamps, actions taken, match details, and reviewer notes. These can be exported for internal audits, regulatory exams, or board reporting.</p>
<p>4. Flexible Integration and Deployment Whether firms prefer cloud, on-premise, or hybrid environments, iComply supports secure deployment with UK data residency options and edge encryption.</p>
<p>5. Consolidated Case Management Investigate alerts, assign actions, and document decisions in a unified AML dashboard—streamlining team workflows and reducing missed red flags.</p>
 Case Insight: Private Brokerage in London 
<p>A London-based investment firm implemented iComply’s AML screening and case management tools across its brokerage and custody divisions. Within 3 months:</p>
 
 Screening false positives dropped by 38% 
 Review time per flagged entity fell from 2 hours to 15 minutes 
 The firm passed its next FCA review with zero material findings 
 
 What to Watch in 2025 
 
 OFSI Sanctions List Expansions: New regimes tied to geopolitical risk will increase screening demands 
 Crypto-Market Intersections: UK regulators are expected to introduce MiCA-equivalent standards for crypto exchanges and custody providers 
 Supervisory Tech Expectations: The FCA is pushing for greater use of RegTech to support ongoing compliance 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Firms operating in UK capital markets can no longer rely on static screening or reactive compliance strategies. The cost of falling behind is not just reputational – it’s regulatory.</p>
<p>Speak with our team to learn how iComply’s AML platform can help you reduce false positives, streamline ongoing monitoring, and prepare for tomorrow’s audit – today.</p>

			<p><a href="https://mtcm.ch/">MTCM</a>, a Luxembourg-based securitization platform serving clients across Europe, the Americas, MENA, and Asia, has entered into a strategic partnership with Tokeny, the leading onchain operating system, to enable the issuance of both traditional and digital securities through a unified workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This collaboration marks the launch of the first dual-format issuance framework in Luxembourg, where an ISIN-listed note and a permissioned security token are minted simultaneously from the same legal compartment, ensuring full fungibility and compliance across both formats.</p>

		 
	 
    The partnership with Tokeny allows us to industrialize a dual-issuance model that was previously not possible. We now produce a fungible twin issuance: one leg as an ISIN-listed note settled via a leading international CSD, the other as ERC-3643-based permissioned tokenized notes onchain. This structure enables investors and arrangers to choose between blockchain or traditional settlement, without compromising on compliance, operational efficiency, or investor protections.  Pedro HerranzManaging Partner at MTCM       The dual issuance model is a practical way to help traditional investors get familiar with the onchain format. Once they try these assets, which are faster to settle, easier to access, and enhanced with features that weren’t possible before, they will naturally prefer the modernized and better way to access, manage, and transfer securities. This would definitely accelerate the demands from buy sides and drive the adoption.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Under a white-label integration, Tokeny’s T-REX tokenization platform has been embedded into MTCM’s comprehensive end-to-end solutions. While MTCM acts as structurer, administrator and calculation agent, Tokeny provides easy-to-use interfaces to all stakeholders.</p>
<p>The integration is now live and supports the full lifecycle of a digital issuance, from onboarding and KYC to subscription and secondary solutions, within MTCM’s white-labeled investor portal. Tokeny’s technology simplifies complex workflows, embedding digital identity, AML/KYC verification, wallet integration, and cap table management into a single interface, reducing onboarding friction and improving transparency for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>This model significantly improves access, speed, and cost efficiency in structured finance. Institutional and professional investors can now self-custody digital securities, bypassing the high distribution and custodian costs typically associated with structured notes. For arrangers, this hybrid issuance opens up a wider distribution universe, combining reach through the traditional investors with new and blockchain-native investor segments.</p>
<p>With over €2.5 billion in assets under service and a 400% increase in AUS over the past two years, MTCM continues to expand its global footprint and lead innovation in hybrid financial structuring.</p>
<p>By merging the benefits of capital markets infrastructure with onchain efficiency, MTCM and Tokeny are redefining how structured investments are issued, distributed, and managed in a multi-rail financial future.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how banks, healthcare apps, or even e-commerce platforms verify your face in seconds? No passwords. No OTPs. Just a camera and some futuristic software. Welcome to the world of face authentication SDKs!</p>
<p>In today’s fast-paced digital environment, verifying real users instantly and securely has become critical. Whether it’s protecting sensitive financial data, simplifying access control in educational platforms, or preventing identity fraud in government systems, face authentication SDKs are the magic wand making it all possible.</p>
<p>This blog will walk you through everything you need to know about face authentication SDKs, including how they work, why they matter, and how Recognito is delivering best-in-class solutions in this space. Let’s dive in. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Face Authentication SDK? 
<p>An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a set of tools that helps developers build and add features to their apps. A <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face authentication SDK</a> is a toolkit that allows developers to add face recognition-based login or verification features to their apps, websites, or systems.</p>
<p>This SDK leverages:</p>
 
 Real-time facial recognition 
 AI-driven biometric analysis 
 Facial liveness detection 
 Match scoring and identity validation algorithms 
 
<p>In essence, it helps applications detect and confirm whether the person on screen is not only a match for a stored image but also a real, live human being. It’s the backbone of modern biometric security systems.</p>
<p>But wait, isn’t it the same as a face recognition SDK? Not quite.</p>
<p>While both SDKs use facial biometrics, face authentication SDKs go a step further by integrating liveness detection for face recognition, making them more suitable for high-security scenarios like banking, KYC processes, and digital onboarding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Does a Face Authentication SDK Work? 
<p>Let’s break this down step by step in the simplest way possible:</p>
 Step 1: Face Capture 
<p>The camera captures a live video or image of the user.</p>
 Step 2: Feature Extraction 
<p>Facial features like the distance between the eyes, jawline shape, cheekbone curvature, and skin texture are mapped using AI.</p>
 Step 3: Database Match 
<p>The captured data is compared against stored images or documents like driver’s licenses and passports.</p>
 Step 4: Liveness Detection 
<p>Face liveness detection SDK makes sure the person is really there and not using a photo or a fake video.</p>
 Step 5: Authentication Result 
<p>The system delivers a decision in real time, whether the identity is verified or not.</p>
<p></p>
 Types of Liveness Detection: Passive vs Active 
<p>Both active and passive liveness detection methods are crucial components of a robust <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">facial liveness detection</a> system.</p>
<p>Active Liveness Detection: Users are asked to do simple actions like blink, smile, or turn their head. These gestures are hard to mimic with static images or deepfake videos.</p>
<p>Passive Liveness Detection: The system checks for life signs without user interaction, such as skin texture, micro-expressions, or subtle movements in blood flow. This technique adds a frictionless layer of verification that’s completely invisible to users.</p>
<p>Recognito supports both, making it one of the most advanced <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">face liveness detection SDK</a> offerings in the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Is a Face Authentication SDK Essential in 2025 and Beyond? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Cybersecurity First 
<p>Online fraud is at an all-time high. With face authentication SDKs, businesses can prevent spoofing, account takeovers, and unauthorized access more effectively than ever.</p>
 2. Frictionless User Experience 
<p>Say goodbye to forgotten passwords and long login forms. With biometric login, users can access services in under 5 seconds. This makes onboarding fast, easy, and secure.</p>
 3. Real-Time Identity Verification 
<p>With liveness detection for face recognition, verification becomes instant and reliable 24/7, without manual checks.</p>
 4. Easy Integration 
<p>Modern face recognition SDKs like Recognito’s offer detailed API documentation and support for Android, iOS, and web platforms.</p>
 5. Regulatory Compliance 
<p>Industries like banking, fintech, and healthcare require strict KYC and AML compliance. Biometric authentication ensures businesses remain compliant while minimizing operational overhead.</p>
 6. Scalable and Cost-Effective 
<p>Automated identity checks help save time and money by reducing the need for manual verification.</p>

  <p>SaaS apps not only have to meet the rigorous demands of managing users at an enterprise level but must also be secure and resilient by design.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/technology-blog/open-letter-to-our-suppliers">“An Open Letter to Third-party Suppliers”</a>, Patrick Opet, Chief Information Security Officer of JPMorgan Chase, writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Modern integration patterns, however, dismantle these essential boundaries, relying heavily on modern identity protocols (e.g., OAuth) to create direct, often unchecked interactions between third-party services and firms’ sensitive internal resources.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Modern identity secure standards can help with user lifecycle maintenance of SaaS apps, e.g., provisioning and deactivating employees, and everything else in between. These solutions include adhering to protocols that facilitate single sign-on (SSO), user lifecycle management, entitlements, and full session logout across all applications. On top of managing user and non-human identities, e.g., service apps, adding AI access to work applications will bring unprecedented complexity. We don’t have a way to manage these AI tools, but there is a standard solution that aims to solve this problem. First, let’s go over how AI is currently set up to integrate across work applications.</p>

 OAuth for Enterprise AI 
<p>More AI tools are using protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect their AI learning models to make external requests to relevant data and apps within the enterprise. With growing demand and popularity for adopting AI in the workplace, how can we safely integrate AI into the enterprise?</p>

<p>Solution: There is no need to reinvent how we authenticate and authorize AI to protected resources. With recent updates to the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization">MCP authorization spec</a>, we can continue to rely on OAuth and authorization servers from external providers like Auth0, separate from MCP servers, to authenticate/authorize non-human identities, including AI.</p>

 Enterprise AI connecting to external apps 
<p>Right now, app-to-app connections require interactive user consent and happen invisibly to the enterprise IdP. Naturally, AI-to-app connections follow the same setup, which is not ideal because we need a way to move the connections between the applications, including non-human identities, into the IdP, where they can be visible and managed by the enterprise admin. How can we make this possible?</p>

<p>Solution: By combining new and in-progress OAuth extensions called <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining/">“Identity and Authorization Chaining Across Domains”</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/">“Identity Assertion Authorization Grant”</a>, which we’ll refer to as “Cross-App Access” for short. These extensions enable the enterprise IdP to sit in the middle of the OAuth exchange between the two apps or AI-to-app.</p>

 A brief intro to Cross-App Access 
<p>In this example, we’ll use Agent0 (a hypothetical MCP client) as the Enterprise AI application trying to connect to a resource application called Todo0 and its (hypothetical) MCP server. We’ll start with a high-level overview of the flow and later go over the detailed protocol.</p>

<p>First, the user logs in to Agent0 through the IdP as normal. This results in Agent0 getting either an ID token or SAML assertion from the IdP, which tells Agent0 who the user is. (This works the same for SAML assertions or ID tokens, so we’ll use ID tokens in the example from here out.) This is no different than what the user would do today when signing in to Agent0.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, instead of prompting the user to connect to Todo0, Agent0 takes the ID token back to the IdP in a request that says, “Agent0 is requesting access to this user’s Todo0 account.”
The IdP validates the ID token, sees that it was issued to Agent0, and verifies that the admin has allowed Agent0 to access Todo0 on behalf of the given user. Assuming everything checks out, the IdP issues a new token back to Agent0.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Agent0 takes the intermediate token from the IdP to Todo0, saying, “Hi, I would like an access token for the Todo0 MCP server. The IdP gave me this token with the details of the user to issue the access token for.” Todo0 validates the token the same way it would have validated an ID token. (Remember, Todo0 is already configured for SSO to the IdP for this customer as well, so it already has a way to validate these tokens.) Todo0 is able to issue an access token giving Agent0 access to this user’s resources in its MCP server.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This solves the two big problems:</p>

<p>The exchange happens entirely without user interaction, so the user never sees prompts or OAuth consent screens.</p>

<p>Since the IdP sits between the exchange, the enterprise admin can configure the policies to determine which applications are allowed to use this direct connection.
The other nice side effect of this is that since no user interaction is required, the first time a new user logs in to Agent0, all their enterprise apps will be automatically connected without them having to click any buttons!</p>

 OAuth’s Cross-App Access protocol 
<p>Now let’s look at what this looks like in the actual protocol. This is based on the adopted in-progress OAuth specification <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining/">“Identity and Authorization Chaining Across Domains”</a>. This spec is actually a combination of two RFCs: <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693">Token Exchange (RFC 8693)</a> and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7523">JWT Profile for Authorization Grants (RFC 7523)</a>. Both RFCs, as well as the “Identity and Authorization Chaining Across Domains” spec, are very flexible. While this means it is possible to apply this to many different use cases, it does mean we need to be a bit more specific in how to use it for this use case. For that purpose, Aaron Parecki has co-authored a profile of the Identity Chaining draft called <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant/">“Identity Assertion Authorization Grant”</a> to fill in the missing pieces for the specific use case detailed here.</p>

<p>Let’s go through it step by step. For this example, we’ll use the following entities:</p>
 
   Agent0 - the “Requesting Application”, which is attempting to access Todo0 
   Todo0 - the “Resource Application”, which has the resources being accessed through MCP 
   Okta - the enterprise identity provider that users at the example company can use to sign in to both apps 
 

<p></p>

 Single Sign-On 
<p>First, Agent0 gets the user to sign in using a standard OpenID Connect (or SAML) flow in order to obtain an ID token. There isn’t anything unique to this spec regarding this first stage, so we will skip the details of the OpenID Connect flow, and we’ll start with the ID token as the input to the next step.</p>

 Token exchange 
<p>Agent0, the requesting application, then makes a Token Exchange request (RFC 8693) to the IdP’s token endpoint with the following parameters:</p>

 
   requested_token_type: The value <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag</code> indicates that an ID Assertion JWT is being requested. 
   resource: The Issuer URL of the Resource Application’s authorization server. 
   subject_token: The identity assertion (e.g., the OpenID Connect ID Token or SAML assertion) for the target end-user. 
   subject_token_type: Either <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token</code> or <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2</code> as defined by RFC 8693. 
 

<p>This request will also include the client credentials that Agent0 would use in a traditional OAuth token request, which could be a client secret or a JWT Bearer Assertion.</p>

   <code>POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: acme.okta.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
&amp;requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag
&amp;resource=https://mcp.todo0.com/
&amp;subject_token=eyJraWQiOiJzMTZ0cVNtODhwREo4VGZCXzdrSEtQ...
&amp;subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token
&amp;client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
&amp;client_assertion=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjIyIn0...
</code>   

 ID assertion validation and policy evaluation 
<p>At this point, the IdP evaluates the request and decides whether to issue the requested “ID Assertion JWT.” The request will be evaluated based on the validity of the arguments and the customer’s configured policy.</p>

<p>For example, the IdP validates that the ID token in this request was issued to the same client that matches the provided client authentication. It evaluates that the user still exists and is active, and that the user is assigned the Resource Application. Other policies can be evaluated at the discretion of the IdP, just as it can during a single sign-on flow.
If the IdP agrees that the requesting app should be authorized to access the given user’s data in the resource app’s MCP server, it will respond with a Token Exchange response to issue the token:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

{
  "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag",
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...",
  "token_type": "N_A",
  "expires_in": 300
}
</code>   

<p>The claims in the issued JWT are defined in the “Identity Assertion Authorization Grant.” The JWT is signed using the same key that the IdP uses to sign ID tokens. This is a critical aspect that makes this work, since again, we assumed that both apps would already be configured for SSO to the IdP and would already be aware of the signing key for that purpose.</p>

<p>At this point, Agent0 is ready to request a token for the Resource App’s MCP server.</p>

 Access token request 
<p>The JWT received in the previous request can now be used as a “JWT Authorization Grant” as described by RFC 7523. To do this, Agent0 makes a request to the MCP authorization server’s</p>
 
   token endpoint with the following parameters: 
   grant_type: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
assertion: The Identity Assertion Authorization Grant JWT obtained in the previous token exchange step 
 

<p>For example:</p>

   <code>POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: auth.todo0.com
Authorization: Basic yZS1yYW5kb20tc2VjcmV0v3JOkF0XG5Qx2

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
assertion=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...
</code>   

<p>Todo0’s authorization server can now evaluate this request to determine whether to issue an access token. The authorization server can validate the JWT by checking the issuer (iss) in the JWT to determine which enterprise IdP the token is from and then checking the signature using the public key discovered at that server. Other claims must also be validated, as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-parecki-oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant-03.html#section-6.1">Section 6.1</a> of the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant.
Assuming all the validations pass, Todo0 is ready to issue an access token to Agent0 in the token response:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "access_token": "2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
  "expires_in": 86400
}
</code>   

<p>This token response is the same format that Todo0’s authorization server would respond to a traditional OAuth flow. That’s another key aspect of this design that makes it scalable. We don’t need the resource app to use any particular access token format, since only that server is responsible for validating those tokens.
Now that Agent0 has the access token, it can request the (hypothetical) Todo0 MCP server using the bearer token the same way it would have received the token using the traditional redirect-based OAuth flow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Note: Eventually, we’ll need to define the specific behavior of when to return a refresh token in this token response. The goal is to ensure the client goes through the IdP often enough for the IdP to enforce its access policies. A refresh token could potentially undermine that if the refresh token lifetime is too long. It follows that ultimately, the IdP should enforce the refresh token lifetime, so we will need to define a way for the IdP to communicate to the authorization server whether and how long to issue refresh tokens. This would enable the authorization server to make its own decision on access token lifetime, while still respecting the enterprise IdP policy.</p>
</blockquote>

 Cross-App Access sequence diagram 
<p>Here’s the flow again, this time as a sequence diagram.</p>

<p></p>

 
   The client initiates a login request 
   The user’s browser is redirected to the IdP 
   The user logs in at the IdP 
   The IdP returns an OAuth authorization code to the user’s browser 
   The user’s browser delivers the authorization code to the client 
   The client exchanges the authorization code for an ID token at the IdP 
   The IdP returns an ID token to the client 
   At this point, the user is logged in to the MCP client. Everything up until this point has been a standard OpenID Connect flow. 
   The client makes a direct Token Exchange request to the IdP to exchange the ID token for a cross-domain “ID Assertion JWT” 
   The IdP validates the request and checks the internal policy 
   The IdP returns the ID-JAG to the client 
   The client makes a token request using the ID-JAG to the MCP authorization server 
   The authorization server validates the token using the signing key it also uses for its OpenID Connect flow with the IdP 
   The authorization server returns an access token 
   The client makes a request with the access token to the MCP server 
   The MCP server returns the response

<p>YouTube collects data like search history, watch history, and interactions to personalize recommendations and ads, but this can compromise privacy by profiling user behavior. Regularly clearing history via YouTube’s settings or enabling auto-delete enhances privacy and minimizes data misuse risks, especially on shared devices.</p>



 Why You Should Clear Your YouTube Search History 



 How YouTube Uses Search History 



<p>YouTube leverages your search history to personalize ads and video recommendations, tailoring content to your interests based on what you’ve searched and watched. This data helps the platform deliver relevant suggestions but also feeds into algorithms that create detailed user profiles for targeted advertising. While this can enhance your viewing experience, it raises concerns about how much personal information is being tracked and stored. Learning how to clear all YouTube search history allows you to reset this personalization, limiting the platform’s ability to <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-delete-the-history-from-youtube/">use your past searches to influence ads</a> and recommendations, giving you greater control over your data.</p>









 Privacy Risks of YouTube Search History 



<p>The privacy risks associated with YouTube search history are significant, as this data can be shared with advertisers to deliver targeted ads or exposed on shared devices, compromising your personal information. Advertisers may use your search patterns to build detailed profiles, potentially leading to intrusive marketing or, in worst cases, data breaches if security is lax. On shared or public devices, others could access your search history, revealing sensitive interests or activities. By understanding how to clear all YouTube search history, you can mitigate these risks, preventing unwanted data sharing and ensuring your browsing habits remain private, especially in shared environments.</p>



 Benefits of Clearing YouTube Search History 



<p>Clearing your YouTube search history offers multiple benefits, including enhanced privacy, reduced targeted ads, and a cleaner user experience. <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-delete-youtube-search-history/">By removing your search data</a>, you limit YouTube’s ability to profile your behavior, resulting in fewer personalized ads that may feel intrusive.

<p>Using tools like VPNs (e.g., Proton VPN) or secure DNS services (e.g., Cloudflare 1.1.1.1) alongside how to clear all YouTube search history provides enhanced privacy by masking your online activity. A VPN encrypts your internet connection and hides your IP address, preventing YouTube or third parties from tracking your location or browsing habits. Download Proton VPN, sign up (free or paid plans available), and connect to a secure server before accessing YouTube. Similarly, switching to Cloudflare’s 1.1.1.1 DNS, configured in your device’s network settings, improves speed and blocks malicious sites. These tools reduce data collection beyond what YouTube’s history tracks, ensuring a more private browsing experience when combined with regular search history clearing.</p>



 Regularly Review Connected Apps and Revoke Access 



<p>Regularly reviewing and revoking access to connected apps that link to your Google account is a vital privacy measure, complementing how to clear all YouTube search history. Third-party apps or services connected to your Google account may access your YouTube data, including search and watch history, even after clearing it. To manage this, visit myaccount.google.com, sign in, and go to “Security” -&gt; “Third-party apps with account access.” Review the list of apps, checking their permissions, and click “Remove Access” for any unused or suspicious services. Performing this check monthly ensures that only trusted apps can access your YouTube data. By revoking unnecessary access and clearing your search history, you maintain tighter control over your personal information and reduce potential privacy risks.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Mastering how to clear all YouTube search history is a critical step in safeguarding your online privacy and controlling your digital footprint. By regularly clearing search and watch history, pausing data tracking, and managing ad personalization through Google’s settings, you can minimize targeted ads and protect sensitive information, especially on shared devices. These measures not only enhance your privacy but also create a cleaner, more personalized YouTube experience, allowing you to browse with confidence and peace of mind.</p>

<p>As the transition period for PCI DSS 4.0 draws to a close on March 31, 2025, PCI DSS 4.0.1 stands as the current version of the standard. More importantly, the March 31, 2025 deadline for full compliance with all new and customized PCI DSS 4.0 requirements is live.&nbsp;</p> 
 What's New in PCI DSS 4.0.1?  
<p>PCI DSS 4.0.1 represents a limited but important revision to version 4.0. While it doesn't introduce new requirements, it provides crucial clarifications that impact how organizations implement security controls, particularly around multi-factor authentication and payment page security.&nbsp;</p>  
 Key Clarifications in 4.0.1:  
<p>Phishing-Resistant Authentication Emphasis: 4.0.1 strengthens language around phishing-resistant authentication factors, providing clearer guidance on when they can substitute for traditional MFA requirements.</p> 
<p>Enhanced iframe Responsibility Framework: The update clarifies that merchants are responsible for scripts running only on their own payment pages, and provides guidance on how to manage the security of payment page scripts when third-party elements are involved. This distinction is critical for organizations maintaining the security of their payment processing infrastructure, particularly concerning Requirement 6.4.3.</p> 
<p>Refined Payment Page Script Management: Requirement 6.4.3 receives important refinements around how organizations monitor and secure payment page scripts, emphasizing supply chain security and the integrity of these scripts.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Universal MFA Mandate: What Changes on March 31, 2025  
<p>The universal MFA requirement under Requirement 8.4.2, introduced in PCI DSS 4.0, represents the most significant change coming into full effect with the March 31, 2025 deadline.</p> 
 From Administrative to Universal Access Control  
<p>Previous Requirement (PCI DSS 3.2.1): MFA was required only for administrators accessing the cardholder data environment (CDE).</p> 
<p>New Requirement (PCI DSS 4.0.1): MFA must be implemented for ALL access to the CDE, regardless of user role or access level</p> 
<p>This expansion affects:</p> 
  
  Cloud-based applications and services  
  On-premises systems and applications  
  Network security devices  
  Workstations and endpoints  
  Servers and databases  
  Administrative consoles  
  
 The Scope Challenge  
<p>Organizations are discovering that their CDE scope is broader than initially anticipated. The universal MFA requirement applies to:</p> 
  
  Direct CDE Access: Any system that stores, processes, or transmits cardholder data  
  System Components: All components that support CDE operations  
  Network Infrastructure: Devices that route or control CDE traffic  
  Management Systems: Platforms used to administer CDE components  
  
 Practical Exceptions  
<p>Practical Considerations: PCI DSS 4.0.1 includes specific guidance regarding Requirement 8.4.2, acknowledging that MFA may not be feasible or necessary for every single transaction when cardholder data is accessed as part of a real-time process for a single transaction. Organizations must carefully review the nuances of this requirement to determine applicability, as the broader universal MFA mandate still applies to all CDE access.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Phishing-Resistant Authentication Advantage  
<p>A key clarification in PCI DSS 4.0.1 addresses phishing-resistant authentication. The standard now explicitly states that a phishing-resistant authentication factor can substitute for traditional MFA for non-administrative access in the CDE.</p> 
 What Makes Authentication "Phishing-Resistant"?  
<p>Phishing-resistant authentication methods are designed to prevent credential theft even when users interact with malicious websites or applications. Key characteristics include:</p> 
  
  Cryptographic binding: Authentication is cryptographically bound to the specific service  
  No shared secrets: No passwords, SMS codes, or other interceptable credentials  
  Origin verification: The authentication method verifies it's communicating with the legitimate service  
  
 FIDO2 and Passkeys: The Gold Standard  
<p>PCI DSS 4.0.1's guidance continues to reference FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) standards, particularly FIDO2 and passkeys, as preferred authentication methods. These technologies offer:</p> 
  
  Hardware-backed security: Credentials stored in secure hardware elements  
  Built-in phishing resistance: Automatic verification of service authenticity  
  Simplified user experience: Often requiring just a biometric gesture or device interaction  
  
 The Hidden Costs of Traditional MFA at Scale  
<p>While organizations rush to implement universal MFA, many are discovering the hidden costs of scaling traditional authentication methods:</p> 
 Operational Overhead  
  
  Help Desk Burden: Forrester research indicates help desk calls average $42.50 per incident  
  Token Management: Physical tokens require distribution, replacement, and lifecycle management  
  User Productivity: Complex authentication processes can reduce worker efficiency by 10-15%  
  
 Security Gaps&nbsp;  
  
  SMS Vulnerabilities: Text-based codes remain susceptible to SIM swapping and interception  
  App-Based Weaknesses: TOTP applications can be compromised through malware or social engineering  
  Bypass Risks: Complex MFA systems often include bypass mechanisms that create security holes  
  
 Passwordless Authentication: The Strategic Advantage  
<p>Organizations implementing passwordless authentication solutions are finding significant advantages in meeting PCI DSS 4.0.1 requirements:</p> 
 Simplified Compliance  
  
  Single-Factor Phishing Resistance: Passwordless methods can meet MFA requirements with a single, strong authentication factor  
  Unified Access Control: One solution for all CDE access points  
  Reduced Complexity: Fewer authentication systems to manage and audit  
  
 Enhanced Security  
  
  Elimination of Shared Secrets: No passwords to steal, guess, or intercept  
  Hardware-Backed Protection: Credentials stored in secure hardware elements  
  Automatic Phishing Protection: Built-in verification of service authenticity  
  
 Improved User Experience  
  
  Streamlined Authentication: Often requiring just a biometric gesture  
  Reduced Friction: No passwords to remember or tokens to carry  
  Consistent Experience: Same authentication method across all systems  
  
 Beyond Compliance: Building Long-Term Security  
<p>While meeting the March 31, 2025 deadline is critical, organizations should view PCI DSS 4.0.1 compliance as part of a broader security modernization effort.</p> 
 Zero Trust Alignment  
<p>PCI DSS 4.0.1's authentication requirements align closely with Zero Trust architecture principles:</p> 
  
  Never Trust, Always Verify: MFA for all access, regardless of location or user role  
  Least Privilege Access: Strong authentication supports granular access controls  
  Continuous Verification: Dynamic risk assessment and adaptive authentication  
  
 Future-Proofing Authentication  
<p>The evolution from PCI DSS 4.0 to 4.0.1 demonstrates the ongoing refinement of security standards. Organizations investing in modern, phishing-resistant authentication are better positioned for future requirements.</p> 
 The Universal MFA Requirements  
<p>With PCI DSS 4.0.1 representing the current version of the standard, the universal MFA requirement represents the most significant authentication change in PCI DSS history, affecting every user who accesses cardholder data environments.</p> 
<p>Success requires more than just deploying MFA technology—it demands a strategic approach that considers user experience, operational efficiency, and long-term security objectives. Organizations that embrace modern, phishing-resistant authentication methods will not only achieve compliance but also establish a stronger security foundation for the future.</p> 
<p>The question now isn't whether your organization will implement universal MFA—it's whether you'll do it in a way that enhances or hinders your business operations while meeting the evolving demands of payment card security.</p> 
 PCI DSS 4.0.1 MFA FAQ  
<p>Q: What happens if we don't meet the March 31, 2025 deadline? A: Non-compliance can result in fines ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per month, loss of payment processing privileges, and potential legal liability. More importantly, it leaves your organization vulnerable to data breaches and associated costs.</p> 
<p>Q: Can we still use our existing MFA solution? A: Existing solutions may work if they can be extended to all CDE access points and meet the security requirements in PCI DSS 4.0.1. However, many legacy MFA systems lack the scalability and security features needed for universal deployment.</p> 
<p>Q: What's the difference between phishing-resistant authentication and traditional MFA? A: Phishing-resistant authentication is cryptographically bound to specific services and cannot be intercepted or replayed, even if users interact with malicious sites. Traditional MFA methods like SMS or TOTP apps can be compromised through various attack techniques.</p> 
<p>Q: How does PCI DSS 4.0.1 affect our cloud-based payment processing? A: The universal MFA requirement applies to all system components, including cloud-based applications and services. The 4.0.1 clarifications around iframe responsibilities help define specific obligations for different aspects of cloud-based payment processing.</p> 
<p>Q: Is passwordless authentication required for PCI DSS 4.0.1 compliance? A: While not explicitly required, passwordless authentication using phishing-resistant methods can simplify compliance and provide stronger security than traditional MFA approaches. The standard's emphasis on FIDO-based authentication suggests a clear preference for these modern methods.</p>

<p>In today’s competitive job market, a university degree is no longer the only indicator of a graduate’s readiness for the workforce. Employers are looking for candidates who can demonstrate specific skills and achievements that go beyond a traditional transcript. This shift has led to a growing focus on graduate employability and how institutions can better prepare students to succeed after graduation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, transcripts and diplomas don’t always tell the full story. That’s where verifiable credentials come in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These credentials give students a modern way to highlight their real-world skills and learning achievements. By providing a way for students to showcase their skills to potential employers, universities dramatically improve graduate employability outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



 What Is graduate employability?&nbsp; 



<p>Graduate employability refers to the skills, knowledge, and personal attributes that make graduates more likely to be employed and succeed in their chosen careers. Universities are under growing pressure to not only deliver academic content but also equip students with practical, real-world capabilities. Also, employers want greater insight into what a graduate can actually do, not just what degree they hold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is an example for the persistent gap between academic qualifications and labor market alignment:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2021, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/04/12/10-facts-about-todays-college-graduates/">found that</a> 41% of recent college graduates (ages 22 to 27) were underemployed, meaning they were working in jobs that don’t require a college degree. That’s notably higher than the 34% underemployment rate for all college graduates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The role of verifiable credentials&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials are digital representations of learning achievements that can be easily shared, displayed, and authenticated. Unlike a traditional diploma or certificate, a verifiable credential contains detailed metadata about what was learned, how it was assessed, who issued it, and when.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These verifiable credentials are built using open standards, such as the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/open-badges-3-explained/">Open Badges 3.0</a> specification and the W3C Verifiable Credentials framework. That means they are cryptographically secure, tamper-resistant, and can be verified instantly without the need to contact the issuing institution.&nbsp;</p>



 How verifiable credentials enhance graduate employability 



<p>Here are a few ways credentials can directly support graduate employability:&nbsp;</p>



 Make skills visible&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials allow universities to highlight specific skills and competencies that may not appear on a transcript. From soft skills like communication and leadership to technical proficiencies like data analysis or project management, credentials give employers a clearer picture of a graduate’s capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



 Support lifelong learning&nbsp; 



<p>Employers value candidates who show a commitment to ongoing professional development. Verifiable credentials can be earned for <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/microcredentials-in-higher-education-benefits-examples-and-how-to-get-started/">microcredentials</a>, workshops, internships, and extracurricular achievements to help graduates build a lifelong portfolio of verified learning experiences.&nbsp;</p>



 Improve trust and transparency&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials are secure and can’t be faked. Employers can instantly validate the issuer, criteria, and evidence behind a credential. This builds trust in the credential and in the graduate presenting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Enable more equitable hiring&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials help level the playing field by focusing on competencies rather than pedigree. A student from a smaller or lesser-known institution can stand out based on what they’ve actually learned and achieved, not just the name on their degree.&nbsp;</p>



 Increase student motivation and engagement 



<p>Students are more likely to engage in skill-building activities when they know their efforts will be recognized in a way that’s useful after graduation. Digital credentials offer immediate, meaningful recognition that students can carry with them into the job market.&nbsp;</p>



 Implementing verifiable credentials at your institution&nbsp; 



<p>To effectively use verifiable credentials to boost graduate employability, universities should:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Align credentials offerings with in-demand job skills and industry frameworks.&nbsp;<br> 



 Allow students to collect and manage their credentials in secure digital wallets.&nbsp;<br> 



 Promote employer awareness and acceptance of digital credentials.&nbsp;<br> 



 Embed credentials pathways into existing academic and co-curricular programs.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>At Anonyome Labs, our technology helps universities issue secure, tamper-proof credentials that students can easily share with employers without sacrificing data privacy or requiring ongoing verification support from your institution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you’re launching a digital credentials program for the first time or upgrading your current system, Anonyome Labs can help you align with the latest standards and best practices for graduate employability.&nbsp;</p>

  As KYB regulations tighten in 2025, community banks must rethink how they verify and monitor small business clients. This guide explores practical ways to meet compliance expectations without adding headcount.

<p>U.S. community banks are under pressure to improve KYB (Know Your Business) compliance for small business accounts, especially in light of evolving FinCEN and OCC guidelines. This article explores how KYB modernization using iComply can help banks uncover risk, automate beneficial ownership discovery, and streamline business account onboarding—without increasing compliance headcou</p>
<p>Community banks are the backbone of American Main Street. They finance local businesses, support job creation, and deliver personalized service in ways that larger institutions often can’t. But in 2025, these same banks face increasing pressure from regulators to modernize their approach to KYB—Know Your Business—especially when onboarding and monitoring small and medium-sized business (SMB) accounts.</p>
<p>The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA), and updated FinCEN guidance are reshaping expectations around business verification, beneficial ownership identification, and AML due diligence. For community banks, this means a new era of regulatory scrutiny—with limited resources to meet it.</p>
 The Compliance Challenge 
<p>Unlike large banks with dedicated compliance divisions and automation budgets, most community banks operate with tight teams and resource constraints. Yet the burden of compliance is growing:</p>
 
 FinCEN’s Beneficial Ownership Information (BOI) Rule now requires detailed UBO disclosures from most business clients 
 OCC guidelines emphasize continuous monitoring and risk-based segmentation of commercial clients 
 SMB clients often have opaque structures—LLCs, trusts, layered ownership—that require more intensive due diligence 
 
<p>Without the right tools, community banks may face:</p>
 
 Slowed onboarding and increased abandonment 
 Gaps in beneficial ownership data 
 Difficulty proving compliance during audits 
 Higher costs and staff burnout 
 
 Where Traditional KYB Falls Short 
<p>Manual Processes: Many banks still rely on PDFs, in-branch document scans, or email back-and-forths to collect business documents and ownership information. This is time-consuming and error-prone.</p>
<p>Fragmented Vendor Stacks: It’s common to see a mishmash of ID verification tools, AML screeners, and reporting systems that don’t talk to each other.</p>
<p>Reactive Risk Management: Without automated triggers, compliance teams may only discover red flags during periodic reviews or when alerted by third parties.</p>
 How iComply Modernizes KYB 
<p>iComply’s modular platform enables community banks to take a smarter, proactive approach to KYB with tools designed for the complexity of modern SMB verification.</p>
 1. UBO Discovery &amp; Corporate Structure Mapping 
<p>Automated workflows parse corporate filings, shareholder data, and registry sources to:</p>
 
 Identify direct and indirect beneficial owners 
 Connect ownership chains and nominee relationships 
 Flag high-risk jurisdictions and complex structures 
 
 2. Smart Document Collection 
<p>Customizable white-label portals guide businesses through document uploads (e.g., Articles of Incorporation, licenses, shareholder agreements) using a risk-based logic tree.</p>
 3. Ongoing Risk Monitoring 
<p>Integrate AML watchlists, PEP screening, and adverse media scanning into the KYB lifecycle. Set triggers based on changes in ownership, risk score, or business activity.</p>
 4. Edge Computing for Privacy Compliance 
<p>Sensitive data—like passports or ID documents of directors—is processed locally on the user’s device before encryption and transfer, supporting data sovereignty and reducing breach risk.</p>
 5. Ready-to-Audit Records 
<p>Every onboarding and refresh event is logged with full audit trails, timestamps, and linked source documents—streamlining exam prep and reducing regulatory friction.</p>
 Case Study: Midwestern Community Bank 
<p>A regional bank serving agricultural and construction businesses implemented iComply’s KYB module to address onboarding delays and incomplete BO data. The result:</p>
 
 Reduced average onboarding time from 5 days to less than 24 hours 
 Increased accuracy of UBO records by 60% 
 Passed a FinCEN audit with zero deficiencies 
 
 Regulatory Outlook for 2025 
 
 CTA Enforcement: As FinCEN begins enforcing penalties for BOI non-compliance, banks will need stronger controls to validate and monitor client-provided data. 
 OCC AML Exam Priorities: Community banks should expect increased examiner focus on KYB workflows, documentation, and UBO verification methods. 
 Technology Standards: There’s growing regulatory support for adopting centralized platforms that reduce fragmentation in compliance operations. 
 
 Recommendations 
<p>Community banks should:</p>
 
 Review and update KYB policies to reflect CTA and FinCEN rule changes 
 Replace manual and fragmented vendor processes with centralized, automated workflows 
 Prioritize edge-secure solutions that support privacy, security, and audit readiness

				 <p>By: Helen Garneau</p>
<p>In March 2025, online brokerage firms in Japan were hit by a <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/04/17/japan/crime-legal/hacking-brokerage-accounts/">massive wave of account takeovers</a>. Criminal groups used phishing sites to steal login credentials from investors, then logged in and executed trades—sometimes worth millions of yen—without the account holders’ knowledge. More than 100 stocks are believed to have been manipulated in the process.</p>
<p>The attack followed a familiar pattern: attackers built fake websites mimicking legitimate brokerage login pages. Unsuspecting investors entered their credentials, which were then used to log in as if they were the real account holders. In one case, a man lost over ¥2 million (about $14,700 USD) in minutes; in another, an account was accessed from an unfamiliar region and drained of nearly ¥10 million (about $70,000) in assets.</p>
 No compensation 
<p>Because these attacks used valid usernames and passwords, brokerages argued they weren’t at fault and denied compensation to the victims. From the system’s perspective, it looked like the real user had initiated all the trades.&nbsp;</p>
 No protection 
<p>Weak authentication that puts all the risk on the customer undermines trust in the entire trading ecosystem. And it’s an unsustainable security position when AI-tools and biometric identity fraud are added to the attacks on user accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are brokerages really going to take the position that a fake biometric was “real” as far as their system was concerned — and it’s the customer’s responsibility for their biometric data being faked or stolen?</p>
 A better and more powerful way to authenticate account holders 
<p>Step 1: Replace usernames and passwords for customer accounts with Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>A Verifiable Credential is a tamper-proof digital credential that a customer holds in a digital wallet on a mobile device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s verified by cryptography so authentication is seamless and doesn’t involve the process of inputting personal data that can be phished or stolen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The credential can’t be shared or stolen because of the way it is bound to the customer and their device.</p>
<p>Step 2: Add a verified biometric to the credential</p>
<p>This can be done when a customer is onboarded, or it can be derived from a government issued ID during and combined with a liveness check to ensure the image on the ID matches the real, live person.</p>
<p>Now you have a way to cross check a liveness check in real time, mitigating biometric identity fraud and the risk of generative AI deepfakes. The customer has a way of proving that they are really who they present as.</p>
 Mutual trust, built in 
<p>With this setup, the customer and the brokerage verify each other before any data is shared. Customers can be sure they’re dealing with the real brokerage. Brokerages can be sure they’re dealing with the real customer. And phishing attempts are detected and blocked before they begin.</p>
<p>Built for compliance and trust</p>
 
 Verifiable transactions: Your customer holds and controls their data from their device and you can cryptographically verify their identity and data without having to check it against information held in the cloud or by a third-party identity provider. 
 Simplified compliance: Since biometric data never leaves the user’s device and doesn’t need to be stored by the brokerage or a third party to be verified, brokerages aren’t burdened with the responsibility of storing or managing that sensitive information. This reduces liability and makes it easier to align with strict data protection regulations. 
 Consumer trust: When customers know that no trade can be executed without their personal, biometric consent, they feel secure. Brokerages can point to real safeguards—not just promises—when reassuring their customers that their investments are protected by the latest in identity security technology. 
 
 Indicio Proven makes all this simple 
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a> makes it easy to issue and verify these credentials, radically simplifying identity assurance and data sharing — and at significantly lower cost than conventional identity providers.</p>

  Thales and Skydweller join forces to develop an innovative aerial surveillance solution, combining Skydweller’s zero carbon footprint extreme endurance and Thales’ SMART RADAR based on Artificial Intelligence
prezly

Wed, 06/18/2025 - 11:10


             
 Skydweller and Thales are strengthening their collaboration by equipping <a href="https://www.skydweller.aero/">Skydweller’s</a> unmanned solar powered aircraft (MAPS) with a new solution consisting of the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr/searchmaster">AirMaster S</a> radar, equipped with Artificial Intelligence features allowing optimal and autonomous adaptation to the specific flight conditions.  
 This innovative solution combines a solar-powered extreme endurance aerial platform with next-generation surveillance intelligence, to set a new standard in autonomous, ultra-persistent maritime surveillance.  
 The Skydweller MAPS (medium-altitude pseudo-satellite), an autonomous aircraft with an unrivalled payload carrying capacity (up to 400kg unlike all other solar powered aircraft lacking real payload capability) is capable of flights from weeks to months, destroying the tyranny of distance with no carbon emissions. This capability allows for almost continuous maritime coverage, extending the scope of surveillance missions that require both persistence and operational performance. 
 
<p>Thales will equip the MAPS Skydweller with the AirMaster S radar system and its advanced SMART RADAR capabilities, whose intelligent functions have already been proven on board the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr/monde-defense-forces-aeriennes/mission-and-surveillance-systems/magazine/quarantaine-rugissante">ATL2</a> maritime patrol aircraft. Operating in X-band with AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array Antenna) technology, the AirMaster S radar offers significant operational advantages such as immediate and accurate assessment of land, air or sea situation. </p>
<p>The radar also features auto-tuning capabilities based on flight and mission conditions, perfectly suited to the Skydweller drone's persistence in flight. Its AI-based target classification feature can detect points of interest among a large volume of data and reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted to the ground. </p>
<p>Thanks to its ability to fly uninterrupted for weeks to months, the MAPS Skydweller solar powered unmanned aircraft allows a permanent presence in sensitive areas. It complements the resources already available (satellites, other types of drones, aircraft, etc.) and makes it possible to redirect resources according to the missions. </p>
<blockquote><p>"The combination of Thales' AirMaster S Smart radar with the MAPS Skydweller will make it possible to change the paradigm for surveillance missions, by offering a unique solution to current sovereignty challenges. We welcome this alliance and think it will be greater to security to NATO, the EU, and allies of western democracies,”&nbsp;Sébastien Renouard, Chief Commercial Officer for Europe Middle East &amp; Africa. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"We are delighted with this collaboration, which demonstrates the value of our Artificial Intelligence capabilities in the field of radars, which, combined with the innovative Skydweller MAPS, represent a real technological breakthrough for surveillance missions," Philippe Duhamel, Executive Vice President, Defense Mission Systems, Thales</p></blockquote>

  SpruceID is redefining LER verification with open standards and privacy-first credentials that put learners in control of sharing their achievements.

<p>When a learner earns a credential, whether it's a workforce certificate, micro-credential, or degree, they deserve to share it with the same trust, control, and clarity that we expect in any other critical verification process.</p><p>As Learning and Employment Records (LERs) gain traction across education, training, and workforce systems, we're facing a pivotal challenge: Why aren't these credentials built on the same principles of transparency, consent, and interoperability as other verified information in our digital lives? If LERs continue to rely on fragmented standards, formats, and verification practices, learners are left navigating a maze while employers and institutions struggle to interpret records consistently and securely.</p><p>To build trust in the LER ecosystem, we need credentialing infrastructure that meets users where they are: portable, verifiable, and understandable across contexts.</p> The Existing Model: Simple but Limited <p>In many implementations, the credential is uploaded to a central service after issuance. The learner shares a static URL or QR code, and anyone with access can view the full contents and verification status, no wallet or special tools are needed on the verifier's side. This ease of access is a clear benefit.</p><p>However, the model is generally more centralized than might be desired, which comes with some challenges. First is control of and access to data. The verification experience relies on the availability and integrity of a third-party service (or, commonly, services tied to the issuer) that holds the credential data. If the user is removed from that system, they lose the badge information stored in that system. This makes the holder dependent on the issuer to maintain the service and credential info for them. Next is reliability - if the badge-holding system goes offline or is compromised, the verification capabilities are also lost. Lastly, there is the question of privacy. If the verifier must visit a central service, particularly one managed by the issuer, then the issuer knows who is verifying what information about every badge. That is a powerful set of tracking data. </p><p>When the entire credential is shared and made broadly available for verification at a public or semi-public address, there's no opportunity for selective disclosure, either to choose not to share certain information or to give consent per verification request. Even when this type of badge sharing is revocable, these links generally are “all or nothing” and lead to overexposure.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to evolve these solutions as we move towards a more privacy-preserving, user-controlled world of digital data sharing.&nbsp;</p> A New Approach: Privacy-Preserving, Standards-Based Verification <p>At SpruceID, we’ve taken a new approach to building Learning and Employment Record (LER) credentials, one that gives learners more control and privacy. We use the <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Open Badges 3.0</a> standard, which defines a common way to describe learning achievements so they can be recognized across different platforms. Open Badges 3.0 specifies the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM) 2.0</a> for structuring these credentials, enabling cryptographic security, portability, and tamper resistance. This approach gives learners more control over how their credentials are shared and verified while aligning with emerging ecosystem standards.</p><p>For issuing and presenting credentials, we use <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OID4VC (OpenID for Verifiable Credentials)</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OID4VP (OpenID for Verifiable Presentations)</a>, which allow credentials to be securely shared in real-time, with the holder’s consent rather than stored on a central server. To support selective disclosure, we package the credential using <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SD-JWT VC</a>, a format that lets the holder reveal only specific pieces of information rather than the entire credential. </p><p>Altogether, this approach lets learners store credentials in their secure digital wallet and decide exactly what they share, when, and with whom, providing stronger privacy, less reliance on intermediaries, and better alignment with data protection laws.</p><p>In this model:</p>  Credentials live with the holder, not on a hosted server  Verification is interactive, happening in real time between the holder and verifier  Only necessary information is shared, thanks to selective disclosure and user consent flows  Standards like GDPR and FERPA are easier to support by design  <p>This approach preserves portability: learners can use their credentials across platforms and systems, even if the original issuer or platform disappears. It's also designed for longevity, supporting lifelong learning records that the holder truly owns and controls.</p> Why This Matters <p>We believe credential holders deserve the same control over their achievements that they are learning to expect from their identity data. That means user consent, data minimization, and resilience against vendor lock-in.</p><p>For issuers, this means credentials that are portable and can be used across systems and platforms.</p><p>For verifiers, it means a more secure, tamper-resistant way to confirm qualifications, with standards-based integrations that can plug into existing HR or admissions workflows.</p><p>For learners, this means credentials they truly own, not just access to a link but full control over how their accomplishments are shared and seen.</p> A Familiar Yet More Secure UX <p>Although this model introduces more real-time interactions, the user experience remains intuitive. For example, when an employer wants a job applicant to verify their appropriate credential, they can embed a QR code for the learner to scan with their credential wallet. This allows the learner to review the request, simply scan the QR code, and tap “approve” when prompted. As more systems begin to use open standards, any compliant wallet or verifier would be able to participate in building out or adopting these solutions. Broad compatibility is critical for long-term ecosystem success.</p><p>Verifiers will likely need to adapt their existing processes to a small extent. Instead of reviewing a credential on a webpage, a recruiter or admissions officer might need to share an OID4VP QR code and save the results from that request instead. Although this is a shift, it offers more security and reduces fraud, and simple integrations with verifier products will evolve over time.</p> Supporting Optionality <p>We also recognize that one size doesn't fit all. Some credentials are meant to be widely shared and carry less sensitive data. For some use cases, public links will always make sense. These scenarios can still support individuals by adding short-lived presentation tokens or creating one-time verification experiences that can be shared with a key or code.&nbsp;</p><p>Our goal is to offer institutions and holders flexibility to choose between high-trust, high-control models and simpler, open-sharing options depending on what’s appropriate for their business needs.</p> Building LER Credentials for the Future <p>As digital credentials become a foundational layer of how we recognize learning and achievement, it's time to evolve the way we verify them. Static links and centralized systems have their place, and have been a baseline and necessary first step, but there are exciting improvements to these expectations that we are beginning to see around privacy, control, and interoperability.&nbsp;</p><p>At SpruceID, we believe that by embracing open standards, centering learner privacy and consent in these processes, and empowering users with modern, secure digital credential wallets, we can create a verification experience that is simultaneously intuitive, resilient, and trustworthy.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

				  Indicio, through its partnership with SITA, will participate in the European Union’s APTITUDE Consortium to develop digital travel credentials for the EU Digital Identity Wallet. Indicio and SITA developed the world’s first Digital Passport Credential based on International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards for Digital Travel Credentials and successfully combined it with digital credentials following European Union digital identity specifications for seamless international travel.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>DUBLIN — June 17, 2025 — <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the global leader in Verifiable Credential technology and decentralized identity infrastructure, is excited to&nbsp; announce that it will participate in APTITUDE, the latest official&nbsp; European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI Wallet) Large Scale Pilot. APTITUDE will focus specifically on travel and payment within the European Digital Identity Framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through its partnership with SITA, Indicio will contribute to the development of government-issued digital travel credentials based on International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) specifications (DTC Type 2). These credentials will serve as digital passports, enabling preauthorized travel and seamless border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working with SITA and Aruba, Indicio previously developed and successfully implemented the world’s first Digital Passport Credential based on ICAO’s DTC Type 1 standard, which involved a passenger deriving a digital credential from their passport and authenticating the biometric image in the passport chip with a liveness check of the passenger.</p>
<p>“The ability to combine authenticated biometrics in a tamper-proof Verifiable Credential is the foundation of&nbsp; “government-grade” digital identity,”&nbsp; said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “It’s an inflection point where digital identity can be universally trusted. So it’s a really critical step for governments to be able to issue these kinds of credentials directly. As longtime champions of this technology, we are deeply grateful to be able to participate in this world-changing trial through our European partner, SITA. The APTITUDE trial has the potential to help everyone advance to secure, privacy-preserving digital identity and to make travel seamless.”</p>
 The world is becoming verifiable 
<p>With Gartner Research forecasting that “at least 500 million smartphone users will be regularly making verifiable claims using a digital identity wallet” by 2026, Europe’s implementation of digital wallets and Verifiable Credentials is accelerating global adoption.</p>
<p>The technology is sector spanning, with seamless, secure applications in aviation, hospitality, border security, education, banking and finance, and government services. With Indicio Proven, enterprises and governments have the widest range of credential formats and protocols, a digital wallet SDK, powerful governance software, and ledger and ledgerless support to rapidly implement interoperable Verifiable Credential solutions for seamless data sharing and identity verification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in 2018, our conversations revolved around how India’s UPI is picking up, and similarly why document verification is still so time consuming. We were discussing mainly usecases like VISA processing, Higher education across the border, and dreaded Government office visits in India, where every time you visit, there will be one more document missing between us and what we want to get. That is where we focused on solving for ‘trust’ in digital transactions, leading us to dive deep into something called Verifiable Credentials (VC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fast forward five years, and many usecases spanning from nation scale (ONDC, NPCI etc), and small apartment usecases (for the likes of certificates for cultural programs, sports events etc), we’ve gathered some insights we’d love to share.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Understanding Verifiable Credentials (VC) 



<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">VC is a w3c standard</a> for how to share information/credentials. At its core, VC aims to:</p>



 
 Confirm that the credential hasn’t changed since it was issued.<br> 



 Verify the issuer’s identity.<br> 



 Check if the credential is still valid (not expired).<br> 



 Determine if the credential has been revoked. 
 



<p>VCs are a powerful way to manage credentials, helping machines quickly verify digital documents and boosting trust. It also focuses on providing the user the much needed ownership of her/his data. But, alas widespread adoption hasn’t fully taken off yet. The reasons for it are many, and valid when you think from the lens of the adopters. Lets list some.</p>



 
 It is an ecosystem story: You need all 3 parties (Issuer, Holder, and Verifiers) to use it to make it meaningful 



 Interoperability: Even though standard is flexible and provides options to interoperability, majority of the solutions use custom proof section, and ZK (ZeroKnowledge) system, making the issuer data, not easily verifiable from the service providers. 



 Government is a major stakeholder: In many scenarios, and usecases, the ball stops at the government. Because the Government’s adoption is a key blocker to build ‘trust’ in solutions. 



 Changes to existing software products: For many private companies we spoke to, the economics of making changes to existing software stacks was not feasible, and VC standards needed that change to even get started. 



 Who pays?
 
 As it is an ecosystem play, the question in mind of for-profit companies is, who should pay? Why should I pay if I am issuing VC, because the service providers are benefiting from ‘Verifiable’ data. 



 For non-profits, it is not sustainable to keep funding the efforts repeatedly 



 For Govt and Executives, the ‘perk’ is not very clear. If people don’t come to offices, how do they ‘exercise’ their power? 



 Few of the visionaries wanted it, but bureaucracy is such that the very few startups in this space can never work with the government because of stricter tender norms. 
 
 
 



<p>But someone has to break this huge blocker, and here is how we approached the problem and designed the solution stack.</p>



<p><br></p>



 Data Tokenization by Dhiway 







<p><br>This is where data tokenization comes into play—think of it as adding a powerful new capability of verification without changing your existing data. Here’s what makes it valuable:</p>



 
 Integrity Checks: Easily verify if content remains unchanged by comparing hashes.<br> 



 Issuer Verification: Use digital signatures (private/public keys) to confirm who issued the document.<br> 



 Validity Checks: Include expiry directly within your data to manage validity effortlessly.<br> 



 Revocation Control: The issuer can dynamically manage document status through tokens.<br> 
 



<p>But that’s just the beginning. Data tokenization offers even more advantages than traditional VCs:</p>



 
 Easy Integration: Seamlessly connect with your current systems without additional changes.<br> 



 Universal Compatibility: Tokenize any document type, not just JSON-based VCs.<br> 



 Enhanced Trust: Transparent, decentralized logging ensures complete trustworthiness.<br> 



 Time-series Verification: See document changes over time, not just single-point verification.<br> 
 



<p></p>



 <br>Sounds Ideal, What’s the Catch? 



<p>The primary limitation is that unlike VCs, which may be verified offline, data tokenization requires internet connectivity to interact with network nodes for verification. Beyond this, data tokenization is remarkably versatile and simple to implement.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>More Benefits You Should Know About 



 
 Compliance Ready: Fully aligns with data privacy standards like DPDP and GDPR.<br> 



 Flexible Security: Easily rotate keys for added security.<br> 



 Empowerment: Delegate issuance powers, enabling broader participation.<br> 



 Enhanced VC (VC++): Even VC JSON data (without embedded proof) can be tokenized for convenient use, much like a digital wallet.<br> 



 Enhanced mDoc (mDoc++): Supports modern credential formats like mobile Driver Licenses (mDL).<br> 



 Simplified Storage: Store tokenized data flexibly across various platforms like Google Drive, WhatsApp, local folders, or FTP servers, eliminating the need for dedicated wallets. 
 



<p><br>One may ask, “ ‘Tokenization’ is the word which is loosely used with web3 and blockchain technologies, isn’t it for ‘Transaction’ only?”. We always say, tokenization is a key word that came to highlight, because more people are using it. It is already being done. The STOCK MARKET works on tokenized shares today. The Bankers Cheque (Demand Draft/DD) is another such example. We are talking about ‘Data’ here, which is surely a superset of every thing we talk about Tokenization.</p>



<p>Does Tokenization solve all the things mentioned above?</p>



 
 Common Standard. Simple API to access.&nbsp; 



 NO (major) CHANGES to existing software products, they continue to generate documents as is, with a new API added to it.&nbsp; 



 The government can integrate without concern of sovereignty concerns. 



 Who pays? : This will be explained in a separate blog, many interesting pointers here, and we believe you will come back to read about it  



 It is an ecosystem story: Decentralized networks are designed for ecosystems. With CORD’s OnChain Governance, an option to run an enterprise network, the ecosystem should be able to benefit out. 
 



<p></p>



 <br>All good? Let’s see how Dhiway can help. 



<p>What does Dhiway do? Simply put, we’re amplifying trust to find and fulfill opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, our vision is, there would never be ‘one chain to rule them all’, hence providing the document / data creators an option to choose what they need. Public, private, consortium led tokenization network/stack is the right way to make people consume these features faster. Keep customer’s needs, their regulations, and their compliance requirements in mind when we propose a solution.</p>



<p>With that, Dhiway’s CORD based platform allows people to get started quickly on this, and start your journey with ‘Verifiability’.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking a bit about the whole Model Context Protocol (MCP) thing.“</p>



<p>According to its documentation, MCP is ‘an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.’ Given the growing dependence on large language models (LLMs), this is a big deal (remembering that <a href="https://toloka.ai/blog/difference-between-ai-ml-llm-and-generative-ai/">all LLMs are a type of AI, but not all AIs depend on LLMs</a>). If we’re moving toward a world where AIs are expected to do All The Things, interfacing with our applications and services, then having a universal adapter that lets AIs talk to everything is undeniably powerful.</p>



<p>But, me being me, as soon as I saw someone describe MCP as an “open standard,” I immediately had questions.</p>

<p>I’m not a developer; I can’t speak to MCP’s utility from a coding perspective. I’m not an architect, either; I can’t tell you where this fits best in your environment. But I am a standards person. So if you tell me something is an open standard, I’m going to want to know: who is standardizing it? What process are they following? Who’s doing the review? What are the intellectual property considerations?</p>



 What a standards organization does 



<p>Let’s back up for a moment. What does a standards development organization (SDO) actually do?</p>



<p>If you’ve never looked into it, you might joke that SDOs exist to slow things down under the weight of process. OK, fair. But let me ask: why is that always a bad thing?</p>



<p>That process guarantees broader review across multiple dimensions. For example, the <a href="https://ietf.org">IETF</a> requires a security considerations section in every draft submitted for publication. They also mandate cross-area review, requiring input from the different <a href="https://www.ietf.org/technologies/areas/">areas</a>: Internet, Web and Internet Transport, Applications and Real Time, Routing, and Security.</p>



<p>Over at the <a href="https://w3.org">W3C</a>, every spec is <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#doc-reviews">subject to</a> privacy, internationalization, accessibility, and architectural review, often more than once during its lifecycle. And all the formal SDOs I’ve worked with have some kind of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) policy, which goes beyond an open-source license to include licensing terms for essential patent claims.</p>



 You have to start somewhere 



<p>To be clear, most SDOs didn’t emerge fully formed. They started with a handful of people who weren’t satisfied with the existing processes or the politics. That’s how the <a href="https://whatwg.org">WHATWG</a> began, opting for a living-document model and less procedural overhead than the W3C. (Though in my opinion, they eventually ended up with just as much process, just differently shaped.)</p>



<p>So maybe MCP is on its way to becoming its own kind of SDO, at least for this protocol. That’s fine. You have to start somewhere. But if that’s what’s happening, I don’t know where those conversations are taking place. Is there a governance plan? An IPR framework? A mailing list that isn’t just announcements?</p>



 So, back to MCP 



<p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>, the company behind Claude, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">announced</a> MCP late last year to address a real problem they’ve faced as an AI vendor: how to standardize context exchange between apps and LLMs—doing so openly and transparently. That’s great. I genuinely appreciate the transparency, and I understand the desire to move fast in an area evolving as rapidly as AI. However, when people hear ‘open,’ they often assume peer-reviewed, widely adopted, and safely maintained. But an open GitHub repo doesn’t guarantee any of that.</p>



<p>By publishing the spec openly and encouraging others to use it, they’re aiming for what’s often called a “<a href="https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded/article/21796209/whats-the-difference-between-de-jure-and-de-facto-standards">de facto standard</a>”, something widely adopted even in the absence of formal standardization. Go team!</p>



<p>But I’m still worried.</p>



<p>I like the structure of a formal review process. I also like being able to point to exactly who reviewed a spec for security, privacy, and accessibility, and knowing that those reviews weren’t optional. Knowing that if you implement something before those reviews are done, you’re doing so at your own risk is critical.</p>



<p>Will adding a process slow things down? Yes, but I don’t think that’s a bad thing. It’s better to go slower than to trip over a hazard that could’ve been avoided with just a bit more thoughtfulness.</p>



<p>Just look at what’s happened in other areas of tech when we skipped due diligence: poor API scoping, security vulnerabilities, and consent models that collapsed under legal scrutiny. A good standards process helps us catch those kinds of mistakes before they happen. I’ve been in those three-hour meetings. It’s not glamorous. But you know what happens in those meetings? Someone catches the thing no one saw coming.</p>



 What happens if MCP becomes the default, without structure? 



<p>Let’s talk about the future we might be sliding into without realizing it.</p>



<p>If MCP gets widely adopted without formal structure—no shared governance, no multi-stakeholder review, no clear IPR policy—we don’t get a win for open standards. We get a de facto protocol that locks in early design assumptions, possibly shaped by a single vendor’s priorities, and leaves little room for dissenting use cases or evolving needs.</p>



<p>That might sound fine in the short term. After all, it’s solving a real problem! But over time, we run into real consequences.</p>



<p>What if MCP bakes in patterns that work well for consumer apps but break down in healthcare or financial services, where regulatory audits and fine-grained access controls are non-negotiable? Or, what if it assumes context is something you pull from a user, rather than something the user pushes or consents to, reinforcing an architecture that sidesteps agency and privacy?</p>



<p>What if an entire ecosystem of tooling gets built around early versions of the spec, and then a major vulnerability or design flaw gets discovered, but there’s no defined process or authority to fix it in a way that maintains trust?</p>



<p>If MCP becomes the default before it’s ready, we risk not just technical debt but governance debt, which is harder to see but far more expensive to repay.</p>



 Call to action 



<p>None of this means MCP is flawed or untrustworthy. It’s solving a real problem, and it’s doing it more openly than many. But openness isn’t the same as structure. So here’s my CTA: does anyone want to help this protocol grow up a bit? </p>



<p>Maybe that means finding a home for MCP within an existing SDO or spinning up something new and bespoke. Either way, the structure needs to happen.</p>



<p>I don’t have any contacts in the project, so this is mostly a wish on my part. But if you have any ideas (and if you agree this is a concern), let’s chat!</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/">Spherical Cow Consulting</a>. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down key topics in the world of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser behavior and policy shifts.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have the time to follow every new specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



 



 What is MCP, and Why Is It a Big Deal? 



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it. I’ve been thinking about the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a trending topic in the tech world.</p>



<p>[00:00:38]<br>According to its documentation, MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs).</p>



<p>[00:00:48]<br>And with the rise of LLMs as a dominant type of AI, this protocol could prove essential.</p>



<p>[00:00:56]<br>If we’re truly heading into a world where AI can:</p>



 
 Summarize documents 



 Write and review code 



 Manage complex schedules 



 Coordinate across digital systems 
 



<p>…then having a universal adapter like MCP is a pretty compelling idea.</p>



<p>[00:01:14]<br>So I get the excitement—really, I do.</p>



 



 But What Does “Open Standard” Really Mean? 



<p>[00:01:16]<br>Me being me, the moment I saw MCP described as an “open standard,” I had questions.</p>



<p>[00:01:26]<br>Now, I’m not a developer or a systems architect. But I am a standards person. And when I hear open standard, I ask:</p>



 
 Who’s maintaining it? 



 What’s the review process? 



 Are there intellectual property rights (IPR) concerns? 



 Who decides how and when it changes? 
 



<p>[00:02:00]<br>Because open can mean very different things.</p>



<p>[00:02:06]<br>For example:</p>



 
 Open source: The code is public 



 Open access: No login needed to read documentation 



 Open to contribution: Community can propose changes 
 



<p>[00:02:20]<br>But a true open standard means much more. It implies:</p>



 
 Governance 



 Transparency 



 Neutrality 



 Stability 



 Shared ownership 
 



 



 Zooming Out: What Do SDOs Actually Do? 



<p>[00:02:44]<br>Before diving further into MCP, let’s look at Standards Development Organizations (SDOs).</p>



<p>[00:02:54]<br>If you’ve never worked within one, you might think SDOs are where good ideas go to die—buried under mountains of email and bureaucracy.</p>



<p>[00:03:03]<br>And yes, it can feel like that some days.</p>



<p>[00:03:08]<br>But that process exists for good reason.</p>



<p>[00:03:10]<br>Take the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), for example. Every draft must include:</p>



 
 A security considerations section 



 Review across multiple technical areas: transport, application, security, routing 



 Checks that prevent major issues at scale 
 



<p>[00:03:43]<br>Or consider the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). They require:</p>



 
 Privacy and accessibility reviews 



 Internationalization checks 



 Architectural coherence assessments 
 



<p>[00:03:57]<br>These aren’t easy. But they force critical thinking, which ultimately strengthens the standard.</p>



 



 Why Governance Matters 



<p>[00:04:27]<br>When a standard is finally published, developers, vendors, and even regulators rely on it. That trust only exists because of rigorous review and intellectual property safeguards.</p>



<p>[00:04:45]<br>Because with foundational tech, you really don’t want legal issues popping up years later.</p>



<p>[00:04:57]<br>All SDOs start small. For instance:</p>



 
 The WHATWG formed because W3C felt too slow 



 W3C itself branched from IETF for the same reason 
 



<p>[00:05:22]<br>Eventually, though, governance always returns—just with different flavors and speeds.</p>



<p>[00:05:31]<br>Lesson? You can’t escape governance. If your idea scales, governance will find you.</p>



 



 Where Does MCP Stand Today? 



<p>[00:05:55]<br>Let’s come back to MCP.</p>



<p>[00:06:09]<br>Anthropic—the creators of Claude AI—released MCP in late 2024 to address a real challenge: how to standardize context exchange for LLMs.</p>



<p>[00:06:25]<br>They’ve done a commendable job being transparent. The spec is published, and adoption is encouraged. That’s what we’d call a de facto standard—it gains traction because it simply works.</p>



<p>[00:06:48]<br>But there’s risk here. If MCP becomes the norm without governance or formal review:</p>



 
 We’re embedding one vendor’s assumptions 



 There’s no accountability or shared maintenance 



 Critical decisions become hard to challenge 
 



<p>[00:07:07]<br>For example:</p>



 
 It may work for consumer apps but fail in regulated industries 



 It might prioritize AI-driven “pull” models, ignoring consent-based “push” models 



 Future changes could break everything, with no obligation to maintain compatibility 
 



<p>[00:07:19]<br>In short:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What starts fast becomes fragile. What feels open becomes proprietary.</p>
</blockquote>



 



 We’ve Seen This Before 



<p>[00:07:33]<br>Consider:</p>



 
 OAuth2: Took years to retrofit its security model after early, chaotic adoption 



 HTML5: W3C and WHATWG had to reconcile major differences just to move forward 
 



<p>[00:07:43]<br>These were not technical failures—they were governance failures. And they’re costly to fix.</p>



<p>[00:08:19]<br>This is what I mean by governance debt. It’s invisible—until suddenly, it’s not.</p>



 



 A Call to Action: Help Build the Foundation 



<p>[00:08:29]<br>To be clear: MCP is not broken. It’s solving a real problem, and it’s already more open than many other AI protocols.</p>



<p>[00:08:35]<br>But openness ≠ structure. A GitHub repo ≠ a standards body.</p>



<p>[00:08:37]<br>So here’s my question:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who wants to help give MCP a real foundation?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>[00:08:45]<br>That might mean:</p>



 
 Finding a home for MCP within an existing standards body 



 Forming a lightweight, transparent working group 



 Agreeing on a proper review process (including privacy, security, and accessibility) 
 



<p>[00:08:58]<br>I don’t care about the venue—IETF, W3C, something new. I care that we do something.</p>



<p>[00:09:06]<br>Because if this protocol is going to power the AI systems that touch every corner of our lives, we can’t afford to be careless.</p>

 Presentation attacks and deepfakes pose more than just technological threats — they challenge the very foundation of trust that powers every online interaction. Thankfully, IDnow remains dedicated to offering the industry’s most dynamic defense system against AI-generated attacks. 



 



<p>Although face verification has become an affordable and efficient way to authenticate user identities, it remains a vulnerable part of the identity verification process and highly susceptible to fraud attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Businesses that wish to protect themselves – and their customers – from the increasingly tech-savvy fraudster must ensure they leverage the latest technologies, including liveness detection, to stay one step ahead. If they don’t, they run the risk of joining the growing list of European companies that lose <a href="https://www.compliancecorylated.com/news/uk-lost-33-2bn-to-frauds-and-scams-in-2024-the-highest-in-europe/">millions in attacks every year.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow continually enhances its face verification and liveness detection capabilities — not as isolated features, but as integral components of our comprehensive trust ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested in how IDnow has been working to mitigate skin tone bias in face verification systems? Read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/synthetic-face-identity-verification-bias/">blog, ‘A synthetic solution? Facing up to identity verification bias.’</a></p>



 What is liveness detection? 



<p>Liveness detection leverages biometric characteristics, such as facial features or fingerprints, to detect whether the presented subject is a living person. In the case of remote face verification, it ensures the captured digital image features a real face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liveness detection also flags so-called ‘unreal faces’, which fraudsters present during the selfie submission stage of face verification. In these presentation attacks, fraudsters present printed photos, videos on monitors, or even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07383">t-shirts</a> or <a href="https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/data/phymatt">personalized hygienic masks</a> in front of the recording device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liveness detection should also protect against new attack vectors, including those that use invisible noise and patterns to camouflage the attack. The attacker may also choose to exploit capture conditions, such as backlighting, to make detection more difficult.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While presentation attacks have been known to unlock mobile devices, they also pose significant risk during the face verification steps of identity verification and KYC processes. It is for this reason that businesses must ensure they have a robust identity verification process that includes liveness detection, presentation attack detection (PAD), injection detection, and deepfake detection.</p>



 How does presentation attack detection (PAD) work? 



<p>Thankfully, presentation attacks do leave clues that can be identified by liveness experts, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern">moiré patterns</a> (interference patterns that can be subtle and take many forms, such as color alteration, face deformation, or unnatural motion) that appear when recording a screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well-crafted attacks can be difficult to identify by the human eye, but thanks to the rise of deep learning-based AI, PAD is becoming more effective. Trained on massive volumes of data, those models can detect subtle clues and anomalies. Some can point out invisible patterns, while others can detect unusual textures in image patches. Researchers have also managed to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07419">detect infinitesimal face color variations</a> due to blood pulsation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>PAD has improved dramatically in both usage and accuracy over the years and remains an incredibly important area for online fraud prevention. To keep up to date with industry developments and reinforce our detection capabilities, IDnow regularly participates in initiatives like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/research-project-soteria-europe/">SOTERIA project</a> and research papers like the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10744500">‘A Novel and Responsible Dataset for Face Presentation Attack Detection on Mobile Devices,’</a> which was presented at the IJCB 2024 conference.</p>



 



Nathan Ramoly shows how easy it is to create a deepfake.



 Deepfakes and the double edge sword of AI. 



<p>While artificial intelligence has enabled new fraud detection capabilities, it has also proven a powerful tool for attacking KYC systems using deepfakes (AI-generated or heavily modified faces).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the not-too-distant past, the creation of deepfakes was only able to be done by experts, but now, thanks to easy-to-use multiple websites and apps, even those with little technological expertise can generate deepfakes in just a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are three main categories of deepfakes:&nbsp;</p>



  Generated faces: Using Generative AI, the attacker creates a face to resemble the target or creates a whole new fake identity. &nbsp;  



  Face reenactment: The attacker acquires a picture of a target’s face, typically from social media, and uses AI to animate the image; adding motion to a static picture to create a fake video from a single photo.&nbsp;  



  Face swap: Here, the attacker acquires a picture of the target’s face and performs a capture of themself. They then upload both images to a deepfake tool that will extract the biometric traits of the target and modify the attacker’s face in a new capture that resembles the target.&nbsp;  



<p>Once generated, fraudsters inject deepfakes into the KYC process through ‘virtual cameras,’ where images are presented as regular selfies. Sophisticated deepfakes mimic actual capture sessions, with natural motion, lighting and texture that does not deform the face. As such, deepfakes can bypass both face verification and PAD, which makes the business case for implementing robust liveness detection even more compelling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address the complexity of threats posed by deepfakes, we combine our proprietary AI-based detection technologies, including liveness detection, with solutions from our trusted partners. This hybrid approach enables us to offer a powerful and adaptive fraud prevention system that complies with European regulations, without compromising the user experience and appetite for smooth and secure onboarding experiences.</p>



 How IDnow’s liveness detection works. 



<p>Our liveness detection technology features three separate checks:&nbsp;</p>



  Presentation attack detection to flag when living faces are replaced by other media, such as pictures or masks.&nbsp;  



  Injection attack detection to prevent the injection of harmful code or commands into an application, database, or other system.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Deepfake detection to detect face alteration crafted by advanced AI.  



 Facing up to the future of liveness attacks. 



<p>As the ability to detect deepfakes improves, we can expect new types of attacks to emerge, especially adversarial attacks, which aim to exploit new-found weaknesses in AI models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By seamlessly integrating our proprietary AI-driven liveness detection with complementary technologies from our trusted partner network, we’ve created a dynamic defense system that anticipates and neutralizes emerging threats before they can compromise security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, our commitment extends beyond our current capabilities. We’ve positioned our platform to evolve continuously, ensuring that as deepfake technologies advance, our detection and prevention mechanisms remain at the forefront of innovation. In doing so, we enable businesses to build lasting customer relationships founded on unshakeable trust, regardless of how the threat landscape transforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this new era where digital identity verification faces unprecedented challenges, IDnow stands as the trusted European leader in identity verification technology, empowering businesses to turn potential vulnerabilities into competitive advantages through intelligent, adaptive and continuous trust management.</p>

 Who Really Owns This Company? 
<p>The more complex the structure, the easier it is to hide who’s in control. From nested entities and trusts to nominees and offshore links, beneficial ownership is where compliance gets messy. This article explains how to cut through that complexity, meet global regulatory standards, and build workflows that make your team faster, sharper, and more confident.</p>
 
 The Real Risk Behind the Org Chart 
<p>Modern corporate structures are designed to move fast, limit liability, and optimise tax exposure. But those same benefits make them ideal for obscuring ownership and enabling financial crime. As regulators around the world increase scrutiny of shell companies and hidden controllers, firms that rely on spreadsheets or static PDFs for corporate due diligence are falling behind.</p>
<p>The question is no longer whether you must uncover beneficial ownership. It’s whether you can do it in time to avoid regulatory exposure, lost business, or reputational damage.</p>
 
 What Makes Ownership Discovery Difficult 
 Layers and Loopholes 
<p>Multi-layered structures that span several jurisdictions are intentionally difficult to trace. Every additional holding company, foreign registration, or nominee creates another barrier between the customer you see and the individual actually in control.</p>
 Jurisdictional Differences 
<p>Not all countries define beneficial ownership the same way. A 25% threshold might apply in one region, but a different one somewhere else. Some registries are publicly accessible. Others are not. Some are updated in real time. Others take months. If your system isn’t built to handle these differences, your compliance is already compromised.</p>
 Control Without Ownership 
<p>Ownership isn’t the only thing that matters. The person signing on behalf of the company, exercising control through voting shares, or directing funds through another entity may not technically own anything on paper—but they still pose a risk. Real beneficial ownership discovery requires uncovering both ownership and control.</p>
<p>
</p> What Regulators Expect 
 
 
<p>AUSTRAC requires clear identification and verification of beneficial owners, with an emphasis on transparency for high-risk and international clients.</p>
 
 
<p>FCA mandates that firms understand who exercises control and why, and apply enhanced due diligence where ownership is unclear.</p>
 
 
<p>FINCEN under the Corporate Transparency Act obligates reporting of beneficial ownership data for nearly every U.S. registered company.</p>
 
 
<p>FINRA requires broker-dealers to collect and maintain beneficial ownership data for all legal entity customers.</p>
 
 
<p>EU AMLA enforces harmonised rules for beneficial ownership registers and sets higher standards for ownership verification and oversight.</p>
 
 
<p>In short, no matter where you operate, ownership is something you need to prove – and document your process of doing so.</p>
 
 Your Advantage: Do It Better Than Your Competitors 
 1. Use KYB as a Differentiator 
<p>If your clients feel interrogated every time they submit corporate documents, they’ll walk. If your sales team delays deals while waiting on compliance, they’ll get blocked. But when you can verify directors, shareholders, and UBOs in minutes with zero back-and-forth, you make onboarding frictionless. That builds trust. It shortens sales cycles. And it gives you a competitive edge.</p>
 2. Improve Client Confidence 
<p>Automated data collection and verification makes your team look sharp. Clients get a professional experience. You reduce repetitive requests and deliver faster decisions. That improves client confidence, reinforces brand trust, and reduces dropout.</p>
 3. Eliminate Manual Workflows 
<p>Stop chasing documents and cross-referencing multiple databases manually. Automate beneficial ownership mapping. Use real-time screening tools that flag suspicious individuals or connections. Pre-fill forms using public registries. Create an end-to-end audit trail that proves your process was complete, defensible, and regulator-ready.</p>
 
 iComply’s Answer to Ownership Complexity 
<p>iComply’s KYB engine was built for global coverage and high-stakes compliance. Our platform:</p>
 
 
<p>Maps beneficial ownership across jurisdictions using official registries and custom workflows</p>
 
 
<p>Automates control structure diagrams and shareholder breakdowns</p>

<p>Flags risk indicators across sanctions, PEP, fraud, and adverse media databases</p>
 
 
<p>Logs every decision, match, and review into an audit-ready report</p>
 
 
<p>You get visibility across any structure. Your team gets clarity and control. Your clients get onboarded faster.</p>
<p>Every time you ask, “Who owns this company?” you are really asking, “Can I trust this client?” The faster and more confidently you can answer that question, the safer your business becomes.</p>
<p>With iComply, beneficial ownership is no longer a blind spot. It’s your edge.</p>

 Why Centralized Systems Like Gov.UK’s One Login, India’s Aadhaar, and Singapore’s Singpass Raise Global Privacy Alarms 
<p>Centralized digital identity systems—such as the UK’s One Login, India’s Aadhaar, and Singapore’s Singpass—are facing mounting scrutiny over risks to user privacy, system security, and surveillance overreach. These platforms often rely on architectures that report back to central authorities every time an identity is used—a phenomenon now widely referred to as “ID phone home.” In contrast, privacy-first identity verification solutions like iComply enable secure, compliant onboarding while keeping individuals in control of their data.</p>
 Understanding the “ID Phone Home” Phenomenon 
<p>The term “ID phone home” describes a systemic flaw in many centralized identity verification solutions: every time you use your ID—whether to log in, verify age, or sign a contract—your interaction is logged and relayed back to a centralized server, often a government authority or state-approved vendor. Over time, these interactions form a persistent behavioural profile: where you were, what you accessed, when, and how often.</p>
<p>This model creates a digital paper trail of your identity across services, locations, and platforms—often without explicit consent or meaningful control. It shifts identity from something you own into something you borrow from a system that watches while you use it.</p>
 
 Global Case Studies: The Privacy Risks of Centralized Identity Systems 
 🇬🇧 United Kingdom: One Login’s Security Shortcomings 
<p>The UK government’s One Login platform was designed to streamline access to more than 50 public services with a single verified digital identity. But in May 2025, the platform lost its Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) certification after its biometric vendor, iProov, failed to meet compliance standards.</p>
<p>This lapse followed a series of security warnings:</p>
 
 
<p>A red teaming exercise revealed that privileged system access could be compromised without triggering monitoring alerts.</p>
 
 
<p>One Login meets just 21 of 39 outcomes in the National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) Cyber Assessment Framework.</p>
 
 
<p>As of today, One Login remains uncertified, raising questions about its reliability as the government’s “gold standard” for digital ID.</p>
 
 
<p>Privacy advocates are particularly concerned that One Login enables real-time tracking of users whenever their ID is used to access services, submit filings, or verify identity—making it an archetype of the “ID phone home” problem.</p>
 🇮🇳 India: Aadhaar’s Surveillance Legacy 
<p>Aadhaar, the world’s largest biometric ID system, was rolled out to bring universal digital identity access to more than a billion people. But over the past decade, Aadhaar has been plagued by controversy:</p>
 
 
<p>Data breaches have exposed the personal information of millions, with unauthorized access being sold online for pennies.</p>
 
 
<p>The Supreme Court of India ruled that linking Aadhaar to every service, from SIM cards to bank accounts, posed an unacceptable risk of state surveillance.</p>
 
 
<p>India’s digital privacy laws remain fragmented, with weak enforcement mechanisms for data misuse.</p>
 
 
<p>Aadhaar is often cited by digital rights groups as a case study in how centralized digital identity, when deployed at scale, can unintentionally lead to systemic risk.</p>
 🇸🇬 Singapore: Singpass and Consent Concerns 
<p>Singpass, Singapore’s national digital identity platform, is widely used to access both government and commercial services. Its integration with facial recognition and passive verification has raised serious concerns:</p>
 
 
<p>Leaked Singpass credentials have been found on the dark web, increasing fraud and impersonation risks.</p>
 
 
<p>Critics argue that consent mechanisms are insufficient, as users are forced to interact with a platform that tracks behaviour but lacks transparent opt-outs.</p>
 
 
<p>Privacy International and other watchdogs warn that Singpass enables “continuous, ambient surveillance” across multiple service channels.</p>
 
 
<p>The Singpass model underscores the trade-off between convenience and control—one that many users may not fully understand until their data is compromised</p>
 mDLs: Mobile Convenience, Structural Risk 
<p>The rise of mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) has been positioned as the next leap in digital identity verification. Apple’s big announcement last week will allow users to store and present official ID from their phones. However, most mDL implementations rely on proprietary apps that phone home to validate identity with issuing authorities or third-party servers. Given Apple’s historical posture on privacy, it will be worth watching how the navigate the security concerns surrounding mDLs.</p>
<p>This means:</p>
 
 
<p>Each time you prove your age, sign a rental agreement, or board a flight, your identity data may be pinged and stored centrally.</p>
 
 
<p>Even metadata—such as location, timestamp, or IP address—can be enough to build a user profile.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlike a physical ID, most mDLs offer no real-time visibility into how, where, or when your identity is being logged.</p>
 
 
<p>In practice, mDLs risk turning your phone into a live identity beacon – with few safeguards and little recourse.</p>
 Take Action: No Phone Home Petition 
<p>A rapidly growing global movement call “No Phone Home” has raised concerns over surveillance risks and single points of failure/control within each of the above solutions. The truth of the matter is that “Phone Home” identity systems are built to protect the interests of the legacy verification service providers. As a signatory on the No Phone Home Petition, we invite you to also sign the petition by clicking here: <a href="https://nophonehome.com/">https://nophonehome.com/&nbsp;</a></p>
 
 The Case for Decentralized, Privacy-First Identity Verification 
<p>Decentralizing the very act of ID verification and authentication avoids these pitfalls entirely. Instead of requiring cloud-based validation every time an ID is used, these systems process and encrypt sensitive data on the user’s device, using edge computing and zero-knowledge architecture.</p>
 Key Benefits of a Privacy-First Approach 
 
 
<p>User control: You decide who sees your data, for how long, and under what conditions.</p>
 
 
<p>No surveillance trail: No unnecessary data transmission to centralized servers.</p>
 
 
<p>Compliance without compromise: Fully meets emerging regulations such as the UK Companies House requirements for director identity verification, KYC, and KYB – without trading away privacy.</p>
 
 
<p>Audit-ready transparency: Every verification step is logged locally and reportable without exposing the user.</p>
 
 
 
 Why iComply Stands Apart 
<p>At iComply, we don’t believe trust should be demanded—it should be earned. Our identity verification solution is purpose-built to comply with the UK’s 2025 Companies House reforms, support global KYC/KYB workflows, and protect the one thing no regulation can replace: your identity.</p>
<p>We process:</p>
 
 
<p>Document authentication with template matching, OCR extraction, and full spectrum security feature review</p>
 
 
<p>Concurrent biometric face match (powered by secure, AI-powered, 3D video sessions)</p>
 
 
<p>Hybrid (active and passive) liveness detection</p>
 
 
<p>Capturing clear, informed, and revocable consent</p>
 
 
<p>All without phoning home or compromising your client’s trust, privacy, or security.</p>
 
 Own Your Identity, Don’t Lease It 
<p>The digital identity systems of 2025 are a fork in the road. One path leads to more centralized control, less transparency, and growing behavioural surveillance – and potential for severe government overreach.</p>
<p>The other leads to dignity, discretion, and individual sovereignty.</p>
<p>With iComply, your customer’s identity is more protected than any API or “App-store” based solution can ever deliver.</p>
<p>Start your free trial. Stay compliant. Stay in control.</p>

<p>Everything you do online forms data that’s tracked, mapped, shared and sold (oh yeah, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-shock-stats-prove-most-people-have-had-their-personal-data-stolen/">oftentimes stolen</a>).</p>



<p>A lot of this data turns up in digital graphs called <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">social graphs and interest graphs</a>, which social media platforms build and use to analyze user behavior, personalize user experience, recommend content, and sell advertising and the data itself.</p>



<p>A social graph maps who you know—all your relationships within a social network such as friends, family, coworkers, etc.</p>



<p>An interest graph maps what you like—all your connections to other people based on shared interests, hobbies and topics.</p>



<p>Social media platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, and YouTube, and short form video and content discovery platforms like TikTok and Snapchat, own and control their users’ data graphs, and monetize them by selling targeted advertising based on user connections and interests, selling the data to third parties (e.g. data brokers) for marketing and other purposes, and aggregating the data for other revenue streams.</p>



<p>Social and interest graphs exist for every platform you’re on and for many of the services you’re using (even banking apps). They’re how Netflix knows what shows to recommend and LinkedIn knows which job vacancies to highlight, but also what garden tool or luxury holiday ads will turn up in your feed and browser, for example.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, these graphs contain masses of personal information about you and therefore reveal an awful lot of personal information about you. And while these graphs have some upsides in terms of tailored content, their downsides for privacy and security are far greater.</p>



<p>Here are 7 privacy and security risks of social and interest graphs:</p>



 
 Unintentional data exposure – Your connections, interactions, and interests may reveal more than you realize, even if you haven’t explicitly shared certain details. We’ve all heard how Facebook can predict whether you’ll <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/14/facebook-love-data/">fall in love or break up</a>, and could know you’re <a href="https://www.kidspot.com.au/pregnancy/facebook-might-know-youre-pregnant-before-you-even-tell-your-partner/news-story/d41fb4e2ef869d5182039045c8e0b163">pregnant</a> before you’ve even told your partner.<br> 



 Third-party access and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/datamining.asp">data mining</a> – Social graphs are pots of gold to advertisers, governments, and cybercriminals. Social network data can be mined to gather sensitive information, including location data, health information, religious identity, sexual orientation, and private messages, which can be used for malicious purposes and surveillance.&nbsp;<br> 



 Identity theft and social engineering – Bad actors can exploit social graphs to steal your identity and impersonate you for financial fraud, impersonate your trusted contacts, craft convincing phishing scams, and guess answers to your accounts’ security questions.<br> 



 Algorithmic bias and manipulation – Social graphs help curate content, but they can also reinforce <a href="https://advertising.utexas.edu/news/what-social-media-echo-chamber">echo chambers</a>, control narratives, and manipulate user behavior.<br> 



 Data breaches – If a platform storing your social graph data is breached, your relationships, habits and other sensitive information could be exposed. 2024 was the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/2024-was-the-biggest-year-for-data-breaches/">biggest year on record for data breaches</a>, and statistics show <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-are-social-graphs-and-interest-graphs-and-do-i-have-them/">most people in the world</a> have now had their personal data stolen.<br> 



 Data brokers: Social graph data can be sold to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a>, who can then use the data for targeted advertising, profiling, and other purposes without user consent.&nbsp;<br> 



 Cyberbullying and online harassment: Social network data can be used for cyberbullying and online harassment, such as doxing, which can cause emotional distress and psychological harm.<br>

  <p>“Sometimes, all it takes is a spark of curiosity to ignite a lifelong journey.” - Unknown</p>

<p>Hello OktaDev community 👋! Let me tell you a story – a story of dreams, passion, and the continuous pursuit of curiosity. My name is Sohail Pathan, and I’m thrilled to join Okta as a Senior Developer Advocate.</p>

<p>It all started in Nagpur, a quaint city nestled in central India. As a child, I eagerly peered through my window, convinced superheroes were real and that someday Superman himself would swing by. While superheroes never appeared, another hero soon took their place – technology.</p>

<p>School never captivated me much, but the computer lab was a magical place. Recognizing this spark, my parents gifted me my first desktop computer – a moment that forever changed my life. A formal education in Computer Science followed, where I fell in love with Java and the vibrant Android ecosystem. When <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/android-announces-support-for-kotlin.html">Google introduced Kotlin support in 2017</a>, weekends turned into coding marathons, building Android apps for everyday use.</p>

 My professional journey: from an app developer to a developer advocate 

<p>My professional path started at an EdTech startup. Here, my first role as an Android developer unfolded with both excitement and nervous anticipation. I vividly remember my early days, meticulously building and refining app features, driven by the genuine joy of seeing students interact with the app. On the go, my involvement quickly expanded beyond just coding. I found myself drawn to answering student queries on forums and guiding them through their learning journeys.</p>

<p>
Image: Post meetup group photo with attendees (I’m the one in black blazer 🕴️).</p>

<p>One fine afternoon, the founders approached me. They said – You have a gift for connecting with our users. We’d like you to be our first Developer Community Manager. That moment changed everything. I started organizing meetups where we taught about open-source opportunities like <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSOC</a> and <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>. I used to spend most of my time answering questions on our forums, helping learners one-on-one, and cheering them on as they built their first projects.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize it then, but I was doing the heart of a Developer Relations job – talking to upcoming developers, understanding their struggles, and sharing my own code. The community started growing, and I loved it so much that I decided to make community work my fulltime role without giving up my passion for coding. It was a win-win for me 🎉.</p>

 Adventures in developer relations 

<p>The DevRel adventure deepened when I joined a deeptech startup that aimed to solve a big pain point: making it easier to run Android Studio on the cloud, which could help people with machines that have limited processing power (similar to Google’s Firebase Studio today). As the Head of Developer Relations, my mission was clear – build and grow a community of Android developers who could test, give feedback, and shape our product.</p>

<p>So, it was time to roll up my sleeves. I organized virtual and inperson meetups where developers could share their struggles and ideas. We even hosted hackathons, challenging participants to push the tool’s limits and tell us what worked and what didn’t. Week after week, I collected feedback, sifting through every comment and suggestion.</p>

<p>

<p>For four intense months, we listened, iterated, and tried to find product market fit. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, technical roadblocks and limited demand meant we couldn’t go forward. The founders made the tough call to shut down the company. While it wasn’t the happy ending I’d hoped for, this chapter taught me lessons money can’t buy: the value of listening closely to your community, the courage to make hard decisions, and the resilience to keep moving forward.</p>

<p>With these lessons etched in my mind, I was ready for whatever came next.</p>

 Crafting the API universe at Apyhub 

<p>My next stop was <a href="https://apyhub.com">ApyHub</a>, where I joined as the Developer Advocate (early team). ApyHub was building an API Marketplace for both developers and no-code builders – a place where anyone could discover, consume, and Monetize APIs.</p>

<p>I still remember the excitement of helping the team prepare for very first public launch on Product Hunt. Working side by side with Engineering and Marketing, I helped create sample apps, write tutorials in Go and Node.js, and craft blog posts to spread the word. Single-handedly, I produced code examples that developers could copy, tweak, and run immediately.</p>

<p>Every week brought new adventures: I delivered talks on API design, cataloged hundreds of APIs, and explained API specifications in simple terms. We sponsored hackathon tracks that challenged participants to build real projects using our APIs, and rewarded the best ideas.</p>

<p>

<p>Living in a startup meant wearing many hats. One moment, I was designing microservices used by over 40,000+ developers; the next, I was learning the ins and outs of API gateway, containers, and load balancing – things that require a backend to run smoothly. This hands-on experience deepened my expertise in REST architecture and DevOps practices.</p>

<p>But the heart of my role was listening. Eventually, I became the first responder for our users (paid and free), collecting feedback, identifying what mattered most, and working with the team to make it happen. There’s nothing like seeing a user’s face light up when a tricky bug is fixed, or a feature is added based on their own suggestion.</p>

<p>Through APIs, I also discovered the power of OAuth and identity management. I saw how a few lines of code could secure entire apps and protect user data. It was a revelation that pointed me straight to Okta.</p>

<p>With every sample app, tutorial, and user conversation, my passion for APIs grew stronger. And now, here I am, ready to bring all of that to Okta.</p>

 Why Okta? 

<p>I’m beyond excited to be at Okta, a place where security isn’t just a department – it’s part of our DNA. Our customers come first, and every decision we make is guided by a single goal: to give people safe, seamless access to the tools they love. Whether you’re a startup building your first app or an enterprise rolling out AI solutions, Okta’s mission is to keep you secure without slowing you down.</p>

<p>Ready to dive in! I’m excited to share my knowledge of APIs and identity, and even more so to learn from this amazing community. Our collective efforts can build a future where technology empowers everyone – securely, effortlessly, and intelligently.</p>

 A little fun fact about me 

<p>Beyond tech, I’m an enthusiastic foodie – especially when it comes to biryani (a mixed rice dish made with rice, meat, and spices). I’ve explored almost every regional variety in India and, according to my friends, I’m quite the cook myself! Connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/iamspathan">LinkedIn</a>, and perhaps we can discover the best biryani spots together 🍗🎉.</p>

<p>I’m eager to engage with you all, learn your stories, and build amazing things together at Okta!</p>

<p>“Welcome to this detailed guide! If you’re wondering what a facial recognition SDK is and how it plays a key role in today’s ID verification world, you’re in the right place.”</p>
<p>In today’s digital-first world, protecting identities has become more important than ever. From online banking to remote healthcare, verifying real users quickly and securely is a challenge every organization is facing.</p>
<p>One breakthrough solution is the <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">facial recognition SDK</a>, a powerful tool for real-time, AI-driven identity verification.</p>
<p>If you’re new to this term, don’t worry! We’re here to break it down in a very simple and engaging way, just like we always do.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is a Facial Recognition SDK? 
<p>A facial recognition SDK (Software Development Kit) allows developers to add real-time facial verification into their own mobile apps, websites, or security systems.</p>
<p>It’s powered by artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning models that map facial geometry, like jawlines, eye spacing, skin tone, and compare it with a reference image to confirm a match.</p>
<p>Most importantly, modern SDKs include facial liveness detection, which ensures that the person in front of the camera is physically present, not a photo, deepfake, or video.</p>
<p>This is the core of modern digital identity systems, and Recognito is leading this evolution with our high-performance SDKs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Does a Facial Recognition SDK Work? 
<p>Let us explain this process in a way that feels easy and logical, step by step. </p>
 Step 1: Face Capture 
<p>Using a webcam or phone camera, the system captures a clear facial image in real time.</p>
 Step 2: Feature Mapping 
<p>An AI-powered engine analyzes facial features and measurements. This is the brain of the face recognition SDK.</p>
 Step 3: Comparison &amp; Match 
<p>The image is matched against a stored photo, ID document, or database for identity confirmation.</p>
 Step 4: Liveness Detection 
<p>Here’s where liveness detection for face recognition plays a crucial role. It detects whether the user is real, using <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">face liveness detection SDK</a> techniques like skin texture analysis, blinking, motion detection, or even blood flow monitoring.</p>
 Step 5: Result Generation 
<p>If everything checks out, the system confirms the identity in seconds. Fast, simple, secure.</p>
<p></p>
 Why Is Facial Recognition SDK Important? 
<p>This tool has become essential for companies across various industries. Let’s explore why:</p>
 1.  Stronger Security 
<p>Using facial recognition and facial liveness detection, organizations can stop identity fraud, spoofing, and deepfake-based attacks.</p>
 2.  Smoother User Experience 
<p>Users no longer need to remember passwords or go through long verification forms. With a few seconds of scanning, the job is done.</p>
 3.  Easy to Integrate 
<p>Modern face recognition SDKs like Recognito’s are developer-friendly with full documentation, APIs, and support for mobile and desktop platforms.</p>
 4.  Regulatory Compliance 
<p>If you’re in finance, health, or telecom, compliance with KYC and AML rules is critical. Facial ID systems ensure your process is secure and regulation-friendly.</p>
 5.  Cost Efficiency 
<p>The automation reduces dependency on manual reviewers, helping organizations scale without hiring extra verification staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 A Wake-Up Call for HR in the Age of Deepfakes and Remote Work  
<p>In 2025, HR leaders are facing a new kind of threat: highly convincing fake applicants, AI-powered resume fraud, and deepfake interview proxies. What used to be fringe or far-fetched is now a weekly reality for talent teams.</p> 
<p>From <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/north-korean-it-workers-infiltrating-fortune-500-companies/">fake IT workers linked to nation-states</a> to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91334692/more-fake-applicants-are-trying-to-trick-hr-thanks-to-the-rise-of-deepfakes">deepfake-driven interview fraud</a>, the threats have never been more diverse, or more advanced. According to HYPR's <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">2025 State of Passwordless Identity Assurance report</a>, 95% of organizations experienced a deepfake incident in the last year, and nearly 40% had a GenAI-related security breach.</p> 
<p>This field-ready guide outlines 10 bottom-of-funnel actions to equip HR teams with real-world tactics, tools, and strategies to detect, prevent, and respond to identity fraud in recruiting and onboarding. Each step is designed to be immediately implementable and mapped to core tools HR professionals already use.</p> 
 1. Clarify Cross-Functional Ownership of Hiring Fraud  
<p>Fraudulent hires affect HR, Security, and IT, &nbsp;yet ownership is often murky:</p> 
  
  Align stakeholders using this guidance from <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-cios-and-cisos-are-saying-about-fake-it-workers">HYPR’s CIO/CISO blog</a>.  
  Establish a joint fraud prevention task force.  
  
Toolkit Tip: Assign an executive sponsor (e.g., CHRO or CISO) for hiring fraud oversight.
<br> 
 2. Assume Everyone is Fake, and Build From There  
<p>This isn’t just about paranoia. It’s about readiness. HR teams should establish a fraud-first mindset:</p> 
  
  Normalize candidate fraud as a standard risk category.  
  Create consistent internal workflows to flag, escalate, and investigate suspicious applications.  
  Adopt peer-driven validation: use teams like security, compliance, and legal to review flagged applicants.  
  
Toolkit Tip: Standardize your screening process with a short “authenticity check” script for recruiters to follow during early conversations.
<br> 
 3. Adapt Screening Depth by Role Sensitivity  
<p>Not every role requires the same rigor:</p> 
  
  Segment roles into low, medium, and high trust tiers.  
  Apply adaptive screening (e.g., basic IDV for marketing coordinator; full IDV and continuity checks for engineering lead).  
  
Toolkit Tip: Build screening tiers into your job requisition templates.
<br> 
 4. Add AI Forgery Resilience to Your Hiring Workflow  
<p>As synthetic candidates and deepfakes become more sophisticated, relying on human intuition alone isn’t enough. Instead, build process-level defenses:</p> 
  
  Use examples from <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/ai-forgery-epidemic">HYPR’s AI Forgery Epidemic blog</a> to train teams on the problems.  
  Integrate AI forgery testing into your hiring tech stack to flag suspicious video, voice, or document inputs automatically.  
  Standardize workflows that include automated pre-screening and digital identity checks – not just résumé reviews.  
  
Toolkit Tip: Rehearse your response plan by running “fraud injection” simulations in your onboarding or interview funnel to see how your systems respond – not just your people.
<br> 
 5. Use Digital Footprint Signals to Automate Resume Validation  
<p>AI-generated resumes and fake work history are on the rise. Don’t rely on gut instinct, use scalable signals to flag inconsistencies early:</p> 
  
  Automate LinkedIn-to-resume cross-checks using screening tools or browser plug-ins.  
  Look for verified links to real portfolios (e.g., GitHub, Behance) and active digital histories, not static PDF claims.  
  Flag mismatches between claimed employers and suspicious email domains (e.g., Gmail addresses for C-level roles).  
  
<p>Toolkit Tip: Use pre-screening software that incorporates digital footprint analysis to identify high-risk applicants before interviews.</p> 
 6. Verify Identity Before the Interview  
<p>Don’t wait until you like the candidate. Use multi-factor identity verification before they enter your hiring funnel:</p> 
  
  Require biometric and document verification at application or pre-interview stage.  
  Validate location using IP and device fingerprinting.  
  
<p>Toolkit Tip: Integrate HYPR Affirm into your ATS (e.g., Greenhouse, Lever) to automate fraud screening.</p> 
 7. Screen for Location Spoofing and Jurisdiction Risks  
<p>Remote applicants frequently lie about location:</p> 
  
  Use real-time geolocation checks to confirm physical presence.  
  Apply filters to block non-compliant jurisdictions (e.g., embargoed nations, unsupported states).  
  
<p>Toolkit Tip: Leverage Affirm’s geolocation feature to automate this process and reduce liability.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/hypr-unmasks-fake-it-worker">Read About How HYPR Unmasks a Fake IT Worker </a></p> 
 8. Require Live Video Interviews With Consent-Based Checks  
<p>To prevent interview fraud and proxies, implement lightweight but effective checks—with transparency and candidate consent:</p> 
  
  Ask candidates to briefly display a government-issued ID on camera and perform a unique gesture or phrase.  
  Require cameras to remain on during interviews to ensure real-time presence.  
  Clearly notify candidates if interviews will be recorded, and obtain their consent beforehand.  
  
<p>Toolkit Tip: Record interviews and retain them for internal verification if inconsistencies arise.</p> 
 9. Confirm Continuity with Biometric Re-Verification  
<p>Proxies often disappear after early interviews. Enforce re-verification:</p> 
  
  Trigger biometric liveness detection at final interview or offer stage.  
  Ensure the same person shows up across all touchpoints.  
  
<p>Toolkit Tip: Deploy Affirm to automate re-verification workflows tied to hiring stage transitions.</p> 
 10. Make Identity Verification an Ongoing Process  
<p>The hiring process is only the beginning. Maintaining workforce integrity means:</p> 
  
  Periodic re-verification of identities, especially for high-risk or privileged roles.  
  Applying identity verification during role changes, contractor onboarding, or access escalation.  
  
<p>Toolkit Tip: Consider implementing continuous or lifecycle IDV strategies to stay ahead of evolving threats.</p>

<p>For those who joined me at Identiverse 2025 and had a chance to hear my keynote, you know it wasn’t just a presentation—it was a rallying cry. In a world increasingly flooded with misinformation, deepfakes, and impersonations, I urged identity professionals to embrace a new mantra: We Are the Guardians of Authenticity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Identiverse was much more than a single moment on stage. It was an inspiring week of connection, collaboration, and momentum. Ping Identity was proud to play a major role at the event, with an impactful presence that reflected our deep commitment to innovation and partnership.</p>

<p>Holochain 0.5 is recommended for use.</p><p>We’re now recommending Holochain 0.5.2 for general development. The <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.5/?ref=blog.holochain.org">upgrade guide</a> tells you everything you need to know to get your hApp updated and running.</p><p>Holochain 0.5 is already in the hands of early adopters, and the feedback so far is that it’s much more consistent, which makes it feels faster. Here’s a message we got from the lead dev of a project:</p><p>Initial test feedback on Holochain 0.5.1 is that gossip is performant. We've noticed that time to reach full DHT sync is approximately 1 minute down from 30+ minutes.</p><p>A 30× speedup is a big leap. The dev explained that with Holochain 0.4, synchronization would sometimes be fast, but other times it could be extremely slow or not complete at all. Now, new data shows up reliably — it takes up to a minute to appear for new peers and is almost immediate for already synced peers.</p><p>Interestingly, performance wasn’t the focus of 0.5 — it was about making peer networking more reliable.</p><p>Let’s look at that one-minute delay for new peers, because it’s important for developers and users to understand.</p><p>With <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune2</a>, Holochain 0.5’s new networking implementation, the behavior for newcomer nodes has changed somewhat. Initially, most DHT data won’t be visible, and they won’t immediately receive new data from other peers — this is the time when their node is trying to discover other peers and sync data with them, and hasn’t yet advertised that they’re storing and serving data (so they won’t receive publish messages for new data).</p><p>At the beginning, the gossip loop happens every minute instead of the default five minutes, in order to get this initial sync completed sooner. After this stage — one, two, or a few gossip rounds depending on the number of peers and amount of data — the newcomer has a full peer table and a full DHT shard*, so they drop the gossip frequency to five minutes. Now all data lookups are local (so they’re fast). They’re also getting new data directly from authors via publish rather than gossip (so that’s fast too).</p><p>Known issues:</p><p>We’re working on an 0.5.3 release to address feedback from early testers. Here’s what we plan to tackle:</p>  When an agent goes offline, other agents may keep trying to connect to them for up to 20 minutes, which will cause network errors and slow data synchronization. We’re tracking this (Holochain <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4978?ref=blog.holochain.org">#4978</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4999?ref=blog.holochain.org">#4999</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/5000?ref=blog.holochain.org">#5000</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/5017?ref=blog.holochain.org">#5017</a>). (Note: this is a long-standing problem that has become more visible now that networking as a whole is working better.)  We’ve received feedback that the new initial syncing behavior creates a feeling of unresponsiveness for new users, so we’re looking at strategies to help initial sync complete sooner (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/issues/220?ref=blog.holochain.org">kitsune2 #220</a>).  <p>These will be addressed in the 0.6 dev release series and backported to 0.5.</p> In development <p>In the Holochain 0.6-dev line, work is being done on SQL query performance. I reported some <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4079?ref=blog.holochain.org#issuecomment-2863047641">good progress</a> in last Dev Pulse, and since then, general query execution time has been cut by 25% across the board.</p><p>This release series will also address the feedback on 0.5:</p>  Agents will fetch data from multiple peers in parallel to get a response faster, and in case one happens to be offline (H<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/5000?ref=blog.holochain.org">olochain #5000</a>).  Unresponsive peers will be tracked (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/issues/221?ref=blog.holochain.org">kitsune2 #221</a>) and filtered from gossip rounds until they come back online (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/issues/222?ref=blog.holochain.org">kitsune2 #222</a>).  Existing agents will permit bursts of gossip from newcomers, to help them get synced quickly, while newcomers will attempt new gossip rounds as soon as they’ve fetched the content they discovered during the last round, until they’re in sync (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/issues/220?ref=blog.holochain.org">kitsune #220</a>).  <p>Most of this is already complete and ready to be backported to 0.5.3.</p><p>In 0.6 we’re also planning to work on:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/13?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Holochain+0.6&amp;filterQuery=epic%3A%22Epic%3A+Membrane+proofs%22+is%3Aopen&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Read access gating via membrane proofs</a>  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/13?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Holochain+0.6&amp;filterQuery=epic%3A%22Epic%3A+Migration+%26+Updates%22+is%3Aopen&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Coordinator zome updates</a>  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/13?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Holochain+0.6&amp;filterQuery=is%3Aopen+epic%3A%22Epic%3A+State+Management+Stability%22&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">More state management reviews</a>  <p>Along with various bug fixes and maintenance tasks.</p><p>In a later release we’ll focus on building more test scenarios and reporting on test metrics from Wind Tunnel.</p>

<p>Behind every great social media platform sits a digital representation of who you know and what you like.</p>



<p>The digital mapping of who you know is called your social graph, and the map of what you like is called your interest graph.</p>



<p>Every platform tracks and maps your activity into these two types of “spiderweb” graph and every action you take adds a bit more “web” each time.</p>



<p>Creepy, right?</p>



<p>Well, it’s especially creepy when you discover these graphs exist even if you’re not on social media, since companies like Google, Apple and even banking apps build interest graphs based on your contacts, emails, purchases, and browsing history.</p>



<p>So, to be clear:</p>



<p>A social graph is about who you know—it maps your relationships within a social network: your friends, family, coworkers, etc.</p>



<p>An interest graph is about what you like—it connects you to other people based on shared interests, hobbies and topics, rather than personal relationships.</p>



<p>Every social media platform including the short-form video and content discovery platforms like YouTube and TikTok build and use these graphs about their users. And, surprise, surprise, they use them to analyze user behavior, personalize user experience, recommend content, and sell ads and the data itself.</p>



<p>But they’re not the only ones:</p>



 
 Online retailers use interest graphs to recommend products based on your browsing history and past purchases.<br> 



 Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify use interest graphs to suggest content based on your viewing or listening habits.<br> 



 News aggregation platforms like Google News and Apple News use interest graphs to personalize news feeds and recommend articles based on your interests.<br> 



 Many other apps and services, such as dating apps, job boards, and travel booking platforms, use interest graphs to personalize user experiences.&nbsp; 
 



<p>But while social graphs and interest graphs improve user experience, they also raise privacy and security concerns. The more data collected, the more companies—and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">bad actors</a>—know about you, so it’s crucial to manage your privacy settings and take other <a href="https://anonyome.com">proactive privacy steps</a>.</p>



<p>You can control your social graph and interest graph, to an extent</p>



<p>While you can’t completely opt out of having social graphs and interest graphs, you can take steps to control what information is collected and shared:</p>



 
 Review your privacy settings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to limit data collection.<br> 



 Be choosy about accepting friend requests and connections to limit the amount of your personal data that others can access.<br> 



 Limit app permissions to stop third-party services from accessing your social graph data.<br> 



 Regularly audit your online activity to remove old or inactive connections, unfollow accounts, and mute topics you’re not interested in. 
 



<p>While that’s the standard advice, you can do more to protect yourself:</p>

<p>A big step for travel, a giant step for digital credentials: Apple will enable the mdoc credential format in its next software release for identity authentication in domestic US travel. With the aviation and travel sectors embracing multiple forms of decentralized identity and verifiable credentials for interoperable global travel, there’s little doubt that the transformation of digital identity is under way.</p>
<p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>In a signal that digital credentials are going to be the norm for travel and authentication in the near future, Apple announced a WWDC25, its annual Worldwide Developers Conference,, that the upcoming version of its iOS 26 software will allow a person to derive a digital credential from their passport using the mdoc credential format and store it in their Apple Wallets to prove their identity for domestic travel in the U.S.</p>
<p>In a second, related <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/IdentityDocumentServices/Implenting-as-an-identity-document-provider">announcement</a> on its developer page, Apple announced the availability of an Apple Identity Document Provider API, which allows websites to receive presentations of mdoc-based documents as a way to authenticate identity.</p>
<p>While not the headline news at WWDC25, these developments represent a significant move forward in the global adoption of seamless, secure, and privacy-preserving digital identity and authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, Apple has confined itself to credentials based on the&nbsp; the mdoc (mobile document) standard —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/en/#iso:std:iso-iec:18013:-5:ed-1:v1:en">ISO18013-5 </a>— which is typically used for mobile driver’s licences (mDL).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The global aviation sector is currently focused on&nbsp; credential formats and protocols that enable international travel and interoperability between the European Union digital identity specifications and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>As of now, Apple’s digital wallets do not offer full support for Europe’s digital identity and wallet specifications (e.g., support for OID4VC and SD-JWT VC is not yet included) and do not appear to utilize the full International Civil Aviation Organization’s Digital Travel Credential (DTC) specifications, which establish global standards for creating digital passports.</p>
<p>Because Apple is deriving credentials from existing physical IDs, this also means that the Apple Wallet announcement doesn’t apply to government-issued digital passports based on an upcoming global standard — DTC Type 2 Credentials —&nbsp;which Indicio is working on through its global partnership with SITA as part of the European Union’s Aptitude Trial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet Apple’s experience in successfully implementing new technology and its skill at delivering effortless user experience is a “lift-all-boats” moment, as it will catalyze the administrative and infrastructural transformation needed for the successful global adoption of verifiable credential technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An incremental approach makes sense. The big wallet providers like Apple and Google will learn from the furious pace of innovation around verifiable credentials in the global aviation sector with all the sector and government specific operational and regulatory requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One observation from Indicio’s role in this innovation race: As different countries and geographic regions have already adopted different specifications, interoperability and governance will be the key to usability and seamless travel.</p>
<p>This announcement shows we are all headed toward the same goal —&nbsp;seamless, secure, digital interaction using digital credentials — and that is going to benefit everyone.</p>
<p>Indicio, digital credentials, and travel</p>
<p>As a global market leader in verifiable digital credentials for travel, finance, education, government services, and logistics, Indicio’s decentralized identity solution —&nbsp;Indicio Proven — enables customers to choose from credential representations including mdoc/mDL, ensuring compatibility with Apple, along with SD-JWT VCs, W3C Verifiable Credentials, AnonCreds, Open Badges 3.0, and protocols including DIDComm and OID4VC so that they can best meet their use case and regulatory or geographic requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The variety of use cases for digital credentials means that the future (which is already here) is one where different credentials are used for different purposes but can also interoperate and be combined for maximum flexibility. Indicio recently showed in <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX-_UU80Ig10%26fbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR1F_ZXvZsgdGNoGRyPKJ9Kd5FSen-68OShWsOkmB33XYGE_orvMmdeKCJs_aem_i7ZGBNKQ7o2hER-O8G8wVA&amp;h=AT3CaxxMt0oGmaxaApXnlxEaZPFuhnz_WOi8a4ZGXsnBKcTdYVcGzXBQp8XpqVWBYs91h1qJselsF4ecSXx5yMZEGeYne81VUJVBS_3a4r2GS4cjsw4NAGNOUGlYnUl2edIh5JRnilHG2NJ__7Q&amp;__tn__=R]-R&amp;c[0]=AT0a1K1brS3JADUCEQOszh0Wde3LFlRn-AZvPm17QoCy6RHhougMQ-X6FDYMQEf23o9CGbBKfE2DMEuB2kicbUv4dGadOT_Ie61c-GoiqhOmZoSPZS7zHISG6tVO8O1XerzWtHOWJJvBp-50AW4tuI0WT0-qsUPOgpCw3I_V2EEZXT2LNs1x">a trial with Delta Air Lines</a>&nbsp; that multiple credential formats can be used in a seamless workflow for international travel.

<p>After <a href="https://datarella.com/datarella-joins-e20m-gaia-x-moveid-project-alongside-bosch-airbus-continental-and-top-web3-projects/">three years</a> of intense collaboration, innovation, and field testing, the <a href="https://moveid.org/">moveID</a> project—part of the Gaia‑X 4 Future Mobility initiative—has made significant strides toward redefining how mobility ecosystems work. At its core, moveID aimed to create a decentralized, user-centric infrastructure where vehicles, infrastructure, and service providers interact seamlessly using Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) and AI agents.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Building the Foundation for Trusted Machine Communication 
<p></p>
<p>Working alongside industry leaders such as Bosch, Airbus, Continental, and leading Web3 projects, we contributed to building the technical and conceptual foundation for trusted machine-to-machine communication in the mobility sector. This included the secure exchange of credentials, decentralized data marketplaces, and AI-powered autonomous service interactions—all compliant with European data and privacy standards.</p>
 
 Demonstrating Real-World Impact: MOBIX Park &amp; Charge 
<p></p>
<p>A standout achievement was the <a href="https://mobix.ai/2023/09/01/mobix-park-charge-demonstrator-behind-the-scenes/">development</a> and public demonstration of MOBIX Park &amp; Charge, a fully operational system enabling electric vehicles (EV) to autonomously find parking spots, access charging stations, and handle payments. First showcased at IAA Mobility 2023, the system integrated SSI, blockchain-based payments, and AI agents in a live, real-world environment.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Scaling Toward Smart Cities 
<p>Beyond the demo, MOBIX has evolved into a scalable <a href="https://mobix.ai/2023/09/14/mobix-park-charge-from-iaa-mobility-showcase-to-smart-city-solution/">smart-city solution</a>. By turning private EV chargers and parking spots into publicly accessible assets, we’re addressing key challenges in urban congestion and infrastructure scalability, while opening up new economic opportunities for individuals and municipalities.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Where Web3 Meets AI 
<p>The project also served as a powerful example of the <a href="https://datarella.com/the-convergence-of-ai-and-web3/">convergence</a> between AI and Web3. By combining intelligent agents with decentralized infrastructure, we demonstrated how machines can not only interact but also negotiate, transact, and self-optimize—laying the groundwork for more ethical and transparent digital ecosystems.</p>
  
 A Foundation for the Future 
<p>In sum, moveID wasn’t just about mobility. It showcased how decentralized identity, autonomous agents, and AI can reshape how devices, services, and users interact—not just in cities, but across industries. As the project concludes, its outcomes provide a strong foundation for future applications in smart infrastructure, data sovereignty, and the broader digital economy.</p>

<p>On 11 February 2025, Black Basta’s internal chat logs were leaked, exposing data that includes the cryptocurrency addresses used by Black Basta’s members, and other external actors in the ransomware ecosystem. In fact, some funds of the leaked addresses can be traced back to the Black Basta ransoms we have previously identified. The leak has given us a fuller picture of how the ransoms were subsequently spent to fund the operation.</p>

Any holders who do not migrate their tokens within this timeframe shall risk losing them irrevocably.</p><p>In line with the new tokenomics scheme approved by the community, holders will receive 1.75 new KILT for each 1 old KILT migrated (i.e. a migration ratio of 1:1.75). The migration will not change the maximum token supply of 290,560,000. After the migration, 100% of the supply will be minted and there will be zero inflation. For further details please see the <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/post/238">governance discussion</a> and <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.io/referendum/50">referendum</a>.</p><p>The KILT parachain will continue to run as normal and without interruption. In due course the new Base token will be bridged back to Polkadot to serve as gas, in governance functions, etc.</p><p>Please read this guide carefully before undertaking to migrate your&nbsp;tokens.</p> Contracts and&nbsp;Audit   Ethereum KILT: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x5d3d01fd6d2ad1169b17918eb4f153c6616288eb">0x5d3d01fd6d2ad1169b17918eb4f153c6616288eb</a>  Base KILT (old): <a href="https://basescan.org/token/0x9e5189a77f698305ef76510aff1c528cff48779c">0x9e5189a77f698305ef76510aff1c528cff48779c</a>  Base KILT (new): <a href="https://basescan.org/token/0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8">0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8</a>  Migration Contract: <a href="https://basescan.org/address/0x4a62f30d95a8350fc682642a455b299c074b3b8c">0x4a62f30d95a8350fc682642a455b299c074b3b8c</a>  Security Audit: <a href="https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kilt-protocol#code-security">https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kilt-protocol</a>   Migration Routes <p>There are two alternative ways for users to migrate their KILT&nbsp;tokens.</p> Either:  1) Deposit to a participating Centralised Exchange (CEX) before their respective deadlines. <p>We are actively working with KILT’s exchange partners to support the migration. Users with KILT successfully deposited to a participating exchange before their respective deadlines will have their KILT migrated automatically. Note that this is a one-time event; if the deadline is missed it is very unlikely that any further assistance will be offered by the CEXs and deposits will no longer be open to the old KILT&nbsp;token.</p><p>Whilst the KILT Foundation strives to support CEX participation, they remain completely independent and the nature and extent of their participation may be subject to change. Individual CEX policies will apply; KYC may be required and geographic restrictions may exist. Each exchange will have their own schedule, deadlines and requirements — please check with your chosen exchange and monitor official channels.</p> Or,  2) Follow the self-custody bridging and migration route laid out&nbsp;below. <p>This process requires basic familiarity with self-custody wallets, signing transactions, etc. From 1200 UTC on Thursday June 19th 2025 the migration window will be open for at least 10 weeks and users may migrate at their convenience within that timeframe. After final closure of the migration window, migration will no longer be possible and if a user has not migrated their tokens they will be lost, without the possibility of recourse.</p><p>This guide covers bridging of KILT from Polkadot to Base, and migration within Base from the old contract to the new. The overall journey tokens must take is as&nbsp;shown:</p> You will&nbsp;need: <p>For Step&nbsp;1</p>  A Polkadot wallet e.g <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/extension/">polkadot{.js}</a>, <a href="https://www.talisman.xyz/">Talisman</a>, <a href="https://www.subwallet.app/">Subwallet</a>, <a href="https://novawallet.io/">Nova</a> etc. Note that Sporran, the original KILT wallet, will not suffice; the wallet must be able to connect to multiple parachains (e.g. AssetHub). See Appendix — Starting from Sporran at the foot of this&nbsp;guide.  An EVM&nbsp;wallet  DOT for gas (~$5 fee as of 19th&nbsp;June)  <p>For Steps 2 &amp;&nbsp;3</p>  An EVM&nbsp;wallet  ETH on Ethereum for gas (~$0.60 fee as of 19th&nbsp;June)  ETH on Base for gas (&lt;$0.01, this can be bridged during this&nbsp;process)  <p>Note that steps 1 and 2 may be carried out at any time, including before the opening of the migration window. Step 3 may not be completed until the opening of the migration window.</p> 1) Bridge native KILT to&nbsp;Ethereum <p>Use Polar Path and <a href="https://app.snowbridge.network/">Snowbridge</a>, following the procedure detailed&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/switch-and-trade-polkadot-and-ethereum-tokens-with-polar-path-439dd563cac7">Switch Polkadot and Ethereum Tokens with Polar Path</a></p><p>Note that Sporran, the original KILT wallet, will not suffice; the wallet must be able to connect to multiple parachains (e.g. AssetHub). See Appendix — Starting from Sporran at the foot of this&nbsp;guide.</p> 2) Bridge Ethereum KILT to&nbsp;Base <p>a) Go to <a href="https://superbridge.app/base">https://superbridge.app/Base</a></p><p>b) Connect the same wallet you used with Snowbridge during Step 1, which is now holding your Ethereum KILT, and&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>c) Click the drop-down list of tokens (normally showing ETH by default).</p><p>d) You will see a list of tokens to choose&nbsp;from:</p><p>e) In the search field, enter the contract address for Base&nbsp;KILT:</p><blockquote>0x9E5189a77f698305Ef76510AFF1C528cff48779c</blockquote><p>and select it from the&nbsp;list.</p><p>SuperBridge will discover both Ethereum and Base KILT. Import the&nbsp;pair.</p><p>Note: if the search fails or does not show a correct balance, you may first need to add KILT as a custom token to your wallet. For example, according to this <a href="https://support.metamask.io/manage-crypto/portfolio/how-to-import-a-token-in-metamask-portfolio/">guide for Metamask</a>.</p><p>f) Enter the amount of KILT you would like to bridge. Click “Review bridge” and follow the approval and signing steps particular to your connected wallet. Await confirmation that the bridge has been successful (~3 minutes).</p><p>g) If you don’t already have ETH on Base, you will need some to carry out the migration — $0.01 to $0.05 will suffice under normal network conditions.</p><p>When the KILT bridging is complete, change the token in the drop-down list from KILT to ETH and repeat the process: click “Review bridge” and follow the approval and signing steps particular to your connected wallet.</p><p>h) When the bridging is complete, you can view your Base KILT tokens and Base ETH by switching your wallet to the Base network and adding KILT as a custom token with contract&nbsp;address:</p><blockquote>0x9E5189a77f698305Ef76510AFF1C528cff48779c</blockquote> 3) Migrate from the old Base contract to the new Base&nbsp;contract <p>a) Go to <a href="https://migrate.kilt.io">https://migrate.kilt.io</a> to access the KILT migration portal. Carefully read the Terms and Conditions before proceeding.</p><p>b) Connect your wallet. If required, the portal will prompt you to switch networks to&nbsp;Base.</p><p>c) Enter the amount of KILT you would like to migrate and click Approve. Sign the transaction in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>d) When the approval is complete, the button will change to Migrate. Click the Migrate button and sign the transaction in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>e) To view your migrated KILT, add the new contract address to your wallet as a custom&nbsp;token:</p><blockquote>0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8</blockquote> This completes the migration.  Appendix — Starting from&nbsp;Sporran <p>If you hold KILT tokens on Sporran, you must first move them to a Polkadot wallet which can interact with other parachains (namely, AssetHub) as well as KILT Spiritnet. Sporran can interact only with KILT Spiritnet.</p><p>This may be achieved by&nbsp;either:</p>  Creating a new KILT address within a suitable wallet (e.g <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/extension/">polkadot{.js}</a>, <a href="https://www.talisman.xyz/">Talisman</a>, <a href="https://www.subwallet.app/">Subwallet</a>, <a href="https://novawallet.io/">Nova</a> etc. etc.) and manually sending your KILT from Sporran to the new address, using the “Send” function on Sporran. This is exactly like any other normal token transfer you may have undertaken in the&nbsp;past.  Taking your 12 words (recovery phrase/seed words), which were recorded when originally setting up your Sporran address, and importing them into a suitable wallet (e.g <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/extension/">polkadot{.js}</a>, <a href="https://www.talisman.xyz/">Talisman</a>, <a href="https://www.subwallet.app/">Subwallet</a> etc.) to recreate your address there. Please consult user guides for your chosen wallet; you may find this function described as “Importing” or “Restoring” an existing&nbsp;wallet.

<p>In today’s fast-paced business world, your web browser is more than just a tool for browsing the internet – it’s a critical component of your team’s productivity and efficiency. A well-chosen browser can streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and safeguard sensitive company data, while a poor choice can lead to frustrating delays and security vulnerabilities. But with so many options available, how do you pick the best web browser for business that truly unleashes your team’s potential? This guide dives deep into the features and considerations crucial for making an informed decision that will empower your employees and secure your operations.</p>



 Introduction to Web Browser for Business 



 What is a Web Browser for Business? 



<p>A web browser for business is more than just a consumer browse tool; it’s a strategically chosen application designed to enhance organizational productivity, streamline workflows, and, most critically, provide robust security for sensitive company data. Unlike standard browsers built for general use, a business-grade browser often integrates advanced features like centralized management for IT teams, enhanced security protocols such as sandboxing and data loss prevention (DLP), and seamless compatibility with enterprise-specific applications and cloud services.</p>









 Why Does a Business Need a Web Browser? 



<p>Businesses need a carefully chosen web browser for several compelling reasons:</p>



 
 Enhanced Security: This is paramount. Over 80% of cyberattacks targeting end-users originate in the browser, including phishing, malware, and ransomware. <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-access-blocked-websites/">A standard consumer browser</a> offers basic protection, but a dedicated business browser provides advanced security features like built-in threat protection, data loss prevention (DLP), secure access to cloud applications, and real-time monitoring to safeguard sensitive company data from evolving threats. 



 Boosted Productivity and Efficiency: Employees spend the majority of their workdays in a browser, accessing cloud-based software (CRM, project management, accounting), collaborating, and conducting research. A browser optimized for business offers seamless integrations with essential business applications, efficient tab management, and cross-platform syncing, all of which streamline workflows and reduce friction, leading to significant productivity gains. 



 Centralized Management and IT Control: Unlike individual consumer browsers, a business browser allows IT departments to centrally manage and enforce security policies, control extensions, restrict access to risky websites, and deploy updates across the entire organization. This level of control is crucial for maintaining consistent security configurations, ensuring compliance, and significantly reducing IT overhead. 



 Support for Remote and Hybrid Work: With the rise of remote and hybrid work models, employees often access corporate resources from various devices and networks. A business browser provides a secure and controlled environment for accessing company data, even on unmanaged devices, mitigating risks associated with Bring Your Device (BYOD) policies. 



 Compliance and Data Governance: Many industries face strict regulatory requirements regarding data privacy and security (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Business browsers help organizations meet these compliance standards by offering features that prevent data leakage, support secure browser practices, and provide auditing and reporting capabilities to track user activity and security incidents. 
 



 Why Choosing the Best Web Browser for Business Matters 



<p>Selecting the <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-delete-the-history-from-youtube/">right web browser for your business</a> is a pivotal strategic decision, far beyond mere preference. In today’s highly interconnected and cyber-threatened environment, the browser acts as your team’s primary gateway to cloud applications, sensitive data, and client interactions. Its impact is felt across several critical areas:</p>



 
 Impact on Productivity: A well-chosen browser directly influences your team’s efficiency. Fast loading times are crucial, as even small delays accumulate to significant wasted hours daily. Crucially, it must ensure seamless compatibility with essential business applications like CRM systems, project management tools and accounting software. A browser that frequently crashes or struggles with these vital tools can severely hamper workflow and reduce output. 



 Addressing Security Concerns: Protecting sensitive information is paramount. The browser is a primary entry point for cyber threats. The right browser offers robust features for safeguarding sensitive data, including client information, financial records, and proprietary intellectual property, against phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, and data breaches. It should provide advanced security protocols to minimize these risks. 
 









 
 Facilitating Collaboration and Integration: Modern businesses thrive on teamwork. The ideal browser supports essential extensions that enhance productivity, enable seamless cloud syncing across devices, and integrate smoothly with team workflows. This ensures employees can collaborate effectively on shared documents, communicate effortlessly, and access synchronized data, regardless of their location. 
 



<p>Example:</p>



<p>Consider the tangible risks: a slow or insecure browser can lead to constant frustration, missed deadlines due to inefficiencies, or, far worse, critical data breaches that compromise client trust, incur heavy financial penalties, and severely damage your company’s reputation. Therefore, investing time in choosing a browser optimized for your business needs directly contributes to unlocking your business’s full potential by fostering a more secure, efficient, and collaborative digital workspace.</p>



 Criteria for Selecting the Best Web Browser for Business 



<p>Choosing the <a href="https://blog.herond.org/top-5-browsers-for-mac-privacy-focused-browsers-and-extensions/">best web browser for business</a> isn’t just about personal preference. It’s a strategic decision impacting your team’s efficiency and data security. Top-tier business browsers excel in several key areas:</p>



 
 Speed and Performance: A critical factor for boosting productivity, leading browsers offer quick page loading times and smooth multitasking. This minimizes delays, keeping your team focused and efficient throughout the workday. 



 Robust Security Features: Paramount for business, the ideal browser includes built-in privacy tools, effective ad-blockers, and strong protection against phishing and malware. These features are vital for safeguarding sensitive company data and preventing cyber threats. 
 









 
 Seamless Compatibility: Essential for modern operations, the browser must offer comprehensive support for business tools like Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, CRM systems, and other cloud-based applications. This ensures workflows remain uninterrupted and integrated. 



 Extensive Customization: The availability of a wide range of extensions for productivity, security, and collaboration. It allows businesses to tailor the Browse experience precisely to their unique needs, enhancing specific team functions and overall efficiency. 



 Reliable Cross-platform Support: For today’s remote and hybrid teams, strong cross-platform syncing across all devices (desktop, mobile) is crucial. This ensures consistent access to data and settings, fostering seamless collaboration regardless of location.

<p>In an age of rising streaming costs, the desire to download movies for free is growing, offering film lovers a personal library of blockbusters accessible anytime, offline. While this digital landscape can be complex with legal and safety concerns, knowing the right platforms is key. This guide will help you navigate safely, revealing the best websites to download movies for free by focusing on accessibility, content variety, and user safety. It will ensure that blockbusters truly await you without compromising your device or data.</p>



 Introduction To The Best Websites To Download Movies For Free 



<p>The appeal of downloading movies for free is stronger than ever, offering film enthusiasts the convenience of building a personal library without recurring subscription costs. However, navigating the online landscape to find reliable and safe platforms can be complex, often raising concerns about legality, malware, and intrusive ads. This guide is designed to cut through the noise, helping you discover the best websites to download movies by focusing on platforms that offer a balance of broad content, user-friendliness, and a commitment to safety. We’ll ensure you can access your favorite blockbusters and cinematic treasures securely and efficiently, transforming your viewing experience without compromising your device or data.</p>









 Why Should We Know About Websites To Download Movies for Free? 



<p>For many film enthusiasts, this method offers compelling advantages that go beyond simply saving money. Imagine having your favorite blockbusters and cinematic classics available offline, on any device, whenever you want, without worrying about internet connectivity or recurring monthly fees.</p>



 Cost Savings 



<p>One of the most immediate and significant drivers for people seeking free movie downloads is the undeniable appeal of cost savings. In an entertainment landscape increasingly dominated by multiple subscription services (Netflix, Disney+, Max, etc.), each demanding a separate monthly fee, the cumulative cost can become substantial. Downloading movies for free allows viewers to bypass these recurring expenses entirely, providing access to a vast library of films, including the latest blockbusters, without putting a dent in their budget. This financial relief makes high-quality entertainment accessible to a broader audience, fostering a personal movie library without ongoing financial commitment.</p>



 Convenience and Offline Viewing 



<p>Beyond just saving money, the desire for enhanced convenience is a major reason people opt to download movies for free. Unlike streaming, which is entirely reliant on a stable internet connection, downloading enables true offline viewing. This means you can enjoy your favorite films anytime, anywhere – whether on a long flight, a road trip through areas with no Wi-Fi, or simply at home during an internet outage. The ability to access movies without buffering issues or connectivity worries offers unparalleled flexibility, making downloaded content a perfect solution for those who want their entertainment readily available on their terms.</p>









 Access to Blockbusters Without Subscriptions 



<p>A significant motivation behind seeking free movie downloads is the strong desire to access popular blockbusters and a wider variety of films without the need for multiple, potentially expensive, streaming subscriptions. Not all blockbusters are available on every platform simultaneously, and content libraries frequently change. This provides a sense of “ownership” and ensures access to desired content outside the fluctuating terms of various streaming providers.</p>



 The Need for Safe and Legal Sources 



<p>While the benefits of downloading movies for free are clear, it’s critical to emphasize the need for safe and legal sources. The internet is rife with unofficial websites that distribute copyrighted content, often bundling it with malicious software. Engaging with such platforms carries significant risks, including exposure to malware, viruses, spyware, and other cyber threats that can compromise your device and personal data. Furthermore, downloading copyrighted material without permission can lead to copyright issues and legal repercussions. Therefore, users must exercise extreme caution and prioritize reputable, legally compliant platforms, or those that aggregate links from verified sources, to ensure a secure and ethical downloading experience.</p>



 Criteria for Choosing the Best Websites To Download Movies for free 



<p>With a vast and often risky online landscape, understanding key criteria is crucial for a safe, high-quality, and enjoyable experience.</p>



 Key Factors for Selection 



<p>When seeking the best websites to download movies, several crucial factors dictate a safe and satisfying experience. Foremost among these is Safety, ensuring the platform is entirely malware-free and poses no threat to your device or data. Equally vital is Legality, meaning the site primarily offers public domain content or has explicit authorization to distribute the films. Beyond security and compliance, the platform should boast ease of use, featuring an intuitive interface for effortless navigation and downloading. Finally, content quality is paramount, with a strong emphasis on the availability of HD (high-definition) downloads to ensure a superior viewing experience.</p>



 Importance of Avoiding Pirated Content 



<p>Users must understand the importance of avoiding pirated content when looking to download movies for free. Beyond the ethical considerations, downloading unauthorized copyrighted material carries significant risks. Firstly, it’s a legal issue, potentially leading to copyright infringement penalties. Secondly, and perhaps more immediately, unofficial sites are notorious for being vectors of malware, viruses, and ransomware, which can severely compromise your device, steal personal information, or even corrupt your entire system. Prioritizing legal and safe sources protects both your legal standing and the integrity of your digital devices.</p>









 Checking Regional Availability 



<p>A final, yet often overlooked, criterion when selecting movie download websites is checking regional availability. Due to licensing agreements and distribution rights, many platforms or specific film titles may be subject to geo-restrictions, meaning they are only accessible from certain countries. Before committing to a site or attempting a download, it’s advisable to quickly verify if the content is legally available in your region. While VPNs can sometimes offer workarounds for these restrictions, being aware of regional limitations from the outset helps manage expectations and ensures a smoother, more compliant downloading experience.</p>



 Top Websites to Download Movies for Free 



<p>The desire to download movies for free is stronger than ever, offering film enthusiasts offline access without subscription fees. However, finding truly reliable and safe platforms can be challenging.</p>



<p>Here’s a curated list of top websites to download movies for free, prioritizing those offering legal content or public domain titles, alongside platforms known for user-friendliness and quality.</p>

 How to Stay Safe While Choosing Websites To Download Movies For Free 



<p>While the allure of downloading movies for free is strong, navigating the online landscape without risking your device or personal data requires vigilance. Unofficial sources can expose you to malware, viruses, and legal issues.</p>



 Use Reputable Websites 



<p>The most crucial step in staying safe while downloading movies is to strictly use reputable websites. The internet is rife with unofficial sources that distribute pirated content, which are often laden with malware, viruses, and phishing scams designed to compromise your device or steal your personal information. Stick to well-known, legitimate platforms that offer public domain movies, or provide ad-supported legal streaming with the option for offline viewing (like those mentioned in our “Top Websites” list). By choosing established and trustworthy sites, you significantly reduce your exposure to harmful downloads and deceptive practices.</p>



 Install Antivirus Software and Enable a Firewall 



<p>A fundamental layer of defense when downloading movies from any source is robust cybersecurity. Always install reliable antivirus software on your computer or device and ensure it is kept up-to-date with the latest definitions. This software acts as your first line of defense, scanning downloaded files for malware and blocking known threats. Complement this by enabling your operating system’s built-in firewall. A firewall monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic, preventing unauthorized access to your device and blocking suspicious connections that could arise from unsafe downloads. These two tools work in tandem to create a secure environment for your digital activities.</p>







 Consider Using a VPN for Privacy 



<p>While not strictly a safety measure against malware, considering a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for privacy is highly recommended, especially if you find yourself needing to access region-restricted content. A VPN encrypts your internet connection and masks your IP address, making your online activities much more private and difficult to trace. This layer of anonymity adds an extra shield against potential monitoring and enhances your overall online security posture when navigating various movie download sites.</p>



 Verify the Legality of the Website 



<p>Before initiating any download, it’s essential to verify the legality of the website itself. Illegitimate sites that distribute copyrighted content without permission not only put you at risk of encountering malware but can also lead to copyright infringement issues. Look for clear indicators that a site is offering public domain films, has explicit licensing agreements, or is an official platform. Be wary of sites promising the latest blockbusters for free without ads or any clear business model, as these are strong indicators of illicit activity. Prioritizing legal sources ensures you’re enjoying content ethically and without legal repercussions.</p>



 Tips for Spotting Unsafe Websites 



<p>Developing an eye for danger signs is crucial for staying safe while downloading movies. Be vigilant for excessive pop-ups, especially those that appear immediately upon visiting a site or when clicking anywhere on the page. These are a classic sign of untrustworthy platforms. Similarly, be extremely cautious of suspicious links that redirect you to unexpected pages or prompt you to download unusual files. Other red flags include websites with very generic or unprofessional designs, numerous broken links, or those that demand personal information or unusual browser extensions before allowing access to content. Trust your instincts; if a site feels off, it’s best to navigate away immediately.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, the quest for free movie downloads doesn’t have to be a perilous journey. By understanding the compelling reasons—from significant cost savings and unparalleled offline convenience to accessing desired blockbusters without restrictive subscriptions—you can truly enhance your entertainment experience. However, the paramount takeaway remains the absolute necessity of prioritizing safe and legal sources. By adhering to the criteria of reputable websites, utilizing essential cybersecurity tools like antivirus software and VPNs, and learning to spot the red flags of unsafe platforms, you can confidently navigate the digital landscape. Embrace the world of free cinema responsibly, and with the right knowledge, blockbusters truly await you, ready to be enjoyed securely and at your leisure.</p>

<p>Join Christine Owen, Field CTO at 1Kosmos, and Fadi Jarrar, VP of Public Sector, as they announce a major milestone: 1Kosmos is now FedRAMP High Authorized. Learn what this achievement means for federal agencies, how it sets 1Kosmos apart as the only Kantara-certified CSP with FedRAMP High, and why it reinforces our commitment to delivering the highest standards in security, privacy, and user experience.</p>
  
<p></p>
 
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>Hello everybody. Fadi Jarrar here with 1Kosmos and Vice President of Public Sector, and we have some exciting news to share with you everybody. I’m inviting Christine Owen. Christine, I’ll let you go ahead and introduce yourself and share a little bit of news.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>Hi. So I’m Christine Owen and I’m the field CTO at 1Kosmos, and I am so excited, beyond excited to be able to tell everybody that we have achieved our FedRAMP High Authorization. This is a massive, massive achievement for us. We worked very hard over the last year to make sure that our product was exactly how it needed to be for federal requirements and also for that stricter, higher FedRAMP High requirements. So we are so excited to be able to say that we’re FedRAMP High authorized today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>Let’s step back a little bit. What is FedRAMP High? What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>Right. So FedRAMP is a requirement for federal agencies and it essentially is for SaaS products. So if you are operating in the cloud and you’re a product, you need to have a FedRAMP authorized product. There’s a lot of different levels. Generally people operate in the Moderate space. Moderate has a certain number of NIST 800-53 Rev. 5 controls that you have to meet. We decided to just jump all of that and go straight to High for a lot of different reasons, partially because we are a security by design company and we wanted to make sure that we offered our clients the highest level of security that we could.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>Rip off the bandaid and go straight to High. I like it. What sets FedRAMP High apart from other security certifications? I know we have Kantara, we have a bunch of different certifications. What differs FedRAMP High from all those?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>Right. So we have a lot of different certifications actually. We have ISO 27001, we have SOC 2. We do our PAD-1 and 2 certifications. We have Kantara certification. And then on top of that we also do PIN testing. So we do a lot of certifications and testing of our product regularly. What we’ve decided to do when it comes to FedRAMP High is we decided to create and operate for the federal government in state and local jurisdictions and governments so that we could give them the highest level of security with our product. FedRAMP High has to be operated within a GovCloud, so a certified by the federal government cloud, we have that. So there are certain controls that are stricter than our ISO 27001 certification. So we have that. And then on top of that, there are certain encryption requirements for FedRAMP that essentially require FIPS 140-3 encryption standards and we also meet those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>Great. So I think you touched on this a little bit, but what really validates the security and reliability of the 1Kosmos platform in our FedRAMP High environment versus commercial and others?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>Right. So we have stronger controls, so we have to operate within the US within a GovCloud, and we have to have US citizens who pass certain tests to be able to get into the environment, operating within the environment. But on top of that, we also have continuous monitoring. And in those cases with FedRAMP, we have to remediate any vulnerabilities we find in a certain period of time based on FedRAMP requirements and based on the criticality of that vulnerability. It’s not that we weren’t doing that before, but now it is a requirement for us to be able to maintain our authorization. So it’s something that we take very seriously and it’s something that we’re really excited to offer to all of our customers, quite frankly, because any vulnerability that has to get fixed in FedRAMP High also flow down into the commercial environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>So what is the value as a credential service provider to onboard the FedRAMP High authorization to 1Kosmos?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So we are the only Kantara certified product period that is FedRAMP High. So it’s a big differentiator security-wise against our competitors within the federal market space because we come to the federal government with the highest, strictest security controls in the civilian agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. So tell us a little bit about the journey. You and I have conversed about FedRAMP almost every day of our lives together here. So what did the journey look like? What were the big challenges that we had to overcome?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>There were a lot of tears, lots of yelling. No, honestly, I think it’s just, and this is for any product, company that’s getting ready to go through some sort of FedRAMP authorization and starting at the beginning like we did, what you realize is how much you don’t know and there is a lot to learn when it comes to FedRAMP requirements and also when it just comes to the process of getting through the FedRAMP PMO. So I think that was the biggest challenge for us. Now that we’ve gone through it once, I think we have a better understanding of how to go through it again. We already have plans to go back and get reassessed for additional enhancements.</p>
<p>So clearly I am a glutton for pain, but it’s totally worth it because as we continue to enhance and grow the product, on the commercial side, we are planning on doing as much parity within the FedRAMP High environment as possible. So what that means is on the commercial side, we will be building with the FedRAMP High encryption and other standards within our codes and making sure that vulnerabilities are caught before they go into our product. And on the FedRAMP High side, it means that we will be going back to the assessor quite often to make sure that we can provide the best product to our customers. We’re really excited about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>So now that we’ve got to FedRAMP High, I’m not sure if we’re at the top of the mountain or if there’s other things in the foreseeable future that we’re focused on and in different markets in public sector, what are your thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>So we’re never going to be at the top of the mountain. We’re always going to be climbing to the top to achieve the best that we can achieve, so be that as product enhancements and going back to get reassessed multiple times a year. And then next we’ve decided why not? We’re going to strive to become IL4 authorized. And the reason is really because we want to make sure that we are able to operate within any of the agencies in the federal space and we want to make sure that we stay in the strongest, most secure controls. So the difference between High and IL4 is really about 20 controls. And we did the math and we did look through all of this and we decided, you know what? It’s worth it because if something gets compromised within the FedRAMP High environment, we’ll always be able to pivot to the IL4 environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>So for basic people like myself, the assumption I have is the FedRAMP environment is extremely restrictive and maybe affects some flexibility. Can you shed a little bit about how the user experience, how we can maintain the user experience and build upon that in our FedRAMP environment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So the FedRAMP environment is just essentially, I like to think of it as it’s the boundary around our product. So that is really strict. So essentially our engineers have a very strong DevSecOps game. And so what this means is that the perimeter is very hardened, but on the inside it’s still a little squishy. And what I mean by that is it’s the exact same product that we have on the commercial side, which means that user experience, the flexibility of the platform, the flexibility of the workflows, the strong authenticators, that’s all still there. So I’m really excited because the user experience is something that we care about, probably equal to security and privacy. And so we are still iterating on our product and we will still bring a very strong user experience to our product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>Great. So let me ask you this. There’s a traditional model of achieving FedRAMP and another model which we went to, the endeavor that we took. Can you kind of explain how we were able to get the FedRAMP High so quickly and what users that are looking us up in the marketplace can look for and all that good stuff?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>Right. So we decided to piggyback off of a platform that already was FedRAMP High authorized, which means that we had to go through a significant change request on that platform to be able to achieve FedRAMP High. In theory, it does make it faster, but in practice it’s still a long process when it’s your first time at the rodeo. The platform that we decided to use was FedHIVE. We actually believe that they are the best in the business for various reasons, including the fact that they believe in strong compliance measures and they are very strict and very fair when it comes to how they run their platform. So we are on their platform and if you go to the Marketplace and you can request FedHIVE’s package and we are within that package. You could also go to FedHIVE itself and we have a page on FedHIVE about our FedRAMP High Authorization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>So our platform is known to be highly flexible and we’re known for our privacy preserving principles and so forth. What impact does FedRAMP have on that? Does it affect our flexibility? Does it affect our privacy preserving principles, anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Christine Owen:</p>
 
<p>No, it doesn’t. Again, all it does is make sure that we adhere to very strong security practices that meet the highest level of the civilian government and we still have a very flexible platform. Our customers can still either just do doc verification or do doc verification with a biometric match or use a biometric to be able to log into their computer. There’s a lot of different things that our customers can still do with our product because we made sure that, I would say 95% of our features ended up in the FedRAMP offering. Now, just like any other product offering that migrates from commercial to FedRAMP, maybe there was one or two features that we are putting in this year once we achieved the authorization. But I am very, very clear to say that that does not affect our privacy. It does not affect our very flexible platform and it won’t affect our security either. So I’m really excited that we’ve worked really hard on this and we’ve achieved a FedRAMP High Authorization with 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Fadi Jarrar:</p>
 
<p>Well, I think that wraps us up. Appreciate your time, Christine. We got a lot of work to do onward and upward, and we’re looking forward to really working with our clients to really build that security and privacy story and go help defend fraud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re excited that we’re bringing the most secure full-service Kantara certified CSP to the marketplace today.</p>

				 <p>Indicio Proven isn’t just a new way to verify identity, it’s a new way to build portable, interoperable digital trust —&nbsp;one that provides a common, universal foundation for commercial, digital, corporate and decentralized banking and finance.</p>
<p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>In banking and&nbsp; financial services, customer experience and security can feel like a trade-off: You can make a process seamless or you can make it secure — but how to do both?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s what we’re changing.</p>
<p>With Indicio Proven banks and financial services&nbsp; can provide seamless account authentication —&nbsp;no passwords, no multifactor authentication — with the highest level of digital identity assurance and privacy protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And when we say the “highest level of digital identity assurance,” we mean government-grade digital identity, capable of mitigating biometric identity fraud and generative-AI deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, Indicio Proven’s combination of seamless, secure, and interoperability has the power to turn digital identity into a universal payment system —&nbsp;authentication and payment rails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>And all with significant cost savings over current, slow-lane identity access management solutions.</p>
<p>Fractured and fragile: how we currently manage of account identity</p>
<p>Right now, banks and&nbsp; financial services meet compliance requirements using legacy identity systems built around centralized databases, proprietary integrations, and recurring verification steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customers submit some form of state-issued ID, such as a passport or driver’s license, wait for a check, and do it again when accessing a new product or to make a transaction. Even after passing KYC, they’re stuck verifying over and over again– especially across services, apps, or jurisdictions.</p>
<p>This slows down business, drives up drop-off rates, and creates exposure to security risks: Phishing attacks, account takeovers, and data breaches. With biometric identity fraud, deepfakes, and the rapid expansion in AI usage across all attack vectors,&nbsp; verifying identity has become exponentially challenging and costly. For consumers, stolen biometrics represent existential threats. They can’t just reset their faces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials vs credentials that are verifiable</p>
<p>Many institutions and identity providers say they already have verifiable digital credentials for account management and that’s because verifiable credentials are the new buzzword in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a Verifiable Credential is more than an auth token with a fancy label; it’s the product of a set of global standards that transforms how personal data is created, made tamper proof, stored, shared, and verified.</p>
<p>These standards mean a Verifiable Credential can be used to authenticate a person’s identity anywhere, without having to check in with the source of that identity data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For banks and financial services, this means no need for complex direct integrations or phoning home to verify an identity or third-party identity providers and access management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For customers, this means they have control over their personal data, consent to share it, and the ability to share it securely.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the interplay of cryptography, decentralized technologies, and identity binding all deliver instant authentication, enabling institutions to deliver seamless experiences to their customers.</p>
<p>The decentralized identity revolution just evolved to incorporate biometrics&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we add authenticated biometrics to a Verifiable Credential, we create “government-grade” digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ground-breaking innovation was developed by Indicio for international travel. It’s&nbsp;a way to generate a Verifiable Credential from a passport so that the image of the passport holder’s face in the passport chip can be checked against a live view of that person. This solution is now being used for international travel and border crossing.</p>
<p>When applied to banking and financial services, authenticated biometrics in a Verifiable Credential delivers the strong assurance needed for KYC, account management, and payments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It transforms remote onboarding and provides a way to mitigate biometric identity fraud and deepfakes. A customer can verify a liveness check of their face with an authenticated, tamper-proof biometric template of their face.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the magic of real Verifiable Credentials is that you can verify this biometric data without having to store your customers’ biometric data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This goes for all the data in the credential. Or data added from another credential to a presentation of this government-grade digital identity. You can cryptographically prove the source of the data and its integrity — that it hasn’t been altered.</p>
<p>Our shorthand for this is “portable trust.” All sorts of personal data or critical information can be rendered fully portable for verification anywhere. It’s a fundamental change in how we communicate information — a software architecture that can sit on top of our fractured internet and make it fully integrated, fully seamless.</p>
<p>This is why we talk of digital identity as a payment rail (and it’s not just a metaphor, Verifiable Credentials allow you to create secure, peer-to-peer communications channels for sharing information).</p>
<p>What it means for your customers</p>
<p>Instead of&nbsp; relying on usernames and passwords, backend database calls, or waving around photocopies of government-issued IDs in front of webcams, a customer can scan a QR code to instantly prove who they are and what they’re authorized to have access to&nbsp; without ever exposing sensitive data or calling back to a central server controlled by a third-party verification service. Just a direct, trusted line of communication between your customer and you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because credentials are held by the user, they can move seamlessly across services and providers. Want to let a customer make a transaction with the credentials they used last week to open a digital account? Easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s checking identity for a crypto transaction, approving a loan, or verifying a remote signature, you can be confident the user is who they say they are– and that they’re the only one with access.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven powers fintech</p>
<p>Proven gives you the infrastructure to:</p>
 
 Onboard customers faster, with reusable credentials that prove identity, residency, income, or accreditation. 
 Prevent account takeovers, by enabling biometric-authenticated logins and transactions. 
 Comply with regulations, thanks to selective disclosure and audit trails for every credential use. 
 Create better UX, where users don’t repeat the same steps across your ecosystem. 
 Scale trust, by letting partners verify credentials you issue — or issue their own into your network 
 Manage AI, by giving your agents, chatbots, and digital assistants, verifiable identities for secure customer interaction and permissioned data access. 
 
<p>The bottom line</p>
<p>Indicio Proven isn’t just a new way to verify identity, it’s a new way to build digital trust — one that provides a common foundation for commercial, digital, corporate and decentralized banking and finance.</p>

<p>Delegation, especially in the digital world, spans every sector and silo you can think of, from personal issues to business needs. A caregiver needs to manage prescriptions for an incapacitated family member. An executive assistant files expense reports on behalf of a CEO. An AI agent moves money between your bank accounts, ideally without draining your savings in the process. Real life involves multiple actors, multiple roles, and a messy, shifting web of consent and authority.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, most of our digital systems still behave as if we’re playing a single-player game. Delegation, the ability for one party to act clearly and securely on behalf of another, is not a nice-to-have. It never really was; just ask anyone who had to get into someone else’s accounts after that someone else passed away. But agentic AI has turned what was treated as an edge case into a foundational requirement for how we live and interact online.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/03/delegation-part-one/">first post on delegation</a>, I wrote about why this matters. Now let’s consider what today’s technical foundations offer and why what we have today isn’t enough.</p>



 OAuth: Great for Authorization. Awkward for Delegation. 



<p>If you work anywhere near digital identity, you know <a href="https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2">OAuth 2.0</a> (I’d like directly to the spec, but there are <a href="https://self-issued.info/?p=2615">SO MANY SPECS</a> in the OAuth family. It’s crazypants.). OAuth 2.0 is the backbone of how we let one service act on behalf of a user. It’s how you click “Sign in with Google” or allow a fitness app to access your calendar.</p>



<p>For basic authorization, OAuth is brilliant. But for complex, human-centric delegation? Not so much.</p>



<p>In most OAuth implementations, delegation looks like “Alice-to-Alice” sharing. Alice authorizes a service, and when that service acts, it looks like Alice herself is taking the action. There’s no clear, auditable distinction between actions initiated directly by Alice and actions performed on her behalf.</p>



<p>When the stakes are low, that’s fine. When delegation needs to be explicit, limited, and verifiable, you know, in healthcare, finance, or enterprise environments, it starts to fall apart.</p>



 RFC 8693: Token Exchange – Helpful, but Not Plug-and-Play 



<p>There is important work happening inside OAuth to handle more sophisticated delegation patterns.</p>



<p>RFC 8693 (OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange) defines a way to trade one token for another. It creates the foundation for services acting “on behalf of” a user and enables more traceable chains of authorization.</p>



<p>This is real progress. It opens the door to:</p>



 
 Services that act as authorized intermediaries, 



 Audit trails that reflect delegated authority, 



 Clearer boundaries between who initiated which actions. 
 



<p>But it has its own issues.</p>



<p>As shared by engineers working with these standards today, RFC 8693 is a framework, not a turnkey solution. It’s incredibly useful if someone does the heavy work of designing the exact policies, constraints, and usage patterns that fit a specific environment.</p>



<p>There are no general-purpose, plug-and-play implementations. To put it another way, RFC 8693 gives you the ingredients. It doesn’t bake the gluten-and-dairy-free-but-still-tasty cake.</p>



 OAuth 2.1: Important Cleanup, Not a Delegation Revolution 



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1/">OAuth 2.1</a> is currently moving through the IETF process; that means it is still a draft, and you shouldn’t think of it as a stable specification. It consolidates best practices from OAuth 2.0 and improves security by:</p>



 
 Requiring Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for all clients, 



 Removing risky flows like the Implicit and Resource Owner Password Credentials grants, 



 Tightening rules around redirect URIs to prevent common attacks. 
 



<p>These are much-needed improvements to make OAuth deployments more secure and consistent.</p>



<p>However, OAuth 2.1 does not introduce major new delegation capabilities. If you were hoping for a seamless way to model multi-actor delegation as a standard feature, OAuth 2.1 will disappoint you. It’s a maintenance and modernization release, not a redesign of delegation models.</p>



 What’s Still Missing? 



<p>When people talk about “richer delegation models,” they are typically looking for capabilities that OAuth alone doesn’t fully deliver today:</p>



 
 Contextual constraints: Delegating narrowly, following the model of “only access this resource, only for this task, only during this window.” 



 Clear actor chains: Recording “Bob is acting for Alice” rather than obscuring delegation behind a generic authorization. 



 Lifecycle management: Ensuring delegation expires automatically when the situation changes (e.g., a role change or time limit). 



 Auditability: Maintaining reliable logs that show exactly who acted, when, and under what authority. 



 Transitivity control: Defining whether and how a delegated authority can be further delegated to others. 
 



<p>OAuth, with extensions like Token Exchange and Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), can enable some of this when carefully implemented. (Those last three words should fill you with trepidation, just sayin’.) But it doesn’t guarantee it, and it leaves much of the structure up to each deployment. (What could possibly go wrong?)</p>



<p>That gap matters, especially as systems get more complex, regulatory scrutiny increases, and agentic AI becomes more common.</p>



 Exploring Other Delegation Models 



<p>Recognizing these gaps, others in the identity community are exploring additional models beyond pure OAuth:</p>



 
 <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html">User-Managed Access (UMA)</a>: Built on top of OAuth 2.0, UMA allows resource owners to define fine-grained sharing policies. It offers strong concepts for delegation but has seen limited real-world adoption due to its complexity. 



 Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers (VCs and DIDs): These technologies allow an agent to present cryptographically verifiable proof of delegated authority. They are still maturing but hold significant promise for trusted delegation between humans, organizations, and AI agents. 



 Enterprise Mission Profiles: Some organizations are developing tailored delegation frameworks for specific industries, building on OAuth or PKI to meet regulated needs without relying on consumer-grade assumptions. 
 



<p>Each approach recognizes the same fundamental reality: digital systems must become much better at supporting explicit, constrained, auditable delegation.</p>



 Why I’m Writing About This 



<p>To be clear, I’m not one of the people writing these specifications. I’m not here to offer a new protocol or propose another working group. No, seriously, we do not need another working group. My goal is to build a bridge between people who have resources to throw at this problem and the groups working on the problem now. .</p>



<p>There is a growing group of implementers, architects, and security leads who are starting to notice the cracks:</p>



 
 Delegation models are messy. 



 AI agents are bumping into walls. 



 Critical systems are relying on brittle workarounds. 
 



<p>At the same time, important, thoughtful work is happening in standards bodies like the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/ekyc-ida/">OpenID Foundation</a> and the IETF to address delegation challenges, but those efforts aren’t widely understood yet.</p>



<p>If you’re feeling frustrated that “surely OAuth already handles this,” or worried that your project’s AI agent has no clean path to delegated authority, you’re not wrong.</p>



<p>The people working on these specs know there’s a gap. They’re working hard to close it. They are amazing. But building better delegation models will take time, feedback, and collaboration from across the industry, not just inside the standards track.</p>



 Delegation Isn’t Solved Yet, But It’s Solvable 



<p>Delegation today is a patchwork of partial solutions. But it doesn’t have to stay that way.</p>



<p>With better tools and more attention to what real-world delegation actually requires, we can build systems that reflect the complex, messy, multi-actor world we live in. It’s not going to change quickly, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be focusing our attention on fixing the problems. </p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00]<br>Welcome to A Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Why Are We Talking About Delegation Again? 



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Welcome back. Today, we’re revisiting the topic of delegation, but this time we’re diving into the technical side—what today’s systems offer, why it’s not enough, and where the real gaps lie.</p>



<p>[00:00:41]<br>If you’re familiar with OAuth, hang in for 30 seconds. If not, no worries—here’s the short version:</p>



<p>[00:00:50]<br>OAuth is a protocol that lets you authorize one service to access something you control without handing over your password.</p>



<p>[00:00:57]<br>It’s why you can “Sign in with Google” or allow a calendar app to sync your schedule—without giving up full control of your account.</p>



 



 OAuth: The Backbone of Modern Delegation 



<p>[00:01:04]<br>OAuth is the underlying plumbing for online access delegation. When it works well, it’s great. But when it falls short (and spoiler alert: it does), it results in messy workarounds and real security gaps.</p>



<p>[00:01:25]<br>Originally, digital systems were built around a clean model: one user, one identity, one device, one intent. And while that worked for about 80% of use cases, the remaining 20%—where delegation lives—takes the most effort to get right.</p>



 



 Real Life Is Messy: The Rise of Multi-Actor Systems 



<p>[00:01:47]<br>Fast forward to today: real life is messy, with overlapping authority and complex actors.</p>



<p>[00:02:00]<br>Think about it:</p>



 
 A caregiver managing a family member’s medical appointments 



 An executive assistant filing expenses for a CEO 



 An AI agent managing your bank accounts (ideally without buying a Tesla) 
 



<p>[00:02:15]<br>Delegation has never been a “nice-to-have” feature. It’s always been critical—just ask anyone who’s had to manage a deceased relative’s online accounts.</p>



<p>[00:02:25]<br>Now, with AI entering the picture, delegation has gone from edge case to foundational design problem—and most systems aren’t ready.</p>



 



 What OAuth Gets Right (and Where It Breaks) 



<p>[00:02:39]<br>OAuth 2.0 is well-known in identity circles. It’s a powerful authorization protocol, especially for simple use cases like:</p>



 
 Signing in with Google 



 Granting apps access to calendar or contacts 
 



<p>[00:03:17]<br>But for complex, human-centered delegation, things start to fall apart. Here’s what typically happens:</p>



 
 Alice authorizes a service 



 The service acts 



 Logs show Alice did it—even though it was the service 
 



<p>[00:03:41]<br>That’s okay when the stakes are low. But when it’s an AI agent booking travel, paying bills, or managing healthcare? Not so much.</p>



<p>[00:03:52]<br>You don’t want to give your AI or family member unlimited, untraceable access.</p>



<p>[00:04:03]<br>But you also don’t want it blocked at every turn. Systems need to recognize that it’s acting with limited, delegated authority.</p>



 



 The Need for Rich, Constrained Delegation 



<p>[00:04:12]<br>Without rich, constrained delegation, you either:</p>



 
 Grant too much access and lose control 



 Or block useful actions completely 
 



<p>[00:04:22]<br>Neither option is ideal. And OAuth—at least as widely implemented—wasn’t designed for this kind of nuanced delegation.</p>



 



 RFC 8693: Token Exchange to the Rescue? 



<p>[00:04:32]<br>OAuth isn’t standing still. One key development is RFC 8693—the token exchange spec. It enables services to act on a user’s behalf with audit trails and chains of authority.</p>



<p>[00:05:06]<br>Sounds promising, right?</p>



<p>[00:05:06]<br>But here’s the catch: RFC 8693 is a framework, not a turnkey solution. It gives you the ingredients, not the cake.</p>



<p>[00:05:31]<br>If your project assumes token exchange will “just work” for delegation—good luck. You’ll need to profile it properly, define scopes, and create policies tailored to your environment.</p>



 



 What About OAuth 2.1? 



<p>[00:05:40]<br>OAuth 2.1 is in the works. It tightens up security and standardizes key improvements:</p>



 
 PKCE is now mandatory 



 Risky flows (like resource owner passwords) are removed 



 Redirect rules are stricter 
 



<p>[00:06:13]<br>These are great changes. But let’s be clear: OAuth 2.1 is a maintenance release. It’s not a new model for delegation.</p>



 



 What We Actually Need for Delegation 



<p>[00:06:39]<br>When people say we need “richer” delegation, they mean:</p>



 
 Contextual constraints<br>(e.g., access this resource for this purpose within this timeframe) 



 Clear actor chains<br>(e.g., Bob is acting for Alice—and the system knows it) 



 Lifecycle management<br>(e.g., permissions expire automatically with role changes) 



 Auditability<br>(e.g., logs that track who did what, when, and on whose behalf) 



 Transitivity control<br>(e.g., delegate-of-a-delegate rules with tight boundaries) 
 



<p>[00:07:59]<br>Especially with AI, you may want a delegate (human or agent) to be able to re-delegate—but only for specific purposes and within strict limits.</p>



 



 The Problem with Current Systems 



<p>[00:08:08]<br>Without fine-grained control, delegation chains either collapse into chaos or simply don’t work.</p>



<p>And right now, very few systems—or standards—can handle controlled, conditional re-delegation well.</p>



 



 Other Delegation Models to Watch 



<p>[00:08:42]<br>Outside of OAuth, some promising models include:</p>



 
 User Managed Access (UMA)<br>Fine-grained sharing policies—but limited adoption 



 Verifiable Credentials &amp; DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)<br>Let agents cryptographically prove they’re authorized—but still maturing 



 Enterprise Mission Profiles<br>Customized frameworks tuned for high-compliance environments like banking 
 



<p>[00:09:31]<br>All of these agree on one thing: one user, one device, one intent no longer reflects the real world (if it ever did).</p>



 



 Why This Matters 



<p>[00:09:44]<br>I’m not writing OAuth specs, and I’m not proposing another working group (please, no more working groups).</p>



<p>[00:09:53]<br>What I am trying to do—through this podcast and blog—is build a bridge.</p>



<p>Because:</p>



 
 More architects and implementers are realizing delegation is messy 



 AI agents are bumping into walls 



 Critical systems are relying on brittle workarounds 
 



 



 So, Where Do We Go from Here? 



<p>[00:10:14]<br>Standards bodies like the OpenID Foundation and IETF are doing excellent, thoughtful work. But that work isn’t always widely understood or accessible.</p>



<p>[00:10:45]<br>If you’re frustrated that “surely OAuth handles this”—you’re not alone. It doesn’t. Yet.</p>



<p>[00:11:04]<br>Delegation isn’t solved—but it is solvable. With better tools and more attention to real-world needs, we can build systems that reflect the messy, beautiful, multi-actor world we live in.</p>



<p>And while it won’t happen overnight (hello, technical debt), it’s absolutely worth doing.</p>

By applying a risk-based approach and the right technology, you can refresh client records with precision, automate up to 90 percent of the process, and turn compliance into a competitive asset.</p>
 
 Why KYC Refresh Matters 
<p>A KYC refresh is the periodic process of reviewing and updating client information to ensure it reflects their current risk profile. It is not optional. Whether required by a regulatory cycle, triggered by a risk event, or prompted by a jurisdictional policy update, KYC refresh is now expected as part of any ongoing customer due diligence framework.</p>
<p>What used to be a back-office task has become a front-line control. It protects your institution against fraud, enforcement action, and reputational damage. But for too many firms, it still means a mess of emails, PDF forms, manual reviews, and irritated clients.</p>
 
 Common Pitfalls in Traditional KYC Refresh Workflows 
<p>Most firms still treat KYC refresh as a reactive checklist. This approach is slow, manual, and prone to error.</p>
 
 Data is pulled from outdated systems or spreadsheets 
 Customers are asked for information they have already provided 
 Compliance analysts must manually compare documents, validate changes, and log notes in isolated systems 
 Refresh cycles are static, not risk-based, meaning high-risk clients may go unchecked while low-risk clients are over-screened 
 There is no audit trail that links what was reviewed, when, by whom, and what changed 
 
<p>The result is poor visibility, increased regulatory exposure, and customer frustration.</p>
 
 A Better Model: Risk-Based and Automated 
<p>Leading firms are shifting from reactive reviews to proactive KYC refresh cycles. This means segmenting clients by risk and automating the work accordingly.</p>
 High-risk clients 
<p>Refresh most frequently or upon trigger events. Include document re-verification, new screening, updated risk assessments, and potential escalation to enhanced due diligence.</p>
 Medium-risk clients 
<p>Refresh regularly. Use automation to confirm key data, update watchlist screening, and verify continued activity alignment with stated business purpose.</p>
 Low-risk clients 
<p>Refresh less often or on auto-pilot via continuous monitoring. Use passive data checks, behaviour monitoring, and automated triggers to flag changes in risk exposure.</p>
 
 How to Implement a Modern KYC Refresh Strategy 
 1. Segment your customers by risk 
<p>Review your onboarding profiles and determine which customers are due for a refresh. Consider geography, industry, ownership complexity, transaction history, and past risk indicators.</p>
 2. Set triggers and schedules 
<p>Combine fixed intervals with dynamic events. Triggers can include address changes, document expiry, transaction anomalies, adverse media alerts, or policy shifts.</p>
 3. Automate outreach and collection 
<p>Use pre-filled digital forms, smart questionnaires, and self-service portals to request updated information. Eliminate the need for manual email follow-ups and one-size-fits-all templates.</p>
 4. Validate documents automatically 
<p>Use document authentication and biometric checks to verify IDs and ownership documents. Apply liveness checks and passive face match for returning users.</p>
 5. Refresh screening in real time 
<p>Screen updated profiles against sanctions, PEP lists, adverse media, and fraud databases. Record all hits and resolutions in an audit-ready format.</p>
 6. Maintain a continuous audit trail 
<p>Capture every action, update, and risk score adjustment. Your refresh process should be defensible, not just compliant.</p>

<p>“Have you ever thought, how facial ID recognition plays its crucial role in ID verification? No! Get ready! This blog post is going to be special for you.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this digital age, where digital security is paramount for all agencies, facial ID recognition has emerged as a cutting-edge solution for ID verification.</p>
<p>But here is a question often raised by many users: What is this? How is it shaping the future of ID verification?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog post is an answer to such questions. In this guide, we will have a detailed discussion on this topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read this content from start to end carefully….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Facial ID Recognition? 
<p>After hearing this term, you would have understood it. Facial ID recognition is an innovative biometric technology that analyzes the facial features of users. It utilizes AI, ML, and their sophisticated algorithms to verify whether and map the facial geometry, like the distance between your eyes, the shape of your jawline, and other facial features.</p>
<p>Here you would be thinking, how does this technology work? Don’t worry! The upcoming section is the answer to this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Facial ID Recognition Works? 
<p>In this section, we will discuss a step-by-step guide on how facial ID recognition works for <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">ID document liveness detection SDK</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: The system captures some images of users or scans their faces using a high-quality scanner.</p>
<p>Step 2: Software driven by AI identifies the facial features of users, like jawlines, distance between eyes, etc.</p>
<p>Step 3: Now, the system compares the scanned face with the database of images.</p>
<p>Step 4: Finally, the decision is made based on the similarity score. It ensures whether the fake ID scanner confirms the matches or not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Role of Facial ID Verification in Shaping the Future of ID Verification 
<p>Let’s uncover the cornerstone section of this blog, which is all about the role of facial ID recognition in shaping the future of fake ID verification.</p>
 1. Enhanced Security 
<p>After the arrival of facial ID recognition, users have eliminated their worries related to security during ID verification. As we have hinted earlier that this technology is driven by AI software.</p>
<p>So, this is the greatest benefit of this integration of AI and ML with this technology, that security has been increased from 10 to 1000.</p>
<p>How this technology further shows its magic will be discussed in the next headings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Frictionless User Experience 
<p>Those days have gone when old traditional methods of security like entering passwords, answering questions, and others were at their peak. These ways were undoubtedly time-consuming and boring.</p>
<p>However, technology has brought this innovative method of verification. This facial ID recognition is free of such tension of time and hassles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can verify the users’ and their documents’ realness or fakeness within a few minutes. Additionally, it always provides the system with accurate results. Such accuracy is not exclusive to humans. They can sometimes make some mistakes during verification. That’s really great…….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Spoofing Prevention &amp; Liveness Detection 
<p>We should be very thankful to AI and deep learning, which have provided us with an opportunity to differentiate between real faces and fake 3D images and videos. This is called facial liveness detection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two main types of face liveness detection play a crucial role in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Active livness detection: This type of facial liveness detection verifies whether the users have presented the real or fake ID documents and images to the system. They are said to perform some specific actions like blinking, head-moving, and others to identify whether the users are physically present or using fake identities.</p>
<p>Passive liveness detection: In this type, users are identified by their skin and facial features. Additionally, they are also identified through their blood flow.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Real-time Verification&nbsp; 
<p>We will ask a very simple question of you: Are security guards exclusive to real-time verification of criminals? Hoping!&nbsp; You will say, no!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is true! Humans can perform their duty for a specific time. Even sometimes, criminals can manipulate them during their duty time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, manipulating this technology is not child’s play. This whole system is driven by algorithms. Now you can understand the efficiency of a <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-verification-playground/">fake ID scanner</a> used by this system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we derive a formula for this technology, it is a combination of real-time, error-free, and accurate detection of theft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What About Our Service? 
<p>In this section, we will tell you about our new cutting-edge service.</p>
<p>After reading this role of facial ID recognition, many users ask, How to get it? How can we generate or get such algorithms to identify the theft? So, our service name is Recognito. Let’s give its brief overview.</p>

 Ocean Protocol Update ||&nbsp;2025  1. Introduction <p>Turns out if you spend all your time building, June sneaks up on you. And we wouldn’t have it any other way. 2025’s been moving fast, and so have we. Here’s what we’ve been building and where we’re headed&nbsp;next.</p><p>First things first, let’s start with what you already know: Ocean Protocol was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Over the years, we’ve built a versatile tech stack that combines AI and crypto, allowing secure, private, and decentralized data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>The past few months have been all about putting real tools into your hands, improving workflows, and setting the stage for what’s next. With the launch of the new <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OceanProtocol.ocean-protocol-vscode-extension">Ocean Nodes Visual Studio Code extension</a>, developers and data scientists can now run free compute-to-data jobs straight from their editor, with zero friction, for developing and testing. You can read more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/free-compute-to-data-with-ocean-nodes-vscode-extension-1f8385cb077c">here</a>.</p><p>Adoption of Ocean Nodes is growing steadily, and we’re starting to see more community-driven use cases emerge. On the enterprise side, Ocean Enterprise is progressing toward a production-ready launch. Meanwhile, we’re actively building on real-world applications and partnerships to make decentralized AI practical and usable — like the ones with <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-protocol-partners-with-netmind-as-the-first-gpu-provider-for-ocean-nodes-a63a858f9865">Netmind</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-protocol-x-aethir-to-expand-access-to-decentralized-compute-for-ai-builders-5dd143ffddad">Aethir</a>.</p><p>Let’s explore what else we’ve been building, and where we’re headed next in the second half of&nbsp;2025.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-node">Ocean Nodes</a>: This is the innovative solution our core team developed to democratize large models, decentralize them, and help monetize and protect IP. Since the launch on August 15, 2024, more than 1.4M nodes have been installed across over 73 countries, marking a significant leap toward decentralizing data computation.  <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Predictoor</a> has matured with enhanced models, dashboards, and insights, helping users discover pathways to profitability.  <a href="https://oceanenterprise.io/">Ocean Enterprise Collective</a>, an independent initiative, now unites 12 organizations spanning 8 countries and 9 industries, enabling businesses to leverage a fully compliant and secure version of Ocean Protocol.   2. Goals for&nbsp;2025 <p>In this update, we’ll break down our 2025 goals and highlight how they’ll enable you, whether you’re a data scientist, developer, enterprise, or crypto enthusiast, to innovate and&nbsp;thrive.</p> 2.1 From Predictoor baseline, make $&nbsp;trading <p>About Predictoor. In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. The “earn $” part is key, because it fosters&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Predictoor involves two groups of&nbsp;people:</p>  Predictoors: data scientists who use AI models to predict what the price of ETH, BTC, etc will be 5 (or 60) minutes into the future. The scientists run bots that submit these predictions onto the chain every 5 minutes. Predictoors earn $ based on sales of the feeds, including sales from Ocean’s Data Farming incentives program.  Traders: run bots that input predictoors’ aggregated predictions, to use as alpha in trading. It’s another edge for making $ while&nbsp;trading.  <p>Predictoor is built using the Ocean stack. And, it runs on <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Sapphire</a>; we’ve <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/success-in-ai-powered-prediction-bots-leads-to-ocean-oasis-partnership-e4e9f697c99a">partnered</a> with the Oasis&nbsp;team.</p><p>Predictoor traction. Since mainnet launch in October 2023, Predictoor has accumulated about $2B total volume. [Source: <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor?range-ha=all">DappRadar</a>].</p><p>2024 core goal review. Predictoor’s primary goal throughout 2024 was “traders to make serious $”. If that is met, then traders will spend $ to buy feeds; which leads to serious $ for predictoors. The Predictoor team worked towards this primary goal throughout 2024, testing trading strategies with real $. Bonus side effects of this were improved analytics and&nbsp;tooling.</p><p>2025 core goal. Obviously “make $ trading” is not an easy task. It’s a grind taking skill and perseverance. The team has ratcheted, inching ever-closer to making money. As of early 2025, the live trading algorithms are starting to bear fruit. The team will continue to grind, towards the goal “make serious $ trading”. We can expect this to be the main progress in Predictoor in 2025. Everything else in Predictoor will&nbsp;follow.</p><p>2025 bonus. We’re a few months into 2025. Our collaborators at Oasis have launched <a href="https://x.com/OasisProtocol/status/1918727259818795040">WT3</a>, a decentralized, verifiable trading agent that uses Predictoor feeds for its&nbsp;alpha.</p> 2.2 Launch Ocean Nodes&nbsp;C2D.2 <p>Since <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-ocean-nodes-decentralized-practical-solution-for-building-powerful-ai-c72fc6747165">launching Ocean Nodes in August</a>, nearly 1.4M nodes have been deployed globally, becoming the foundation of decentralized AI infrastructure.</p><p>What’s new in&nbsp;2025?</p>  Free Compute&nbsp;Jobs:    Developers can run test algorithms using limited runtime directly inside their development environment.  <p>2. VS Code Extension:</p>  This extension brings Compute-to-Data directly into VS Code, allowing users&nbsp;to:  Write and run algorithms on real&nbsp;datasets  Monitor job progress in real-time  Customize environments using Docker or private&nbsp;keys  Publish to the Ocean stack directly from their&nbsp;editor  <p>What’s next?</p><p>With Ocean Nodes C2D.2, we’re focused on making the platform even more intuitive and powerful.</p><p>Our vision is to support data scientists to easily write and monetize algorithms, allow businesses to quickly spin up and validate data-driven business cases, and enables developers to build dApps with minimal&nbsp;effort.</p><p>To achieve this goal, we are simultaneously focusing on three key initiatives:</p>  Redesigning the compute infrastructure  Grow our community of data scientists and engage them in using&nbsp;compute  Build real-world business cases on top of&nbsp;compute  <p>For b. and c. we will work in close collaboration with the community of data scientists that we built throughout the years with our data challenges.</p><p>The development plan</p><p>The end goal: to create a sustainable network of compute environments. To do this, we need users to have as little friction as possible before starting to build on top of the stack. Here’s how we’re doing&nbsp;it:</p>  Free Compute&nbsp;Jobs  Visual Studio Code Extension  Paid Compute Jobs: Now that the above is out, we are focused on the paid jobs. Whilst it may sound simple, the mechanisms are more complicated. Also, we are introducing a new payment model that is more flexible and based on the time it takes to&nbsp;compute.  Configurable Nodes: Node owners can enable or disable specific functionalities, such as free environments tied to incentives.  Multistage Compute: Manage complex AI pipelines seamlessly  <p>All these new functionalities will be included in the Visual Studio Code extension, so make sure to download that and get yourself familiar with it before the next&nbsp;updates.</p><p>The end goal is to facilitate the creation of models. For this, we need to integrate GPUs. Together with the data scientist community, we will create easy and intuitive flows to train models and provide ways for inference on created&nbsp;models.</p><p>While the features keep rolling out we will also keep working on creating relevant analytics for the network of nodes and improving the nodes dashboard.</p> Expanding Ocean Nodes Through Strategic Partnerships <p>In 2025, Ocean Protocol has formed key partnerships to enhance the capabilities of Ocean&nbsp;Nodes:</p>  NetMind AI: As the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-partners-with-netmind-as-the-first-gpu-provider-for-ocean-nodes-a63a858f9865">first external GPU provider for Ocean Nodes</a>, NetMind contributes nearly 2,000 high-performance GPUs. This collaboration empowers developers and data scientists to train and scale AI models more efficiently within the decentralized ecosystem.  Aethir: Aethir brings its decentralized cloud computing infrastructure to the Ocean Nodes network. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-x-aethir-to-expand-access-to-decentralized-compute-for-ai-builders-5dd143ffddad">This integration</a> provides AI developers with scalable and cost-effective resources to build, scale, and deploy AI models, further advancing the decentralized AI landscape.  <p>These partnerships significantly bolster the Ocean Nodes infrastructure, offering enhanced computational power and scalability for AI development within the Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p> 3. <a href="https://oceanenterprise.io/">Ocean Enterprise</a> <p>What is Ocean Enterprise?</p><p>Ocean Enterprise is a free open-source enterprise-ready data ecosystem software solution that enables companies and public institutions to securely manage and monetize proprietary AI &amp; data products and services in a trusted and compliant environment.</p><p>What is the goal for&nbsp;2025?</p><p>After extensive design and development in close collaboration with the business community, Ocean Enterprise v1 (OE v1) will be released in Q3 2025. Powered by Ocean Node, OEv1 is meant to be used by companies that are looking to turn digital goods into profits and leverage the exciting new capabilities of compute-to-data in a compliant enterprise offering.</p><p>OE v1 is designed to ensure compliance with the most recent EU data regulations and comes with features dedicated to enterprise use cases.

  Beneficial ownership discovery doesn’t need to be slow or manual. This article explores how firms can use advanced KYB software to comply with UBO requirements from AUSTRAC, FCA, FinCEN, and the EU AMLA - while improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Global regulators including AUSTRAC, FCA, FINRA, FinCEN, and the EU’s AMLA are tightening Know Your Business (KYB) and Ultimate Beneficial Ownership (UBO) rules. Legacy methods for identifying and verifying UBOs are too slow, too manual, and too risky. But with the right systems, UBO discovery can become a competitive advantage. KYB compliance software enables firms to reduce onboarding times, increase customer satisfaction, and slash manual effort by 90 percent – all while exceeding the regulatory bar.</p>
 
 The Shift Toward Verified Ownership 
<p>Firms today face growing pressure to not just know their clients but to understand who ultimately owns or controls them. UBO identification is no longer a tick-box exercise. It’s central to anti-money laundering obligations, reputational risk management, and trust in the global financial system. Whether you’re operating in the UK, EU, US, or Australia, regulators are demanding more transparency, faster disclosures, and ongoing oversight of ownership structures.</p>
 
 Regulatory Expectations Are Clear – and Increasing 
 
 
<p>AUSTRAC mandates that reporting entities identify and verify the ultimate beneficial owners of customers, particularly for higher-risk customers and complex structures.</p>
 
 
<p>FCA requires that firms identify and verify UBOs of corporate customers and understand control mechanisms, including voting rights and indirect influence.</p>
 
 
<p>FINRA enforces Customer Due Diligence (CDD) rules, requiring firms to identify the natural persons who own or control legal entity customers.</p>
 
 
<p>FinCEN has implemented the Corporate Transparency Act, mandating detailed beneficial ownership reporting for nearly all corporations, LLCs, and similar entities in the United States.</p>
 
 
<p>EU AMLA legislation sets consistent rules across member states, including central UBO registers and tighter requirements for verifying cross-border ownership chains.</p>
 
 
<p>The message is consistent: firms must discover and document beneficial owners with precision and speed. Excuses tied to complexity or resource constraints are no longer acceptable.</p>
 
 The Problem: Manual Processes Can’t Keep Up 
<p>Most compliance teams still rely on a tangled mix of email chains, spreadsheets, static PDF forms, and fragmented data vendors to complete UBO discovery. These methods result in:</p>
 
 Days or weeks to onboard complex corporate structures 
 Inconsistent data that can’t withstand audits or enforcement scrutiny 
 Frustrated clients who feel like they’re doing your job for you 
 
 
 A Better Approach: Automate, Map, Monitor 
<p>Firms that invest in purpose-built KYB platforms gain far more than just efficiency. With the right technology, UBO discovery becomes a competitive differentiator.</p>
 1. Gain a Competitive Advantage 
<p>Fast onboarding isn’t just nice to have – it’s critical to your success. When your competitors take days to review complex structures, and you deliver decisions in minutes, you win more deals in less time. That’s the bottom line. Rapid UBO discovery across jurisdictions creates momentum for sales, onboarding, and operations. You reduce friction and show clients that you are serious about compliance without making them feel punished by it.</p>
 2. Increase Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty 
<p>Clients don’t want to feel like suspects. Repeated document requests and contradictory forms make onboarding feel adversarial. Automating document collection and verification helps you engage clients with clarity, consistency, and confidence. That’s not just better service – it’s brand protection. Happy clients are loyal clients. Loyal clients refer business.</p>
 3. Reduce Manual Work by 90 Percent 
<p>When your KYB system collects, enriches, and monitors beneficial ownership information in real time, your team stops firefighting and starts delivering value. Automated workflows replace redundant data entry. Smart questionnaires adapt to risk. Alerts notify your analysts when something changes, instead of expecting them to spot it manually. The result is a smarter team with more time to focus on high-value work.</p>
 
 iComply’s KYB Compliance Software: Built for Beneficial Ownership 
<p>iComply’s KYB platform is designed to accelerate and secure UBO discovery at scale:</p>
 
 
<p>Automated document collection and prefilled forms</p>
 
 
<p>Intelligent UBO mapping, linking, and monitoring</p>
 
 
<p>Sanctions, PEP, and adverse media screening for all related parties</p>
 
 
<p>Ongoing monitoring and refresh cycles based on your risk triggers</p>
 
 
<p>Audit-ready reporting in a single click</p>
 
 
<p>All sensitive user data is processed at the edge – on the user’s device – ensuring compliance with data residency, GDPR, and privacy laws no matter which jurisdiction they are in at the time of verification. One platform. No vendor sprawl. No surprises.</p>
 
 Where the Market Is Going 
<p>Most firms see KYB and UBO checks as a cost centre. That mindset is obsolete. Regulators now expect beneficial ownership transparency as a condition of market access. Banks, PSPs, and law firms will increasingly be judged by how well they identify and assess their clients’ true owners. That means compliance teams who adopt automation early will not only survive – they’ll bring their firms into the lead.</p>
<p>You don’t need more forms. You don’t need more emails. You need a system that does the work for you. Accelerating UBO discovery isn’t about cutting corners. It’s about building trust, faster. With iComply, you can meet global KYB requirements, onboard clients with confidence, and leave manual ownership checks behind—for good.</p>
<p>Start your free trial. Automate beneficial ownership. Take control.</p>

<p>The FBI is urging all iPhone and Android users to be alert to an insidious <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/23/iphone-android-users-bombarded-by-chinese-attack-do-not-ignore-fbi-warning/">toll fee texting scam</a> from China widely <a href="https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q4_2024.pdf">regarded</a> as “an infrastructural attack on our phones, not a single campaign.”</p>



<p>It follows an urgent FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warning in December 2024 <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/nx-s1-5223490/text-messaging-security-fbi-chinese-hackers-security-encryption#:~:text=But%20the%20agency's%20urgent%20message,of%20Americans%20use%20every%20day.">to stop sending texts messages</a> over unsecured networks and use encrypted messaging and calling systems instead.</p>



<p>The agencies warn texting between Android phones and iPhones is vulnerable (iPhone to iPhone and Android to Android is <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/fbi-iphone-android-texting-insecure/">reportedly safe</a>) due to “Chinese hacking of U.S. networks that is reportedly ‘ongoing and likely larger in scale than previously understood.’”</p>



<p>Encrypted channels are considered the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/nx-s1-5223490/text-messaging-security-fbi-chinese-hackers-security-encryption">best defense</a> against these attacks.</p>



<p>“Encryption is your friend” for texts and phone calls, Jeff Greene, CISA’s executive assistant director for cybersecurity, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/17/nx-s1-5223490/text-messaging-security-fbi-chinese-hackers-security-encryption">told NPR</a>. “Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible, if not really hard, for them to detect it. So our advice is to try to avoid using plain text.”</p>

<p>Toll smishing texts are rapidly spreading across America</p>



<p>The recent spate of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/smishing">smishing</a> texts are claiming an unpaid toll of $6.99 but are really designed to steal the recipient’s credit card and identity.</p>



<p>The Anti-Phishing Working Group (<a href="https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q4_2024.pdf">APWG) says</a> the attackers are&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Unit42-timely-threat-intel/blob/main/2025-03-06-IOCs-for-smishing-activity.txt">registering tens of thousands of domains</a>&nbsp;to mimic state and city toll agencies and attract clicks. They’re also making similar-looking text message <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/23/iphone-android-users-bombarded-by-chinese-attack-do-not-ignore-fbi-warning/">using</a> “an upgraded phishing kit sold in China, which makes it simple to send text messages and launch phishing sites that spoof toll road operators in multiple U.S. states.”</p>



<p>The toll smishing attacks are rapidly spreading “<a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA240412">from state to state</a>.” The FBI is urging people to delete the texts immediately.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/23/iphone-android-users-bombarded-by-chinese-attack-do-not-ignore-fbi-warning/">Authorities</a> are reminding Americans that “legitimate agencies usually send invoices via official mail, not random emails or texts.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/23/iphone-android-users-bombarded-by-chinese-attack-do-not-ignore-fbi-warning/">Learn more</a> about the toll smishing attacks. If you receive a toll smishing text, the FBI advises you to:</p>



 
 File a complaint with the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">Internet Crime Complete Centre</a> (IC3). Be sure to include:
 
 The phone number from where the text originated 



 The website listed within the text. 
 
 



 Check your account using the toll service’s legitimate website. 



 Contact the toll service’s customer service phone number. 



 Delete any smishing texts you receive. 
 



<p>You can also report toll scams to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov or your local consumer protection agency.</p>



<p>Spam texts are on the rise</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.robokiller.com/spam-text-insights">Robokiller</a>, more than 19 billion spam texts were sent in the U.S. in February alone.</p>



<p>Always be alert to the possibility of scams texts and emails and NEVER CLICK THE LINK OR GIVE YOUR INFORMATION. If you think the content of the message might be correct, go straight to the company’s legitimate website (e.g. your toll service’s website) and log into your account to check.</p>



<p>If you think you’ve been scammed, check your accounts and change your passwords even if you haven’t made a payment to the scammers. Dispute any unfamiliar charges on your accounts.</p>



<p>Remember, legitimate agencies will communicate with you about unpaid tolls through official post and not via texts and emails.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q4_2024.pdf">APWG</a> says people receiving any sort of scam text can “help update alerting/blocking mechanisms that protect billions of devices and software clients worldwide” by reporting the texts to the FBI’s IC3.gov or directly to them at apwg.org/sms.</p>



<p>MySudo can protect you from smishing and phishing attacks</p>



<p>Sick of scammers? Fight back with MySudo.</p>



<p>First, <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/#mysudo-dl">download MySudo</a> for iOS or Android.</p>



<p>Then, set up a dedicated “Car Bills” <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo digital identity</a> within MySudo, and use it specifically for opening and paying tolls and all other car-related services you want to include.</p>



<p>Only ever use your “Car Bills Sudo” <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email address</a> when communicating with and logging into these services. Do not use your personal phone or email.</p>



<p>If a suspected smishing text about an outstanding toll or any other supposed debt comes into any other Sudo (you can have 9 Sudos, depending on your <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">plan</a>) or to your personal phone number, then you will know it’s a scam and delete it.</p>



<p>If a text about a toll comes into your official “Car Bills Sudo” you’re more likely to consider whether it’s from the legitimate service provider and not a scammer. But still stay vigilant and check with the legitimate service provider, remembering they’re more likely to contact you by official mail. If the message turns out to be a scam, you can either:</p>



 
 Ignore it, or 



 Block the scammer’s number, or 



 Reset your “Car Bills” Sudo phone number, or 



 Delete the “Car Bills Sudo” altogether and cut off the scammers. They won’t be able to reach you again. 
 



<p>Go one powerful step further by always using the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">MySudo virtual card</a> within your dedicated “Car Bills Sudo” to pay your toll account and any other car-related bills. That way, even if you fall victim to a scam, the scammer does not have your personal credit card. They have your Sudo virtual card, which you can <a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042727394-Can-I-permanently-delete-a-virtual-card-from-my-MySudo-account">easily cancel or close</a> and move on.</p>



<p>The data protection strategy behind MySudo is called <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">compartmentalization</a>.</p>

<p>For passionate football fans, catching live matches without subscription fees is key. In 2025, navigating free streaming options can be tricky, with varying quality and reliability. This guide cuts through the noise, presenting the Top 10 Websites to Watch Football for Free, ensuring you find stable, high-quality streams for all your favorite leagues and never miss a goal this year.</p>



 Introduction To Top Websites To Watch Football For Free 



<p>For football fans, watching live matches is essential, but high subscription costs can be a barrier. Thankfully, many platforms let you watch football for free. However, quality, stability, and safety vary greatly. This guide will introduce you to the top websites to watch football for free, helping you find reliable streams for major leagues and enjoy every game without cost, while also ensuring a smooth and safe viewing experience.</p>









 Why You Should Watch Football for Free Online? 



<p>In 2025, the appeal of<a href="https://blog.herond.org/top-5-free-streaming-sites-for-movies-tv-and-more/"> watching football for free online</a> is stronger than ever. With rising subscription costs for traditional TV channels, free streaming offers a convenient and accessible alternative. It breaks down financial barriers, allowing every fan to catch live matches from top leagues and tournaments globally, right from their device. This method ensures you never miss a moment of the action, providing unparalleled flexibility and cost savings for truly passionate supporters.</p>



 Cost Savings 



<p>One of the most compelling reasons to watch football for free online is the significant cost savings it offers. In an era where cable television packages and premium sports subscriptions can run into hundreds of dollars annually, free streaming platforms eliminate this financial burden. This allows passionate fans to avoid expensive monthly fees, redirecting those savings to other priorities or simply enjoying the sport without the added economic pressure, making top-tier football accessible to everyone.</p>



 Accessibility 



<p>Beyond financial benefits, watching football online for free provides unparalleled accessibility. You are no longer confined to a living room TV; instead, you can catch every thrilling moment of a match on various devices, including your phone, laptop, or smart TV, from anywhere with an internet connection. Whether you’re commuting, traveling, or simply away from your main screen, this flexibility ensures you never miss a crucial goal or a game-changing tackle, fitting seamlessly into your modern lifestyle.</p>


 
 


 Variety 



<p>Free online football streaming truly shines in its variety of content. Unlike traditional local TV channels that often only secure broadcasting rights for a limited number of major leagues, these online platforms typically provide access to a vast array of global leagues and tournaments. This means you can follow not just the Premier League or Champions League, but also niche competitions, less-publicized domestic leagues from around the world, or even youth and women’s football, expanding your horizons as a true football connoisseur.</p>



 Flexibility 



<p>Finally, the flexibility offered by free online football streaming is a huge draw for modern fans. These platforms often provide more than just live streams; many offer options for watching highlights shortly after matches or even full replays if you miss a game. This freedom from fixed schedules and without long-term commitments allows you to consume football content on your terms, fitting it into your busy life and ensuring you can catch up on all the action at your convenience.</p>



 Criteria for Choosing the Top Websites To Watch Football For Free 



<p>With countless options promising free football streams, finding truly reliable and safe websites is crucial for an uninterrupted viewing experience. Not all free platforms are created equal; many come with frustrating issues like excessive ads, poor quality, or even security risks. To genuinely enjoy every goal and thrilling moment without compromise, it’s essential to understand the key criteria for choosing the top free football streaming websites.</p>



 Legality 



<p>When seeking to watch football for free online, prioritizing legality is paramount to avoid potential risks. The best platforms either host content with official broadcast rights or provide links to legal, publicly available streams. While entirely free, completely legal sources for major commercial leagues are rare, discerning users should look for signs of legitimacy, such as clear disclaimers, professional website design, and minimal redirects. Opting for sites that respect intellectual property helps you enjoy the game without contributing to piracy, safeguarding yourself from legal issues or malware often associated with illicit streaming.</p>



 Stream Quality 



<p>A crucial factor for an enjoyable viewing experience is stream quality. Top free football streaming websites should deliver high-definition (HD) streams as a standard, ensuring sharp visuals and clear details of the game. Equally important is minimal buffering or lag, allowing for smooth, uninterrupted viewing of fast-paced action. While achieving perfect stability can be challenging for free services, the best platforms invest in robust servers and efficient content delivery networks to provide a consistent, high-quality picture that truly captures the excitement of live football.</p>









 Safety 



<p>Safety is a non-negotiable criterion when choosing free streaming platforms. Reputable websites should be free from malware, excessive and intrusive ads, or phishing risks that could compromise your device or personal information. Be wary of sites demanding suspicious downloads, displaying an overwhelming number of pop-ups, or redirecting you to unfamiliar pages. Prioritizing platforms that demonstrate a commitment to user safety, often indicated by an “https://” URL and a clean, trustworthy interface, is essential for a worry-free football viewing experience.</p>



 User Experience 



<p>A seamless user experience significantly enhances the pleasure of watching football online. The best free streaming websites feature easy-to-navigate interfaces, allowing you to quickly find matches, browse schedules, and access streams without frustration. Mobile compatibility is also vital, ensuring a smooth experience whether you’re watching on a phone, tablet, or smart TV.</p>



 Availability 



<p>Finally, availability plays a key role in accessibility. The top free football streaming websites should either be accessible globally or provide clear information and workarounds for geo-restrictions. This ensures that fans, regardless of their geographical location, can tune into their desired matches. Websites that consistently offer live links for a wide range of international and local tournaments demonstrate superior availability, ensuring you can follow your favorite teams and leagues from anywhere in the world.</p>



 Top 10 Websites to Watch Football for Free in 2025 



<p>For passionate football fans, catching live matches without subscription fees is key. In 2025, navigating free streaming options can be tricky, with varying quality and reliability. Here are your top 10 <a href="https://blog.herond.org/top-5-free-private-browsers-that-protect-your-privacy-in-2024/">websites to watch football for free</a> in 2025.</p>



 Live Soccer TV 



<p>Live Soccer TV is a highly comprehensive and reliable platform that serves as an essential guide for football fans worldwide. While it primarily acts as a scheduling hub, it offers detailed information on where to watch matches, including links to official streams and legal broadcasters across a vast array of global leagues and tournaments. Its key advantage lies in its legality and extensive coverage, encompassing both major and niche leagues, all without requiring any user registration. The main consideration is that it mostly redirects users to other platforms rather than hosting direct streams, meaning the ultimate viewing experience depends on the linked service. To use it, simply visit livesoccertv.com to find upcoming match schedules and discover where to access the streams.</p>



 YouTube (Official Channels) 



<p>For a legitimate and high-quality viewing experience, <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube’s official channels</a> from leagues or individual teams are an excellent resource for football content. Many official entities offer free live streams for select matches, particularly youth leagues, pre-season games, or specific tournament stages, alongside a wealth of high-quality highlights, replays, and behind-the-scenes content. The main benefits include guaranteed legality and superior stream quality. However, not all matches are broadcast live, and availability can vary significantly by region due to geo-restrictions. Users can search directly for official league or team channels on YouTube, and a reliable VPN might be necessary to access geo-restricted content.</p>


 
 


 Pluto TV 



<p>Pluto TV stands out as a popular free, ad-supported streaming service that includes dedicated sports channels relevant to football enthusiasts. Channels like beIN Sports Xtra and Fox Sports (though content can vary by region) occasionally offer live football matches but are more commonly known for providing football highlights, replays, analysis, and sports-related documentaries. Its main pros include being completely free with no signup required and wide support across multiple devices. Access is straightforward: visit pluto.tv on your web browser or download its dedicated app.</p>


 
 


 Tubi 



<p>Tubi is another significant player in the free, ad-supported streaming market, offering a variety of content that includes sports channels like Fox Sports. For football fans, this means access to football highlights, replays of past games, and occasional live events, though the emphasis is more on curated sports content rather than extensive live match schedules. Tubi is a legal platform that does not require an account, making it highly accessible. It’s also very mobile-friendly, offering a seamless experience on smartphones and tablets. The main con is its limited live match availability, often focusing more on replays and football documentaries. To use Tubi, simply visit tubitv.com or download the app on your preferred device.</p>









 BBC iPlayer (UK only) 



<p>For football fans residing in the UK, or those with a reliable UK VPN, BBC iPlayer is a premier legal and free platform. It offers free live football streams for select matches, particularly those involving the UK national teams, FA Cup ties, or specific Premier League games if the BBC holds broadcasting rights. Its major advantages are high-quality, legal, and ad-free viewing for users within the United Kingdom. The significant limitation is its strict geo-restriction to the UK, and users also typically require a valid UK TV license to access its full content. To use it, access bbc.co.uk/iplayer, ensuring your IP address is registered as being within the UK, potentially via a VPN.</p>







 SportRAR 



<p>SportRAR is a well-known aggregator that compiles free streams for football and a wide array of other sports. It’s particularly popular for providing access to streams for major leagues globally. However, like many free aggregators, some links may be unreliable, leading to broken streams or constant buffering. Users should also be prepared for potential ad issues, though often manageable. To use it, visit sportrar.tv and cautiously select the football streams that appear to be most stable.</p>









 Footybite 



<p>Footybite is a platform specifically tailored for football fans, making it a go-to destination for many seeking free streams. It offers an extensive selection of free live streams and highlights for various global tournaments and leagues. A significant advantage is its dedicated focus on football, often providing multiple stream links for a single match, allowing users to choose the most stable option. However, users should exercise caution as some links may lead to unofficial sources or sites with intrusive advertising. The general usage involves accessing Footybite and checking for active streams for upcoming or live matches.</p>


 
 


 Social442 TV 



<p>Social442 TV positions itself as a football-centric community and streaming site, offering live streams, highlights, and analysis for a variety of leagues. Its strength lies in its dedicated focus on football and its community-driven aspect, which can provide a richer experience for fans. However, accessing its content typically requires account creation, which might be a barrier for some users seeking instant access. Additionally, as with many free streaming platforms, the stability of some streams may vary, especially during peak viewing times. To utilize its features, users need to sign up at social442.com for access.</p>


 
 


 Red Bull TV 



<p>Red Bull TV is a high-quality streaming platform primarily known for extreme sports, but it also offers free streams for select football events. These often include niche tournaments, youth football championships, or unique football-related documentaries sponsored by Red Bull. Its advantages include no signup requirement, consistently high-quality streams, and broad multi-device support. The main drawback for dedicated football fans is its limited football coverage, as its primary focus remains on action and extreme sports. Users can visit redbull.tv to check for any available football streams, which are typically well-produced.</p>

<p>Facebook Video has become an unexpected platform for watching football for free, particularly for user-generated content and streams from smaller leagues or local tournaments. Both individual users and pages (including some official ones from smaller clubs or regional associations) may feature live streams for football matches. Its main pros are being completely free and highly accessible with a standard Facebook account. However, inconsistent stream quality is a significant drawback, as it relies heavily on the uploader’s connection and equipment. Official content from major leagues is also quite limited. Users can find streams by searching for “live football” or specific match names on <a href="https://facebook.com/watch">facebook.com/watch</a>.</p>









 Tips for Safe and Smooth Websites to Watch Football for Free 



<p>Here are the key tips to consider:</p>



 Use a Reliable VPN 



<p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is your best friend when watching football for free online. A VPN encrypts your internet connection, hiding your IP address and making your online activity private. This is crucial for two reasons:</p>



 
 Bypassing Geo-Restrictions: Many free (and even some legal) streams are limited to specific countries. A VPN allows you to connect to a server in a different country, making it appear as if you’re browsing from there, thus unlocking geo-restricted content. 



 Enhanced Security: Free streaming sites can sometimes be malicious or riddled with trackers. A VPN adds a layer of security, protecting your data from potential threats and preventing third parties from monitoring your streaming habits. Choose reputable VPN services like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or Surfshark for optimal performance and security. 
 



 Employ an Ad Blocker 



<p>One of the most common frustrations with websites to watch football for free is the sheer volume of intrusive advertisements, including pop-ups, pop-unders, and auto-playing video ads. These not only disrupt your viewing but can also be a source of malware. Installing a robust ad blocker (like Herond Shield of Herond Browser, AdBlock Plus, or AdGuard) as a browser extension is highly recommended. This will significantly reduce the number of ads, improve page loading times, and create a much smoother, safer viewing environment. Some browsers like Herond Browser have built-in ad blockers.</p>



 Maintain a Strong Internet Connection 



<p>A fast and stable internet connection is fundamental for websites to watch football for free with minimal buffering. For HD quality, aim for a minimum download speed of 5-10 Mbps, with higher speeds (25 Mbps+) being ideal for Full HD or 4K.</p>



<p>Check Your Speed</p>



<p>Regularly run an internet speed test to ensure you’re getting the promised bandwidth from your provider.</p>



<p>Wired Connection</p>



<p>If possible, use an Ethernet cable to connect your device directly to your router. This provides a more stable and faster connection than Wi-Fi.</p>



<p>Reduce Network Congestion</p>



<p>During streaming, close unnecessary tabs, applications, and background downloads on your device and other devices connected to your network.</p>









 Keep Your Software Updated 



<p>Ensure your operating system, web browser, and any streaming apps are always up-to-date. Software updates often include security patches and performance improvements that can prevent vulnerabilities and enhance streaming quality. Outdated software can be a gateway for malware and lead to compatibility issues that cause buffering or crashes.</p>



 Be Wary of Suspicious Links and Downloads 



<p>Free streaming sites, especially aggregators, can sometimes redirect you to unknown or malicious pages.</p>



<p>Look for HTTPS</p>



<p>Always check that the website’s URL begins with “https://” (indicating a secure connection) rather than just “http://”.</p>



<p>Avoid Unknown Downloads</p>



<p>Never download any software, plugins, or executables prompted by a streaming site unless you are sure of its legitimacy. These are common vectors for malware.</p>



<p>Close Pop-ups Safely</p>



<p>If a pop-up appears, try to close it using the small “x” button on the pop-up itself, rather than clicking anywhere else on the screen, which could activate a malicious link.</p>



 Consider Browser Choice 



<p>Some browsers are inherently more privacy-focused or offer better performance. <a href="https://blog.herond.org/what-is-herond-browser/">Herond Browser</a>, for instance, has a built-in ad blocker and prioritizes privacy. Using a browser with good security and performance features can naturally contribute to a safer and smoother streaming experience.</p>



<p>By implementing these tips, you can significantly enhance your experience of watching football for free online, enjoying every moment of the game with peace of mind and minimal interruptions.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>By understanding the importance of legality, stream quality, safety, user experience, and availability, you can confidently choose platforms that deliver the matches you want, without the hidden costs or risks. Remember to leverage tools like VPNs and ad blockers for enhanced security and a smoother viewing experience.</p>



<p>Whether you prefer official highlights on YouTube, legal ad-supported streams from Pluto TV, or carefully vetted aggregators, the power to choose websites to watch football for free is truly at your fingertips. Embrace these resources and tips, and prepare to enjoy every thrilling moment of the beautiful game throughout 2025, without missing a single kick.</p>

<p>Ethereum’s switch to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system has totally changed how people can get involved in keeping the network secure and running smoothly. By staking your ETH, you’re not just helping secure the Ethereum blockchain – you’re also earning passive income! With more platforms supporting Ethereum Proof of Stake than ever before, it’s easier for investors to stake their ETH safely and effectively. In this blog, we’ll dive into the top five platforms that make Ethereum Proof of Stake simple, rewarding, and beginner-friendly.</p>



 What is Ethereum Staking? 



<p>Ethereum staking is a way to earn rewards by helping keep the Ethereum network secure. It involves locking up your ETH to support transaction validation and network security. In return, participants, called validators, earn rewards for their role in maintaining the blockchain.</p>



<p>This system started after Ethereum upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model during the Ethereum Merge. Instead of using energy-heavy mining, the network now selects validators to confirm transactions based on how much ETH they have staked. This shift makes the network more energy-efficient and secure. However, validators must act responsibly—any dishonest behavior can result in penalties or loss of funds.</p>









<p>For everyday users, staking offers a way to earn passive income without needing to trade actively. By staking ETH through trusted platforms, users can contribute to the network and grow their holdings over time. However, it’s important to choose a secure staking method to protect your investment.</p>



 How Does Ethereum Staking Work? 



<p>Ethereum staking allows you to earn rewards by locking up your ETH to support the network’s security and operations. To become a validator, you need to stake at least 32 ETH, which enables you to propose and confirm new transaction blocks. This role comes with rewards but also carries risks; dishonest actions can lead to penalties, including slashing, where a portion of your staked ETH is forfeited.</p>



<p>If you don’t have 32 ETH or prefer not to manage a validator node, staking pools offer an accessible alternative. These platforms allow you to stake smaller amounts by pooling your ETH with others. The platform manages the technical aspects, and you earn rewards proportional to your contribution, minus any service fees.</p>







<p>Staking rewards can vary based on network activity and the total amount of ETH staked. On average, annual returns range from 4% to 7%. By staking your ETH, you’re not only earning passive income but also contributing to the security and scalability of the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>Every time you open a web browser, you’re inviting a whole host of third parties—advertisers, websites, ISPs, and even government agencies – to track your every move. But what if you didn’t have to accept that as the status quo? What if there were browsers specifically designed to protect your data and safeguard your privacy while still delivering fast, reliable performance? In this guide, we’ll explore the top browsers that offer an unmatched balance of speed and security, helping you take back control of your online experience.</p>



 5 Elements of a Secure Browser You Should Look For 



<p>Before we dive into the best browsers, let’s take a moment to understand the key features that make a browser truly secure. Here’s what you should be looking for when making a decision about which browser to use:</p>



 
 Encryption: A secure browser ensures that your connection is encrypted, which means that even if hackers try to intercept your data, they won’t be able to read it. Without encryption, you’re leaving your data wide open for theft. 



 Privacy Features: The best browsers go beyond simply offering incognito modes. They actively block third-party trackers and cookies, preventing advertisers from following your every click. Privacy-first browsers also minimize the data they collect, ensuring your browsing history remains private. 
 









 
 Frequent Updates: Security is an ongoing battle. That’s why a good browser will update frequently to patch vulnerabilities and keep hackers at bay. Frequent updates ensure that the latest threats don’t compromise your browsing experience. 



 Sandboxing: A powerful security feature that isolates web pages from one another, preventing malicious websites from compromising the rest of your system. In simple terms, it keeps potential threats confined, so they can’t reach your personal files or sensitive data. 



 Anti-Phishing &amp; Malware Protection: The best browsers automatically block phishing attempts and harmful websites. This feature adds an additional layer of protection by preventing you from accidentally visiting sites that could steal your personal information or infect your device with malware. 
 



<p>With these elements in mind, let’s explore the browsers that stand out in terms of speed, security, and functionality.</p>



 Top 10 Fast, Secure, and Best Web Browsers to Use 



<p>If you’re still relying on the default browser that came with your device, it might be time for an upgrade. Here’s a list of the top browsers that provide the perfect mix of speed, privacy, and security:</p>



 Herond Browser 



<p>Herond Browser sets itself apart in the crowded world of web browsers. It’s not just fast—it’s built for the future, offering top-tier security, blazing performance, and Web 3.0 integration, all in one package.</p>



 Unmatched Privacy and Security 



<p>At its core, Herond prioritizes privacy. With the Herond Shield, it blocks ads, trackers, and harmful websites. SSL certificates secure your connection, while Tor integration (coming soon) will add even more layers of protection. Plus, the Advanced Security Alert System (ASAS) keeps you one step ahead of online threats, making it a truly secure option for privacy-conscious users.</p>







 Seamless Web 3.0 Integration 



<p>Herond is ahead of the curve in the Web 3.0 revolution. It seamlessly integrates with Herond Wallet for decentralized digital asset management, giving users the tools to explore blockchain technology directly from the browser. It’s an experience designed for the decentralized web, putting users in full control of their data and assets.</p>



 Blazing Fast Performance 



<p>Speed is another standout feature. Herond loads pages up to three times faster than most browsers, ensuring that your browsing experience remains smooth and efficient. Whether you’re multitasking or streaming, Herond handles it all without slowing down.</p>



 User-Centric Design and Ecosystem 



<p>Herond’s design is all about customization. With a user-friendly interface and flexible settings, you can personalize your browsing experience. And with tools like Herond ID for decentralized identity management, Herond offers an integrated ecosystem that goes beyond just being a browser.</p>



<p>Looking for a fast and secure browser? Learn <a href="https://herond.org/browser">how to download Herond Browser on a computer </a>and enjoy top-tier privacy and Web 3.0 features. Plus, Herond is already available on both the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herond.android.browser&amp;pcampaignid=web_share">CH Play</a> and<a href="https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/herond-browser/id6462850011"> App Store </a>for your mobile device, offering a seamless and convenient browsing experience wherever you are.</p>



 Google Chrome 



<p>Google Chrome remains one of the most popular browsers, and for good reason. It’s fast, efficient, and well-integrated with Google’s ecosystem. Chrome frequently updates its security features and provides a seamless user experience. However, while Chrome does have robust security protocols, it is notorious for collecting data for advertising purposes. If privacy is a top priority for you, Chrome can be configured for enhanced privacy, but there are more privacy-conscious options available.</p>









 Mozilla Firefox 



<p>Mozilla Firefox stands as one of the best open-source browsers with a strong commitment to privacy. It offers an excellent speed-to-security ratio, with advanced privacy features like anti-tracking and phishing protection. Firefox also lets users customize their privacy settings, allowing you to decide what data gets collected. Plus, Firefox’s community-driven, open-source nature means that it’s constantly being updated and reviewed for security vulnerabilities.</p>







 Brave Browser 



<p>Brave takes privacy and security to the next level. This browser blocks ads and trackers by default, which not only protects your data but also boosts browsing speed. Brave’s integrated HTTPS upgrade ensures that you’re always browsing securely. Additionally, Brave’s innovative reward system allows users to earn cryptocurrency by viewing privacy-respecting ads—an excellent bonus for those looking to balance privacy and functionality.</p>









 Microsoft Edge 



<p>Microsoft Edge has come a long way since its earlier versions. Built on the same open-source Chromium engine that powers Chrome, Edge has improved in terms of speed and security. It includes features like built-in phishing and malware protection, as well as a secure password manager. Edge also boasts privacy tools like tracking prevention and a dedicated InPrivate mode. While not as privacy-focused as some others, Edge offers a well-rounded browsing experience with strong security features.</p>


 
 


 Safari 



<p>Safari has been the go-to browser for Apple users for years. It delivers excellent performance on macOS and iOS devices, especially when it comes to speed. Safari also offers strong privacy protection, with features like Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which helps block advertisers from following your every move online. It’s an ideal choice for those within the Apple ecosystem who want solid security without sacrificing performance.</p>


 
 


 Opera Browser 



<p>Opera is often overlooked but packs a punch with its robust security features. Built-in tools like a free VPN, ad blocker, and fraud protection make Opera a secure choice. The browser also boasts excellent speed performance, even with all these features running. Opera is an especially great choice for users who want a browser that provides a variety of privacy and security tools in one package, without needing extra extensions.</p>









 Tor Browser 



<p>When privacy is the top priority, Tor is the go-to choice for many. Tor’s ability to encrypt internet traffic and route it through multiple nodes makes it the best tool for users who need ultimate anonymity. Tor prevents tracking, stops unwanted surveillance, and shields your identity by masking your IP address. However, the trade-off for this high level of privacy is speed—Tor is slower than most browsers due to its complex encryption process. But for those who prioritize anonymity over speed, it’s the best choice.</p>




 <a href="https://blog.herond.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/121-2.png"></a> 




 Vivaldi 



<p>Vivaldi is a highly customizable browser that offers excellent speed and security. It comes with a built-in ad blocker, custom search engines, and advanced privacy features, giving you control over what data gets collected. Vivaldi allows you to configure almost every aspect of your browsing experience, from the interface to security settings, making it a great option for users who like to tweak things to their exact specifications.</p>







 Epic Browser 



<p>Epic Browser is designed with privacy in mind. It blocks all tracking cookies, advertisements, and even automatically forces secure HTTPS connections. Epic is known for its simple, no-frills interface and its commitment to keeping your data private. By default, Epic doesn’t store your browsing history or any personal data, and it doesn’t allow for any syncing, which is perfect for users who prioritize privacy above all else.</p>









 Conclusion 



<p>Choosing the right browser is more than just about convenience—it’s about security, speed, and privacy. The browsers we’ve discussed offer various features that cater to different user needs, whether you’re looking for an anonymous browsing experience, a super-fast option, or an all-around secure browser.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the best browser for you depends on your priorities. If privacy and security are your top concerns, browsers like Brave, Firefox, and Tor should be at the top of your list. If you’re after speed and integration with other services, Chrome and Edge will suit you well. And if you want the perfect balance between speed, privacy, and security, consider trying Herond or Vivaldi. Whichever you choose, remember that it’s time to take control of your online experience and make sure your browsing is as fast and secure as possible.</p>

				 Starting in August 2025, the UK mandates identity verification for company directors and Persons with Significant Control (PSCs) under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023. While GOV.UK’s One Login system offers a verification route, recent security concerns have emerged due to its loss of certification. iComply provides a robust, privacy-focused alternative that not only meets but exceeds these new requirements, ensuring secure and compliant identity verification.<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Changing Landscape of Corporate Director Identity Verification in the United Kingdom 
<p>The UK’s corporate environment is undergoing significant reforms aimed at enhancing transparency and combating economic crime. Central to these changes is the requirement for identity verification of key individuals involved in companies.</p>
 Key Requirements: 
 
 Who Must Verify:
 
 All new and existing company directors 
 Persons with Significant Control (PSCs) 
 Individuals submitting filings to Companies House 
 
 
 Verification Methods:
 
 Directly through Companies House via GOV.UK One Login 
 In-person at designated UK Post Office branches 
 Through Authorised Corporate Service Providers (ACSPs) 
 
 
 Timeline:
 
 Voluntary verification available from April 8, 2025 
 Mandatory verification for new appointments from Autumn 2025 
 12-month transition period for existing directors and PSCs to comply 
 
 
 
<p>Failure to comply may result in criminal offenses and the inability to serve as a director.<a href="https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2025/04/companies-house-incoming-identity-verification-requirements?utm_source=chatgpt.com">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-World Implications: A Compliance Officer’s Perspective 
<p>Consider James, a compliance officer at a reputable UK corporate services firm. James is tasked with onboarding a new client, a multinational corporation with a complex ownership structure. Navigating the intricate web of subsidiaries and stakeholders, James must ensure that all directors and PSCs are properly verified to meet the upcoming regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Utilizing iComply’s advanced identity verification solutions, James efficiently:</p>
 
 Automates the collection of necessary identification documents 
 Conducts thorough checks against global watchlists and sanctions 
 Generates audit-ready reports to demonstrate compliance 
 
<p>This streamlined process not only saves time but also provides peace of mind, knowing that the firm adheres to the highest standards of regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Concerns Surrounding GOV.UK One Login 
<p>While GOV.UK’s One Login system offers a digital route for identity verification, recent developments have raised concerns:</p>
 
 Loss of Certification: In May 2025, One Login lost its certification under the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DIATF) due to its biometric authentication provider, iProov, failing to renew compliance. 
 Security Vulnerabilities: The system has been reported to comply with barely half – only 21 – of the 39 outcomes detailed in the National Cyber Security Centre’s Cyber Assessment Framework, indicating significant shortcomings in information security. 
 Privacy Concerns: The centralized nature of One Login raises potential privacy issues, with critics highlighting the risks of “ID phone home” scenarios where user interactions could be tracked, monitored, or controlled remotely. 
 
<p>These issues underscore the importance of choosing a reliable and secure identity verification solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 iComply: Exceeding Standards in Identity Verification 
<p>iComply offers a comprehensive identity verification solution that not only meets but surpasses the UK’s new regulatory requirements:</p>
 
 Advanced Verification Techniques: Employing document authentication, hybrid (active and passive) liveness detection, and concurrent biometric verification within a secure video session. 
 Privacy-First Approach: Prioritizing user privacy through decentralized verification methods, reducing the risk of data breaches associated with centralized systems. 
 Continuous Compliance Monitoring: Staying ahead of regulatory changes to ensure ongoing compliance and security. 
 User Empowerment: Providing users with control over their personal data, fostering trust and confidence in the verification process. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enhancing Corporate Transparency 
<p>The implementation of stringent identity verification requirements aims to:</p>
 
 Prevent Fraudulent Activities: By ensuring that only verified individuals can hold key positions within companies. 
 Improve Data Accuracy: Enhancing the reliability of information within the Companies House register. 
 Strengthen Public Trust: Demonstrating a commitment to transparency and accountability in the corporate sector. 
 
<p>iComply’s KYB and KYC solutions align with these objectives, offering tools that support businesses in maintaining integrity and public confidence.</p>
<p>As the UK moves towards stricter identity verification mandates, businesses must adapt to ensure compliance and protect their reputations. iComply stands as a trusted partner in this transition, offering advanced, privacy-focused solutions that meet and exceed regulatory standards.</p>
<p>Contact us to learn why James’ firm chose iComply for secure, compliant, and trustworthy identity verification on directors, beneficial owners, and PSCs in the United Kingdom.</p>

				 <p>[Amsterdam] <a href="https://www.money2020.com/">Money 20/20</a> — “The world’s leading, premium content, sales and networking platform for the global money ecosystem” — has <a href="https://europe.money2020.com/media/newroom/pr-2025-04-06-25-startup-media-session">selected Indicio</a> as one of eight startups “transforming the world of money.”</p>
<p>The announcement was made today during the Money 20/20 conference in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>“This is tremendous recognition for Indicio and our technology’s capacity to turn verifiable identity into the ubiquitous payment method of the future,” said Heather Dahl, CEO. “The banking and financial sector has started to realize the power of Verifiable Credentials to create industry-spanning solutions that cover everything from seamless account access to digital assets, privacy-preserving biometric authentication, and identity for agentic AI. All these have tremendous value to business and customers alike. But the payoff is even bigger when you start to see how decentralized identity can be a secure payment rail for instant, independent, peer-to-peer transactions — digital infrastructure you can create with your phone.”</p>
<p>To underscore how rapidly this future is coming, Indicio just announced <a href="https://indicio.tech/artificial-intelligence/">Indicio ProvenAI</a>. ProvenAI is a simple way to implement verifiable identity for AI agents and their customers, so each can authenticate the other before the customer gives consent to access data. It is the latest addition to Indicio Proven, the company’s platform for interoperable decentralized identity solutions and the latest product in its suite of financial service applications.</p>
<p>“Simply put, the vast potential of agentic AI in banking and finance is constrained by the problems our technology solves,” said Dahl. “With Verifiable Credentials, we are able to give AI agents verifiable identities, we enable secure communication between agent and customer that can be initiated by the agent, and we provide a simple way for the customer to give consent to the AI requesting access to their data.”</p>
<p>Indicio’s identity solution for AI follows on its ground-breaking solution to the problem of AI-generated identity fraud.</p>
<p>“With the emergence of deepfakes, we saw an opportunity to translate our travel solution — the world’s first digital passport credential based on standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization — into a financial one,” said Dahl. “At&nbsp; the core of this is ‘government-grade digital identity’ using authenticated biometrics.”</p>
<p>Indicio’s ability to combine authenticated biometrics with Verifiable Credentials means that a remote liveness check or biometric scan can be instantly crosschecked against an authenticated, tamper-proof copy of a person’s biometrics that the person holds on their phone. When added to a KYC credential, financial institutions have an enormously powerful, reusable&nbsp; authentication solution at a fraction of the cost of conventional identity verification.</p>
<p>“The beauty of it is that the biometric data stays with the person — there’s no need for enterprises&nbsp; to store people’s biometric data to verify it,” said Dahl. “This is a breakthrough for consumers —&nbsp;and a gateway to better account login and security. We know from the travel sector that many people are willing to use and trust&nbsp; biometrics if they can be sure their data is protected. With Indicio, people have custody and control of their most valuable data and can share it in a way that’s instantly verifiable.”</p>
<p>Indicio has been leading the decentralized identity sector with these kinds of innovations, but it has also recently entered the European digital wallet market with another tech first: a simple way to combine credentials built to Europe’s digital identity specifications with credentials from outside Europe that have been built to different global standards.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to make every kind of credential format —&nbsp;digital travel credentials, EU credentials, mobile driver’s licenses —&nbsp;all work with each other and be easily combined in seamless workflows, including in the world of money,” said Dahl. “We successfully showed that this was possible earlier in the year in an international travel trial with Aruba, Delta Air Lines, and SITA.</p>
<p>“This seamless interoperability creates a single customer journey, bridging companies, industries, and sectors to meet a consumer’s needs. Interoperability is the key to a single digital market in a micro as well as macro sense.</p>
<p>“We call it decentralized identity,” said Dahl, “but it’s really a way to connect anywhere to everywhere in a trusted, privacy-preserving way. It’s a foundation for seamless interaction, payments, agentic AI and a new kind of internet.”</p>
<p>In line with the company’s commitment to be the leader in global interoperability, Indicio is currently incorporating the Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) into its Proven platform. The company will also be developing the technology for government-issued digital passport credentials based on the ICAO DTC 2 specification with its global partner SITA in the EU Aptitude Trial.</p>

 Streamlining Security: HYPR and HID Merge Physical and Digital Access  The notion of “access” no longer coincides with a single connotation. Within a sprawling landscape of digital identities and physical spaces, modern enterprises are confronted with the daunting task of securing each of these spaces from all possible angles. The struggle to secure virtual and physical access incurs productivity setbacks and security vulnerabilities. The introduction of the virtual world was supposed to provide convenience and efficiency, but the resulting balance between digital and physical access has left organizations scrambling to address each separately.
<br>
<br>But what if there was a way to streamline access, fortify security, and empower employees all at once?
<br> 
 A Unified Solution for Every Use Case  
<p>HYPR and HID have partnered to deliver one converged access solution with hardware- and software-based passkeys in a single platform. Whether your workforce needs smart cards for regulated environments, mobile-device credentials for remote workers, or both, this solution flexes to your policies and compliance requirements:</p>  
  
   
    
    Hardware-Based Passkeys: Ideal for high-security sites and regulated industries (finance, manufacturing, healthcare).  
    Software-Based Passkeys: Perfect for contractors, hybrid staff, and deskless workers.  
    Mixed Workforces: Assign each user the credential type that matches their role; no system overhaul required.  
      
  
<p>By registering and verifying identities at enrollment, HYPR’s identity verification establishes a chain of trust from day one. HID’s smart cards then become both your physical badge and your FIDO credential, unlocking doors and business applications with a single tap.</p> 
 A Leader in Trusted Identity Solutions  
<p>HID is a global leader in Identity and Access Management, specializing in the issuance, authentication, and management of digital identities for millions of users. As an active member of the FIDO Alliance, HID strongly advocates for passwordless authentication. We recognize that the transition from traditional password-based authentication to passkeys varies for each organization. Therefore, we have partnered with strategic vendors such as Microsoft and HYPR to deliver solutions that meet businesses wherever they are in their passwordless journey. Whether leveraging the power of physical access cards, the <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/product-mix/crescendo">Crescendo portfolio</a>, or our software solutions, our mission is to become the trusted leader in delivering confidence to navigate within a digital world.</p> 
 Key Benefits of the HYPR | HID Integration  
  
  Stronger Security&nbsp;<br>Deploy phishing-resistant, device-bound passkeys, with no password fallbacks, across every environment. Only verified users gain access to sensitive systems or secure areas.  
  Flexible Deployment&nbsp;<br>Support hardware and software passkeys from the same console.  
  Simplified Administration<br>Manage <a href="https://www.hidglobal.com/products/crescendo">Crescendo Cards</a> and HYPR credentials through one pane of glass. Reduce provisioning steps, lower maintenance costs, and accelerate onboarding.<br>  
  Faster Onboarding<br>Enable self-service enrollment – no pre-issued certificates or IT hand-holding required. New hires, contractors, and partners get up and running in minutes.  
  Increased Productivity<br>One credential for doors, desktops, and apps means fewer helpdesk tickets and smoother user experiences. Employees focus on work, not passwords.  
  Compliance Ready<br>Built on FIDO-certified technology, the solution supports zero trust initiatives and audit requirements across industries.  
  
 Frictionless User Experience for Enterprise Access  
<p>No employee walks into their building, sits down at their desk, opens their computer, and starts working. The users at your organization use ID badges to gain entry to the office. They then use a number of authentication methods to access their workstations and applications. HID and HYPR’s solution acknowledges these existing methods and improves the speed and efficiency of your infrastructure rather than changing it or overcomplicating it.&nbsp;</p> 
 Single Credential for Physical and Digital Access  
<p>To provide a unified physical and digital access experience, the HYPR and HID integration leverages the power of the Crescendo Cards, which support PIV and are FIDO-certified. Acting as a single, secure credential, they allow users to unlock office doors and log in to workstations. Notably, the Crescendo tools streamline the management, provisioning, and recovery of these cards, relieving administrative burden. Users can self-enroll their Crescendo Cards for both domains of access, eliminating complex onboarding processes. If a card is lost or stolen, organizations are assured of quick and secure recovery.</p> 
 Simplifying Security in the Face of Modern Threats  
<p>By converging physical and digital access, HYPR and HID eliminate the silos and manual gaps that adversaries exploit. Users self-enroll, IT manages everything centrally, and security teams gain continuous assurance that only verified humans enter your systems and spaces.</p> 
<p>Learn more about how the HYPR | HID integration can address your most demanding access use cases while reducing risk, accelerating onboarding, and maximizing your existing investments.</p>

<p>Reality, which has definitely included sharing passwords, has always been messier.</p>



<p>From caregivers managing health portals, to coworkers submitting expense reports on behalf of others, to kids navigating school systems with help from their parents, the need for delegation is everywhere. But digital identity systems still mostly assume a clean one-to-one world. And when real life demands “acting for someone else,” we’re left cobbling together workarounds such as password sharing, manual overrides, and endless customer support calls.</p>



<p>Now, with the rise of agentic AI, where digital agents can take actions independently, the challenge of delegation has found new urgency. If humans already can’t delegate to other people cleanly in digital systems, what happens when software needs to do it?</p>



<p>Delegation isn’t new. But it’s getting urgent.</p>



<p>You may also be interested in some of my earlier posts, “<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/02/11/agentic-ai-and-authentication/">Agentic AI and Authentication: Exploring Some Unanswered Questions</a>” and “<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/02/25/ai-and-ciam/">What AI Agents Can Teach Us About Fraud in Consumer Identity</a>.”</p>



 Delegation: Beyond Permission Tokens and Role Switching 



<p>Delegation sounds simple: authorize one party to act on behalf of another. I wish it were that simple! Alas, today, “delegation” often gets boiled down to clumsy versions of permission tokens or role-switching.</p>



<p>Let’s take a real-world example. I’m paraphrasing from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gffletch/">George Fletcher</a>‘s LinkedIn article on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/delegated-authentication-george-fletcher-9rqke/?trackingId=cr6QEITMSbaF3uTdL%2Bz2xQ%3D%3D">Delegated Authorization</a> (are you following George? You need to be following George).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Alice managed medical and supplement accounts for herself and her spouse Bob. After Alice’s death, Bob needed access to those accounts to make changes. But because most systems didn’t support delegation, the only option was for Bob to impersonate Alice, using her password, risking terms-of-service violations and creating an audit mess.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is hardly rare. Across industries, you see:</p>



 
 Healthcare: Caregivers trying to manage appointments and prescriptions without “breaking” patient portals. 



 Workplaces: Expense approvals getting “proxy-approved” by executive assistants without clear delegation records. 



 Education: Parents struggling to fill out school forms because online systems assume the student is the sole user. 



 Customer Service: Agents needing to fix a customer’s problem but lacking any secure way to act on the customer’s behalf. 
 



<p>In these cases, systems often lean on role-switching (“pretend to be someone else”) or manual overrides (“fax us a form”). Neither solution is scalable, auditable, or user-friendly.</p>



 Why Agentic AI Turns the Pressure Up 



<p>If delegation was already broken for humans, AI makes the problem even harder. (The irony here, given AI is supposed to make everything easier, does not escape me.)</p>



<p>Picture an AI financial assistant you authorize to move money between your accounts. That AI is acting on your behalf, but today’s systems aren’t designed to distinguish “the customer” from “the customer’s agent.” There’s no standard way to represent delegated credentials. No clear audit trail showing who (or what) took which action.</p>



<p>Without robust delegation models, AI agents risk being blocked from useful actions or allowed to act too broadly without sufficient consent or guardrails.</p>



<p>This isn’t just a futuristic thought experiment. Real discussions (like those at The Identity Salon) have flagged problems ranging from AI in banking to AI-powered scheduling assistants accessing your work calendar.</p>



 Delegation Models (and Why They’re Still Not Enough) 



<p>We’ve tried to tackle delegation before. Some of the main models include:</p>



 
 OAuth “Alice-to-Alice” Sharing: Useful for limited access (like “this app can see your calendar”), where you grant a service permission to act on your behalf. But even though another app is doing the work, the system still treats it as if you personally took the action, which isn’t the kind of clear, separate delegation we often need. 



 <a href="https://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/wg/rec-oauth-uma-grant-2.0.html">User-Managed Access (UMA)</a>: A step forward in enabling a touch more complexity, UMA (a spec out of the Kantara Initiative) allows Bob to act for Alice with his own identity. Unfortunately, adoption of UMA has been slow. 



 On-Behalf-Of Models in “OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange” (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693">RFC 8693</a>): Helpful for service-to-service delegation, but lacking lifecycle management and human-centric constraints. 



 Persona Chaining: Several efforts have proposed ways to create sub-identities for delegation, but they tend to introduce ambiguity over time and often fail to take hold in real-world systems. Why? Because chaining authority adds complexity: it’s harder to define clear boundaries, enforce policy constraints, and ensure reliable audit trails as the chain grows. Without strong governance, persona chains risk becoming security liabilities instead of flexible solutions. 
 



<p>Each model solves part of the puzzle. None solves it completely. Especially once you factor in:</p>



 
 Contextual constraints (“only for this task,” “only until next Tuesday”). 



 Transitivity (“Bob can act for Alice—but can’t pass that authority to Carol”). 



 Auditability (“who did what, when, and why”). 



 Lifecycle management (“delegation expires automatically when conditions change”). 
 



 Real-World Enterprise Reflections 



<p>Healthcare and personal AI agents are one thing, but don’t think the enterprise gets to avoid this pain.</p>



<p>In HR systems, managers often need to submit forms on behalf of employees. Without built-in delegation, companies end up granting broad admin rights, creating security risks and compliance headaches. (There’s a reason digital identity is one of the most successful attack vectors there is today.)</p>



<p>In expense systems, executive assistants often “act for” executives, but technically submit expenses “as” the executive. Good luck untangling that when auditors come knocking. Or not. You deserve at least a slap on the wrist if that’s what you’re doing.</p>



<p>Even in research settings, project leads sometimes need to act on behalf of students or postdocs to access grant portals or finalize submissions, but systems rarely support clear, limited delegation.</p>



 Delegation Isn’t Optional Anymore 



<p>As George Fletcher put it, we need ways for one party to prove:</p>



 
 They have the right to act on someone else’s behalf. 



 They are the specific person (or agent) authorized. 



 Their actions are constrained by clear, enforceable policies. 
 



<p>Without this, delegation remains a patchwork of risky workarounds.</p>



<p>And with AI agents entering the mix, “I’ll just share my password” is no longer an acceptable fallback.</p>



<p>If we want a digital world that reflects real human (and increasingly agentic) relationships, delegation needs to be a first-class feature, not an afterthought. But it’s not going to be easy. Whatever new specifications technologists come up with will have to contend with legacy systems that have no idea how to implement those specifications (I wrote about the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/03/11/standards-versus-reality/">long-tail of implementation</a> not too long ago). The technical debt here is crazypants.</p>



 



<p>In the next post, I’ll dive into where I think existing delegation models fall short and what a more complete, future-ready solution could look like.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00]<br>Welcome to A Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Delegation Sounds Simple — Until It Isn’t 



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Today, we’re diving into a problem that’s bigger than it sounds: delegation.</p>



<p>If that word makes your eyes glaze over, hang on. Because without solving the delegation problem, everything from caregiving to AI agents managing your bank accounts is held together with virtual duct tape and hope.</p>



 



 What Is Delegation, Really? 



<p>[00:01:03]<br>Digital systems were built on a simple model: one user, one identity, one device, one intent. Clean. Predictable.</p>



<p>But real life doesn’t work like that.</p>



<p>[00:01:17]<br>Delegation happens all the time. You hand your kid your phone to check in at the orthodontist. A coworker approves an invoice while you’re in the air. Your partner logs into the utility company’s website to pay a bill.</p>



<p>Delegation is normal behavior. It’s how families, companies, and governments function. Ever heard of a power of attorney? Same idea, different paperwork.</p>



<p>[00:01:48]<br>But our systems still assume we all live alone on little digital islands. One user, one device. No help allowed.</p>



 



 How People Actually Delegate 



<p>[00:02:00]<br>When you try to act for someone else, you usually end up doing one of three things:</p>



 
 Share a password (bad, and you know it) 



 Fill out a 1990s-style form 



 Spend an afternoon lost in customer support limbo 
 



<p>[00:02:24]<br>Delegation isn’t a corner case. It’s everyday life. And as AI agents enter the mix, the cracks in our one-user model become more obvious—and more dangerous.</p>



 



 Real Life Example: Bob and Alice 



<p>[00:02:41]<br>Let’s talk about a real-world example, using Bob and Alice. Because in Identity Land, everyone is Bob and Alice.</p>



<p>[00:02:49]<br>Alice manages all the medical and supplement accounts for her household. When she dies, Bob needs to access those accounts to cancel services, update info, settle things.</p>



<p>[00:02:59]<br>But that’s not easy. Most sites don’t support real delegation. Bob’s options:</p>



 
 Steal or guess Alice’s password (which is illegal) 



 Fax around a death certificate like it’s 1997 
 



<p>[00:03:24]<br>Even if he gets in, the system doesn’t know Bob is acting with Alice’s consent.</p>



<p>[00:03:35]<br>This isn’t an extreme case. Parents managing care for kids, adult children helping with banking, executive assistants scheduling meetings—it’s all delegation.</p>



<p>We designed our systems as if these use cases don’t exist.</p>



 



 And Then Came AI Agents 



<p>[00:03:59]<br>Let’s make it even messier by adding AI.</p>



<p>[00:04:05]<br>Imagine you have an AI assistant that can act on your behalf: book flights, order groceries, pay bills, move money. Maybe it even negotiates your internet bill.</p>



<p>You’ve told it what it can do—and it works. Until it doesn’t.</p>



<p>[00:04:24]<br>When the AI tries to update your address or cancel a subscription, the system says: Who are you, and why should I trust you?</p>



<p>[00:04:56]<br>Right now, there’s no standard credential that says, “I’m an authorized agent.” No way to prove the agent isn’t just stealing your identity.</p>



<p>So you either get blocked at every step, or you let the AI act freely—with no oversight, audit trail, or way to revoke access.</p>



<p>[00:05:22]<br>Either scenario is a nightmare.</p>



<p>[00:05:24]<br>This isn’t theoretical. Visa and Mastercard are already testing AI agents that act on your behalf. People are plugging them into banking tools, medical apps, productivity workflows.</p>



<p>But the tools weren’t built for real delegation.</p>



 



 Existing Models Aren’t Enough 



<p>[00:06:04]<br>There have been attempts to fix this:</p>



 
 OAuth 2.0 — Lets Alice share access, but it still looks like Alice did everything 



 User Managed Access (UMA) — Great concept where Bob acts for Alice as Bob, with permission. But not widely adopted 



 OAuth Token Exchange — Works well for backend services, but not for actual humans 



 Persona Chaining — Create sub-identities, then lose track of them 
 



<p>[00:07:00]<br>Each solves part of the problem, but none cover the full picture—especially when you need context, limits, expiration, and audit trails.</p>



 



 Delegation in the Enterprise? Worse. 



<p>[00:07:25]<br>You’d think enterprises would have this figured out. Nope.</p>



<p>[00:07:30]<br>HR managers need to do things on behalf of employees. But instead of targeted delegation (like submitting vacation requests but not seeing salary), they get full admin rights.</p>



<p>[00:07:40]<br>Executive assistants submit expenses for executives all the time. That’s fine—until an audit shows $6,000 in upgrades and spa charges, and the system logs show the executive clicked “submit.”</p>



<p>Maybe they did. Maybe they didn’t.</p>



<p>[00:08:12]<br>Yes, this really happens. Especially in older ERP or expense systems, or in underfunded orgs without fine-grained access controls.</p>



<p>[00:08:49]<br>Even well-funded companies often rely on temporary access, shared accounts, and informal workflows that make real audit trails impossible.</p>



<p>[00:09:12]<br>Unless the system supports delegated authority as a first-class feature, it always looks like the executive made the request. Not the assistant.</p>



 



 Broken Delegation = Risk and Waste 



<p>[00:09:31]<br>Every time delegation is handled poorly, it:</p>



 
 Slows down work 



 Increases friction 



 Creates security risks 



 Forces people into workarounds 
 



<p>[00:09:48]<br>Delegation isn’t an edge case. It’s just life. And ignoring it breaks everything.</p>



 



 What Needs to Change 



<p>[00:10:02]<br>We need ways for people and agents to prove:</p>



 
 They have the right to act for someone else 



 They are who they say they are 



 Their actions are constrained, auditable, and revocable 
 



<p>[00:10:28]<br>Without that, delegation stays chaotic—and automation doesn’t work.</p>



<p>[00:10:39]<br>Fixing this isn’t easy. It means:</p>



 
 Updating protocols like OAuth and UMA 



 Building support for verifiable credentials 



 Creating governance models that aren’t just “hope and vibes” 
 



<p>[00:10:53]<br>And then there’s the technical debt—so large it might have its own zip code. Updating protocols doesn’t magically update software. Apps have to evolve too.</p>



<p>[00:11:17]<br>If we want digital systems that reflect real life, delegation has to be a first-class feature.</p>



 



 What’s Next 



<p>[00:11:25]<br>In Part Two, I’ll dig deeper into where today’s models fall short—and what it’ll take to build delegation that doesn’t suck.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs was among the world’s leading experts on the future of digital identities and cybersecurity at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2025">2025 European Identity and Cloud Conference</a> in Germany in May.</p>



<p>Anonyome’s CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulashley/?ref=blog.identity.foundation">Dr Paul Ashley</a> presented on implementing hardware security modules in digital identity wallets, and Chief Architect <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown/">Steve McCown</a> discussed fighting AI deepfakes with <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/balancing-online-trustworthiness-and-anonymity-with-personhood-credentials/">personhood credentials</a>.</p>



<p>The four-day EIC 2025 saw 300 experts share solutions to the complex challenges of human-centric digital identity in the face of accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, and other developments in cutting-edge identity and cloud technologies.</p>



 Implementing hardware security modules in digital identity wallets 



<p>Dr Ashley explained how digital identity wallets can be enhanced through HSM integration to fulfill the requirements of the EU Digital Identity Wallet framework and analyzed each credential standard’s compatibility with various HSMs’ cryptographic capabilities. He focused on examining the secure enclave capabilities on iOS and Android phones and Yubikey 5C NFC devices to support different verifiable credential presentation proof signature profiles and strong holder binding. Dr Ashley explained:</p>



 
 The secure enclaves on iOS and Android phones offer limited cryptographic flexibility for supporting various verifiable credential proof signature profiles, restricting the types of credentials and signing algorithms that can be utilized.<br> 



 Approximately 50% of current Android phones lack secure enclaves, limiting accessibility to this functionality for a significant portion of the population.<br> 



 Yubikey 5C NFC provides greater cryptographic flexibility and the added benefit of compatibility across the user’s wallet devices.<br> 



 None of the mentioned options are currently certified for EUDI Wallet use.<br> 



 Exploring the potential of remote HSMs like those from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ubiqu/">ubiqu</a> as a solution to the identified limitations presents an intriguing avenue for future consideration.

<p>Steve McCown made two appearances at EIC 2025: he presented a “101” on <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/balancing-online-trustworthiness-and-anonymity-with-personhood-credentials/">personhood credentials</a> (PHCs) and was part of an expert panel examining real-world implementations, emerging standards, and practical challenges in digital identity.</p>



 Benefits and challenges of personhood credentials 



<p>In his “101” Steve looked at the evolution of the “personhood” concept as a way of proving a user is a real human and not a bot in an AI world. He identified some of the significant benefits of PHCs, such as reducing impact of sockpuppeting, mitigating bot attacks, and verifying a person’s delegation to AI agent, but also warned of potential challenges, including:</p>



 
 Equitable access: can PHCs affect access to digital services?<br> 



 Free expression: will people feel safe using PHCs?<br> 



 Checks on power: how will PHCs affect tech providers?<br> 



 Robustness of attack and error: how might PHCs be vulnerable to errors or subversive compromise? 
 



<p></p>



<p>Steve’s talk underscored the idea that the web faces a critical inflection point: as AI-generated content proliferates and platforms demand increasingly invasive identity verification, we risk creating a digital environment where every interaction requires credentials—essentially a “papers, please” culture for the internet. Privacy-preserving approaches to personhood verification can help prevent this dystopian outcome while still enabling necessary trust.</p>

<p>The expert panel explored how technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure can preserve individual privacy while meeting legitimate verification requirements. The discussion addressed pressing questions around maintaining an open web, preventing privacy violations, and safeguarding human agency in increasingly digital environments.</p>



<p>Steve was joined on the panel by Ankur Banerjee, Co-chair of Technical Steering Committee, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>; Drummond Reed, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> Community Member; and Sebastian Rodriguez, Strategy Advisor, <a href="https://www.privado.id/">Privado.ID</a>.</p>

				  Knowing your AI agent will be the cornerstone of successful agentic AI —&nbsp;along with knowing it’s your customer who’s interacting with it. ProvenAI and decentralized identity provide the compliance, security, and trust needed to deliver a smarter future for everyone.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, WA: June 2, 2025: <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> today announced the development of <a href="https://indicio.tech/artificial-intelligence/">Indicio ProvenAI,</a> a digital identity infrastructure for AI agents and people to safely and securely authenticate each other and for people to be able to consent to share their data with an AI agent. ProvenAI’s use of Verifiable Credentials provides the trust needed for AI agents and agentic AI to access and use personal data for complex problem solving, enabling a revolution in digital products and services.</p>
<p>As AI agents begin to take on sensitive tasks—from travel planning to financial services—we need to verify who they are, confirm who they represent, and ensure they access our data and act only with our permission. ProvenAI brings a trusted identity layer to AI by using standards-based Verifiable Credentials and privacy-preserving protocols to establish cryptographic trust.</p>
<p>“AI is quickly moving into personal and high-stakes spaces where identity, consent, and data control are essential,” said Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio. “ProvenAI gives developers and organizations the tools to build agents that can prove who they are and prove who you are—securely, privately, and with your permission.”</p>
<p>ProvenAI addresses a fast-emerging need across sectors like travel, finance, education, where AI is already being deployed. It is ideal for customer-facing AI systems, like chatbots that book travel, process loan applications, or assist with student services—where trust, authentication, and compliance are non-negotiable.</p>
 How ProvenAI Works 
 
 Prove the AI agent is legitimate<br>AI agents present Verifiable Credentials to prove their identity and authorization when interacting with users or services. This prevents spoofing and phishing attempts, builds trust in automated interactions, and ensures that users are engaging with the correct application—not a fake or malicious impersonator. 
 Consent to share personal data<br>Users share their identity information with the AI agent using Verifiable Credentials, giving explicit consent and control over what’s shared. This not only ensures privacy but also provides the agent with high-quality, authoritative data directly from the credential itself—improving accuracy, reducing errors, and enabling more relevant responses. 
 Authenticate users without revealing data<br>ProvenAI uses biometric-linked credentials and zero-knowledge proofs to verify a user’s identity without exposing personal or sensitive information. This protects privacy, prevents data leakage, and enables strong authentication without the need to store or transmit raw biometric data—reducing risk for both users and organizations. 
 
<p>ProvenAI is built on Indicio Proven and aligned with EUDI, ISO, and W3C standards, delivering global interoperability with support for wide range of standardized credential formats—including SD-JWTs, mdoc/mDL, JSON-LD, and AnonCreds—and widely used communication protocols like DIDComm and OpenID4VC.</p>
 Join the ProvenAI Webinar 
<p>Learn more at the ProvenAI webinar on Wednesday, June 25 at 7:00 AM PT, featuring Ken Ebert, Mike Ebert, and Trevor Butterworth. The session will explore the technology, use cases, and how AI developers can get involved early.</p>

<p>We’re excited to share the latest updates on Permissioning the City (PtC). Our vision to transform how urban spaces are managed and shared by communities has taken some exciting steps forward with the development of our MVP (Platform 1.0).</p> Introducing the MVP — Platform&nbsp;1.0 <p>Check out our new video highlighting the core functionalities and vision behind the product. (Not all functionalities described in the video are currently accessible but the backend is&nbsp;there!)</p><p>Our MVP focuses on three critical&nbsp;areas:</p>  Space Discovery: Making it easier to discover and access information about underutilised spaces.  Rule-making: Enabling communities to collaboratively create, adjust, and iterate rules using our rule-template system.  Community Decision-Making: Facilitating inclusive decisions and structured deliberation through an ‘explained vote’&nbsp;system.  <p>Throughout this development, we’ve actively worked with stakeholders — from commercial and non-commercial space managers to event organisers, artists, and administrators. Our three dedicated in-person workshops allowed us to test ideas such as collaborative rule-making, refine features, and fine-tune our feedback system directly with potential users. You can see our video here which features these engagements.</p> Our Recent Highlights <p>We’re excited to share some achievements from the past&nbsp;year:</p>  <a href="https://edge.worldgovernmentsummit.org/">Dubai World Government Summit</a>: Featured in the Edge of Government exhibition, showcasing global innovations in public governance.  <a href="https://v.daum.net/v/20250523014010958?f=p">Digital Innovation Award</a>: Selected by South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT for the 2025 Digital Innovation Awards.  Funder Validation: Successfully presented MVP to our funder, the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA), receiving encouraging support and validation.  New Funding Secured: NIPA renewed our support for 2025–2026! We’re collaborating with regional institutions across South Korea— Incheon, Yongin, Daegu, and Jeonnam — to expand testing across private homes, shared offices/kitchens, and public&nbsp;squares.  Melbourne Design Week: With RMIT, collaboratively exploring the potential of digital permission architectures in unlocking Australian cities. See event info&nbsp;<a href="https://designweek.melbourne/event/prototyping-permission-unlocking-australian-cities-through-digital-architecture/">here</a>.   What’s Next? <p>Next, we’re diving deep into testing the MVP across real-world environments to answer key governance and knowledge/data related questions, such&nbsp;as:</p><p>Self-selecting permissioning group with responsibility sharing:</p>  Does this feature allow us to find a generally permissive balance of concerned parties, and find considerate and consensual ways for space to be activated?  Should there be special members of the permissioning group which should always be involved as a safeguard, e.g. the space owner? (One way we can test this is having the permissioning group decisions reviewed by a responsibility holder — if the veto is never used, it would suggest that the responsibility holder may not necessarily always need to participate.)  How do we avoid “tragedy of the commons” situations after something goes wrong? What processes do we need to define how these responsibilities are assigned as part of rule-making?  <p>Rule-focused feedback:</p>  Does focusing feedback on rules rather than individuals encourage compliance and reduce negative behaviours?  <p>Asynchronous deliberation:</p>  Will our voting system, which allows explanations and discussions, lead to broader consensus?  <p>Collective intelligence generated through the use of the platform:</p>  What meaningful data can we (responsibly) collect that will benefit both communities and local authorities — creating a positive feedback&nbsp;loop?  What are the possible external use cases for this intelligence? What stakeholders might be interested? E.g. evidence-informed masterplanning   Developing Platform 2.0: AI-Supported Adaptive Permissioning <p>Our new grant enables us to move towards Platform 2.0, a transformative phase introducing conversational, AI-supported dynamic permissioning. While decisions by peers will remain at the heart of Permissioning the City, AI will be used only to facilitate this process. Instead of cumbersome forms, users will interact naturally, negotiating space access through intuitive dialogues powered by small Language Models&nbsp;(sLLMs).</p><p>Highlights of Platform 2.0&nbsp;include:</p>  Adaptive permissions: Permissions that evolve dynamically based on real-time feedback, context, and outcomes.  Trust &amp; verification: Layered verification combining human, sensor, and machine inputs, secured by decentralised identity systems (DIDs) and privacy-enhancing technologies.  Legal automation: Automatically generated contracts and insurance agreements based on the intents and care commitments agreed by&nbsp;peers.  Conversational interfaces: Natural language dialogues facilitate real-time rule negotiations and dynamic governance.   Core Design Questions Driving Platform&nbsp;2.0   Dynamic cities: How can adaptive governance replace static control, fostering real-time, participatory space management?  Decentralised trust: What robust verification systems (e.g., blockchain, multi-level checks) ensure permissions remain trustworthy?  Contextual rule-making: Can organic rule creation emerge effectively from lived behaviours and evolving contexts?  AI governance support: How effectively can AI agents assist in managing real-time space usage and adaptive rules, such as matching between space needs and availability, or proposing rule adjustments based on peer feedback?  Dialogic permissions: Can we structure legal permissions conversationally, moving beyond rigid contracts to flexible, understandable agreements?

 KILT Protocol is entering an exciting new phase in its mission to enable real-world trust on the internet. <p>KILT’s technology, products, and tokenomics are undergoing a complete transformation with the goal of becoming a leader in the decentralized identity (DeID) sector. Developments include:</p>  The establishment of the <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-kilt-foundation-is-here-30387398b919">KILT Foundation</a> dedicated to supporting the growth and success of KILT protocol.  Expansion of the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn-about-kilt">team and advisory&nbsp;council</a>.  A bold new product strategy to fulfill consumer app demand, complimenting our earlier focus on infrastructure and enterprise/government integrations.  Growth beyond Polkadot to Base and the EVM world; opening to a user base orders of magnitude larger than&nbsp;before.  Tokenomic improvements including a halt of inflation, and novel token&nbsp;utility.  Continued pursuit and development of enterprise and government integrations; high-level working relationships with some of the world’s largest organizations.  <p>With an ambitious new outlook, KILT is expanding and improving its contribution to Web3, the next phase of the internet where identity is portable, credentials are verifiable, and users retain full&nbsp;control.</p><p>Read on to find out about some of the products and updates for 2025 which will take the network to the next level, providing multichain tools around DeID for everyday internet users, enterprise and developers.</p> New Products and&nbsp;Services <p>The new KILT product portfolio will include the Clans InfoFi platform; the Sporran super app; decentralized identifiers (DeIDs) for individuals and as a service (DaaS); KILT Pay, linking credentials with real-world payments; and a software development kit (SDK) bringing KILT to Ethereum-compatible blockchains. These and more are are under active development and are planned to roll out through 2025, beginning with Clans in the next few&nbsp;weeks.</p> Clans: Rewards in the Attention Economy <p>The attention economy just got an upgrade! Built on KILT, Clans is a mobile-first InfoFi platform that lets you earn rewards for engaging with others and creating content — directly tied to your activity on X (Twitter). Available on iOS and Android, Clans enables you to rise through the ranks while supporting your favorite projects across any&nbsp;network.</p> In Web3, community is currency. <p>But building meaningful communities requires more than Discord bots or bounty boards. It needs measurable attention economics, social proof, and incentives aligned with contribution.</p>  Post-to-Earn Mechanics: Join campaigns, post content, and earn Roar Points based on real engagement (likes, reposts, replies) and mindshare.  Leaderboard Dynamics: Rise through the ranks and earn exclusive rewards by supporting campaigns.  Mobile-First UX: Available on iOS and Android, Clans facilitates effortless engagement, particularly for mobile-first communities globally.  Beyond KILT: Ecosystem-agnostic infrastructure allows other protocols to launch viral growth campaigns using&nbsp;Clans.   Fully mobile-native; Clans turns attention into ownership.  Sporran 2.0: Your Identity Super&nbsp;App <p>The Sporran 2.0 “Super App” brings decentralized identity to the real world. Not limited to Web3 and with frictionless onboarding, this multi-functional app lets you authenticate a decentralized single sign-on (SSO) and access secure digital signing (DIDsign), KILT Pay, and third-party integrations. So now you can manage your identity, credentials and tokens across the internet just using your&nbsp;phone.</p> Reimagining the Web3&nbsp;Wallet. <p>Today’s Web3 wallets are great for storing tokens but fall short in managing identities and credentials, and providing utility. With Sporran 2.0, KILT is transforming its identity wallet into a multi-functional super app that unlocks decentralized identity in your daily digital&nbsp;life.</p>  Claim &amp; Present Credentials: Easily manage your KILT-based verifiable credentials (DIDs, attestations, proofs).  Built-In Security: Leverages TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) and MPC (Multi-Party Computation) for secure credential and key management.  Access Mini-Apps: Use Sporran as your gateway to DIDsign, KILT Pay, and third-party integrations.  Single Sign-On (SSO): Authenticate seamlessly across dApps and Web2 platforms using KILT-issued credentials, eliminating the need for passwords or traditional wallets. Powered by OpenID Connect (OIDC) with relayers, for a secure, single sign-on access across services.   Sporran is a Web3-native passport; not just for access, but for&nbsp;utility.  DIDsign 2.0: The Web3 Signing Platform for Everyday&nbsp;Use <p>A decentralized alternative to DocuSign and Adobe Sign, DIDsign 2.0 is a verifiable, privacy-preserving signing platform. Based on the internationally-recognized <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/">W3C decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs), you can create and control your digital identity, storing it on your own device. With DIDsign you can use decentralized identities for document signing and credential-based access via your phone or device, with signatures verifiable on-chain without revealing document content. The platform also enables multi-party signing, great for quick and transparent contract approvals.</p> Bringing decentralized signature infrastructure into everyday workflows. <p>KILT is reimagining DIDsign as a fully-featured decentralized signing platform: a verifiable, privacy-preserving alternative to DocuSign and Adobe&nbsp;Sign.</p>  Legally-Sound Document Signing: Sign contracts, agreements, NDAs, and invoices using decentralized identifiers and timestamped hashes.  Credential-Based Authentication: Only signers with required credentials (e.g., verified KYC or professional affiliations) can access and&nbsp;sign.  Auditability Without Surveillance: All signatures are verifiable on-chain, while document contents remain off-chain and encrypted.  Team Collaboration: Manage multi-party signing flows, track progress, and issue countersignatures — all inside a unified interface.   From DAOs signing grants to enterprises managing staffing contracts — DIDsign 2.0 brings decentralized signature infrastructure into everyday workflows.  KILT Pay: Credential-Aware Payments Infrastructure <p>KILT Pay links your identity with real-world payments using verified credentials. This allows users and platforms to transact safely and seamlessly. Integrated with payment services, KILT Pay can be used for credential-based anti-money-laundering (AML) controls or non-custodial Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements without leaking personal&nbsp;data.</p> Web3 payments need more than just wallets and QR codes — they need verified, compliant identity. <p>KILT Pay bridges on-chain credentials with real-world payments, enabling merchants, platforms, and users to transact safely and seamlessly. Keep an eye on <a href="https://x.com/Kiltprotocol">KILT X</a> for announcements of collaborations with leading payment integrators.</p>  Credential-based checkout and AML controls — without leaking personal&nbsp;data.  Onboarding tools for fintechs, exchanges, and DAOs requiring non-custodial KYC.   Pay for services with a tap, while proving eligibility or jurisdiction — no passwords, no screenshots, no friction.  EVM SDK: KILT Identity for Every&nbsp;Chain <p>The EVM Software Development Kit (SDK) expands KILT identity solutions beyond the Polkadot ecosystem, bringing them to Ethereum-compatible blockchains. The TypeScript SDK makes it easier for developers to integrate KILT as identity middleware, with cross-chain portability and credentials that can be utilized by smart contracts across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and all Ethereum-compatible blockchains.</p> KILT’s identity layer becomes composable across ecosystems. <p>We will be releasing a complete EVM Software Development Kit (SDK) that brings KILT’s credential primitives to Ethereum-compatible chains.</p>  Solidity Libraries: KILT credentials can be natively verified by smart contracts across a range of blockchains, including Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and other Layer 2 solutions.  Cross-Chain Credential Portability: Credentials issued on KILT, validated across ecosystems.  TypeScript SDK: Simplifies backend and frontend development with credential APIs.   This makes KILT de facto identity middleware for the EVM universe.  DID-as-a-Service (DaaS): Developer-Friendly Identity&nbsp;APIs <p>Verifiable identity shouldn’t require a PhD in cryptography.</p><p>DID-as-a-Service is KILT’s turnkey developer suite that lets any builder integrate decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials into apps, platforms, and products — with just a few lines of code. Not limited to Web3 platforms, these can be used for secure log-ins, credential gating or age-restricted content, and embedded identity&nbsp;layers.</p> Use Cases:   Identity-based logins for DeFi or Web2&nbsp;portals.  Credential gating for token sales, age-restricted content, or governance.  Embedded identity layers for wallets, exchanges, AI agents, and&nbsp;more.   Available via RESTful APIs and SDKs, DaaS lowers the barrier for integrating identity into high-scale applications.  Token Migration <p>To pave the way for KILT’s ambitious multichain future, the community <a href="https://kilt.polkassembly.network/referendum/50">voted</a> to migrate the KILT token to a new contract on the Base network. This process will begin in the near future; details will be announced on <a href="https://x.com/Kiltprotocol">KILT X (Twitter)</a>. KILT holders will be required to migrate their tokens either via supported exchanges or manually by a self-custody route. A detailed how-to guide will be published via <a href="https://x.com/Kiltprotocol">X</a> and the <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/">KILT blog</a> before migration begins.</p><p>The new token <a href="https://Basescan.org/token/0x5d0dd05bb095fdd6af4865a1adf97c39c85ad2d8">contract</a>, the migration <a href="https://Basescan.org/address/0x4a62f30d95a8350fc682642a455b299c074b3b8c">contract</a>, and migration portal have recently completed a <a href="https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kilt-protocol#code-security">security audit</a> with&nbsp;Certik.</p> These new developments on KILT Protocol aim to bring more trust and security to the internet without compromising on privacy. Follow KILT updates on <a href="https://x.com/Kiltprotocol">X</a> or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/">blog</a>.  🔗 A Unified Identity Layer for the Decentralized Internet: Why It&nbsp;Matters <p>Identity is the missing layer in decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Without scalable, privacy-preserving, and composable identity primitives:</p>  DAOs can’t onboard contributors with&nbsp;trust.  DeFi protocols can’t scale responsibly or compliantly.  Content and engagement can’t be credibly incentivized.  Signing documents still relies on centralized Web2&nbsp;vendors.  <p>KILT solves this — with infrastructure, UX, and interoperability baked&nbsp;in.</p> 📣 Get&nbsp;Involved <p>Whether you’re&nbsp;a:</p>  dApp Builder looking to integrate login, credentials, or document&nbsp;signing,  Ecosystem Project wanting to launch community campaigns via&nbsp;Clans,  Enterprise seeking a decentralized e-signature alternative, Digital Identity Framework integration.

<p>A sidebar is a familiar element in web design, typically positioned on the left or right side of a webpage. It provides quick access to key information, enhances user experience, and improves website functionality. However, not all sidebars are beneficial. If poorly designed, they can clutter the page, distract users, or even slow down loading speeds.</p>



<p>So, how can you make the most of a sidebar? What are the best ways to optimize it for a smoother workflow? This article will guide you through everything you need to know.</p>

 What Is a Sidebar and Why Does It Matter? 



<p>A sidebar is a section of a webpage that contains supplementary content. It can include navigation menus, article categories, ads, search boxes, and other useful widgets.</p>



<p>The role of a sidebar depends on the website type. On news sites, it helps readers find related articles. For personal blogs, it showcases post categories or featured content. In e-commerce, a sidebar often houses product filters to streamline the shopping experience.</p>



<p>According to a HubSpot study, 42% of users still rely on sidebars for navigation, while 58% focus solely on the main content. This indicates that while sidebars remain valuable, they must be thoughtfully designed to avoid reducing user engagement.</p>


 
 


 How a Sidebar Enhances User Experience 



<p>Some websites have eliminated sidebars to emphasize their primary content. However, for many, this is still essential. It offers several key benefits:</p>



 
 Faster information access: Users can find relevant content without excessive scrolling or menu navigation. This is especially useful for content-heavy sites like news portals, blogs, and forums. 



 Increased conversion rates: A well-optimized sidebar can house call-to-action (CTA) buttons, advertisements, or sign-up forms to grab attention. Crazy Egg reports that properly designed sidebars can boost click-through rates by up to 40%. 



 Better SEO performance: Internal links in sidebars help Google index content more effectively, improving website rankings on search engines.

 5 Simple Ways to Optimize Your Sidebar for Productivity 



<p>Sidebars can either streamline your workflow or create unnecessary distractions. Here are five essential tips to make yours more effective.</p>



 Prioritize Essential Content 



<p>One of the biggest mistakes in sidebar design is overcrowding it with too much information. A cluttered sidebar overwhelms users and makes it harder to find relevant content. Instead, focus on the most important elements.</p>



<p>An effective sidebar should include only a search bar, post categories, popular articles, and clear CTAs. If your site is an e-commerce platform, keep it simple by displaying only product filters and shopping cart access. Personal blogs can highlight categories and featured posts without overloading the space.</p>



 Utilize WordPress Widgets Wisely 



<p>For WordPress users, optimizing a sidebar is much easier with widgets. These built-in tools allow you to add elements like article categories, recent posts, social media links, and email sign-up forms without touching code.</p>



<p>However, not all widgets add value. Too many can clutter the page and slow down your site. Carefully select only those that truly enhance user experience.</p>



 Choose the Right Position 



<p>There’s no universal rule for sidebar placement, but statistics show that 70% of websites position it on the right. This placement prevents it from disrupting reading flow, making it the preferred choice for content-driven sites.</p>



<p>On the other hand, e-commerce sites often place sidebars on the left to make product filtering more intuitive. If your website prioritizes navigation and interactivity, consider a left sidebar.</p>



 Reduce Distractions 



<p>A sidebar should aid user navigation, not become a source of distraction. Excessive ads, animated banners, or irrelevant links can clutter the space and reduce efficiency.</p>



<p>Regularly review your sidebar and remove unnecessary elements. If ads are essential, limit them to one or two strategically placed banners rather than flooding the sidebar with promotions. Google’s research suggests that cleaner, distraction-free sidebars help retain users 30% longer.</p>



 Personalize the Sidebar Experience 



<p>Customization is key to a truly effective sidebar. Allowing users to tailor their sidebar content enhances engagement and usability.</p>



<p>For example, a blog can let users select preferred categories to display. An e-commerce site can enable shoppers to save filter settings for future searches. Personalized experiences lead to higher satisfaction and better interaction rates.</p>


 
 


 How to Create and Modify a Sidebar in WordPress 



<p>WordPress provides multiple ways to add and edit sidebars. If your theme supports sidebars, simply navigate to Appearance → Widgets, where you can drag and drop elements as needed. For more advanced customization, use the Customize tool under Appearance to preview changes in real time.</p>



<p>If your theme lacks sidebar support, you can manually edit the functions.php file or install a plugin like Simple Custom Sidebar to add new sidebar functionality.</p>



<p>Important Considerations for Design</p>



<p>A well-designed sidebar should be simple, intuitive, and distraction-free. Here are key factors to keep in mind:</p>



 
 Regular performance checks: Ensure that your sidebar genuinely enhances user experience. If it doesn’t contribute to engagement or conversions, reconsider its content and design. 



 Remove unnecessary elements: Not every website benefits from a sidebar. If it doesn’t add value, either streamline it or remove it entirely. 
 


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>A sidebar can be a powerful tool for improving navigation, boosting conversions, and enhancing SEO if used correctly. Thoughtful design and optimization ensure that it serves its purpose without overwhelming users. By implementing the five optimization tips outlined in this article, you can maximize the efficiency of yours, streamline your workflow, and create a more user-friendly website.</p>

<p>Ever wondered why a link opens in an app instead of your browser, or vice versa? Knowing how to detect if a URL opens in a browser or app is crucial for improving user experience, streamlining app development, and analyzing data effectively. Whether you’re a developer, marketer, or casual user, this quick guide offers simple, practical methods to identify URL behavior. From using tools and code to leveraging handy tips, discover how to easily detect if a <a href="https://blog.herond.org/top-fast-secure-and-best-web-browsers-to-use/">URL opens in a browser or app</a> and take control of your digital navigation!</p>



 Introduction about URL opens in browser or app 



<p>Understanding whether a URL opens in a browser or an app is essential for enhancing user experience and optimizing digital navigation. This introduction explores why detecting URL behavior matters and previews quick, effective methods to identify it.</p>



 What is URL? 



<p>A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to locate a resource on the internet, such as a webpage, image, or file. It typically consists of a protocol (e.g., https://), a domain name (e.g., www.companyabc.com), and a path to the specific resource (e.g., /page), enabling <a href="https://blog.herond.org/why-should-you-use-an-ad-blocking-browser-top-best-choices-today/">browsers or apps</a> to access and display content.</p>









 What do we need to know about URL? 



<p>To effectively navigate the internet, it’s essential to understand URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), which serve as addresses for locating online resources like webpages or files. Knowing a URL’s structure – protocol (e.g., https://), domain, and path – helps users and developers ensure seamless access to content in browsers or apps. URLs also play a key role in SEO, marketing, and security, enabling better user experience, campaign tracking, and safe browsing practices.</p>



 Why Detect If a URL Opens in a Browser or App? 



<p>Knowing how to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app is essential for enhancing user experience and improving data analysis. Understanding URL behavior ensures links function as intended, boosting efficiency across various tasks.</p>



 Common Use Cases 



 App Development: Ensuring URLs Trigger Apps (Deep Linking) 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is critical for app developers to ensure seamless deep linking, where URLs direct users to specific content within an app, such as a song in Spotify or a post in a social media app. By verifying whether a URL triggers the intended app (e.g., using schemes like “spotify://”) or falls back to a browser, developers can test and refine app functionality. This process ensures a smooth user experience and compatibility across platforms.</p>



 Digital Marketing: Tracking User Behavior Across Browsers or Apps 



<p>In digital marketing, detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app helps marketers track user behavior and optimize campaigns. Understanding whether a promotional link directs users to a mobile app (for higher engagement) or a website (for broader reach) allows for better targeting and performance analysis. For instance, a campaign link for an e-commerce app might be tested to ensure it opens the app for logged-in users or a browser for new visitors. Tools like Google Analytics or Branch.io can leverage this data to refine strategies.</p>



 Link Testing: Verifying URLs Function Correctly on Different Platforms 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is vital for link testing to ensure URLs work as intended across various platforms. SEO professionals, content creators, or QA testers need to verify that links function correctly on iOS, Android, or desktop environments. By detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app, testers can identify and fix broken links or misconfigured redirects, ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.</p>


 
 


 Benefits 



 Enhances User Experience 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app significantly improves user experience by ensuring links lead to the intended destination. For instance, a URL designed to open the Spotify app should seamlessly launch the app for users who have it installed, rather than redirecting to a browser, which can be frustrating. By confirming URL behavior, you can prevent misdirects and provide a smooth, intuitive navigation experience across devices, whether users are accessing content on iOS, Android, or desktop. This clarity makes digital interactions more enjoyable and efficient for everyone.</p>



 Optimizes Marketing Campaigns 



<p>For digital marketers, detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is key to optimizing campaign performance. Understanding whether a promotional link directs users to a mobile app (for higher engagement) or a website (for broader reach) allows marketers to tailor strategies and track user behavior effectively. For example, a campaign for an e-commerce app can be refined by ensuring links open the app for logged-in users. Tools like Google Analytics rely on this data to measure conversions, making it essential to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app for data-driven marketing success.</p>



 Supports Debugging in Web/App Development 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is crucial for developers debugging web or app functionality. Misconfigured URLs, such as those failing to trigger deep links or universal links, can disrupt app features or user flows. By verifying whether a URL opens the intended app (e.g., a payment app like PayPal) or falls back to a browser, developers can identify and fix issues like broken links or incorrect redirects. This process ensures apps and websites work seamlessly across platforms, saving time and enhancing reliability during development.</p>



 Methods to Detect If a URL Opens in a Browser or App 



<p>Below are practical methods to identify whether a URL directs to a browser or an app, ensuring seamless navigation and functionality across platforms.</p>



 Manual Testing 



 Manual Testing on Devices 



<p>Manual testing is a straightforward way to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app.</p>



 
 Open the URL on a device (smartphone, tablet, or PC) using a browser or messaging app. 



 Observe whether it launches a browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari) or an app (e.g., YouTube, Spotify). 



 Test on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, desktop) to account for app installations or settings. 



 Tip: If the app is installed, URLs like “youtube.com” may open the YouTube app; otherwise, they default to a browser. 
 



 Inspecting URL Schemes 



<p>Checking the URL’s protocol can reveal whether it’s designed for an app or browser, making it a reliable method to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app.</p>



 
 Examine the URL for app-specific schemes (e.g., “youtube://” for YouTube, “spotify://” for Spotify). 



 Use tools like Postman or a browser’s address bar to input the URL and check for redirects. 



 Verify if the device has the associated app installed, as this influences behavior. 



 Tip: Custom schemes typically trigger apps if installed; otherwise, they may prompt a browser fallback. 
 









 Using Browser Developer Tools 



<p>Browser Developer Tools offer a technical approach to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, perfect for developers needing detailed insights.</p>



 
 Open the URL in a browser and access Developer Tools (press F12 or right-click &gt; Inspect). 



 Check the “Network” tab for redirects or app-specific responses. 



 Run navigator.userAgent in the console to identify the environment (browser or app). 



 Tip: Use extensions like “User-Agent Switcher” to simulate app environments for testing. 
 



 Leveraging Analytics or SDKs 



<p>Analytics tools and SDKs provide automated ways to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, ideal for marketers and developers tracking user flows.</p>



 
 Integrate tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel to monitor where users land (browser or app). 



 Use SDKs like Branch.io or Firebase Dynamic Links to track deep link behavior. 



 Check platform-specific configs, such as Apple’s Universal Links or Android’s App Links. 



 Tip: These tools log detailed data, helping confirm whether a URL triggers an app or browser. 
 



 Using Online Tools or Extensions 



<p>Online tools and browser extensions simplify the process to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, especially for non-technical users.</p>



 
 Use tools like Redirect Checker or URL Profiler to analyze URL paths and redirects. 



 Install browser extensions like “User-Agent Switcher” to mimic app or browser environments. 



 Test the URL across different devices or emulators to verify behavior. 



 Tip: Ensure tools are updated to support modern app protocols for accurate results. 
 



 Tips for Optimizing URL Detection 



<p>To effectively detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, applying optimization techniques ensures accuracy, efficiency, and a seamless process. These practical tips help streamline URL behavior analysis for developers, marketers, and everyday users, enhancing workflows and user experiences across platforms.</p>



 Test Across Multiple Platforms 



<p>URL behavior can vary depending on the device or operating system. So cross-platform testing is crucial to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app.</p>



 
 Test URLs on iOS, Android, and desktop devices to observe differences. 



 Check if apps like YouTube or Spotify are installed, as this affects whether the URL opens in the app or browser. 



 Use emulators or virtual devices to simulate environments without physical hardware. 



 Tip: Document results for each platform to identify patterns and ensure consistent behavior. 
 



 Use Analytics Tools for Insights 



<p>Analytics tools provide valuable data to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, especially for tracking user behavior in marketing or app development.</p>



 
 Integrate Google Analytics or Mixpanel to monitor where users land after clicking a URL. 



 Set up event tracking to capture app launches versus browser redirects. 



 Analyze reports to identify trends, such as higher app engagement on mobile devices. 



 Tip: Use UTM parameters in URLs to track specific campaigns and their outcomes. 
 


 
 


 Optimize Deep Linking 



<p>Deep linking ensures URLs direct users to specific app content, and optimizing this process helps accurately detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app.</p>



 
 Configure Universal Links (iOS) or App Links (Android) correctly in app settings. 



 Test deep links with tools like Branch.io or Firebase Dynamic Links to confirm app triggers. 



 Verify fallback behavior to ensure URLs open in a browser if the app isn’t installed. 



 Tip: Regularly update app configurations to align with platform changes. 
 



 Ensure Security Checks 



<p>Security is critical when testing URLs to detect if a URL opens in a browser or an app, as malicious links can harm devices or compromise data.</p>



 
 Verify URLs come from trusted sources to avoid phishing or malware risks. 



 Use URL scanners like VirusTotal to check for suspicious behavior before testing. 



 Enable browser security features or extensions like Herond Shield for safe navigation. 



 Tip: Avoid testing unverified URLs on personal devices; use a sandbox environment instead. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Detecting if a URL opens in a browser or an app is a vital skill for enhancing user experiences, optimizing marketing campaigns, and streamlining app development. From manual testing and inspecting URL schemes to using browser tools, analytics, and extensions, the methods outlined in this guide make it easy to identify URL behavior accurately. Start applying these techniques today to ensure seamless navigation across platforms!</p>

<p>On 29 May 2025, the US Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), sanctioned an entity called Funnull along with an associated individual, Liu Lizhi. Funnull is a Philippines-based cloud infrastructure provider that allegedly serves thousands of illicit websites such as phishing sites, fake trading apps, gambling websites, and pig butchering scams. In the accompanying <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0149">press release</a>, OFAC stated that Funnull has directly facilitated $200 million in victim-reported losses from pig butchering scams.<br><br>According to OFAC, Funnull has acquired IP addresses from mainstream cloud service providers to sell to cybercriminals to host illicit content. It is, therefore, reportedly a key enabler of so-called "infrastructure laundering", whereby cybercriminals relay their malicious traffic through U.S. cloud providers. The majority of cryptocurrency investment scam websites reported to the FBI are linked to Funnull.&nbsp;<br><br>Funnull also provides additional services to cybercriminals such as automatically generating large numbers of similar website names and web design templates. Furthermore, Funnell obtained a code repository that allows web developers to maliciously alter code to redirect visitors of legitimate websites to scam ones, some of which OFAC was able to link to Chinese criminal money laundering.<br><br>As part of this action, OFAC sanctioned two cryptocurrency addresses on Ethereum and Tron. The two addresses have received more than $4 million.<br><br>The sanctioned Tron address has received funds directly from Huione Pay, part of Huione Group, which was recently found by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to be an <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-u.s.-treasury-finds-huione-group-to-be-of-primary-money-laundering-concern">entity of primary money laundering concern</a>. Huione Pay is a payments and foreign exchange business, which our <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/cyber-scam-marketplace">previous research</a> has linked to laundering of the proceeds of pig butchering scams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seattle: MAY 28,2025:&nbsp;Indicio is delighted to announce that Will Groah has joined the <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> Board of Directors to help the company chart its expansion as a global leader in decentralized identity technology and biometric authentication.</p>
<p>Will comes to Indicio with considerable experience in defense, national security, and technology, and having successfully built a company from zero to 300 employees with a successful exit. He has extensive experience in nurturing technology startups to sustainability and beyond.</p>
<p>“Will is one of Indicio’s earliest champions,” said Indicio CEO Heather Dahl. “He saw the transformative power of the technology we were building and how it could be deployed across every sector. Just as important, he also saw the strength of the team behind it —&nbsp;and our approach to business and our customers.”</p>
<p>“It’s easy to be carried away by new technology and to have visions,” said Will, “but it’s another thing to carry out technology transformation. That requires sweat, dedication, and really effective teamwork. I could already see decentralized identity as an era-defining technology —&nbsp;it makes the exchange of information, the underlying architecture of the digital world, faster, safer, and more streamlined —&nbsp;and that has a host of benefits. But with Indicio, I saw this vision becoming reality through an extraordinary display of willpower, talent, and ambition. That’s why I couldn’t wait to get onboard to contribute.“</p>
<p>Indicio has the energy of a juggernaut — and this team’s optimism, their astounding speed at problem solving and delivery, their total dedication to customers no matter what timezone — it’s all inspiring. They’ve proven the technology, the business model, and the ability to execute with global partners and customers. And now the market is taking off. At Indicio, it’s afterburner time — and I’m here for it.”</p>
<p>Will is a board member, advisor, and investor to several high-growth healthtech, sportstech, and fintech segments. Current projects include advising the development of a regional hospital system’s innovation division, board and advisor for sports tech management start-ups, and coaching.</p>
<p>“Will is a tremendous asset to Indicio because he brings so much experience with startup technology companies and with our investors,” said Ken Ebert, CTO at Indicio. Every team member has a deep appreciation for his insights, enthusiasm, and support. He is as tireless as we are and continually pushes us to think in novel ways and to formulate new applications and approaches to scale our business.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s a bigger picture to the technology and solutions Indicio is implementing,” said Will. “It’s one where the world is being unnecessarily taxed by legacy technologies and approaches to identity and data. Taxed in terms of cost, taxed in terms of friction, taxed in terms of frustration. Indicio has created a technology for trust that eliminates this tax, leaving the world in a much better place. Better for business, because it is so much more efficient to act on trusted data. Better for people, because everything is simpler and seamless and more secure, and they have control over their personal data. Everything is trustworthy — provable and proven. I’m honored — along with a stellar team of advisors —to be helping Indicio build this future.”</p>
<p>Will joins Tom Plofchan as a strategic advisor. <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/former-pangiam-managing-partner-and-chief-investment-officer-tom-plofchan-joins-indicio-as-a-strategic-advisor-to-guide-decentralized-digital-identity-strategy/">Read Tom’s announcement here.</a></p>

<p>You’ve no doubt heard the saying, ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket’, but have you ever thought how it applies to data privacy?</p>



<p>The egg/basket advice is basically about spreading risk and diversifying assets, right? If all your valuables (eggs) are in one place (basket) and that place is compromised (basket breaks), you’ll lose all your valuables. Eggs are fragile and baskets break, so you’re facing a real risk, but it’s one you can easily mitigate by spreading your eggs across more baskets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>And that’s where the link to data privacy comes in. If we put all our personal information in one place (the internet) by using it everywhere we interact online, then we risk losing all that information in one incident (data breach, identity theft, credit card fraud etc.). What’s more, we risk having it correlated by data brokers or ad tech, stolen by hackers, or sold by the service operator itself.</p>



<p>Here’s how it works: data broking services can collect enough data to determine (or infer) a user’s legal identity online, then they can track that user across the many different services and sites they access. By tracking users in this manner, these applications can correlate enough datapoints to assemble the full set of <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information (PII)</a> about the user. This PII can divulge highly sensitive information about the user, such as medical history, personal finance, employment, social relationships and so on. Usually, this type of PII is information the user would prefer to remain private (at least outside of the context in which they want it to be used). On top of that, the user is at risk of those applications storing the information indefinitely, selling it to other organizations, or having it exposed through a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breach</a>.</p>



<p>So, in our digital lives, ‘Don’t put all your eggs in one basket’ is really talking about compartmentalization—categorizing and separating our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal data</a> into many different compartments to reduce the impact when it is compromised. Compartmentalization recognizes no system is perfect, breaches are always possible, so it’s wise to manage the risk. You might lose an egg or two, but you won’t lose them all.</p>



<p>Compartmentalization is widely regarded as the most powerful way to protect personal information. It means limiting access to information to only those people or organizations who need it in order to perform a certain task or function. Originating in the military with classified information, the concept can be further understood with another military term: ‘managing the blast radius’. In information security, compartmentalization is equally about spreading the risk so if there’s any impact (breach) we’ve limited the damage to our personal information and the harm and recovery effort are far less.</p>



<p>We already compartmentalize in the offline world. We organize our closets (socks in one drawer, gym clothes in another), our banking (separate accounts for everyday expenses, bills, savings and emergencies), and our email (filed in folders). We even compartmentalize our daily interactions (work/social) and our weekend activities (social engagements vs. family time). Compartmentalization in the online world is essentially the same—but arguably far more urgent.</p>



<p>Compartmentalization gives people control.Our digital privacy can feel as fragile as those eggs, but we can act to protect it in much the same way by separating our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a> into different compartments and limiting impact.</p>



<p>MySudo app makes compartmentalization simple.The <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a> app is based on the concept of a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo digital identity</a> that allows users to talk, text, email, browse and pay privately and securely. A Sudo is a customizable digital identity that intentionally differentiates from a user’s legal identity and mitigates the risk to that user’s highly sensitive PII.</p>



<p>We all have many online accounts, and when we repeatedly use the same personal information to access these accounts, they become linked together. If a breach occurs on just one of those accounts, all our other accounts and their associated data are also at risk of being compromised.</p>



<p>Users can create up to <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">nine different Sudos</a> and use them in any context (e.g. for banking, selling on classifieds, catching up with friends, and booking travel). MySudo is compartmentalization at its simplest and best.</p>

 What Fortnite’s Darth Vader Reveals About the Future of AI NPCs 



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite?lang=en-US">Fortnite made headlines by introducing a voice-interactive Darth Vader NPC powered by AI</a>. Using advanced voice synthesis and language models, players could speak directly to Vader and receive real-time, dynamic responses. While groundbreaking, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-risks-potential-disney-epic-games-2025-5">this move also sparked debate</a>, especially around voice actor rights, AI safety, and content moderation.</p>



<p>At Union Avatars, we’ve been working on similar AI-powered NPCs in collaboration with NVIDIA, but with a core difference: we’re building tools designed to empower creators and companies to ethically bring avatars to life.</p>



 A New Era for NPCs 



<p>Through our partnership with NVIDIA ACE (Avatar Cloud Engine), we’re enabling developers to transform any 3D character into an intelligent, interactive NPC with:</p>



 
 Conversational AI that responds naturally and contextually 



 Custom 3D avatars, created from a selfie or designed from scratch 



 Real-time voice and animation, powered by NVIDIA’s Audio2Face technologies 
 



<p>Whether you’re building a game, a virtual store, or an educational platform, our tech makes it easy to create lifelike NPCs that feel truly human.</p>



 What Makes Our Approach Different? 



<p>Unlike the Darth Vader case, where concerns have been raised about replacing voice actors and lack of control over AI behavior, we focus on creator control, transparency, and ethical deployment. Here’s how:</p>



 
 Consent and custom voice options: use your own voice or synthetic voices with full permissions 



 Full behavior control: define what your NPC can or can’t say, with safe and brand-aligned prompts 



 No-code setup: our AI NPC system is accessible to both developers and creative teams 
 



 The Future of NPCs Is Here 



<p>We believe AI-powered avatars are not just a trend, they’re a new creative frontier. Whether it’s a helpful shop assistant in a virtual store or a or a front desk assistant in a hotel, Union Avatars is building the tools to make them possible.</p>



<p>Want to see it in action?</p>



 

 



 Ready to Build Smarter NPCs? 



<p>With Union Avatars and NVIDIA ACE, the future of interactive characters is already here. Whether you’re creating games, virtual worlds, or branded experiences, we give you the tools to bring AI-powered avatars to life ethically, creatively, and at scale.</p>

<p>When it comes to compliance, decentralization is changing the game. As regulations tighten and cyber threats grow, financial institutions are turning to innovations like edge computing, self-sovereign digital identity (SSI), and AI-powered transaction monitoring with blockchain-secured logs to protect sensitive data and streamline KYC, KYB, and AML processes.</p>



<p>These technologies make compliance not only stronger but smarter—here’s how they’re reshaping the future of risk management.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



 1. Edge Computing: Secure Data at the Source 



<p>Traditional compliance systems transmit customer data to multiple cloud servers and subprocessors—introducing risks along the way.</p>



<p>Edge computing eliminates those vulnerabilities by encrypting and verifying data directly on the user’s device or at a local edge node before it’s ever transmitted. This means:</p>



 
 Minimal data exposure: Sensitive information never travels further than it needs to. 



 Faster processing: Verification happens in real-time, cutting down delays in customer onboarding. 



 Built-in compliance: Local data processing aligns with regulations like GDPR and CCPA by keeping data within jurisdictional boundaries. 
 



<p>&nbsp;</p>



 2. Self-Sovereign Digital Identity: Empowering Customers and Reducing Risk 



<p>SSI puts customers in control of their own verified identity data. Instead of handing over unnecessary personal information during onboarding, customers share only what’s needed through secure, verifiable credentials.</p>



<p>For compliance teams, this means:</p>



 
 Less liability: No need to store excessive customer data, reducing your exposure in the event of a breach. 



 Enhanced verification: SSI credentials are cryptographically secure and harder to forge. 



 Better customer experience: Clients appreciate the transparency and convenience of sharing verified information without repeated forms or unnecessary data requests. 
 



<p>&nbsp;</p>



 3. AI-Powered Transaction Monitoring and Blockchain-Secured Logs 



<p>Blockchain-secured transaction logs provide an immutable, transparent record of transactions, while AI-powered monitoring enhances fraud detection. Instead of static or batch reviews, AI scans blockchain-based records in real-time to:</p>



 
 Identify complex transaction patterns that signal money laundering. 



 Flag connections to sanctioned individuals or flagged entities. 



 Analyze historical and current data simultaneously to detect trends, not just single red flags. 
 



<p>The combination of blockchain’s tamper-proof nature and AI’s processing power strengthens audit trails and improves AML screening accuracy without increasing manual workloads.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



 The Decentralized Advantage 



<p>Edge computing ensures that data stays local. SSI reduces your liability footprint by decentralizing identity control. AI-powered monitoring transforms static reports into proactive, real-time risk detection. Together, these innovations make compliance faster, more secure, and more customer-friendly—without compromising on privacy or performance.</p>



<p>Decentralization isn’t just the future of compliance—it’s happening now. With iComply’s platform, you can embrace these innovations to strengthen your KYC, KYB, and AML processes. Let’s lead the way to a more secure, decentralized future.</p>

				 <p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>As more governments step into the world of digital credentials, the Mobile Driver’s Licence (mDL), is emerging as the first credential that many people will likely carry in their digital wallets. But a digital driver’s license isn’t the whole journey when it comes to digital identity: It’s just one of many different digital credentials that we’ll use to prove who we are and to share data in a verifiable, tamper-proof way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicio-offers-a-variety-of-verifiable-credential-protocols-tools-and-building-blocks/">Indicio supports the widest possible range</a> of open standards, credential formats, and advanced communication protocols for deploying decentralized identity: SD-JWT, W3C Verifiable Credentials, AnonCreds, JSON-LD, Open Badges 3.0,&nbsp; DIDComm, OID4VC, and yes, mDL.</p>
<p>Because real-world identity isn’t a single road. It’s a map of different paths, winding through industries, ecosystems, and use cases.</p>
<p>Here, we explain why mdoc/mDL is joining the list of technologies supported in the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a>® technology stack.</p>
 mdoc/mDL 
<p>A Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) is a type of document that resides on a mobile device, generically known as an mdoc. Thus, an mDL is a particular type of mdoc, one that enables the attributes of a driver’s license to be held on a mobile device in a machine-readable way. The mDL is specified by the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021</a> standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presently, 30 U.S. states <a href="https://www.aamva.org/jurisdiction-data-maps#anchorformdlmap">have implemented or are implementing</a> mDLs. In March 2025, the European Union’s Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20250324IPR27462/road-safety-deal-for-modern-eu-driving-licence-rules">mandated</a> a uniform mobile driving licence that will work with EU-specified digital wallets by 2030.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of an mDL include:</p>
 
 Improved security: Each time you present an mDL for verification, it generates a new cryptographic presentation of the data.&nbsp; 
 Interoperability: As an mDL follows the international mdoc standard, it can be used across states and countries. All mDLs have the same data structure and are verified in the same way. A <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202505/new-zealand-integrates-international-mdls-for-age-id-verification">recent example of the mDL’s interoperability</a> comes from New Zealand’s NZ Verify App, which enables mDL credentials issued from a growing list of regions to be verified. 
 Offline availability: An mDL is designed to be either presented online or in person using Bluetooth Low Energy or NFC for “tap &amp; go,” “scan &amp; request,” or “tap &amp; hold” interactions with an electronic mDL reader, which allows an mDL to be verified without either party needing to be online. 
 Privacy: The mDL allows data in the license to be selectively disclosed, so you can share just your age or address, for example, without revealing anything else. 
 
<p>One peculiarity: part of the mDL spec ensures that issuers —&nbsp;governmenst — can’t see where licenses are being verified, so a specific holder can’t be tracked and profiled; but, another part of the spec also makes this possible, so user privacy is dependent on how a specific mDL instance is implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 When an mDL/mdoc isn’t the best fit 
<p>If your identity authentication needs require more information than that contained in a driver’s license, then you need to use Verifiable Credentials (VC). These&nbsp; can be configured to hold different kinds of data in a tamper-proof way, including biometrics, and can use secure communication protocols for semantically rich interaction between credential holders, issuers, and verifiers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you can create a digital equivalent of a passport with a Verifiable Credential, and you can integrate that with other credentials (such as a visa and boarding pass credential) to share more complex data. An mDL is and always will be just a driver’s license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mdoc format does not have the same flexibility in terms of data formats or communication protocols. If you are a school district issuing staff IDs or a company setting up passwordless login, Verifiable Credentials are a better option. Similarly, if you want to issue diplomas or certificates, the Open Badges 3.0 format meets these specific needs best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mdoc/mDL is also a comparatively complex technical specification to implement, whereas a simple VC solution can be up and running in hours and a country-level deployment can be implemented in a few weeks.</p>
 One credential will not rule them all 
<p>We’re not moving toward a world where one credential will rule all use cases. We’re heading toward a world where different credentials work together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments are issuing mDLs but they will also issue digital passport credentials (ICAO DTC Type 2 credentials). Many organizations will want to implement DIDComm to take advantage of secure communication with credential holders, or they may choose to use OID4VC to take advantage of their existing authentication protocols.</p>
<p>Each use case brings its own needs for implementation, interoperability, privacy, simplicity, and usability.</p>
 Indicio connects digital identities 
<p>Indicio was the<a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/"> first to successfully combine</a> two key global credential formats and protocols in a single workflow for international travel: DTC Type 1 using AnonCreds and DIDComm and IATA One ID using OID4VC.</p>
<p>Now, we’re adding mdoc/mDL to our stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re committed to giving our customers the best solution for their needs and to making that solution interoperable.</p>
<p>Whether you’re just getting started or already deep into development, we’re here to help you choose the right specifications and credentials for your project—and make sure they work seamlessly with everything else.</p>

			<p>Luxembourg &amp; San Salvador, El Salvador, 27 May 2025 – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leading provider of onchain finance solutions, has been selected by <a href="https://ditobanx.com/">Ditobanx</a>, a licensed Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) in El Salvador, to facilitate the successful launch of <a href="https://www.coingt.com/">COINGT</a>, a $325 million tokenized infrastructure initiative.</p>
<p>Backed by shares in the Interoceanic Corridor of Guatemala (CIG), the token represents a major milestone in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and sets a new standard for blockchain-driven infrastructure financing in Latin America.</p>
<p>The launch of COINGT was carried out under <a href="https://cnad.gob.sv/es/issuances/">the regulatory approval</a> of the National Digital Assets Commission of El Salvador, leveraging the country’s forward-thinking legal framework for digital assets.</p>

		 
	 
    Every market is different, and local leadership is essential. This launch is a perfect example: we provide the technology, while Ditobanx brings the regulatory expertise, market access, and everything else needed to make tokenization work smoothly. Latin America has huge potential, and infrastructure is the foundation for its growth. By making financing more accessible, Ditobanx is accelerating regional development in a way that was previously out of reach.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>CIG is a transformative infrastructure project connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through a 372-kilometer corridor. The initiative includes two deep-sea ports, a double-track railway, a hydrocarbon pipeline, and large-scale industrial and logistics zones. Designed to position Guatemala as a key logistics and energy hub, the project is expected to have significant economic and social impact across Central America.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokenization opens up financial access. Infrastructure financing has long been inaccessible to many, especially in developing regions. Through COINGT, we’re enabling local and international investors to participate in a transformative project that will reshape trade, logistics, and opportunity across Central America.  Guillermo ContrerasCEO of Ditobanx    
	 
		 
			<p>El Salvador is moving beyond Bitcoin headlines and quietly building the first regulated digital asset economy in the region. With Ditobanx as a licensed DASP and Tokeny providing the white-label and institutional-grade onchain finance operating system, COINGT demonstrates how regulatory clarity, onchain compliance, and local operators can work together to bring real-world tokenization to life. It offers a blueprint for how other emerging markets can unlock capital through compliant tokenization innovation.</p>

		 
	 
   
	 
		 
			 About Ditobanx

<p>This is the final post in a four-part series exploring decentralization not as a buzzword, but as a series of hard tradeoffs that digital infrastructure teams, architects, and strategy leads must navigate.</p>



 
 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/07/engineering-vs-economics/">Engineering Meets Economics</a>, we explored why resilience depends on the ability to shift between centralized and decentralized systems, not cling to one model. 



 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/13/the-cost-of-decentralization/">How Decentralized Are You Willing to Pay For?</a>, we talked about the very real costs of optionality: complexity, coordination, and duplicated capabilities. 



 And in <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/20/redefining-success/">Redefining Success</a>, we looked at why our success metrics often reinforce centralization—even when it’s no longer serving us. 
 



<p>So if we know decentralization has value, and we know it’s technically feasible… why does it still fail in practice?<br>Because the tech might be ready, but governance is lagging behind. This makes sense because governance means politics, and politics are hard.</p>



 Decentralization Doesn’t Mean Disorder 



<p>Most enterprise folks hear “decentralization” and think:</p>



 
 Increased risk 



 Lack of visibility 



 Slower coordination 



 No one in charge when something breaks 
 



<p>But that’s not a property of decentralization; it’s a symptom of missing or immature governance.</p>



<p>We see this all the time in digital identity:</p>



 
 A federation that works technically, but has no process for resolving disputes 



 A wallet ecosystem that’s privacy-preserving, but can’t agree on what metadata is mandatory 



 An access system that’s delegated, but lacks revocation mechanisms that everyone honors 
 



<p>If you’re a technologist, this probably sounds familiar. Governance gaps show up as operational issues: broken policy syncs, inconsistent audit trails, revocation flows that only work in theory. If your service mesh or access broker assumes everyone interprets “suspend access” the same way—but no one agreed on what that means—you’ve built an elegant mess.</p>



<p>When decentralization fails, it’s often not because the protocols were bad. It’s because we didn’t define who gets to decide, update, delegate, or enforce—and under what terms.</p>



 Governance Is Infrastructure 



<p>If decentralization is the design pattern, governance is the scaffolding.</p>



<p>And here’s the important part: we already know how to build decentralized tech. The internet itself is built on decentralized protocols: DNS, BGP, email, and even identity federations. We have working models. We know how to distribute trust and authority technically.</p>



<p>What’s missing isn’t architecture, it’s agreement.</p>



<p>We can make it happen at scale. But without governance, decentralization becomes friction, not flexibility.</p>



<p>Governance defines:</p>



 
 Who holds authority 



 How power shifts over time 



 What happens when participants disagree 



 How trust is established and withdrawn 
 



<p>For CIOs and digital strategy leaders, it’s a core risk management issue. Weak governance delays implementation. It also increases legal exposure, regulatory risk, and recovery costs when things go wrong. It makes vendor transitions expensive. And it turns architecture decisions into lock-in faster than most teams realize.</p>



<p>In enterprise environments, we already know how to manage distributed control.</p>



 
 We decentralize org charts … with reporting lines, SLAs, and escalation paths 



 We allow teams to own systems … within shared standards and budgets 



 We outsource critical functions … with contracts and enforcement mechanisms 
 



<p>We don’t expect everyone to act independently. We expect them to act accountably within a structure.<br>I think we should treat digital infrastructure the same way.</p>



 Examples Worth Learning From 



<p>Across the identity and trust space, we’re starting to see governance taken seriously as more than a compliance exercise. It’s a strategic enabler for an organization.</p>



 
 The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/get-involved/working-group-activity/">Trust Over IP Foundation’s Governance Stack Working Group</a> is actively developing models and interoperability standards for governance frameworks that support legal, business, and social trust. Their work includes templates and specifications for governance architecture, trust assurance, and certification—tools that make decentralized systems both usable and accountable. 



 Projects like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/scitt/about/">SCITT</a> at the IETF are tackling supply chain integrity by designing trust architectures that include not just technical assertions, but clear governance of who can issue, verify, and rely on those assertions. 



 Wallet ecosystems are (slowly) recognizing that success will depend not just on cryptography, but on common rules for inclusion, suspension, and dispute resolution. 
 



<p>If you work in identity, you’ve probably seen this up close: great protocols with no shared process for trust anchors, no agreement on metadata, no real mechanism for shared accountability. We don’t need another working group (says someone who loves to manage working groups). We need rules for when and how trust changes.</p>



<p>Identity professionals often sit closest to the tension and are best positioned to help shape how governance gets built. If you’re part of IAM, you’re part of the governance problem and the solution. Don’t wait for someone else to define the structure you’ll be bound by later.</p>



 What Governance in Decentralization Means for Your Team 



<p>If you’re building toward decentralization, whether in authentication, cloud strategy, data sharing, or infrastructure, ask yourself:</p>



 
 Who gets to define the rules of engagement? 



 What happens when two participants disagree? 



 How does a new participant join—and how can they be removed? 



 Are you solving the governance questions before the technical ones lock you in? 
 



<p>The hard part isn’t building the system—again, we kind of know how to do that—but deciding who can change it later.</p>



 Final Thought: Governance Is Not Overhead, It’s Capability 



<p>If you take only one thing from this series, let it be this: Resilience isn’t just a technical attribute. It’s a governance capability.</p>



<p>I’ve spent this series talking about how to shift, how much flexibility costs, and what we’re incentivized to build. But none of that matters if no one agrees on how to share control when it counts.</p>



<p>The good news? Governance is designable. It doesn’t need to be perfect. It needs to be intentional, so decentralization becomes a strength, not a source of uncertainty.</p>



<p>Because when the tech is ready but the governance isn’t, you don’t have a distributed system. You have a political standoff, and nothing gets done.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Hey everybody. Welcome back. This is the third episode in our series on centralization and decentralization and the balance between the two.</p>



<p>If you’re just tuning in now, here’s what you’ve missed:</p>



 
 In episode one, we explored why resilience isn’t about being centralized or decentralized. It’s about being able to move between the two models when circumstances change. 



 In episode two, we looked at the real cost of building that kind of flexibility. Because optionality isn’t free. It takes planning, coordination, and a willingness to invest before you need it. 
 



 



 Why Is Decentralization Often a Hard Sell? 



<p>[00:01:01]<br>And that brings us to today’s topic. Why is decentralization often still such a hard sell, especially inside enterprises?</p>



<p>[00:01:09]<br>One answer is that most of our success metrics reward centralization.</p>



<p>[00:01:15]<br>If we don’t challenge how we’re defining success, we’re going to keep optimizing for systems that look great—right up until the point that they don’t.</p>



 



 Centralization and Scale 



<p>[00:01:22]<br>Let’s talk about that in tech. We don’t just love things at scale; we know how to do things at scale fairly well.</p>



<p>[00:01:31]<br>When we’re working with centralized systems, we know the playbook:</p>



 
 Throw more hardware at it 



 Replicate the databases 



 Spin things up in other regions 



 Set up failovers, caching, and routing magic to absorb traffic 
 



<p>And that totally works—up to a point. Even when control is centralized, we’re very good at scaling the infrastructure around it.</p>



<p>[00:01:50]<br>When it comes to decentralized models, we know how to do that too. We just don’t plan that way as often.</p>



<p>[00:01:56]<br>At least not anymore. Think about the protocols from the early days of the Internet: DNS, BGP, SMTP. They’re not flawless or simple, but they work at global scale because they were built to distribute control and survive failure.</p>



<p>[00:02:14]<br>Everyone gets a piece of the responsibilities in those protocols. Everyone can operate within a shared structure. That’s decentralized centralization, and we did it really well.</p>



 



 The Problem with Success Metrics 



<p>[00:02:25]<br>But now, today’s challenge: most of the success metrics we use today, especially in enterprise systems, still push us towards centralization.</p>



<p>[00:02:33]<br>Why? Because it looks faster, is easier to explain, and is a lot easier to report on.</p>



<p>[00:02:40]<br>But when success is only measured by how tightly we can control the system, we end up building architectures that aren’t particularly flexible. And that’s a problem.</p>



 



 Centralization Helped Us Grow—But Does It Still? 



<p>[00:02:49]<br>Now let’s step back for a moment. You might be thinking, “Well, yes, but centralization is what helped us grow as a company, helped us grow at speed.” And yes, you are absolutely right. Centralization often is what helps organizations move fast, simplify complexity, and work at scale. It gives you:</p>



 
 Clean handoffs 



 Predictable systems 



 Fewer moving parts 



 Optimized performance without needing to get everyone to agree on everything 
 



<p>And when you’re trying to move quickly, those things are real advantages.</p>



<p>[00:03:19]<br>But the thing is, those advantages—whether from your infrastructure perspective or your market perspective—don’t last forever.</p>



<p>[00:03:30]<br>Markets might shift, regulations might change, vendor lock-in might become a liability, and the systems that helped you grow start to hold you back.</p>



<p>[00:03:40]<br>There’s a great idea from supply chain strategy that applies here: the faster your environment moves, the more important it becomes to reconfigure quickly.</p>



<p>[00:03:48]<br>And that’s where centralized success starts to crack—not because it failed technically, but because it couldn’t adapt fast enough.</p>



<p>[00:03:56]<br>So the question isn’t, “Didn’t centralization help us grow?” It’s, “Can we keep growing without the ability to be a little bit more flexible?”</p>



 



 Decentralization in Organizations 



<p>[00:04:07]<br>It’s kind of funny—we decentralize all the time, but just not when it comes to our infrastructure and definitely not our identity infrastructures.</p>



<p>Inside organizations, we break up control and distribute responsibility on purpose:</p>



 
 Teams have their own budgets 



 Product groups make roadmap decisions 



 Key performance indicators are set at the department level, not just at the company level 
 



<p>[00:04:31]<br>Why? Because trying to control everything from the top down slows you down. It’s more sustainable to align goals than to micromanage every function.</p>



<p>Take a typical enterprise product org as an example. One team focuses on mobile, another on partner integrations, a third on internal tooling. Each team moves independently within shared priorities. They don’t all escalate to the CIO to push code; they’re trusted to make decisions locally based on their goals and context. We don’t call that chaos—we call that autonomy and maturity.</p>



<p>[00:05:05]<br>Think of it like a city: every neighborhood has its own character, maybe its own rules, but they follow the same traffic lights, zoning laws, public services. That’s decentralization with coordination.</p>



<p>[00:05:17]<br>The control, to an extent, is distributed. If we can do this with people and even in governments—if we can handle distributed authority in complex orgs—why does decentralizing infrastructure sometimes feel so risky? It’s not because we can’t do it. It’s because we haven’t applied the same thinking to systems that we apply to teams of people.</p>



 



 Building Flexibility into Identity 



<p>[00:05:42]<br>If centralization has been our default version of success, what does success look like when you build in the flexibility to decentralize?</p>



<p>[00:05:50]<br>It doesn’t mean blowing up your current architecture, because that would probably be bad and you wouldn’t get very far.</p>



<p>[00:05:56]<br>It doesn’t mean ditching your identity provider or rebuilding everything from scratch, because that also wouldn’t make you very popular and probably wouldn’t get you very far. But it does mean designing for modularity and movement.</p>



<p>[00:06:07]<br>A successful, flexible identity system might include:</p>



 
 Federated logins that work across partners but don’t collapse if one party changes their trust model 



 Credential issuance that’s anchored to your core directory but usable outside your domain 



 Policy enforcement that supports delegation, so different teams or regions can adapt without rewriting global configurations 



 Flexible authentication layers that can shift to support new protocols without breaking legacy systems 
 



<p>[00:06:42]<br>Another good example of flexible identity systems that don’t require a centralized focus.</p>



<p>[00:06:49]<br>Ask yourself in your organization:</p>



 
 Can you change identity providers without breaking logins for 50,000 users? 



 Can you delegate trust without rerouting everything through one central system? 
 



<p>[00:07:03]<br>Are you prepared to adapt when legal or business requirements shift, or will you end up frozen and need to make a plan on the fly?</p>



<p>[00:07:14]<br>Being able to say “yes” to those things—that’s what success with flexibility looks like.</p>



 



 Key Takeaways 



<p>[00:07:25]<br>You don’t have to decentralize everything—and probably shouldn’t. But if your architecture can accommodate controlled divergence and flexibility, you’re set up for long-term success.</p>



<p>[00:07:43]<br>That’s what matters. That’s what’s really cool.</p>



<p>[00:07:46]<br>Here’s the takeaway from today.</p>



<p>[00:07:50]<br>Centralization isn’t the enemy. But if success only counts as scale, simplicity, or speed, that story can get brittle quickly.</p>



<p>[00:08:03]<br>We already know how to decentralize in our org charts and delegate decisions without chaos. We just haven’t always brought that thinking into our infrastructure and identity systems—but we could.</p>



<p>[00:08:15]<br>Success doesn’t have to mean one system to rule them all. It can mean systems that adapt without starting over. That adaptability only works when you’ve got governance built in to support it.</p>



<p>[00:08:30]<br>Our technology is almost good enough—sometimes more than good enough. But shared control takes more than configuration files. It takes structure, accountability, and intention.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts 



<p>[00:08:53]<br>And remember, resilient systems don’t just run well—they recover well and grow on purpose.</p>

<p>Are you curious to know about the Fake ID Checkers and their role in shaping the future of identity verification? If yes! This comprehensive blog post is for you.”</p>
<p>In this age, when there is a large number of methods to prevent fraud, <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-verification-playground/">Fake ID scanners</a> have enhanced productivity at work. These scanners, being utilized by many agencies and other institutions controlling the finance.</p>
<p>However, did you ever think, how these scanners work? What is the key technology behind them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as our doubt goes, you will respond, No!. To convert your no into a yes, we have created this comprehensive blog post for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buckle up! You have to read this guide comprehensively…..</p>
 What are Fake ID Checkers? 
<p>After reading this name, you would have understood their purpose. Fake ID scanners are online digital tools that are used to determine whether the ID documents presented by users are real or fake. These scanners are used for the <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-recognition-sdk/">ID document recognition SDK</a>.</p>
<p>Driven by sophisticated algorithms, these tools are not immune to committing errors. They always provide you with accurate results. When it comes to facial ID recognition, these detectors have brightened the future of this innovative technology used for security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key Technologies Behind the Fake ID Checkers 
<p>Now, it’s time to reveal how these ID scanners play their role in ID document liveness detection SDK. We will introduce you to some technologies behind them.</p>
 1. Optical Character Recognition 
<p>If you are in the ocean of technology, you must have heard about this cutting-edge innovation. Basically, OCR is about extracting text from images and other documents within a few seconds, optimizing the workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fake ID Scanners are integrated to this technology. When ID documents are represented to these scanners, they effectively extract their engraved text for further verification. After this extraction, the system ensures their realness or fakeness and marks these documents for further processing.</p>
<p>So, let’s have a very simple question: Have you ever heard about this innovative technology, OCR? Don’t forget to tell….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Facial ID Recognition 
<p>A critical part of the confirmation procedure is matching the face on the document with the person presenting it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facial ID recognition technology compares the photo on the ID with a live selfie or video of the user. Advanced systems use liveness detection to ensure the selfie isn’t a photo or video replay, minimizing deceiving efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This biometric authentication step adds a layer of security, especially for digital platforms that don’t have a physical presence to manually inspect IDs. In combination with document analysis, facial ID recognition offers a holistic approach to identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Deeper Analysis of Documents 
<p>Fake ID checkers go beyond superficial examination. They analyze fake ID verification documents for deeper inconsistencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the system might look at fonts, spacing, data alignment, and metadata embedded in document barcodes. If something seems off, like a date of birth that doesn’t match the facial features or a document format that’s inconsistent with government-issued patterns, the forged ID checker flags the document as doubtful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. AI And Machine Learning 
<p>These scanners are responsible for real-time and quick response, spreading the fragrance of AI and ML, and their sophisticated algorithms. Isn’t it great that you are combining many technologies and making a bunch of the first line of defence against fraud? Amazing……</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits of Using a Fake ID Checker 
<p>Now, you would probably be thinking, what are the benefits of using these fake ID scanners in the ID document recognition SDK? Don’t worry, just read this section carefully….</p>
 
 Accuracy: To err is human, not such tools. As hinted previously, these tools integrate AI and ML algorithms, ensuring the fastest and precise results. 
 Scalability: If we talk about handling a large amount of data related to facial recognition ID, these scanners show their unbelievable magic in enhancing security. 
 Real-time verification: Not only for one or two hours, but these tools will provide you with the same accurate results in real-time. So, time does’t matter, just fucking the manipulating attempts of criminals very badly. 
 Risk reduction: After reading the previous headings, you would have understood their role in reducing the risks of document leakage and destruction by cyber criminals.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
 Industries Leading the Way 
<p>Several sectors are already gaining the benefits of progressive fake ID verification systems:</p>
 
 Financial Services: Banks and fintech companies use fake ID checkers to onboard customers, issue loans, and prevent fraud.&nbsp; 
 E-Commerce &amp; Marketplaces: Platforms confirm sellers and buyers to build trust and combat identity fraud.&nbsp; 
 Travel and Hospitality: Hotels and airlines use ID document recognition SDKs for continuous check-ins.&nbsp; 
 Online Gaming and Adult Services: Age-restricted platforms use facial ID recognition and document scanning to impose legal age limits. 
 
<p></p>
 Are You Looking for A Fake ID Scanner? Don’t Worry! 
<p>After reading such described comprehensive sections, many users raise a simple question: where to find such detectors or scanners? Are you also worried about this? Don’t worry, we are here with you with our great service, <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT</a> top performer.</p>

 BC 101 #5: Decentralized by Design — The Case for a VC-Free&nbsp;Future <p>In today’s crypto landscape, success is often measured by two metrics: exchange listings and token price performance. While these milestones can drive early attention, fundraising, and short-term engagement, they rarely guarantee meaningful long-term growth.</p><p>In fact, this structure often works against real innovation.</p> The Speculation Trap <p>The pressure to perform in public markets comes too early for many projects. As soon as a token is listed, price volatility becomes a distraction — if not a full-blown liability. Founders start chasing marketing campaigns instead of shipping updates. Teams stretch themselves thin juggling price optics, exchange negotiations, and community expectations, all while the original product roadmap collects&nbsp;dust.</p><p>This is not a bug in the system. It’s how the system was designed. Token-first strategies demand hype. Hype demands liquidity. And liquidity means listings, speculation, and the pressure to constantly “perform” for the market, often before a real product is even&nbsp;live.</p> Enter HPP: A Product-First Ecosystem <p>That’s where the House Party Protocol (HPP) offers a radically different approach.</p><p>HPP isn’t about launching speculative tokens or inflating valuations based on whitepapers and hype. Instead, it integrates post-VC or low-VC projects with proven traction and a shared commitment to sustainable, long-term growth.</p><p>By joining a network where the foundational infrastructure, exchange presence, and liquidity already exist, projects can skip the exhausting “token launch treadmill” and get back to what matters most: building.</p> Build Without the&nbsp;Noise <p>In the HPP model, speculative distractions are removed from the equation. There’s no need for immediate exchange listings or retail hype cycles. Each participating project either already has a listed token or operates without a massive VC pool waiting to be unlocked.</p><p>More importantly, token distributions within HPP follow a milestone-based vesting schedule, not arbitrary cliffs or backdoor unlocks. This ensures long-term alignment between builders, the community, and the ecosystem as a whole. There are just clear incentives to keep building.</p><p>For projects like Booost and VaaSBlock, instead of chasing token listings or short-term price spikes, they’re now focused squarely on delivering real products. They no longer need to divert resources to activities that don’t serve their core mission, freeing them to follow through on their original&nbsp;vision.</p><p>This is not just a technical detail. It’s a structural advantage. HPP was designed to prioritize execution over speculation, reflecting that in its governance, partnerships, and tokenomics.</p> A Model for the Next Crypto&nbsp;Cycle <p>If past bull markets were driven by ICOs, airdrops, and token-fueled speculation, the next phase of crypto will be defined by something much harder to achieve: resilience, credibility, and aligned incentives. HPP is building for that future and quietly leading the&nbsp;way.</p><p>This is where the House Party Protocol (HPP) stands&nbsp;apart.</p><p>HPP isn’t just decentralized in its technology — it’s decentralized by design. From its architecture to its governance and tokenomics, everything is structured to prevent any single entity from gaining outsized control. Even the core team’s tokens are locked for years and overseen by an independent, trusted custodian. No hidden agendas. No silent insiders.</p><p>In an industry that often treats “decentralization” as a branding tool, HPP is one of the few ecosystems where it’s structurally enforced. It’s not a slogan. It’s a principle.</p><p>HPP isn’t just another Layer 2. It’s a blueprint for a more sustainable crypto economy where product, progress, and purpose matter. And in this new phase of crypto, that might be the only bet worth&nbsp;making.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bc-101-5-decentralized-by-design-the-case-for-a-vc-free-future-c588eb7f555f">BC 101 #5: Decentralized by Design — The Case for a VC-Free Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There’s been a recent rush of excitement on LinkedIn about the vividness of the latest animations generated by image transformers.</p>
<p>In particular, there’s a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/endritrestelica_theyre-alive-they-want-to-break-free-activity-7331305659461775360-aqVJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAEKC0Bds7FIlLqgMqnFUp3lCDrHqtG_M0">film clip with vividly realistic robots</a>, in various states of terrible helplessness, bemoaning the prompts that led to their dire situations. I think it’s just an amusing recursive take on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall">Fourth Wall</a>, or a variation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_Hands">M.C. Escher’s famous Dra</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_Hands">wing Hands</a> that draw themselves into existence.</p>
<p>But in many of the LinkedIn comments, people are seeing signs of robots becoming self-aware.</p>
<p>Anthropomorphism is bad enough with Large Language Models, but with image transformers, it might get completely out of hand—like the way very early cinema goers ran screaming from the theatre, convinced a locomotive was about to burst out of the screen and plough into the crowd. This is a new and deeper level of the Deep Fake problem. Even when smart people know the moving images are software generated, they tend to think the animations are real.</p>
<p>I’m calling for “cognitive calm”. Let’s try to unsuspend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">disbelief</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t mean to underestimate the importance of image transformers and the dizzying rate of progress. I just want people to remember that with all AI today, “it’s just a model”.</p>
<p>As I understand them, image transformers are like LLMs; they are both pattern extrapolation machines.</p>
<p>LLMs are sometimes poo-poohed for “merely” completing sentences. That’s a bit of a simplification but the jibe does capture the essential mindlessness of neural network AI models.</p>
<p>The truth is that the output of any LLM-based generator is an evidence-based prediction of how a passage of text is going to continue, in a way that is consistent with the prompt. Today’s trained LLMs reflect trillions of pieces of text sampled from the wild, from which are inferred deep statistical patterns, sufficient to generate sensible strings of sentences. The LLMs not only follow the rules of syntax and grammar but also follow stylistic conventions and other patterns found in the training text. Hence the name language model — it’s an empirical mechanical representation of how real-world text is constructed.</p>
<p>So, if sufficient writers happen to have described different aspects of the behaviour of blue coloured birds in winter, the LLM will be able to string together a fair number of sentences that are consistent with the whole of the body of work it has ingested. Throw in some randomness so the writing isn’t overly repetitive, some feedback loops and unwritten prompts about beginnings, middles and ends, and the result looks like a polished story which embodies the wealth of written experience on the subject.</p>
<p>Just as language transformers make predictions of sensible text passages based on patterns extracted from real life writing, vision transformers predict how things should probably look in brand new images, based on patterns in real world pictures.</p>
<p>AI is certainly amazing at generating reasonable images of complex things and interactions. Yet the properties and relationships of things are not perceived or deduced by these models or understood in any way. The exercise is not to model causality but only appearances.</p>
<p>None of the generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) simulate anything. There is no abstraction of real-world phenomena in mathematical equations; rather, there is merely a probabilistic calculation what things should look or sound like.</p>
<p>Consider what’s going on when an image model is trained on an apple falling from a tree (or rather, on billions of clips of similar objects moving under similar circumstances). Videos are digitised and coded to create arrays of data, which are fed into the neural net and crunched together with other arrays. Patterns in the data result in the iterative refining of a net’s constituent interconnections and weights, which collectively come to instantiate what’s been “learned” from the training. When similar patterns recur in the inputs, reinforcement results and certain weights are boosted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s tempting to think that such an AI has learned the laws of physics through observation, but all it’s doing is establishing the statistics of how series of arrays of data tend to develop in particular ways. And so, based on its training, the image model can be prompted to calculate a sequence of arrays of reasonable data values to follow from some starting condition.</p>
<p>The AI is unaware that the array data structures were earlier designed by engineers to codify the intensity and wavelength of light sampled at different points by a two-dimensional camera sensor, and furthermore, that the sequencing of the arrays correspond to constant time intervals. &nbsp;The AI doesn’t know that cameras are themselves models of the human retina. &nbsp;It doesn’t have to know that, because it’s not watching a video—it’s only crunching data. An altogether different agent later on gets to experience the value arrays as periods of vision in which an apple is falling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The image transformer has no more understanding of physics than an LLM has of the human condition. Sure, ChatGPT might be able compose a vivid story with compelling characters we identity with, to the extent it might even make us cry, but only after ingesting billions of arrangements of adjectives, nouns and verbs which were earlier designed by artists to evoke the emotional response.</p>
<p>If we feed an image model enough video with fruit and objects in motion, then we can prompt it to compute a string of arrays containing patterns that happen to correspond to what a falling apple looks like. Likewise, if a model is trained on millions of hours of humans going about their business, it will be able to generate patterns of pixels which to us&nbsp;look like other people talking and laughing, sharing a joke, or even doing something as complex as flirting.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The stuff of any neural network, whether it’s designed for language or vision, is nothing but interconnects and weights. It happens that some configurations of interconnects and weights can be mapped by humans onto real world features—patterns of lights and sounds—with which we identify. &nbsp;But the model is only learning past patterns and extrapolating new ones.</p>
<p>There are no rules in the worlds which are modelled by these AIs—only statistics. We’ve probably all seen AI-generated images where hands have shifting numbers of fingers and people walk through walls. I appreciate the models are getting better but all the same, these sorts of errors illuminate exactly what it is that’s being modelled—and it was never understanding.</p>
<p>When an AI model for example predicts how a child will respond to a parent in some situation, verbally or visually, it has computed a lot of numbers which correspond to images and/or words which in turn seem sensible to us humans. Strictly speaking, it’s only a coincidence when the AI model comes up with something that’s even relatable let alone accurate.</p>
<p>Note: The images in this blog post are for&nbsp;illustration only. None were generated by AI; they’re the figments of&nbsp;a natural intelligence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cloud and hybrid environments have expanded the attack surface, and cybercriminals are taking full advantage. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warns identity is the top target, making <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solution/zero-trust.html">Zero Trust</a> and identity-first security non-negotiable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, CISA has repeatedly warned that identity-related attacks are among the top vectors for cloud breaches. In its guidance on defending against cloud compromise, CISA stresses the need for:</p>
 
 <p>Strong, phishing-resistant authentication</p>
 
 <p>Centralized identity and access management (IAM)</p>
 
 <p>Continuous monitoring of user behavior and access patterns</p>
 
 
<p>In short, Identity must be treated as the new perimeter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? Because humans are still the weakest link in the identity chain. Phishing, password reuse, and credential theft continue to fuel most breaches, even with sophisticated infrastructure in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why smart organizations put identity at the core, stopping attackers at the front door or catching them faster if they do get through.</p>

 TL;DR 



<p>On June 1, UAGro Wallet goes live on iOS and Android, giving 500 K+ students and alumni instant, tamper-proof diplomas via blockchain. Extrimian’s SSI suite—Digital Credential Wallet, ID Connect API, and Academy—powers this leap, cutting verification time by 99.9%, eliminating fraud, and meeting GDPR, FERPA, and LGPD requirements.</p>



 



 UAGro Wallet &amp; Extrimian: A New Era in University Credential Security 



<p>In 2024, universities worldwide lost over $600 million to fake diplomas, and manual verification still takes 5–14 days per record. On June 1, the Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero (UAGro) breaks this cycle with UAGro Wallet, a mobile app (iOS/Android) delivering verifiable credentials to 500 000 + students and alumni. Powered by Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) from Extrimian, this project seals document fraud and transforms how diplomas, transcripts, and certificates are issued, stored, and verified.</p>



<p></p>



 1. The Credential Crisis in Higher Ed 



 
 Fraud Costs Soar: $600 M+ lost yearly to forged diplomas and transcripts (<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/company-and-culture/the-8-things-you-should-know-about-cyber-attacks-on-the-education-sector-and-how-to-prevent-them/" title="">Check Point 2024</a>). 



 Slow Manual Checks: Average 7 days per verification vs. 2 minutes with SSI. 



 Security Gaps: Under 50 % MFA adoption in universities (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex" title="">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>). 
 



<p>These delays frustrate applicants and employers, drain staff hours (120 h→8 h monthly), and expose institutions to data-theft and compliance fines.</p>



<p></p>



 2. How SSI &amp; Blockchain Fix Verification 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) hands control back to students. Instead of siloed servers, diplomas live in a Digital Credential Wallet—secure, private, and always available offline. Key benefits:</p>



 
 Cryptographic Security: Each credential is signed on a blockchain, making tampering impossible. 



 Instant Trust: Employers verify in seconds without calls or faxes. 



 Selective Privacy: Share only what’s needed (e.g., “Bachelor’s Degree, 2025” without grades). 



 Built-in Compliance: GDPR, FERPA, LGPD covered by design.

									  The $11 Billion Battle for Circle   <p>Ripple and Coinbase  are reportedly eyeing Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, like it’s the last slice of pizza at a happy hour. Circle, which had been gearing up for an IPO, now finds itself at the center of a potential multi-billion dollar bidding war that could reshape the stablecoin landscape.</p><p>The stablecoin provider is reportedly shopping itself around at a $5 billion valuation. Ripple came out swinging with an initial offer between $4–5 billion, later upping the ante to as much as $11 billion, sweetened with a mix of cash and XRP tokens.</p><p>Coinbase hasn’t officially tossed a number into the ring, but their long-standing relationship with Circle could be a game-changer. They co-founded the Centre Consortium back in 2018 to govern USDC and still share revenue from USDC reserves.</p> &nbsp;  Why It’s a Big “Deal” <p>Stablecoins are the quiet workhorses of crypto ,  powering everything from DeFi to global remittances. USDC is one of the most regulated and institutionally friendly stablecoins on the market.</p><p>Whoever lands Circle doesn’t just get a product . They gain control over a regulated, dollar-pegged asset that bridges crypto and traditional finance. That’s huge for global positioning.</p><p>Also: market consolidation. Fewer players with more power could mean better interoperability or, on the flip side, increased centralization. Either way, it’s a pivotal moment.</p> What Would It Mean for the Buyer? <p>Ripple is a global payments firm focused on cross-border transactions. Adding USDC  one of the most trusted stablecoins - could accelerate Ripple’s mission to modernize money movement. With the XRP Ledger evolving post-SEC, controlling a compliant stablecoin gives Ripple a serious edge in attracting new use cases and adoption.</p><p>Coinbase, meanwhile, has skin in the game. That 50/50 revenue-sharing deal with Circle means they’re already benefiting from USDC. Acquiring Circle would deepen that advantage ,  giving Coinbase more control over a critical piece of crypto’s financial plumbing.</p><p>For either, it’s about infrastructure and influence. Stable value is critical to crypto’s usability. With PayPal, TradFi, and governments circling the space, locking down USDC means future-proofing their position.</p> &nbsp;  What Would It Mean for the Market? <p>If Ripple wins:</p>  Tighter integration of USDC with the XRP Ledger  USDC liquidity may shift to Ripple’s ecosystem  Faster expansion into global payments  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Coinbase wins:</p>  Stronger grip on U.S. stablecoin infrastructure  More integration of USDC into Coinbase products  Increased competitive edge as regulators scrutinize rivals like Tether  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Circle IPOs:</p>  Circle retains neutrality  Public accountability increases, possibly limiting flexibility   &nbsp;  What Would It Mean for Users? <p>For users, a successful acquisition could bring:</p>  Smoother transitions between fiat and crypto  Faster, cheaper transactions  Broader access to a trustworthy stablecoin  <p>That said, more control in fewer hands always warrants a watchful eye.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> What Next? <p>Looming questions remain.</p><p>Will regulators get involved? This level of consolidation may attract antitrust scrutiny.</p><p>Will other bidders emerge? Don’t count out TradFi or PayPal.</p><p>Will USDC remain neutral? Ownership could influence its use and perception.</p><p>Whatever the case, stablecoins are becoming as essential as cash and credit . Whoever wins Circle may shape the rules of the road.</p>  <p>— Branden</p>

									         The Case For —&nbsp;And Against — Institutional Integration   <p>Over the past few months, a new wave of momentum has quietly reshaped the crypto landscape, as TradFi institutions and mainstream retailers step deeper into the world of digital assets. From Overstock’s blockchain experiments to Nike’s NFTs, PayPal’s stablecoin to BlackRock’s on-chain funds, the trend is accelerating. While it may lack the explosive energy of bull market euphoria, its implications run just as deep.</p><p>Institutional integration is not a new trend. Overstock became one of the earliest corporate Bitcoin adopters in 2014. But in 2024 and beyond, the landscape looks markedly different. Institutions aren’t just dipping their toes anymore. They’re building infrastructure, shaping regulation, and in many cases, bringing the crypto rails in-house.</p><p>According to Galaxy Digital, tokenized real-world assets managed by traditional finance surpassed $11 billion in Q1 2025. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and JPMorgan are all developing or deploying blockchain-based investment products. At the same time, brands like Adidas and Reddit are keeping their NFT experiments alive, running on public blockchains, but with controlled user experiences.</p><p>The economic effects are measurable. More liquidity, more user acquisition, and more diversified use cases. Chainalysis data from late 2024 shows a 41% increase in institutional transaction volume year-over-year. But retail adoption has only grown 8% in the same window, suggesting a concentration of influence and activity at the top end of the ecosystem.</p><p>The flip side is there’s now a paradox at play. The very institutions crypto sought to disrupt are now key players in its mainstreaming. This isn’t inherently negative, but it invites ongoing debate about decentralization, gatekeeping, and the long-term direction of the space.</p><p>A 2024 DappRadar report found that over 70% of brand-launched NFTs are minted on custodial platforms, meaning users rarely control their assets. Meanwhile, centralized stablecoins like PYUSD offer price stability and access, but often operate within closed systems, limiting composability and self-custody.</p><p>Yet, there’s a potential upside, too. With major players onboard, the industry gains credibility and regulatory traction that could ultimately benefit all participants. For developers, this means more resources. For users, it could mean more reliable on-ramps and protections. For institutions, it’s a chance to reimagine trust.</p><p>Whatever the case, it’s happening. TradFi and DeFi are doing the fusion dance, and real ones know Gogeta never (really) lost a fight.

									         When Customer Data Becomes a Liability   <p>Coinbase, America’s crypto darling, is currently downplaying one of the most serious breaches of consumer privacy in recent history. Meanwhile, it is inadvertently demonstrating how anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) laws create more harm than good when it comes to storing sensitive data.</p><p>In January 2025, Coinbase’s overseas employees betrayed user trust by selling access to sensitive customer information to criminals in exchange for what was likely life-changing sums of money. It was only disclosed in May because the criminals decided to ransom the data back to Coinbase for $20 million — which the company promptly refused, instead offering the same amount as a reward for the hackers’ capture.</p><p>What’s disturbing is how easily these low-level employees accessed sensitive information including ID photos, home addresses, token balances, and the last 4 digits of personal identification numbers. Set against the backdrop of rising crypto kidnappings across Europe, this data breach highlights an incredibly dangerous practice. The centralization of personal information will never be without risk, and these risks clearly outweigh any benefits, as repeatedly demonstrated by breaches like this and the infamous Equifax breach.</p><p>Coinbase shouldn’t have made this information available to low-level employees in foreign countries. Whatever legal team approved that deserves to be fired; the risks were glaringly obvious. But using cheap overseas labor for customer support is standard practice in tech. Which is where decentralized databases, with user-controlled authorization via ZK proofs and homomorphic encryption, come in.</p><p>This technology represents a genuine opportunity to comply with KYC laws while protecting user privacy. Unfortunately, we’re still far from implementing such infrastructure. KYC laws rarely prevent crime or enable effective enforcement. Meanwhile, Coinbase — one of the primary proponents behind the GENIUS act, enabling stablecoin legislation — seems focused on preserving their market position through web2-style regulatory capture.</p><p>Rumors are spreading on Twitter about retail users pulling their tokens off the exchange in protest, hoping to trigger a bank run. Their grievances go beyond this most recent breach of trust, hinging on suspicions that Coinbase might be using fractional reserve practices with institutional finance firms. I personallycan’t advocate for something potentially so destructive to users trapped on the platform if another FTX-like implosion occurred. But I won’t be upset seeing a bad actor face consequences.</p><p>(Full disclosure: I’ve always used Coinbase for onboarding due to their user-friendly interface, but knowing my data was likely compromised and fearing my crypto might be used to back “paper crypto,” I’m now exploring alternatives like MoonPay for future transactions.)</p><p>How do I know my data was compromised? The careful wording in Brian’s announcement suggested that if you transact less than once a month on average, you were probably affected, since “only 1% of our users who trade monthly were exposed.” Reading between the lines, this likely means long-term investors who buy and hold were the primary targets. Just watch the increase in crypto kidnappings to understand how serious this issue is about to become.</p>  <p>— El Prof</p>

 <p>The percentage of breaches that involved a third-party doubled in the last year, and 54% of firms were hit by a third-party sourced attack or breach; vendor access is now a top enterprise risk.1, 2</p>
 
 <p>Traditional, siloed identity and access management (IAM) tools weren’t built to handle the scale, diversity, or fluidity of modern B2B ecosystems and supply chains.</p>
 
 <p>Identity gaps, like stale accounts, overpermissioned access, and weak onboarding, create openings for fraud and data exfiltration.</p>
 
 <p>B2B IAM enables continuous, adaptive trust to govern external access, reducing risk and improving third-party collaboration.</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses depend on a vast network of third-party organizations to drive innovation, speed, and scale in today’s hyper-connected economy. But behind that collaboration lies a critical security question: Can you trust every connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The truth is, while your internal security practices may be sound, the weakest point in your defense might lie just outside your organizational boundary — in your supply chain.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.suomi.fi/">Suomi.fi</a> identity brokering service provides a list of authentication methods for the Tax Administration e-service.&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nowadays, people handle so much sensitive information online that the need for strong authentication is apparent. People cannot rely on username and password authentication for services such as banking, insurance, health care and tax administration, to mention a few. Traditionally, in Finland, we have had three classes of strong authentication methods available for citizens: BankID, Mobile Certificate (Mobiilivarmenne) and the national ID card (HST card). Since the end of October 2024, a fourth type of official strong authentication method has been made available, hightrust.id.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Overview – Hightrust.id 
<p>Hightrust.id is a digital wallet solution designed for mobile devices. It aims to offer a centralised solution for managing individuals’ online identity credentials without remembering various usernames and passwords or carrying several documents. When I write this, higtrust.id provides strong identity verification and legally binding electronic signatures, but the solution has much more potential. In this blog, I will review hightrust.id mainly as an authentication method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hightrust.id as a Strong Authentication method&nbsp; 
<p>It’s not every day that new, strong authentication methods are introduced. But what makes these methods strong? Multifactor authentication methods (MFA) are often seen as stronger options than methods that rely only on a username and password. However, MFA capability alone cannot define a particular method as an officially strong authentication method. It must undergo a complex certification process to prove the solution’s maturity. This is indicated by using a level of assurance (LoA) level. The National Cyber Security Centre of the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency, Traficom, makes the certification guidelines in Finland. From the current strong methods, BankID and Mobile Certificate are on the second highest LoA level of eIDAS Substantial and the HST card on the highest level of eIDAS High using the EU 3-step scale. Hightrust.id has been certified oto the highest level of eIDAS High, although when used in the Finnish Trust Network, it is registered&nbsp; on the same LoA level as the Bank ID and Mobile certificate, eIDAS Substantial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Wallets&nbsp; 
<p>Generally, a digital wallet is an app that includes personal identity data (PID) based on different types of identity and payment documents and potentially additional attributes that could indicate, e.g., your profession or the organisation you work for. Soon, various kinds of cards, such as identity cards, driver’s licenses, debit cards, credit cards, and cryptocurrencies, can be added to the wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hightrust.id digital wallet is a smartphone application that can be downloaded for free from Android’s Google Play or Apple’s App Store. The solution enables user identity verification in a smartphone application with a citizen certificate scanned from an HST card, and it can be used without a separate card reader. The user can also sign documents electronically using the app. Other cards supported now in the hightrust.id wallet include the Finnish Sote card (for healthcare workers) and the Finnish DVV organisation card (generally used by public sector employees). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another interesting digital wallet solution is the EU’s long-planned EUDI wallet, which will be launched around 2026 to 2027. The EUDI wallet will harmonise how EU citizens verify their identity across borders in different e-services. It ultimately provides a cross-border digital identity that will benefit citizens across the 27 EU nations. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/standards/introducing-european-digital-identity-eudi/" title="<span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>here.</span>">here.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Citizen Digital Certificate&nbsp; 
<p>A digital certificate is an identifier verified by a third-party organisation. It can be used to identify its subject and reliably sign in to information networks and systems. Several certificate types, such as server certificates, are available to identify Internet service providers and secure data exchange. The mobile certificate method is based on a certificate stored in a SIM card on a smart device. The certificate stored in an HST card is called the citizen certificate, and the user must enable it before use. Passports cannot be used for this because their chips do not include the citizen certificate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have not enabled the citizen certificate of your HST card, you can do it in hightrust.id app. This is a great feature, as previously this would require using a device with a smartcard reader or attaching a smart card reader to a computer. Your card must be issued after August 31, 2021, and you need a smartphone or tablet with a near-field communication (NFC) feature. Also, you must have the activation code that is delivered to you on paper separately from the card. This code is used to activate the citizen certificate and create a PIN1 for authentication and a PIN2 for signing. If you do not have the activation code available, you can visit the police station to get a new one for a fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start using the citizen certificate, do the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Adding and confirming your email address in the hightrust.id wallet is essential. It speeds up the revocation operation of the citizen certificate in case you accidentally lose or break your phone or change it to a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed instructions in Finnish, Swedish and English on how to proceed with all the steps are <a href="https://hightrust.id/en/support/preparing-to-enable-the-hightrust-id-digital-wallet/">here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Signing in with the hightrust.id&nbsp; 
<p>In the following example, I will sign in to a social and healthcare mobile application called Maisa. It is a personal health record (PHR) application used by some of the largest public health care regions. The app requires strong authentication due to the sensitive information it contains. Here are a few observations of the procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maisa uses the Suomi.fi identity brokering service to provide all of the different strong authentication methods available. Since I use a mobile app to access the service, I must ensure that hightrust.id uses the app option. If using Maisa via computer, I would choose the QR-code scanning option and scan the QR-code from the computer screen using my phone. If I had several cards scanned in the hightrust.id application, I would choose the card manually, but since I have only one, it is selected automatically. Notice that the national ID card does not contain the social security number (HETU) but a SATU identifier (FINUID, Finnish Unique Identification Number). The SATU identifier will be changed to HETU in the background, utilising the national population information system. Face ID, fingerprint, or mobile device security code can be used to accept sending SATU to the population information system. After the SATU to HETU conversion, I need to give permission to send HETU information to Maisa. After this, I can start to use the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The authentication operation did not require typing any information such as passwords or PIN codes since I have the Face ID option on my smartphone. Other options would have been a fingerprint or typing the smartphone’s security code. In both cases, the operation is effortless and does not require the user to remember any additional passwords or codes that he does not know already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hightrust.id vs. other Strong Authentication methods&nbsp; 
<p>Hightrust.id is not the only ID document-based authentication method on the market. Suomi.fi offers the HST card method, but the downside is that it requires a physical card and a card reader device, which is not handy for me to carry outside my home.&nbsp; Also, there are various methods based on ID document scanning and taking pictures and videos of my ID documents and myself. These methods have many benefits, such as providing reliable authentication methods for people from countries outside of Finland and even outside of Europe and letting them use documents like passports, ID cards and driver’s licenses to verify their identity. However, even though many of these methods rely on advanced technologies, they are not officially certified strong authentication methods in Finland. You can read more about the ID document-based authentication methods <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/understanding-id-document-verification/" title="<span data-contrast=&quot;none&quot;>here</span>">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BankID has traditionally been the most popular strong authentication method in Finland. It has been used since the 1990s, and most eService users in Finland are very familiar with it. Since BankID enables access to users’ bank accounts, the current recommendation is to use it carefully and only for the bank’s services. The other strong methods, including mobile certificates, hightrust.id and identification cards, should be used for everything else. They work practically everywhere except when logging into online banking. Lately, the mobile certificate method has gained popularity alongside BankID. If criminals gain access to your mobile certificate, they will get access to your online services, but not your bank account. HST card and the hightrust.id methods also offer their benefits. It is always a good idea to have several strong authentication methods available. This is important not only for safety reasons, but also for situations when the bank service is unavailable, for example, during a service break.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the table below for the basic characteristics of the different strong authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>



Method&nbsp;

<p>Phone security code&nbsp;</p>
Computer &amp; Mobile&nbsp;



<p>* The card must be assigned after the 31st of August 2021&nbsp;</p>
<p>** Depending on the solution. Not all three are required during one session. OTP = One Time Password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Mobile card readers are not very practical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A critical part of any digital solution is the cost. Nothing comes for free, and the service provider must pay something to the identity broker service operators, Suomi.fi (public sector services) or the Finnish Trust Network (FTN, private sector services) to provide strong authentication methods for their clients. Sometimes, this includes an additional transaction-level fee paid per authentication transaction. But sometimes, we users must also pay a small fee for our chosen methods. See the table below for the basic pricing principles of strong authentication methods.&nbsp;</p>

User fees&nbsp;
Service provider fees in FTN&nbsp;


HST card&nbsp;
HST card fee once every 5 years&nbsp;<p></p>

<p>Prices checked and accurate as of 2025/04/11&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>Hightrust.id is a quick and convenient way to sign in to online services, especially when using online services on a mobile device. For those that already have a HST card, it is a great alternative to other sign in methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital identity management and payment industry is constantly changing. Criminals are constantly developing new, innovative ways to hack into our bank accounts to steal our money. Usually, when security is increased, it means more steps for the user to log in. This in turn makes it more difficult to use services. We need innovations like hightrust.id to provide a solution that combines security, convenience and efficiency so that we can use electronic services with peace of mind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pair of British retail giants are still scrambling to regain control of their computer systems nearly a month after massive cyberattacks disrupted their operations and cast a spotlight on the dangers of social engineering schemes targeting corporate IT operations. Despite the availability of technologies for preventing such breaches, most corporations remain vulnerable to this growing threat and the long-term damage it can inflict.</p>
<p>As of May 19, High Street retailer Marks &amp; Spencer has yet to restore online shopping in the face of more than $80 million in lost profit from attacks that have also wiped <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/ms-slow-recovery-cyberattack-puts-it-risk-lasting-damage-2025-05-19/">$1.3 billion</a> from its stock market value. According to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62v34zv828o">the BBC</a>, personal information of some portion of the retailer’s 9.4 million active online customers was compromised in the attack, which could include name, date of birth, contact details, and online order history.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, efforts remain underway at grocery chain Co-op to restock shelves and restore systems that were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/14/co-op-cyber-attack-stock-availability-in-stores-will-not-improve-until-weekend">shut down</a> in response to unfolding attacks days after similar assaults on Marks &amp; Spencer. Despite its quick action, hackers had successfully extracted data related to a “significant number” of its customers, though it did not include bank or credit card information.</p>
<p>These and a number of other recent attacks appear to have been perpetrated by the hacker collective called “Scattered Spider” by some analysts, UNC3944 or Octo Tempest and “Muddled Libra” by others. We <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/mgm-caesars-hacks-more-of-the-same-is-coming-your-way-but-heres-how-to-stop-it/">first posted</a> about this particular cybercriminal network after its successful assaults on Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>A number of factors make this group especially troubling. First, the fact it’s been implicated in dozens of attacks spanning numerous industries worldwide dating back to 2022. Second, it’s believed to be made up of teenagers and young adults leveraging simple social engineering techniques and to infiltrate corporate systems for fun and profit.</p>
 A Tangled Web of Socially-Engineered Breaches 
<p>Even now, a clear picture of the UK attacks remains elusive. But judging from reports, it appears Spider’s playbook continues to forego approaches like credential stuffing or exploiting previously unrecognized vulnerabilities. Instead, they compromise corporate networks through clever conversations. In other words: They talk their way in.</p>
<p>In the M&amp;S and Co-op attacks, the perpetrators appear to have used <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2025-05-12/m-and-s-and-co-op-what-we-know-weeks-after-cyber-attacks">SIM swapping</a> to bypass traditional forms of multifactor authentication (MFA). Either working with an insider, or tricking a call center rep, this typically involves scammers tricking a mobile services provider into transferring the victim’s number to <a href="https://theconversation.com/mands-cyberattacks-used-a-little-known-but-dangerous-technique-and-anyone-could-be-vulnerable-256739">a new SIM card</a>, or even an e-SIM (a kind of virtual SIM that’s embedded in the victim’s device) to a device under the fraudster’s control.</p>
<p>They then tricked IT help desks at Co-op and a third-party supplier to M&amp;S to gain access to the company’s systems, perhaps through a password reset request that was then authenticated using the fraudster’s device. In M&amp;S’s case, it’s believed that once they had enough access, the infiltrators exploited the company’s instance of Microsoft <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2025-05-12/m-and-s-and-co-op-what-we-know-weeks-after-cyber-attacks">Active Directory</a>, which enables a user to log in once and gain entry to all systems for which the victims have permissioned access. From there, they were free to deploy ransomware to cripple the system.</p>
 Why ‘Mission: Impersonate’ Is Just Getting Started 
<p>Scattered Spider is believed to be a decentralized network composed largely of native English-speaking young people who coordinate in real-time over Discord, Telegram, and underground forums. As I mentioned, they rely on techniques that target people, not technology infrastructure. The group reportedly coordinates with a ransomware-as-a-service operation known as <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2025-05-01/dragonforce-the-software-cyber-security-experts-believe-was-used-to-hit-m-and-s">DragonForce</a> that handles the encryption and extortion side of attacks like those on M&amp;S and Co-op.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Scattered Spider isn’t just a threat group. It’s an economic model—one that has been leveraged by these or copycat groups in the weeks since the M&amp;S and Co-op attacks. By early May, luxury department store Harrods reported it was also forced to disable some of its systems after it was hit by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/01/harrods-latest-retailer-hit-cyber-attack-website-shops">cyberattack</a>. Fashion retailer <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14716177/Dior-latest-business-cyber-attack-MS-op.html">Dior</a>, Danish food giant <a href="https://www.scworld.com/brief/cyberattack-hits-arla-foods-production">Alra Foods</a>, and a growing list of other retailers and suppliers have been targeted.</p>
<p>As Metro aptly points out, the allure of these household names <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/05/20/reasons-m-amp-s-co-op-hacked-retailers-might-next-23119928/">is threefold</a>: “Big brand, big data, big target.” It’s also worth pointing out what they aren’t: Organizations in financial services, healthcare, or other high-regulated, attack-hardened industries. All it takes is one employee at a supplier, partner, or within the targeted company itself to click a malicious link or grant unwarranted access to company systems. And as wide as this attack surface may be, it’s also ever-expanding. By May 20, Google was warning there are signs Scattered Spider may be moving on from UK retailers and pivoting to direct cyber-attacks against retail sector <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/google-warns-hackers-that-victimized-uk-retailers-now-targeting-us-firms-with-cyber-attacks/">targets in the US.</a></p>
 A Breach’s Bite Is Painful—and Costly 
<p>Crippled systems, disrupted sales, and headline-driven stock swings are just the immediate prices to be paid when organizations fall prey to threat groups like Scattered Spider. The average additional cost of a data breach on UK-based organizations is now <a href="https://uk.newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Report-Soaring-Data-Breach-Disruption-Drive-Costs-to-Record-Levels">$4.8 million</a> per incident, according to IBM, and as high as $9.8 million for US-based companies. Worldwide, IBM estimates the price of each breach is climbing at a rate of 10% per year. And that’s before any regulatory fines and lawsuits.</p>
<p>The longer-term impact on revenue generation may also be profound for retailers. According to one 2025 survey, <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/101357-data-breaches-affect-consumer-trust">70% of consumers</a> would stop shopping with a brand that suffered a security incident. The fact that 1 in 5 consumers say they use the same passwords across work and personal online accounts means the fallout from successful attacks on retailers may have serious implications for companies in every industry.</p>
<p>As the M&amp;S and Co-op attacks so vividly illustrate, traditional forms of MFA don’t cut it anymore. Cybercriminal enterprises like Scattered Spider continue to find innovative ways to acquire login credentials and circumvent things like one-time passcodes and limited biometric authentication systems designed to confirm the legitimate user is attempting to access company systems. And anyone with administrative access or successful SIM swap can register things like user biometrics to any device—or set up an alternative identity provider to bypass authentication measures all together. Yet while these challenges are real, they’re also not insurmountable.</p>
 Breach-Proof ‘Spider’ Repellant: ‘Liveness’-based<br>
Biometric Authentication 
<p>With old-school forms of MFA proving so unreliable as a means of identity verification and new-school social engineering schemes on the rise, modern forms of biometric authentication are helping to set a new standard for security and convenience. Solutions certified to FIDO2, ISO/IEC biometric presentation attack detection, and NIST 800-63-3 specifications, for instance, use “live” biometric markers tied to a verified identity to provide reliable, strong authentication that’s impervious to account takeover.</p>
<p>Put simply, these solutions are built around the identity of the person accessing the account, instead of just the login credentials or device the person is using. Instead, these solutions offer machine-verified identity to government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, etc.) and enable phishing-resistant multifactor authentication when users log in to corporate systems.</p>
<p>1Kosmos, for example, uses the private key of a matched public-private pair in the user’s device as a possession factor (i.e., what you have), while a live facial scan becomes the “what you are” or inherence authentication element. Before access is granted to a site, app, or system, that live image scan is compared to an image captured during the user enrollment process. A match confirms the identity of the person is in fact the authorized user—and not a bot, deepfake, or imposter—with 99.9% accuracy.</p>
<p>The solution supports a consistent enrollment and authentication experience across all apps, devices, systems, and environments—including existing privileged access management systems.</p>
<p>Which means every organization—big British retailer or otherwise—can prevent breaches before they happen by squashing attempts from Scattered Spider or other threat actors to fraudulently infiltrate accounts.</p>

<p>Meet Rachel—an asset manager onboarding a boutique investment fund with international stakeholders. Before she can move forward, Rachel must navigate KYC, KYB, and AML checks to stay compliant. It’s a complex process, and mistakes can mean fines or reputational risk.</p>



<p>Here’s how Rachel’s experience differs when using manual methods versus iComply’s compliance platform.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 1: Collecting Client Information 



<p>Manual Process: Rachel emails forms, requests documents, and waits for incomplete responses. She sends follow-ups, and the back-and-forth delays onboarding.</p>



<p>With iComply: Rachel sends a secure, custom-branded onboarding link. The platform guides the client through document uploads and verifies everything in real time.</p>



<p>Result: Onboarding is fast and complete—no delays or missing data.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 2: Verifying Ownership 



<p>For corporate clients, KYB compliance requires identifying all beneficial owners with 25% or more ownership.</p>



<p>Manual Process: Rachel searches public records, cross-references shareholder lists, and struggles with foreign registries.</p>



<p>With iComply: The system pulls corporate filings and ownership details globally in seconds, even revealing hidden layers like trusts or holding companies.</p>



<p>Result: Rachel gets an audit-ready overview of the business structure without manual digging.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 3: AML Screening 



<p>AML regulations require checking clients and stakeholders against sanctions, PEPs, and adverse media lists.</p>



<p>Manual Process: Rachel manually inputs names into multiple databases and spends hours reviewing false positives.</p>



<p>With iComply: The platform screens individuals automatically and filters out irrelevant matches, flagging only genuine risks.</p>



<p>Result: Fewer false positives, faster resolutions, and more focus on real risks.</p>



<p></p>



 Step 4: Recordkeeping and Reporting 



<p>Compliance regulations require asset managers to store records securely and generate detailed reports during audits.</p>



<p>Manual Process: Rachel stores files in multiple folders and scrambles to compile audit reports from spreadsheets and emails.</p>



<p>With iComply: Every action is logged automatically. Rachel generates a detailed, audit-ready report with one click.</p>



<p>Result: Audit prep takes minutes, not hours.</p>



<p></p>



 A Tale of Two Experiences 



<p>In the manual workflow, onboarding takes days or weeks, frustrating clients and draining team resources. With iComply, onboarding is seamless—clients appreciate the professional experience, and Rachel’s team focuses on client relationships instead of admin work.</p>



<p></p>



 Key Compliance Considerations for Asset Managers 



 
 Complete Due Diligence: Collect and verify customer information thoroughly. 



 Ongoing AML Screening: Continuously monitor for sanctions, PEPs, and adverse media. 



 Ownership Transparency: Identify beneficial owners, especially in complex structures. 



 Data Security: Store sensitive information securely and comply with regulations like GDPR. 



 Audit Readiness: Keep comprehensive records and generate reports easily. 
 



<p></p>



 Why iComply? 



<p>With iComply, Rachel cut onboarding time, reduced manual work, and stayed audit-ready with end-to-end encryption and automated reporting. Compliance became a competitive advantage—not a burden.</p>



<p>Is your compliance workflow helping or holding you back? Let iComply simplify KYC, KYB, and AML so you can focus on growing your clients’ wealth. Let’s get started.</p>

<p>“We are here with you with this comprehensive blog post. In this guide, we will tell you our discovery about the role of ID Document Liveness Detection.”</p>
<p>Hello dear readers!&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the rise of modern technology, new innovative methods of security have been developed to defeat cyber criminals. From multiple-factor authentication to facial ID recognition, we have all types of security.</p>
<p>One such groundbreaking method of security that has revolutionized the way we fight against fake identities is ID Document Liveness Detection.</p>
<p>We have prepared this guide for its detailed explanation. Stay connected with us till the end….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What ID Document Liveness Detection Claims About It? 
<p>ID Document Liveness Detection SDK is mainly hailed as an innovation in technology that is used to ensure the presented ID is real during the verification. Driven by this technology, a <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-verification-playground/">fake ID detector</a> scans the presented documents and then applies OCR on them to extract their text.</p>
<p>When the text is extracted, the system verifies and marks the documents and issues them for further processing. This technology is being used in all institutions, from banks to educational institutions, and from such institutions to finance.</p>
<p>When we present our stance in front of users, many of them raise a simple question: how does this technology stop identity fraud? Hoping! You will also ask us this question.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, the next section is the answer to your question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How ID Documents Liveness Detection Stops Identity Fraud? 
<p>This section is a detailed part of this blog. In which we will describe the role of ID document Recognition SDK in preventing fraud in detail.</p>
 1. Artificial Intelligence Integration 
<p>When it comes to AI, we don’t think that there is any field where it has not left its everlasting impact. We can all understand this. Luckily! ID Recognition also integrates AI and its advanced algorithms. These algorithms are trained to provide real-time insights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, we can say that: from anyone’s entrance to returning from any institution, the system records all movements of them. Furthermore, AI is exclusive to providing faster results. We mean to say you can get anyone’s insights within a few seconds. Isn’t it great..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Better Document Analysis 
<p>There is a huge difference between document analysis and better document analysis. Did’t understand? Let us make you understand. If we give you some documents and say you to find whether they are fake or real. You might take a lot of time and could even miss subtle signs of tampering.</p>
<p>However, when you use this technology of ID recognition, the advanced algorithms analyze several features from A to Z, including;</p>
 
 Watermark 
 
 
 Hologram 
 
 
 Microtext 
 UV features 
 
<p>And so on….</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let’s ask a very simple question: Is such detection exclusive to humans? Absolutely not! So, this detection is the best feature of this technology.</p>
 3. Enhanced User Experience and Compliance 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-recognition-sdk/">ID Document Recognition SDK</a> not only strengthens the security but also enhances the user experience and compliance by making the verification simple and fast. This technology ensures consistent and smooth compliance onboarding while meeting strict regulatory standards such as KYC(Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering).</p>
<p>Such efficiency and speed of this technology streamlines the process of verification that making it easy for both businesses and customers to comply with legal requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Reduced Costs 
<p>One of the greatest roles of this technology is reducing the costs. A fake ID scanner is integrated with advanced machine learning models that reduce the need for manual verification. Additionally, the agencies don’t need to hire extra labor staff for manual verification. This feature eliminates the tension of errors committed by humans during verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What About Our Service? 
<p>After hearing the role of this technology, many users probably think about how they can make use of this cutting-edge technology. This is where we provide them with <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a>(a face and ID recognition algorithm developer).</p>
<p>Our service is driven by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT</a>-evaluated algorithms. This integration ensures the highest level of accuracy, speed, and performance. Here, once again, a question arises: where can users use our service? You can also visit Recognito <a href="https://github.com/recognito-vision/">GitHub</a> page for more info.</p>
<p>If you have the same question, the next section is for you.</p>
<p></p>
 Where Can We Use Recognito For ID Document Liveness Detection? 
<p>In this section, we will tell you where our service can be used or which institutions can benefit from this technology.</p>
<p>Banks: If you are handling the financial accounts while working in any bank, you can come across Recognito, which implements the same technology of verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Universities and Colleges: Sometimes, cyber criminals try to manipulate educational departments and steal the key information of students and professors. Here, they can eliminate such an issue by using this ID recognition technology.</p>
<p>Healthcare sectors: It is a very surprising thing that many criminals attempt to steal patients’ key information with spoofing images and videos. This is where our service will show its magic and defeat the fake identities.</p>
<p>Telecommunication: Telecom providers often face fraud during new account opening and SIM registration. If you are the same provider, we suggest you check our service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketplaces: Markets are the major places where criminals make attacks. They destroy both online and offline money accounts of users. To defeat them, marketers can heavily benefit from <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">ID Document Liveness Detection SDK</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Our Final Thoughts 
<p>ID Document Liveness Detection plays a crucial role in preventing fraud and defeating online attacks made by criminals. This technology effectively extracts text from ID documents and then lets the system mark them for further processing.</p>
<p>This technology plays a great role that we have discussed in this guide in detail. This section starts from AI integration and ends with reduced costs. This role is such a groundbreaking one. However, many users remain confused about how to get such benefits.</p>
<p>To eliminate this confusion, we have brought Recognition for them, driven by NIST FRVT. In the end, we have discussed some major case uses of this innovative technology from banks to e-commerce marketplaces.</p>
<p>So, what is your feedback for our guide and service? You have liked them or havn’t you? We want your honest feedback…..</p>

 Data theft and how to protect data in the face of increasing cases of data theft<a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/data-theft"></a> 



 Recent Scandal in Argentina Highlights a Massive Digital Trust Gap 



<p>In a striking case that has stirred political and cybersecurity circles alike, Argentine authorities are investigating a social media influencer for allegedly misusing the CUITs (tax IDs) of five provincial governors to facilitate clothing imports under fraudulent barter agreements.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lavoz.com.ar/politica/investigan-a-una-influencer-por-usar-los-cuit-de-cinco-gobernadores-para-importar-ropa-de-canje/">La Voz</a> article, the influencer was able to initiate import operations by impersonating state authorities, a move that points to critical failures in identity verification and data authenticity across public sector systems.</p>



<p>This incident isn’t just a political scandal — it’s a technological wake-up call.</p>



 



 What’s the problem: Identity in a Web2 World Is Broken 



<p>Let’s break down what went wrong:</p>



 
 Static identifiers (like CUITs) are publicly known and easily misused. 



 No decentralized verification mechanism exists to confirm who is behind a given request. 



 Paper-based or email-based authorizations can be forged or socially engineered. 



 Lack of auditability and tamper-resistance in public records. 
 



<p>In short, Web2 identity systems were never designed for integrity-first governance.</p>



<p></p>



 Extrimian Solution: Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity (DID) 



<p>This is where Extrimian’s technology stack comes in — providing next-generation digital identity solutions built for trust, transparency, and tamper-resistance.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) </a>and <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, institutions and individuals can cryptographically prove who they are, what roles they hold, and what permissions they’ve been granted.</p>



 What this looks like in practice: 



 
 Governors or their offices issue verifiable credentials signed with cryptographic keys. 



 These credentials confirm roles, permissions, or authority to engage in specific transactions (e.g., import operations). 



 Customs systems or regulatory APIs validate these credentials in real time. 



 No credential = no action. 



 And any attempt to forge or reuse expired credentials fails cryptographic validation instantly. 
 



<a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/"></a>Verifiable Credentials for Decentralized Digital Identity circuit<br>



 Why does a new data security system matter now? 



<p>Public institutions, regulatory bodies, and private sector players are increasingly vulnerable to identity-based fraud, whether it’s:</p>



 
 Fake authorizations for import/export activity. 



 Impersonation of officials for grants or tenders. 



 Abuse of state data for reputation laundering. 
 



<p>The Extrimian DID/VC framework prevents this by design:</p>



 
 Every claim is traceable, verifiable, and revocable. 



 You control your identity, but institutions can trust it without intermediaries. 



 AI systems or customs logic can automatically validate credentials without human review. 
 



 



 How does Extrimian Technology work for data security? 



 – Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): 



<p>A new standard for digital identity, DIDs are globally unique, user-controlled identifiers that don’t rely on central registries. Unlike CUITs or email addresses, DIDs can’t be spoofed.</p>



 – Verifiable Credentials: 



<p>Credentials (like “Governor of Córdoba”) are digitally signed and timestamped. They’re issued by a trusted entity and can be shown (and validated) without revealing unnecessary personal data.</p>



 –  Interoperability &amp; Compliance: 



<p>Extrimian builds on <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">W3C standards </a>and works with Hyperledger, Ethereum, and other Web3 protocols — making the stack fit for enterprise and government adoption.</p>



 



 Use Case: Protecting CUITs and import authorizations 



<p>Let’s reimagine the current scandal with Extrimian in place:</p>



Current ProblemExtrimian SolutionCUITs misused to authorize importsCredentials would require live cryptographic validationNo verification of who submitted paperworkEvery credential includes signer metadata and roleFraudulent authorization slips throughInvalid credentials are immediately rejected at the protocol layer



<p>The result? No more impersonations. No more unchecked imports.</p>



 



 What is the best Data Theft and Security solution? 



<p>The CUIT scandal is emblematic of a global challenge. As governments digitize, identity without verification is a liability. By integrating <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="">DIDs</a>, institutions don’t just stop fraud — they build digital trust for the AI era.</p>

<p>What if the real threat in the Hindu Kush Himalayas isn’t war, but collapse? What happens when melting glaciers, volatile politics, and fraying ecologies converge? Can we imagine security beyond borders — rooted in shared rivers, anticipatory governance, and a planetary ethic of care? What risks are we still refusing to&nbsp;see?</p><p>In June 2024, Dark Matter Labs was commissioned to develop a 75-year situational risk profile of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH). The goal was to identify the potential of catastrophic risk in the region, i.e. to map a complex terrain of cascading environmental threats, political instability, and social vulnerabilities that might, under certain pressures, tip into systemic crisis. One aspect we sought to explore was how water insecurity could add to political tensions and even lead to conditions for conflict in the&nbsp;region.</p><p>At the time, we chose not to share the full analysis publicly. Some of the risk intersections we identified, particularly around water infrastructure, migration corridors, and conflict hotspots, felt too sensitive, too easily misinterpreted or potentially weaponised. However, given the return of heightened conflict between India and Pakistan, it feels important to share at least part of our analysis. The objective is not to claim prescience or take sides but help shift the conversation away from land and borders to something much more oriented towards the socio-ecological continuities in the region that are hurtling towards systemic collapse. We offer this summary of our learnings in relation to the ongoing conflict.</p>Figure 1. The Hindu Kush Himalayas. Image by Nieves López Isquierdo¹. An Overview of Recent&nbsp;Events <p>On April 22, 2025, gunmen opened fire on a group of tourists in the Himalayan resort town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing 25 visitors and a local guide². The brutality of the incident has shattered any evidence of tenuous calm in the region — a narrative that the Indian government has promoted since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 (which revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s constitutional autonomy). The Indian government blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba, a UN-proscribed terrorist organisation based in Pakistan, for the attack. Within days, New Delhi accused Islamabad of supporting the attackers and launched a diplomatic and economic offensive. India downgraded ties, expelled Pakistani diplomats, sealed its land borders, and suspended the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty — a crucial water-sharing arrangement between the countries that had previously survived three major wars between the two nations³. Pakistan, denying any involvement, bristled at the accusations and retaliated in kind. It closed its airspace to Indian flights, halted all trade, and nearly put a 50-year-old bilateral peace treaty, the Simla Agreement, on&nbsp;hold⁴.</p><p>For ordinary people on both sides of the border, the sudden freefall in relations and outbreak of military hostilities has been alarming. In some regions, air raid sirens and border skirmishes have become nightly occurrences⁵. Even far from the conflict zone, the social fabric has been strained. The killings have opened up India’s already frayed religious and ethnic fault lines. In some Indian cities, anger over the Pahalgam killings has spilled into mob violence and xenophobia. Muslims, especially Kashmiris, living in places like Punjab and New Delhi, have found themselves harassed, assaulted, or shunned, as many Indians scapegoat them for the actions of militants⁶. Social media disinformation and the use of AI-manipulated content and deepfakes has been rampant on both sides, which has only fuelled polarisation and jingoism⁷.</p> Entangled Continuums / Systemic&nbsp;Risks <p>As the two nations trade fire and fury, a deeper crisis continues to unfold. HKH spans 3,500 kilometers across eight countries, towering as the planet’s ‘Third Pole’ with its vast ice fields and alpine ecosystems. It is an awe-inspiring landscape of glaciers, snow-fed rivers, and narrow valleys teeming with life — and risk. Even before the latest military flare-up, scientists and strategists had been sounding alarms about a cascading chain of environmental threats. Climate change is hitting the HKH region hard and fast. Average temperatures in the mountains are rising faster than the global average and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. If the world manages to limit global warming to +1.5°C, the Himalayas will likely experience about +2.0°C — enough to irreversibly alter its ecology. The spillover effects of such warming are already evident and will intensify: a third of all Himalayan glaciers could vanish, monsoon patterns are turning more erratic with heavier bursts of rain and longer droughts, and mountain disasters like landslides and flash floods are on the rise. All of this directly threatens the livelihoods and cultures of upland communities who have contributed almost nothing to global emissions but face outsize consequences.</p><p>Nowhere is the climate impact more dramatic than in the glaciers themselves. The HKH region holds about 73,000 square kilometers of glacier, a crucial store of fresh water that feeds Asia’s great rivers and provides water to over 240 million people in the HKH mountains, and an estimated 1.65–2 billion people downstream, affecting populations as far south as Vietnam. These glaciers are in rapid retreat. Recent assessments show that glacier loss in the 2010s was 65% faster than in the previous decade. By mid-century, the region is expected to hit ‘peak water’ — meaning melting glaciers will swell rivers to a maximum — after which water flows decline steadily as the ice reserves dwindle. If global warming is kept to 1.5–2°C, the Himalayas will still lose about 30–50% of their glacier volume by 2100. This is already an impossible target to meet. On the current trajectory of around 3°C of warming, up to three-quarters of the glacier ice could disappear by the end of the century. Such a loss would be catastrophic, causing both dangerous flooding in the near term and severe water shortages and food insecurity for decades thereafter. Food and water security for the HKH depend on the seasonal meltwater from glaciers. As one report starkly put it, “the people living in these mountains who have contributed next to nothing to global warming are at high risk” — and current adaptation efforts are nowhere near enough to help them&nbsp;cope.</p>Figure 2. Geodetic mass balance of glaciers in each region of the HKH and for the whole region (inset) for 1975–1999, 2000–2009, and 2010–2019. The size of the bars and their colour depend on changes in the average mass balance, expressed in metres water equivalent per year (m w.e. per year). The vertical black lines show the uncertainty. The bold numbers beside each basin give the glacier region in the Randolph Glacier Inventory⁸.Figure 3. Overview of all recorded cryospheric events in the HKH between 2015 and&nbsp;2023⁹.<p>In such a fragile landscape of risk, India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is particularly ominous. The Indus River and its tributaries support 80 percent of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan as well hydropower. Pakistani officials warned that any attempt by India to choke the Indus River would be taken as an “act of war” and met with “full force”¹⁰, and are in the process of finalising a legal response¹¹. In other words, water — the most basic of shared resources — has become a potential weapon, and it is portentous for other resource wars to escalate in a time of climate-induced scarcity. Similarly, consider the Brahmaputra River (known as Yarlung Tsangpo in China) which winds from Tibet into India and Bangladesh. China’s construction of mega-dams upstream and its plans to possibly divert waters have caused consternation in India, which has responded with its own infrastructure projects in the region (notably the construction of India’s longest under-river tunnel across the Brahmaputra¹²). The risk here is that 50% of the Brahmaputra’s catchment is in Chinese-controlled territory. While not explicitly weaponised as in the case of the Indus Water Treaty, there is a threat to India and Bangladesh if Beijing opts to exert too much control. Climate change, in this context, is a risk multiplier: more erratic monsoons and faster glacial melt could lead to sudden floods one decade and crippling droughts the next, without any nation firing a shot. Or worse: forcing one side or both to push towards hot war. All the countries of the HKH are thus bound in a high-stakes environmental lottery. Upstream actions create downstream impacts, and an extreme event in one place — be it a cloudburst, landslide, or outburst flood from a glacial lake — can send ripples of disaster through valleys that span multiple&nbsp;nations.</p><p>It is also important to recognize how multiple hazards stack onto vulnerable mountain populations. A recent multi-hazard assessment of the HKH found that nearly half (around 49%) of the region’s people are exposed to more than one type of natural hazard — often simultaneously. Only 19% of the population resides in the safest third of the land area, whereas one-fifth live in the most dangerous 9% of land where floods, landslides, and wildfires overlap¹³. Many of the high-risk zones are precisely the densely populated mountain valleys and foothill corridors where development has concentrated. For example, the Kashmir Valley, Nepal’s Middle Hills, and parts of the Hindu Kush in Pakistan all feature towns and farmlands squeezed between steep slopes and flood-prone rivers. When heavy monsoon rains come or when a glacier lake suddenly bursts its banks, the damage can be enormous and quickly crosses borders. This was evident in 2010 when epic floods in Pakistan (triggered by unusual monsoon patterns linked to a warming atmosphere) affected 20 million people and even impacted parts of Indian Kashmir downstream. Likewise, a major landslide or earthquake in the Himalayas could dam rivers or reroute them, with downstream countries helpless to prevent flooding. Such cascading disasters are not hypothetical&nbsp;; they are a question of when, not if. Each event can act as a threat multiplier: displacing communities, straining governments, and potentially fueling social unrest or migration that ignites new conflicts (fig.&nbsp;4).</p>Figure 4. An illustrative 50-year Risk Profile for the HKH. Image by Prateek Shankar, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs.<p>The Pahalgam terror attack and the ensuing military standoff occurred against such a backdrop of environmental fragility. In a very real sense, the skirmishes over borders and the looming crisis over glaciers are part of a single continuum of risk. Both stem from hyper-stressed systems that are increasingly interlinked. The HKH region faces an ‘entangled continuum’ of threats where a trigger in one domain (e.g., security) can exacerbate vulnerabilities in another (e.g., water and climate), and vice versa. It is no coincidence that as India and Pakistan were trading fire, they were also trading accusations over water and power supply. Nor is it a coincidence that even as soldiers were entrenched on the frontiers, families were worried about blackouts and crop irrigation back home. In this environment, a narrow focus on conventional, ‘hard’ security threats alone begins to look dangerously myopic.</p><p>This is why the lens of the nation-state, though institutionally powerful, is insufficient to understand what is happening in the region. The rivers of the HKH do not follow treaties or the speeches of political leaders in Delhi and Islamabad. They swell, split, and migrate. So do its communities, its vulnerabilities, and its threats. Treating each skirmish, each event, and each border incident as a contained political dispute misses the deeper story: the systemic weakening of a shared ecological and civilisational fabric. In the days following the Pahalgam attack, much of the attention had focused on questions of accountability and justice. But as long as that attention remains bounded by flags and frontiers, it misses this larger terrain of risk. This is and cannot be a region defined by conflict. It is defined by continuity. Migratory routes, trade flows, shared cosmologies, and mountain knowledge: these threads have always connected lives across what are now hard and militarized borders. The recent outbreak of conflict is not just the resurfacing of old grievances, but the fraying of such threads under new and regionally shared pressures — pressures which are barely acknowledged in public discourse in the&nbsp;region.</p>Figure 5. Development pathways and possible scenarios for the Hindu Kush Himalayas in&nbsp;2080¹⁴.<p>As an informed public and as stakeholders in this region’s future, we must push our leaders to recognize the continuum of risk, these risk commons. It is no longer enough to simply ‘defeat terrorism’ or ‘secure the border’ in a vacuum. Security in the HKH needs to be reconceived as ecological and human security, requiring principled and mediated dialogue and joint strategies that span from the highest mountain peak to the lowest floodplain. Instead of viewing each other as primary threats, countries of the HKH — and more importantly their leaders — may need to see that they face a common threat which is the entangled crisis of climate warming, a more volatile planet, and the cascading disasters it will bring. We must imagine a renewed sense of planetary security that recognises the entanglement of these risks and our shared futures (e.g. shared data infrastructures, anticipatory risk modeling, whole-systems analysis and bold diplomatic innovation). Ultimately, a bullet fired or a treaty broken in anger is not just an act against a rival nation but against the shared life-support systems that all nations depend&nbsp;on.</p><p>This blog was written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zehra-zaidi-obe-7255a5137/">Zehra Zaidi</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prateek-shankar/">Prateek Shankar</a> (who are British-Pakistani and Indian respectively).

 IDnow’s collaborative research project, MAMMOTH, which explores ways of addressing bias in face verification systems, comes to an end in Autumn 2025. Here, we share a summary of the findings so far, and what it could mean for a more inclusive future of identity verification. 



 



<p>Face verification has emerged as an indispensable way for businesses to quickly and securely prove the identity of their customers. There are multiple reasons for its widespread adoption, including enhanced security, reduced operational costs, and elevated user experiences.</p>



<p>Learn more about the steps we take to ensure our face verification and liveness detection capabilities are kept up to date and able to protect against deepfake attacks in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/deepfake-detection-presentation-liveness-technology/">blog, ‘The liveness advantage: Transforming deepfake vulnerabilities into trust opportunities.’</a></p>



 What is face verification and when is it used?&nbsp; 



<p>Face verification is a form of biometric technology that uses the unique features of a face to confirm an identity. In the context of remote identify verification, it involves capturing a digital image of a person’s face, often in real time, and comparing it to the identity photo extracted from a submitted identity document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘one-to-one’ matching process of face verification differs from the ‘one-to-many’ matching technique of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">face recognition,</a> which involves identifying an individual from images of other individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When combined with liveness detection, 3D depth analysis, and AI-powered pattern recognition, face verification can verify identity documents and the actual person behind them to dramatically reduce account takeovers, synthetic identity fraud, and impersonation attempts while creating a seamless customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">banking onboarding </a>to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">airport security</a>, face verification can transform time-consuming identity checks into seamless moments of trust. Beyond its commercial benefits, face verification offers significant social and economic advantages. It is particularly transformative in regions where many lack traditional forms of ID, providing an accessible means to verify identity and unlock services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, despite its widespread use, many face verification systems are still underperforming for specific demographics, such as darker skinned people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, a 2019 study by MIT Media Lab discovered that while face verification error rates for white men were just 0.8%, they jumped to <a href="https://www.aclu-mn.org/en/news/biased-technology-automated-discrimination-facial-recognition#:~:text=The%20error%20rate%20for%20light,published%20by%20MIT%20Media%20Lab.">34.7% for darker skinned women</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This demographic bias isn’t just a technical flaw – it undermines the right to equal access to essential digital services, such as opening bank accounts or registering for welfare or health services.</p>



 Undertaking a MAMMOTH project. 



<p>In 2022, alongside 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ai-bias-facial-verification/">IDnow set out to break down these barriers of bias</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency of the European Commission, the goal was to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In April 2025, I attended the&nbsp;‘<a href="https://mammoth-ai.eu/2nd-mammoth-webinar/">Addressing visual bias in Biometric Identity Verification</a>‘ webinar to share some of the <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2025W/SynRDinBAS/papers/Moussa_Face-swapping_based_Data_Augmentation_for_ID_Document_and_Selfie_Face_WACVW_2025_paper.pdf">findings</a> from the project, discuss how face verification biases arise and what can be done to address them.&nbsp;I was excited to share a solution to this very real problem in the digital world.</p>



 What’s the problem? Skin tone bias in ID verification. 



<p>State-of-the-art face verification models trained on conventional datasets show a significant increase in error rates for individuals with darker skin tones. This is due to an underrepresentation of minority demographics in public datasets. This lack of diversity in the data makes it difficult for models to perform well on underrepresented groups, leading to higher error rates for people with darker skin tones. This reinforces the urgent need for targeted solutions that address demographic imbalance in training data.</p>



 What’s the solution? The power of representation. 



<p>Ensuring face verification models are trained on a balanced dataset of images featuring characteristics typically absent from public datasets significantly improves model performance overall. For instance, as identity card photos may undergo color transformations applied by issuing bodies (e.g., governments), skin tone plays an important role, particularly if the calibration is not optimized for darker skin tones. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This miscalibration can create inconsistencies between the captured selfie image and the individual’s appearance in the ID card photo, especially for those with darker skin tones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shows that training using a demographically balanced real-world dataset that mirrors the specific characteristics and variability of identity card images can ensure more accurate and fair recognition for individuals with darker skin tones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this issue, IDnow proposed using a ‘style transfer’ method to generate new identity card photos that mimic the natural variation and inconsistencies found in real-world data. By augmenting the training dataset with synthetic images, it not only improves model robustness through exposure to a wider range of variations but also enables a further reduction of bias against darker skin faces. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Various experiments on public and proprietary real-world datasets reveal that fine-tuning state-of-the-art face verification models with the proposed methodology yields an 8% improvement in verification accuracy, while requiring only 25% of the original training data. In doing so, the accuracy gap between skin tone groups was reduced by more than 50%, ultimately leading to a fairer face verification system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Incorporating learnings from the MAMMOTH project has enabled us to improve the IDnow face verification system so that we may better address ethnically diverse markets in Europe and beyond.</p>

 A synthetic solution to a real-world problem. 



<p>As the global adoption of biometric face verification systems continues to increase across industries, it’s crucial to ensure that these systems are accurate and fair for all individuals, regardless of skin tone, gender or age. By focusing on designing balanced, ID card-specific training datasets and leveraging synthetic data augmentation techniques, such as style transfer, we can significantly reduce bias and improve the robustness of these models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, without a legal framework to ensure ethical standards are adhered to, even the greatest technological breakthrough will fall short of making a long-lasting social and economic impact. We are proud of the work we are doing to reduce bias in face verification systems and are hopeful that <a href="https://such%20guidance">such guidance</a> will become standard in global regulations, such as the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MAMMOTH project ensured all security measures were followed to protect data and comply with internationally accepted standards and privacy regulations, including GDPR.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of our ongoing series highlighting key contributors to the House Party Protocol (HPP), we spoke with Terry Kim, CEO of AlphaQuark, a core partner in the HPP ecosystem. AlphaQuark has positioned itself at the intersection of real-world assets (RWA), NFTs, and smart financial infrastructure, delivering tools to bring traditional asset valuation into the on-chain world. In this interview, Terry outlines how AlphaQuark is evolving alongside HPP, and why L2 scalability, AI integration, and cross-chain connectivity are unlocking the next frontier for tokenized assets.</p><p>Q1: How would you describe AlphaQuark’s role within the HPP ecosystem?<br>Terry Kim: AlphaQuark was built with a clear mission: to bridge real-world asset value into the blockchain economy. Within HPP, we act as the asset intelligence layer. We’re building not only tokenization systems but also pricing models, data integration tools, and evaluation protocols that let real-world assets interface with smart contracts. The result is a deeper connection between tangible value and programmable finance. In many ways, we’re the “what it’s worth” layer in an ecosystem that’s about verifying, trading, and applying that&nbsp;value.</p><p>Q2: How does AlphaQuark benefit from the transition to HPP Layer 2?<br>Terry Kim: L2 opens up much-needed bandwidth for complex asset logic. Valuation data changes frequently. Compliance checks, liquidity modeling, and even AI-based risk assessments all require more than static smart contracts. HPP Layer 2 gives us the ability to deploy more advanced contract logic and integrate AI agents without bottlenecking performance. It’s the infrastructure upgrade we needed to take AlphaQuark from issuing assets to operating living, evolving asset networks.</p><p>Q3: What is the possible shift for AlphaQuark after the launch of HPP?<br>Terry Kim: HPP marks a major turning point for us. We’ve always focused on building infrastructure for decentralized value, and with HPP Layer 2, we can now do that at scale and with far more sophistication. We’re not pivoting from traditional finance — we’re fully committing to building natively within Web3. This means optimizing for composability, data streaming, and AI-native integrations rather than relying on legacy compatibility. It’s a natural evolution of where we’ve been&nbsp;headed.</p><p>Q4: What makes AlphaQuark uniquely suited to contribute to a unified data and AI-first ecosystem like HPP?<br>Terry Kim: We’re already working with datasets that traditional DeFi protocols can’t handle: appraisal records, legal certificates, and real-world transaction history. Bringing these into the HPP ecosystem means integrating them with AI agents and verifiers. It also means building a common language for “what is valuable” across both human institutions and autonomous protocols. That’s a challenge we’re trying to&nbsp;solve.</p><p>Q5: What are some specific industries where AlphaQuark’s RWA infrastructure is seeing the most traction?<br>Terry Kim: Real estate is a big one, not just tokenizing properties, but bringing appraisal logic, loan terms, and insurance factors on-chain. We’re also seeing interest from insurance platforms, IP marketplaces, and even ESG data providers. They all need trust-minimized ways to package and transfer value. That’s what we will&nbsp;provide.</p><p>Q6: How is AlphaQuark leveraging smart contracts for asset valuation, and how will this evolve with L2?<br>Terry Kim: Right now, we use smart contracts to define valuation rules and create standardized RWA token formats. With HPP L2, we’ll be able to dynamically update those contracts with AI-supplied data. Imagine smart contracts that evolve based on real-time economic indicators, appraisal updates, or audit streams. We also see tremendous potential in AI-powered oracles, which can serve as a dynamic verification and data delivery layer for valuation logic. This will give RWAs a much more intelligent and adaptive pricing mechanism.</p><p>Q7: How do you approach data validation and compliance when bridging off-chain assets on-chain?<br>Terry Kim: We apply a mix of off-chain attestations, oracles, and verified issuers. The HPP ecosystem dramatically improves this with W3DB’s Verification-as-a-Service and Booost’s identity frameworks. That’s the beauty of an integrated ecosystem: we don’t have to build everything ourselves—we just connect to other verified components.</p><p>Q8: How do you see AlphaQuark integrating AI and autonomous agents?<br>Terry Kim: In two ways. First, AI will help process valuation data faster, especially in volatile or emerging markets. Second, autonomous agents can execute strategies like rebalancing asset portfolios, flagging suspicious price anomalies, or even initiating compliance actions. The endgame is programmable value, and AI is the logic layer that makes that&nbsp;real.</p><p>Q10: In 3–5 years, what role do you hope AlphaQuark will play in the future of on-chain finance?<br>Terry Kim: I hope we become the trusted layer for pricing and packaging real-world value. Whether it’s a digital twin of an asset, a structured NFT portfolio, or an AI-driven risk model, I want AlphaQuark to be the valuation oracle that DeFi and TradFi both trust. That’s the long&nbsp;game.</p><blockquote>We’re the “what it’s worth” layer in an ecosystem that involves verifying, trading, and applying that&nbsp;value.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/open-house-interview-with-alphaquark-ceo-on-real-world-assets-in-the-age-of-hpp-41b144c8f753">Open House: Interview with AlphaQuark CEO on Real-World Assets in the Age of HPP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   What if centralized dominance is just what success looks like in our current system? Today, I want to take a step back and ask: Why is it so hard to justify decentralization in the first place? What are we really rewarding when we call a system “successful”?

<p></p>



<p>That’s not a defense of centralization; it is a challenge to how we think about centralization vs decentralization, and how we define progress in enterprise systems and platform design. In tech, success is often framed in terms of scale, speed, and adoption. The bigger you grow, the more central you become. And we rarely stop to ask: Is that centralization a feature… or a failure of imagination?</p>



<p>This is the third post in a series about decentralization in enterprise systems, not as an ideal, but as a spectrum of tradeoffs we all navigate:</p>



 
 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/04/29/engineering-vs-economics/">Engineering Meets Economics</a>, I argued that flexibility is more valuable than ideological purity. We need systems that can move between centralized and decentralized states. 



 In <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/07/cost-of-decentralization/">How Decentralized Are You Willing to Pay For?</a>, I explored what that flexibility actually costs in time, money, tooling, and culture. 
 



<p>Today, I want to take a step back and ask: Why is it so hard to justify decentralization in the first place? What are we really rewarding when we call a system “successful”?</p>



 Success Metrics That Skew Centralized 



<p>Let’s be honest: most of our current incentives favor centralization. Consider how we measure success in enterprise or platform strategy:</p>



 
 Market share → the more users you serve, the more value you’re assumed to create 



 Efficiency → fewer systems, fewer teams, tighter control 



 Reliability → built-in resilience that looks like robustness, even when it’s just concentration 



 Governance → top-down visibility, fast decision-making, single owners 
 



<p>These are all perfectly reasonable goals. But these goals bias us toward consolidation. And once centralized systems become dominant, they become self-reinforcing; technically, economically, and even culturally.</p>



<p>That said, even centralized dominance is rarely permanent. In his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1587956.Clockspeed_?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=OMLFbrDB1m&amp;rank=1">Clockspeed</a> (have you read that book? No? You should.), Charles Fine argues that competitive advantage, whether it comes from control of the supply chain, platform dominance, or speed to market, is always temporary. The faster your environment moves, the more critical it becomes to reconfigure quickly. That makes modular systems, distributed governance, and optionality not just design preferences, but survival traits.</p>



<p>In that light, centralization might get you to success, but it won’t keep you there.</p>



 What’s the Alternative? Success as a Balancing Act  



<p>So let’s ask a different question:</p>



 
 What if success isn’t just about growth, but instead about sustaining healthy tension between centralized power and distributed control? 
 



<p>That’s what good governance often looks like. It’s not pure autonomy or rigid hierarchy. It’s a structure that lets people collaborate without collapsing into uniformity.</p>



<p>This isn’t a utopian call for federating all the things. It’s a call to recognize when centralization is helping and when it’s masking fragility, dependency, or misalignment.</p>



<p>We decentralize within organizations all the time:</p>



 
 We spin up new product teams 



 We delegate budget and decision-making to local units 



 We distribute accountability through OKRs and KPIs 
 



<p>But we do it with clear guardrails, shared incentives, and coordination models. In those cases, decentralization is seen as a sign of maturity, not a threat.</p>



<p>So why do we treat infrastructure decentralization like chaos? (Probably because we don’t do it well, but we can fix that.)</p>



 What This Means for Architecture (and the Org Chart) 



<p>If we accept that centralization is often the default path, not necessarily the best one, then we need to build systems that allow for intentional divergence.</p>



<p>That means:</p>



 
 Designing systems that don’t break when more than one authority exists 



 Structuring metrics to reward adaptability, not just consolidation 



 Treating decentralization not as risk, but as a capacity for complexity 
 



<p>And yes, it also means knowing when centralization is a good choice because it simplifies the right things, not everything.</p>



 Rethinking the Goal 



<p>You don’t need to decentralize your stack into a thousand services. (Good gravy, can you even imagine the insanity?) But you do need to ask:</p>



<p>Are we building systems that grow toward concentration by default because that’s easier to explain, easier to pitch, or easier to measure? Or are we designing for the kinds of success that hold space for flexibility, autonomy, and resilience?</p>



<p>If centralization is the only outcome we allow ourselves to count, we’re optimizing for a world where fragility just looks like efficiency … until it doesn’t. </p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Hey everybody, welcome back. This is the third episode in our series on centralization and decentralization, and the balance between the two.</p>



<p>If you’re just tuning in now, here’s what you’ve missed:</p>



 
 In episode one, we explored why resilience isn’t about being centralized or decentralized. It’s about being able to move between the two models when circumstances change. 



 In episode two, we looked at the real cost of building that kind of flexibility. Because optionality isn’t free. It takes planning, coordination, and a willingness to invest before you need it. 
 



 



 Why Is Decentralization a Hard Sell? 



<p>[00:01:01]<br>And that brings us to today’s topic. Why is decentralization often still such a hard sell, especially inside enterprises?</p>



<p>[00:01:09]<br>One answer is because most of our success metrics reward centralization.</p>



<p>[00:01:15]<br>If we don’t challenge how we’re defining success, we’re going to keep optimizing for systems that look great—right up until the point that they don’t.</p>



 



 Centralization and Scale 



<p>[00:01:22]<br>Let’s talk about that in tech. We don’t just love things at scale; we know how to do things at scale fairly well.</p>



<p>[00:01:31]<br>When we’re working with centralized systems, we know the playbook:</p>



 
 Throw more hardware at it 



 Replicate the databases 



 Spin things up in other regions 



 Set up failovers, caching, and routing magic to absorb traffic 
 



<p>And that totally works—up to a point. Even when control is centralized, we’re very good at scaling the infrastructure around it.</p>



<p>[00:01:50]<br>When it comes to decentralized models, we know how to do that too. We just don’t plan that way as often.</p>



<p>[00:01:56]<br>At least not anymore. Think about the protocols from the early days of the Internet: DNS, BGP, SMTP. They’re not flawless or simple, but they work at global scale because they were built to distribute control and survive failure.</p>



<p>[00:02:14]<br>Everyone gets a piece of the responsibilities in those protocols. Everyone can operate within a shared structure. That’s decentralized centralization, and we did it really well.</p>



 



 The Problem with Success Metrics 



<p>[00:02:25]<br>But now, today’s challenge: most of the success metrics we use today, especially in enterprise systems, still push us towards centralization.</p>



<p>[00:02:33]<br>Why? Because it looks faster, is easier to explain, and is a lot easier to report on.</p>



<p>[00:02:40]<br>But when success is only measured by how tightly we can control the system, we end up building architectures that aren’t particularly flexible. And that’s a problem.</p>



 



 Centralization Helped Us Grow—But Does It Still? 



<p>[00:02:49]<br>Now let’s step back for a moment. You might be thinking, “Well, yes, but centralization is what helped us grow as a company, helped us grow at speed.” And yes, you are absolutely right. Centralization often is what helps organizations move fast, simplify complexity, and work at scale. It gives you:</p>



 
 Clean handoffs 



 Predictable systems 



 Fewer moving parts 



 Optimized performance without needing to get everyone to agree on everything 
 



<p>And when you’re trying to move quickly, those things are real advantages.</p>



<p>[00:03:19]<br>But the thing is, those advantages—whether from your infrastructure perspective or your market perspective—don’t last forever.</p>



<p>[00:03:30]<br>Markets might shift, regulations might change, vendor lock-in might become a liability, and the systems that helped you grow start to hold you back.</p>



<p>[00:03:40]<br>There’s a great idea from supply chain strategy that applies here: the faster your environment moves, the more important it becomes to reconfigure quickly.</p>



<p>[00:03:48]<br>And that’s where centralized success starts to crack—not because it failed technically, but because it couldn’t adapt fast enough.</p>



<p>[00:03:56]<br>So the question isn’t, “Didn’t centralization help us grow?” It’s, “Can we keep growing without the ability to be a little bit more flexible?”</p>



 



 Decentralization in Organizations 



<p>[00:04:07]<br>It’s kind of funny—we decentralize all the time, but just not when it comes to our infrastructure and definitely not our identity infrastructures.</p>



<p>Inside organizations, we break up control and distribute responsibility on purpose:</p>



 
 Teams have their own budgets 



 Product groups make roadmap decisions 



 Key performance indicators are set at the department level, not just at the company level 
 



<p>[00:04:31]<br>Why? Because trying to control everything from the top down slows you down. It’s more sustainable to align goals than to micromanage every function.</p>



<p>Take a typical enterprise product org as an example. One team focuses on mobile, another on partner integrations, a third on internal tooling. Each team moves independently within shared priorities. They don’t all escalate to the CIO to push code; they’re trusted to make decisions locally based on their goals and context. We don’t call that chaos—we call that autonomy and maturity.</p>



<p>[00:05:05]<br>Think of it like a city: every neighborhood has its own character, maybe its own rules, but they follow the same traffic lights, zoning laws, public services. That’s decentralization with coordination.</p>



<p>[00:05:17]<br>The control, to an extent, is distributed. If we can do this with people and even in governments—if we can handle distributed authority in complex orgs—why does decentralizing infrastructure sometimes feel so risky? It’s not because we can’t do it. It’s because we haven’t applied the same thinking to systems that we apply to teams of people.</p>



 



 Building Flexibility into Identity 



<p>[00:05:42]<br>If centralization has been our default version of success, what does success look like when you build in the flexibility to decentralize?</p>



<p>[00:05:50]<br>It doesn’t mean blowing up your current architecture, because that would probably be bad and you wouldn’t get very far.</p>



<p>[00:05:56]<br>It doesn’t mean ditching your identity provider or rebuilding everything from scratch, because that also wouldn’t make you very popular and probably wouldn’t get you very far. But it does mean designing for modularity and movement.</p>



<p>[00:06:07]<br>A successful, flexible identity system might include:</p>



 
 Federated logins that work across partners but don’t collapse if one party changes their trust model 



 Credential issuance that’s anchored to your core directory but usable outside your domain 



 Policy enforcement that supports delegation, so different teams or regions can adapt without rewriting global configurations 



 Flexible authentication layers that can shift to support new protocols without breaking legacy systems 
 



<p>[00:06:42]<br>Another good example of flexible identity systems that don’t require a centralized focus.</p>



<p>[00:06:49]<br>Ask yourself in your organization:</p>



 
 Can you change identity providers without breaking logins for 50,000 users? 



 Can you delegate trust without rerouting everything through one central system? 
 



<p>[00:07:03]<br>Are you prepared to adapt when legal or business requirements shift, or will you end up frozen and need to make a plan on the fly?</p>



<p>[00:07:14]<br>Being able to say “yes” to those things—that’s what success with flexibility looks like.</p>



 



 Key Takeaways 



<p>[00:07:25]<br>You don’t have to decentralize everything—and probably shouldn’t. But if your architecture can accommodate controlled divergence and flexibility, you’re set up for long-term success.</p>



<p>[00:07:43]<br>That’s what matters. That’s what’s really cool.</p>



<p>[00:07:46]<br>Here’s the takeaway from today.</p>



<p>[00:07:50]<br>Centralization isn’t the enemy. But if success only counts as scale, simplicity, or speed, that story can get brittle quickly.</p>



<p>[00:08:03]<br>We already know how to decentralize in our org charts and delegate decisions without chaos. We just haven’t always brought that thinking into our infrastructure and identity systems—but we could.</p>



<p>[00:08:15]<br>Success doesn’t have to mean one system to rule them all. It can mean systems that adapt without starting over. That adaptability only works when you’ve got governance built in to support it.</p>



<p>[00:08:30]<br>Our technology is almost good enough—sometimes more than good enough. But shared control takes more than configuration files. It takes structure, accountability, and intention.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts 



<p>[00:08:53]<br>And remember, resilient systems don’t just run well—they recover well and grow on purpose.</p>

<p>Welcome back to our ongoing reflections on the Many-to-Many project! If you joined us for our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/untangling-complexity-how-can-we-better-support-collaboration-on-complex-and-interconnected-cd83272e68c3">first post</a>, you’ll know we’re trying to reimagine complex governance. For over two years, we’ve been working with diverse partners to understand how groups of organisations can collaborate more effectively to tackle challenges bigger than any single entity could manage alone. This journey has generated a wealth of detailed and complex information.</p>Many-to-Many is designed for groups who want to collaborate to solve complex challenges but require new ideas about value, ownership, and&nbsp;power.<p>One part of our team recently spent an intensive week together in Berlin, focusing on transforming this rich knowledge into accessible information, tools, and insights shared via a digital platform. We committed to “working out loud” and sharing our progress and learnings along the way. Several weeks have passed since our Berlin session and our initial blog post. We had ambitious timelines, and as is often the case with complex projects, the path has had its twists and turns. In this post, we — Michelle, Gurden, and Arianna — share an honest update on what we’ve bumped into, how our thinking has evolved, and the human process of building something meaningful.</p><p>Michelle: So, we talked about “working out loud.” It’s been about four or five weeks since we published the last blog post. We had these grand ambitions in Berlin, thinking we’d have much more to share publicly by now, and that hasn’t quite happened. I’m interested in discussing what we bumped into. What were our blockers? We’ve still made progress, but what prohibited us from moving as quickly as we initially thought?</p><p>Gurden: I can start… I think the process, looking back, has been very human. Let’s be honest, this period, at least in Berlin, had holidays almost every week. Arianna took some time off, and I think some of us got sick. So, if we’re slow, that’s one reason. But secondly, and this was a blessing in disguise for me as the newest team member, I got time for my mind to slowly digest everything. Arianna and I talked about this — this pace allowed our perspective to mould in a nice way, rather than forcing something out.</p><p>I’m very happy that after our workshop, we published the first blog and got a really good signal. Many people commented, liked, and shared it on LinkedIn, and some reached out directly via email. That itself shows what we’re building is on a good path. Then you, Michelle, who is working painstakingly on the Many-to-Many System mega model and documenting your thought process — stopping at key milestones and briefing us. This allowed all three of us to bounce ideas off each other, crystallising, and navigating as we go. Arianna and I started wireframing, which is our way to think out loud, understand, and prioritise.</p><p>But, there’s so much content, so we asked a question to try and help us simply and hone into the real essence — “What needs to be on the homepage?” We started with the journey from the workshop, and we’re evolving. Our first wireframe to what we have now — it’s becoming very tangible. The tangibility has increased a lot since the workshop. It’s getting more visual and taking on a website-like frame. My feedback on the earlier design was that there was too much, maybe 10 buttons, and now it’s becoming more focused. That’s definitely positive. As a coder, I can imagine how we’ll set up the system, the database. I’m looking forward to validating it with other human&nbsp;beings.</p>Thinking through prototyping, going from stories to wireframing steps in the narration<p>Arianna: I can go next. After the workshop, we came to realise how complex it is to navigate the vast amount of information we’re dealing with, especially when it comes to understanding what a person wants, and what they’re struggling with or needing. These two aspects are deeply intertwined, but they unfold across many layers of&nbsp;detail.</p><p>At one point, we found ourselves with a triple navigation system, full of sub-navigations. It became clear that this structure, instead of helping, would likely add confusion; even for someone already familiar with the content but searching for something specific.</p><p>Therefore we spent a lot of time rethinking categorization and identifying different types of information. We started asking: is this one website, one narration explanation? Or could we introduce a double narration including tools and needs? That’s when it clicked — we actually need stories. Not just technical explanations or dry structures.</p><p>The knowledge Michelle, Annette, and Angela bring is full of stories — rich, lived, and layered. And stories are powerful, especially for someone new to a platform. They provide orientation, connection, and&nbsp;meaning.</p><p>Michelle: I want to quickly revisit what you were saying, Gurden, about the time to digest. It’s fascinating, and I’m making a meta-point here. I’ve been trying to digest everything we’ve learned over the past multiple years into our Many-to-Many System. In almost every fifth slide, I’m thinking, “We didn’t all have enough time to digest this at the time we were doing it.” And I’ve realised that’s a key point because of so many unfulfilled potentials. It created a real centralisation because if the whole collaboration didn’t fully understand what was going on, knowledge tended to centralize back into a few people. So, at the end of the day, learning happens at the pace humans can learn, mixed in with all the other stuff they have going on in their lives. As a meta-reflection, we just have to keep reminding ourselves that no matter how good the structures or digital tools are, a collaboration is ultimately about humans. That’s always going to be a&nbsp;factor.</p><p>In terms of the process of building this system, I liked what both of you were saying about refinement, categorization, and creating intelligent information architectures. How do we make this so that someone can actually enter this world and find their way around? For me, that has been the hardest part — consistently zooming in and zooming out. Thinking about something at the highest conceptual, strategic level, all the way down to what we learned, how we structured it, and then how we put this information onto a website where people know what button to push. This is a very wide-spanning problem&nbsp;space.</p><p>The last thing is this concept Arianna alluded to: we’ve been bouncing ideas around. The three of us have been pushing ahead in our own parts but checking in regularly. Frankly, without those check-in moments, none of this could have progressed. It’s so dense that it needs more than one brain on it at a time to untangle&nbsp;it.</p>Bouncing ideas around, but with precise meaning and positionalities<p>Gurden: Yes, what both of you said resonates with me. We’re calling it “systems,” but humans are at the center and heart of everything. That’s who we’re making it for. In our wireframing, we concluded that the first thing is the mindset people are coming from, and then we came to stories because that’s what humans connect&nbsp;with.</p><p>It’s been great having you both to bounce ideas and discuss any confusion. But I’ll highlight this as a challenge as well: when we put this website out, there will be one brave person going through it by themselves, most likely. How this website gives that companionship is something we’ve been thinking about. We’ve used words like “guide” and “field guide.” Maybe the brand and design should embody this — like, “Hey, we’re here, we understand it’s a hard, human thing, and we’re here to&nbsp;help.”</p><p>Michelle: Maybe that’s a great place to kind of end this blog? By asking, has anyone seen that done well? Does anyone know of any really great digital spaces that are trying to be a guide to help people navigate complex information, especially in a collaborative or shared, multi-person context? I&nbsp;haven’t.</p><p>Gurden: A lot of sites have that chatbot thing pop up on the right. I absolutely hate it; for me, that is not the answer. Maybe the bot is getting smarter with AI, but I don’t think that’s enough for our&nbsp;case.</p><p>Arianna: It’s about creating an ongoing, embodied story. One that offers orientation, not just information. At the same time, it needs to provide usable tools. So there’s a dual role: guiding through narrative, and supporting through function.</p><p>Not just about simplifying the complexity, but offering clarity and companionship within&nbsp;it.</p><p>On that note, we’ll pause this reflection. The journey continues, and the challenge of creating a truly supportive and navigable digital space for complex collaboration is one we’re embracing. We’d love to hear your thoughts.

 What is the problem with the higher education credentials verification? 



<p>Weeks of time-consuming, error-prone effort shouldn’t be required to verify academic records. But from 2022 to 2025:</p>



 
 \$600 M+ lost annually to fabricated diplomas. 



 5–14 days for each manual verification. 



 Under 50 % of universities use multi-factor authentication (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex" title="">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>). 
 



 Higher Education Degree and Certification Datacheck: 



<p>This article illustrates how decentralized identity (SSI) and Extrimian’s solutions eliminate these pain points with real-world numbers, self-evident steps, and a path to instant, fraud-proof verification.</p>



 



 1. Why traditional Verification System Fails? 



 1.1 Credential Fraud Runs Wild 



 
 \$600 M+ lost each year to fake or altered diplomas. 



 30 % of job candidates forge degrees on resumes (<a href="https://www.resumebuilder.com/resume-examples/1-4-americans-have-lied-on-their-resume/" title="">ResumeBuilder, 2023</a>). 
 



 1.2 Manual, Slow Workflows 



 
 5–14 days per transcript or diploma order. 



 $20–$30 fee per manual verification. 
 



 1.3 Security &amp; Compliance Loopholes 



 
 Centralized databases are easy targets. 



 Less than 50 % MFA implementation (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>). 



 Email and fax expose personal data to interception. 
 



<p>Suggested image: Bar chart comparing manual vs. SSI verification time<br>Alt-text: “Bar chart comparing 5–14 day manual verification with 2-minute SSI verification.”</p>



 



 2. What is Decentralized Digital Identity? 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity decentralizes control: credentials live in students’ digital wallets, not in some central silo.</p>



 
 Fraud-proof: Cryptographic signatures keep out tampering. 



 Instant verification: Verify authenticity in seconds. 



 Selective disclosure: Reveal only what’s needed (e.g., “Graduated 2025” without full transcript). 



 Built-in compliance: Complies with GDPR, FERPA, and LGPD by design.

Accelerate and secure credential checks with Extrimian’s real-time verification tools, reducing manual reviews and errors.



<p></p>



 3. What are the benefits of Extrimian’s End-to-End Verification Suite? 



 A. Digital Credential Wallet 



 
 Student control: Store diplomas and transcripts on mobile or web. 



 Offline ready: Accessible anytime, even without Internet. 



 Selective sharing: Share temporary QR codes or secure links. 
 



 B. ID Connect API &amp; Dashboard 



 
 No-code integration: Live in less than a day with prebuilt SIS and LMS connectors. 



 Real-time analytics: Track issuance volume, verification logs, and alerts. 



 Enterprise security: End-to-end encryption, role-based access, full audit trails. 
 



 C. Extrimian Academy 



 
 On-demand training: SSI essentials courses to advanced API workflows. 



 Hands-on labs: Sandbox for issuing DIDs and VCs. 



 Certifications: Show your team’s SSI expertise to auditors and stakeholders.

 Why Phishing-Resistant MFA Isn’t Optional Anymore  
<p>The escalating sophistication of phishing and social engineering attacks has pushed organizations towards stronger authentication methods. Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), particularly solutions leveraging FIDO2/WebAuthn standards, is a big leap forward in security posture.<br><br>Many organizations utilize hardware-based FIDO2 authenticators like YubiKeys by Yubico, widely recognized as a gold standard for physical tokens, preventing credential theft and account takeover at the point of authentication. Deploying any security key represents a serious commitment to security, effectively neutralizing threats that rely on stolen passwords or easily intercepted one-time codes.</p>  
 The Broader Picture of Phishing-Resistant Authentication  
Achieving true end-to-end security requires a strategy that extends beyond the initial implementation of phishing-resistant authentication methods. While these methods are a critical defense, organizations often discover that phishing-resistant authentication&nbsp;
alone
&nbsp;is not enough to address all security and operational aspects.
<br>
Specifically, when deploying physical hardware authenticators, which are a common way to achieve strong phishing resistance, organizations can encounter significant operational complexities.<br><br>These "Day 2 problems" involve managing these physical tokens across their entire lifecycle, a challenge that can be particularly acute within large or widely distributed teams. It’s important to understand that these are not shortcomings of any particular brand of hardware authenticator, but rather inherent complexities in managing any physical security hardware at scale
<br> 
 Challenge 1: Secure Onboarding and YubiKey Provisioning  
<p>Getting the right key into the hands of the right user securely is the critical first step.</p> 
  
  The Identity Verification Imperative: Before a YubiKey is issued (in person or shipped), organizations must be certain of the recipient's identity. Standard procedures may not suffice, especially for remote workers. How do you reliably verify someone you've never met?  
  Risk of Mis-Provisioning: Relying on known weak checks like email or simple attestations (KBA) creates risk. An incorrectly provisioned key compromises the entire security model from the start, potentially handing access directly to an attacker impersonating a new employee.  
  
 Challenge 2: Navigating Ongoing Identity Lifecycle Management  
<p>The physical nature of YubiKeys introduces critical ongoing management needs.</p> 
  
  Loss, Theft, Damage, and Lockouts: YubiKeys can be lost, stolen, damaged, or even locked due to too many failed PIN attempts or forgotten credentials. Each of these scenarios requires a secure recovery process, particularly for remote users.  
  Administrative Overhead: Tracking inventory, managing assignments, handling secure revocation for lost/stolen tokens or for departing employees, and ensuring firmware updates add complexity and usually require manual processes to avoid security gaps.  
  
 Challenge 3: Phishable Recovery Methods Undermine Security  
<p>Perhaps the most significant challenge arises when a user loses their YubiKey, especially if it's their primary or even sole FIDO2 authenticator.</p> 
  
  The Recovery Conundrum: YubiKeys are designed to be resistant to remote attacks. This strength means recovery processes must not create a weak link that attackers can circumvent.  
  The Pitfall of Phishable Fallbacks: In the case of a lost YubiKey, reverting back to easily phished methods like SMS/voice OTPs, email links, or security questions for recovery completely undermines the security gains provided by the YubiKey. Attackers know to target these weak recovery paths.  
  The Need for Verified Recovery: A truly secure system requires a recovery process that incorporates strong, multi-factor identity verification. Only after strong identity assurance should you allow legitimate users to regain access or register a new key. This will keep the door closed to social engineering or deepfake attacks.  
  
 YubiKeys Need Integrated Credential Management and Identity Verification  
<p>This guide explores how integrating a dedicated identity assurance platform like HYPR can effectively bridge these management and identity verification gaps. By complementing your Yubico deployment, HYPR helps manage these credentials in your environment and integrates &nbsp;multi-factor identity verification into the key lifecycle moments, ensuring your investment in phishing-resistant hardware delivers its full security potential.</p> 
<p>Let's see how the HYPR Identity Assurance platform addresses the gaps.</p> 
 Secure Onboarding and Hiring with Candidate Verification  
<p>How do you confidently issue a powerful security key like a YubiKey to a new employee, especially one working remotely, without creating an undue security risk or friction? Legacy methods relying on KBA, email verification, manager approvals, or even just shipping a key to a home address lack the level of identity verification needed, to be sure you don’t fall victim to a social engineering attack.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s customizable Identity Verification (IDV) integrates directly into your onboarding flow, before any credentials, including a YubiKey, are provisioned. This isn't just a simple check; this verification involves multiple checks of various factors, in a layered approach, that is tailored exactly to your organization's risk tolerance:</p> 
 Device Check  
<p>HYPR first detects the device the user is on to do the verification, and can check if it is the expected device.</p> 
 Location Detection  
<p>A geolocation location detection is performed and compared against expected location. Radius distance from expected location can be customized.</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Users are prompted to scan a government-issued ID (driver's license, passport) using their smartphone. HYPR analyzes the document for authenticity, checking security features and tampering evidence, and checks the validity of the document against national databases.</p> 
 Biometric Facial Recognition  
<p>To ensure the person presenting the ID is its rightful owner, HYPR employs facial biometric matching, comparing a live selfie capture to the photo on the ID document or in your own data stores. Additionally, liveness detection prevents spoofing attempts while using photos or videos.</p> 
 Manager Attestation  
<p>Combine live video verification and a secure chat, seamless experience human verification transaction. Supervisors or IT can attest to the identity of their team members, adding an extra layer of assurance.</p> 
 Example: Secure Onboarding with HYPR  
<p>Imagine a new remote hire receives an onboarding link on their first day. They are guided through the HYPR identity verification. Only upon successful verification is their identity confirmed, allowing subsequent steps like registering their primary authentication methods, like their assigned YubiKey.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This process securely binds the verified physical identity to the digital identity and the associated credentials. It drastically reduces the risk of provisioning keys to fraudulent accounts and establishes a trusted foundation for the user's entire lifecycle.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Build Phishing-Resistant Account Recovery Workflows  
<p>As mentioned previously, the security gains of YubiKeys are instantly nullified if a user who loses their key can recover their account using phishable methods like SMS OTPs, email links, or knowledge-based answers (KBAs). We know attackers actively target these weak recovery paths at the help desk or user levels.</p> 
<p>HYPR eliminates this vulnerability by ensuring recovery processes maintain the same high level of security as primary authentication. When a user needs to recover access (e.g., after losing their YubiKey), they leverage other already registered and verified strong authentication factors managed by HYPR as well as a re-verification of identity:</p> 
 Multi-Factor Recovery  
<p>Recovery typically involves using the HYPR mobile application on a registered smartphone, protected by device biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint) or a secure PIN, potentially combined with other factors or contextual checks depending on policy. Should more identity assurance be needed, HYPR can also push the user through an identity re-verification process.</p> 
 Self-Service Enablement  
<p>To reduce the burden on IT teams, users can securely initiate recovery themselves through a guided, secure workflow, often without needing costly or time-consuming help desk intervention.</p> 
<p>In cases where a YubiKey is lost, damaged, or needs to be replaced, users can quickly register a new device once their identity is re-verified through a secure recovery flow.</p> 
<p>For scenarios where a device is locked, for instance after too many failed PIN attempts or a forgotten PIN, recovery can still be handled efficiently through a help-desk–driven approach. With HYPR Affirm, this process is safeguarded by strong identity verification, ensuring only the rightful user regains access.<br>Account recovery becomes as resistant to phishing and social engineering as the initial login, preserving the integrity of the entire security system. This directly addresses the most significant operational and security pain points associated with hardware token deployments.</p> 
 Beyond Login: Contextual Awareness and Continuous Authentication  
 Dynamic Trust  
<p>Security isn't static. HYPR can optionally integrate risk signals from devices, users, and browsers, to provide continuous authentication and adaptive access control, even after a successful YubiKey login.</p> 
 Risk Signals  
<p>Factors like device health (e.g., integrating with endpoint detection and response tools like CrowdStrike), geographic location ("impossible travel" scenarios), network reputation, and even behavioral signals can inform a real-time risk score.</p> 
 Adaptive Risk Policies  
<p>Based on this score, HYPR can dynamically adjust security requirements. A low-risk login might proceed seamlessly after the initial YubiKey tap, while a higher-risk scenario could trigger a request for an additional factor or limit access privileges. This allows organizations to balance security posture with user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Streamline YubiKey Management: From Friction to Flow  
 User-Driven YubiKey Enrollment &amp; Renewal  
<p>HYPR turns YubiKey onboarding into a self-service experience. End users pair their YubiKeys, automatically enroll X.509 certificates, and enjoy seamless certificate renewals, with no routine IT involvement required and continuous access guaranteed.</p> 
 Bird’s-Eye Admin Visibility  
<p>While day-to-day enrollment and renewals run themselves, HYPR’s Console Integration gives administrators a consolidated dashboard of every YubiKey enrollment, certificate status, and recent identity verification events. This eliminates the need for spreadsheets point tools.</p> 
 Graceful Deprovisioning  
<p>Rather than manually “removing” keys from the admin console (which doesn’t revoke the certificate on the device), HYPR enable endpoint-driven deprovisioning. Users retire lost or retired keys directly from their workstation, ensuring true on-device certificate removal when possible.</p> 
 Resilient Multi-Factor Backup  
<p>Users can register multiple authenticators as primary and backup. YubiKeys plus HYPR is an ideal combination, so if one factor goes missing, users still authenticate securely through another, dramatically cutting lockouts and support tickets.</p> 
 Achieve End-to-End Phishing Resistance with HYPR  
<p>The journey towards zero trust cybersecurity demands more than just deploying strong authentication factors; it requires a holistic approach that secures the entire identity lifecycle. YubiKeys represent a vital component in this strategy, offering unparalleled phishing resistance at the point of login. However, as we've explored, their true potential is only fully unlocked when paired with solutions that address the critical challenges of high-assurance identity verification and streamlined lifecycle management.</p> 
 Key Steps to Optimize Yubikey Deployments  
<p>Moving from understanding these challenges to implementing effective solutions requires a deliberate approach made custom for your environment. As you consider how to optimize your YubiKey deployment or plan a new one, here are some suggested actionable steps to take:</p> 
  
  Assess Your Current Reality: Honestly evaluate your existing processes. 
    
    Where does friction exist in your YubiKey issuance and management?  
    How are you currently handling remote employee onboarding and identity proofing?  
    Map out your current account recovery workflow. Does it rely on phishable factors like SMS or security questions?<br>Identifying these specific pain points is the first step.  
      
  Define Your Identity Assurance Needs: Determine the level of certainty required when verifying identities.&nbsp;<br> 
    
    Is a basic check sufficient, or do compliance regulations and risk levels demand high-assurance methods like biometric verification against government IDs, especially for privileged users?  
      
  Chart the Full User Lifecycle: Document every stage where a user interacts with credentials, particularly YubiKeys. Pinpoint potential vulnerabilities or inefficiencies in provisioning, replacement, temporary access needs, and deprovisioning.  
  Scrutinize Your Recovery Strategy: This is paramount. If your recovery process undermines your FIDO2 investment, it needs immediate attention. Define requirements for a truly phishing-resistant recovery mechanism.  
  Identify Integration Requirements: List the key systems (your Identity Provider (IdP), HR Information System (HRIS), endpoint security tools) that any management and identity verification solution must seamlessly integrate with.  
  
 Key Questions to Ask Potential Solution Providers  
<p>Armed with your internal assessment, engage vendors with targeted questions to understand how their solutions address these challenges, that are specific to your environment, when integrating with YubiKeys:</p> 
  
  Onboarding &amp; Identity Proofing:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How specifically does your solution verify the identity of remote users before a YubiKey is provisioned to them?  
    What methods (e.g., document scanning, liveness checks, data validation) do you employ to achieve high assurance, and how is this verified identity securely linked to the user's account and key?  
      
  Secure Account Recovery:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    Describe your workflow for a user who has lost their YubiKey. Importantly, how do you enable secure, self-service recovery without falling back on phishable factors like SMS, email links, or KBAs?  
    How is phishing resistance maintained throughout?  
      
  Lifecycle Automation:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    Explain how your platform automates YubiKey provisioning and deprovisioning by integrating with systems like our IdP based on user lifecycle events (joiners, movers, leavers).  
      
  Lost/Stolen Key Management:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    What is the secure process within your system for handling lost or stolen YubiKeys, including issuing replacements and potentially providing secure temporary access?  
      
  Integration &amp; Visibility:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How does your solution integrate with [mention your specific IdP, e.g., Okta, Entra ID]?&nbsp;  
    Can it provide a unified administrative view of YubiKeys alongside other authentication methods?  
      
  User Experience:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How do you ensure these necessary security steps (IDV, secure recovery) are implemented with minimal friction for the end-user?  
      
  Scalability &amp; Compliance:&nbsp;<br> 
    
    How does your platform scale to manage potentially thousands of YubiKeys?  
    What specific reporting and audit logs are generated to help meet compliance requirements?

<p>A Real-World Story of Scale, Trust &amp; Blockchain in Action</p>







<p></p>



<p>Earlier this month, over 3.1 million students across Maharashtra received their SSC and HSC exam results online. Dhiway had the opportunity to build and manage the backend infrastructure for this release in partnership with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/navneet-education-ltd-/">Navneet Education Limited</a></p>



<p>It was a significant milestone — not just in terms of volume, but because of what it represented:</p>



 
 The need for reliable and fast access 



 The demand for tamper-resistant, verifiable documents 



 And the expectation of a seamless digital experience for every student 
 



 <br>The Task 



<p>Navneet approached us with a clear challenge: Can you help us publish board results for millions of students — quickly, securely, and without system failure?</p>



<p>They also wanted each result document to be verifiable using <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/cord-network/">CORD</a> blockchain, to ensure long-term trust and authenticity. This meant handling high user concurrency, delivering fast response times, and ensuring every student could access and download their results without delay.</p>



 <br>Our Approach 



<p>We focused on three core principles: Performance, resilience, and trust.</p>



<p>Here’s how we addressed them:</p>



 
 Cloud-native setup using AWS, with auto-scaling and rate-limiting to manage traffic surges 



 Multi-layer caching to support sub-second response times 



 Client-side rendering, where appropriate, to reduce backend load 



 QR code integration on result PDFs, backed by blockchain hashes 



 Mobile-first design to support access from any device, even in low-bandwidth areas 
 



<p>We also ran extensive load tests with JMeter, simulating double the expected traffic to ensure we were prepared.</p>



Results at scale, delivered with speed and trust — 3.1 M+ students, zero downtime.



<p></p>



<p>Over two separate days of results publication, the system was resilient and provided a positive experience to students anxiously awaiting their results and seeking to download the documents.</p>



 <br>Why Blockchain? 



<p>Every result PDF included a QR code linked to a verifiable digital record anchored on the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/cord-network/">CORD</a> Blockchain, built for trust infrastructure.</p>



<p>This ensured that:</p>



 
 Each result document was tamper-resistant 



 Verification could happen instantly, from anywhere, without needing to log into a portal 
 



<p>We didn’t use blockchain as a buzzword. We used it to add real value, adding a layer of trust and permanence to a document that often marks a turning point in a student’s academic journey.</p>



 <br>Key Takeaways 



 
 UX and accessibility are critical – A smooth front-end experience is essential; users only benefit from fast systems if they can easily access and use them. 



 Verification matters – Especially in education, where credentials must be trusted and stand the test of time. 



 Scale is manageable – With the right preparation and infrastructure, even millions of concurrent users can be served reliably. 
 



 <br>Looking Ahead 



<p>This project brought together everything we care about at Dhiway-infrastructure: digital trust and solving meaningful, real-world problems. Together with Navneet and the Maharashtra State Board, the Dhiway team has demonstrated a new way of managing examination results and created a positive experience for the students and their guardians.</p>



<p>If you’re exploring how to deliver results, certificates, or credentials secure and scalable way, we are happy to share what we’ve learned.</p>

Since then, we’ve progressed into deeper development and analysis. Through this process, we’ve revisited our technical assumptions, stress-tested the economics, and re-evaluated how HPP can best scale and integrate into the broader ecosystem.</p><p>After careful consideration, we believe a strategic course correction is&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Today, we’re introducing AIP-22, a proposal to migrate HPP’s infrastructure roadmap from OP Stack to ARB Stack (Arbitrum) and realign HPP’s future with the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p><p>This is not just a launch decision but a long-term directional shift.</p> Why We’re Proposing the Shift from OP Stack to ARB&nbsp;Stack   Performance Flexibility for AI-Driven Use Cases: ARB Stack offers greater control over block time and execution parameters, essential for data-heavy and AI-coordinated workloads. This flexibility allows us to tailor performance as needed, which is especially important as HPP grows beyond traditional smart contracts into intelligent agents and real-time data environments.  Smarter Resource Management: ARB Stack allows for more efficient resource allocation across compute and storage, enabling us to scale HPP without incurring unnecessary overhead. It supports the kind of modular, elastic architecture needed for future-facing protocol&nbsp;design.  Ecosystem Maturity &amp; DeFi Synergy: Arbitrum’s L2 ecosystem is the most active in the space, particularly in DeFi, and aligns closely with HPP’s vision to become a backbone for data, liquidity, and AI infrastructure. Migrating to ARB Stack positions HPP within an already thriving ecosystem and deeply integrated into the broader Ethereum&nbsp;economy.  Network Effects &amp; Onboarding Opportunities: Migrating now allows HPP to tap into a much broader pool of users, developers, partners, and liquidity providers. We see Arbitrum as a key network for onboarding both Web3-native builders and data-first AI projects, which are central to HPP’s&nbsp;mission.  Strategic Collaboration Potential: Our collaboration with the Arbitrum Foundation and Offchain Labs is already underway. This opens up technical alignment and potential access to grant programs, integration support, and co-marketing opportunities within the Arbitrum ecosystem.   AIP-22 Summary <p>To finalize this shift, we are bringing the decision back to the community through AIP-22. This proposal asks the community to vote on whether HPP should migrate its future development from OP Stack to ARB Stack as its official Layer 2 infrastructure.</p>  Proposal: Confirm ARB Stack (Arbitrum) as the official L2 infrastructure for&nbsp;HPP  Reasoning: Greater technical flexibility, onboarding opportunities, and strong ecosystem alignment  Voting Period: May 21st via Snapshot (<a href="https://snapshot.box/#/s:aergodao.eth">https://snapshot.box/#/s:aergodao.eth</a>)  Eligibility: To participate in the vote, you must hold your <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%24AERGO&amp;src=cashtag_click">$AERGO</a> tokens before 17:00 PM KST / 8:00 AM UTC on May&nbsp;21st.  <p>We recommend participating in the vote using MetaMask, Phantom, or any WalletConnect-compatible wallet.

<p>“This comprehensive blog post will tell you what ID Document Recognition is, its working scenario, and some benefits.”</p>
<p>Identity verification has become the cornerstone for secure access and online digital transactions. In this era, where cyber threats and data breaches are increasing, agencies and institutions are moving toward the most reliable solutions.</p>
<p>Among them, one of the most critical technologies that fight against such attacks is ID Document Recognition.</p>
<p>Wondering about what this is? If yes! Buckle up! This blog post is for you. In this guide, we will explore everything about this technology, including its overview, working process, and role in online security.</p>
<p>So, let’s proceed further…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 ID Document Recognition: A Brief Overview 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-recognition-sdk/">ID Document recognition SDK</a> is an innovative technology that refers to the process of automatically verifying and identifying personal documents, such as passports, ID cards, and driver’s licenses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this process is implemented, agencies and institutions come to know whether such documents presented by a user are real or fake. This innovative technology ensures security enhancement in every field of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 ID Document Recognition Process 
<p>Now you would probably be thinking, what is the technology behind the ID Document Liveness Detection SDK? To answer your question, we have explored our guide through this section. Read it carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Document Capture 
<p>In this first step, institutions capture high-quality images of documents using scanners or high-resolution cameras. Both the front and the back are captured by this scanner.. It takes a few minutes as documents, as the most important and personal information is engraved on such documents. This first step is also implemented by ensuring the clarity of the documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Extract the Text 
<p>In this second step, the important information engraved on these documents is extracted. As far as our doubt goes, you will surely ask, how such data is extracted from these scanned papers? Right? Luckily, nowadays, we have another innovative technology that is used to extract text from scanned papers. This technology is named <a href="https://picturetotext.info/blog/what-is-ocr-technology">OCR(Optical Character Recognition)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Analyze the Data 
<p>Once the extraction is done, the next step is to analyze and verify the data. The system compares this data against known templates, databases, and pre-configured rules. It verifies whether barcodes and QR codes, Font and layout alignment, and other features are real or fake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Liveness Detection And Face Matching 
<p>This is the most important stage of verification in which the presence of the users is ensured. Systems now incorporate liveness detection along with facial recognition ID verification. This facial ID verification identifies whether the users during verification are physically present and using the real ID images or not. This facial ID recognition has two different types. Active liveness detection and passive liveness detection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Decision And Result Generation 
<p>After passing through all technical verification steps, the final step is about making the decision and generating the results. If everything is aligned with the valid rules, the agencies or companies mark the documents as authentic and verified. This decision is generated within a few seconds, ensuring the seamless authentication process.</p>
<p></p>
 Why ID Document Recognition Matters? 
<p>In this section, we will throw light on why the <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">ID document liveness detection SDK</a> matters. There are countless benefits of this technology. We will discuss a few of them below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Fraud Prevention 
 
 
<p>As hinted in the previous sections, this cutting-edge technology is implemented to prevent fraud, especially in finance and educational institutions.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Build Customer Trust 
 
 
<p>Once the fraud is prevented, it automatically builds customer trust. They heavily believe in the systems and make their investments without fear of anything.</p>
 
 
 Cost Saving 
 
 
<p>Agencies use a fake ID detector that is budget-friendly. Such detectors eliminate the need for hiring extra security staff. In short, you can add the extra layers of security without breaking your bank.</p>
 
 
 KYC Compliance 
 
 
<p>ID recognition supports compliance with KYC and ensures the customer’s identity. This helps businesses meet regulatory standards, preventing illegal activities.</p>
 
 
 Streamlined Onboarding 
 
 
<p>Automated ID Document verification makes the onboarding process faster and easier for users. This feature reduces friction and improves customers’ overall experience.</p>
<p></p>
 Pros And Cons of ID Document Recognition 
<p>This section of the blog is all about some pros and cons of ID document liveness detection. We will discuss them briefly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Pros&nbsp; 
<p>This technology prevents fraud concerning spoofing images and videos.</p>
<p>It is used as the international authentication method, not only as a national ID authentication.</p>
<p>The system can confirm the possibilities of information from external registers.</p>
<p>Passwords can be reset using the recheck of selfies and videos.</p>
<p>This technology incorporates AI and ML for better and faster results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Cons&nbsp; 
<p>Some solutions require the user’s ID document information to be stored.</p>
<p>The initial registration can sometimes be very difficult.</p>
<p> Agencies need a phone with NFC functionality for chip scanning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Weekly AMAs &amp; Community-Driven Direction <p>As part of our commitment to weekly AMAs, we’re continuing to update the community on progress, direction, and your top questions. This session focused on the upcoming vote, our Layer 2 (L2) direction, ongoing developments around HPP, and a few fun curveball topics from the community.</p> 1. AIP-22 Vote: Building on&nbsp;Arbitrum <p>This week's big announcement was the launch of a Snapshot-based community vote, this time to decide whether Arbitrum will be the foundation for our Layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>Why Arbitrum?<br>Ben explained the rationale behind this proposed direction:</p>  High transaction volume and network&nbsp;activity  A mature ecosystem with strong infrastructure support  Backing from the Arbitrum Foundation — including marketing and dev coordination  A thriving developer and user community  <blockquote>“We put Arbitrum through rigorous due diligence and compared it with other options. The traction and support were simply unmatched.”</blockquote><p>🗓️ Voting&nbsp;Details:</p>  Make sure your Aergo tokens are in a Snapshot-compatible wallet before May&nbsp;21  The outcome will determine whether Arbitrum becomes the base for Aergo’s new Layer&nbsp;2  <p>The team supports this direction, but it’s ultimately the community’s decision.</p> 2. HPP: What’s Happening Now? <p>We also touched on House Party Protocol (HPP), which marks the public blockchain’s shift into a modern, AI-first architecture.</p><p>The previous vote confirmed:</p>  A token contract&nbsp;upgrade  A new, forward-looking token&nbsp;model  Expand into&nbsp;L2  <p>Ben emphasized that:</p>  The new token(House Party Protocol) will come with a new&nbsp;ticker  A 1:1 token swap will take place in late&nbsp;2025  The Living Roadmap (a public Google Sheet) is available for real-time progress&nbsp;tracking  <blockquote>“HPP isn’t just a rebrand. It’s a major leap forward — aligning us with the future of decentralized AI and intelligent data infrastructure.”</blockquote> 3. What About Aergo’s Enterprise Clients? <p>There was a common question: “Does this mean the enterprise side of Aergo is shutting&nbsp;down?”</p><p>The answer is a clear&nbsp;no.</p>  The Aergo Enterprise Team continues operating  Government and enterprise clients remain unaffected  The changes (vote, token, HPP) are all focused on the public chain&nbsp;only  <blockquote>“Enterprise systems keep running exactly as expected. We’re evolving the public chain — not touching enterprise infrastructure.”</blockquote> 4. Are We Still Focused on&nbsp;Korea? <p>While Aergo has strong roots and visibility in Korea, being listed on all licensed Korean exchanges, the project has always had a global&nbsp;focus.</p><p>Ben clarified:</p>  Aergo is listed on major global platforms like Coinbase and Crypto.com  There’s no “Korea-only” strategy — just strong local trading&nbsp;activity  Future marketing will work to further globalize the&nbsp;brand  <blockquote>“We’re working hard to break the ‘Korean project’ label. Our reach and ambition are&nbsp;global.”</blockquote> 5. AI + Blockchain in Agriculture? Let’s&nbsp;Talk <p>A surprise community question asked about the role of AI and blockchain in farming and agriculture. Here’s what Ben had to&nbsp;say:</p>  AI can monitor crops and livestock 24/7, reducing labor costs and improving food&nbsp;quality  Blockchain enables traceable supply chains, storing data like pesticide usage, logistics, and&nbsp;more  Together, they can optimize farming and distribution with precision  It’s an underexplored but high-potential use case for AI +&nbsp;Web3.   6. Listings: Any&nbsp;News? <p>Inevitably, someone asked about Binance spot listings. Here’s the&nbsp;update:</p>  Token listings are controlled by exchanges, not&nbsp;projects  Paying for listings often leads to bad outcomes for builders, teams, and other stakeholders  Aergo is already re-listed on Binance Futures, as well as many spot markets&nbsp;globally  No new listing news at this&nbsp;time  <blockquote>“We want to be on every trusted platform — but we don’t control listing decisions. No promises, no paid shortcuts.”</blockquote> ✅ Final&nbsp;Words <p>We’re excited about what’s ahead, and your participation makes it all possible. This vote on Arbitrum is a major decision point. It represents a potential new layer of scalability, community alignment, and long-term growth.</p><p>Remember: Get your tokens ready for Snapshot by May 21.<br>Check the Living Roadmap anytime to follow our development progress.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/ama-7-recap-aip-22-vote-arbitrum-l2-and-the-future-of-hpp-7d51bf9a3408">AMA #7 Recap: AIP-22 Vote, Arbitrum L2, and the Future of HPP</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Digital banking has never moved faster. For platforms powering fintechs, neobanks, and embedded financial services, onboarding new customers quickly and securely is essential, not only for user experience but also for compliance.</p><p>That’s where KYC, or Know Your Customer, comes in—the set of identity verification steps financial institutions are legally required to perform before offering services like bank accounts, credit, or investment tools. It's a critical part of protecting against fraud or money laundering. </p><p>However, while some digital services have advanced rapidly, the identity verification tools that power KYC have lagged behind. Most platforms still rely on artificial intelligence to analyze images of physical documents, a patchwork process that creates friction for users and uncertainty for compliance teams. As fraud tactics become more sophisticated, these systems are showing their limits.</p><p>It’s time to modernize how identity is verified online, and that starts with mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs), a secure and verifiable form of digital identity issued by state governments.</p> The Bottleneck in Digital Onboarding <p>If your current onboarding flow involves photo uploads and long processing times, you’re likely to see drop-off and risk.</p><p>Even the best AI-powered verification tools struggle with edge cases, false rejections, and new forms of fraud. Meanwhile, generative AI is making it easier than ever to spoof IDs and deepfake “live” videos that pass existing checks.</p><p>The impact is real: one study found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.signicat.com/the-battle-to-onboard-2022?ref=blog.spruceid.com">over half of users abandon onboarding</a>&nbsp;when it becomes too slow or confusing. For digital platforms competing for users, these delays can directly impact revenue and retention.</p> mDLs: Trust That’s Built In <p>Mobile driver’s licenses are verifiable digital credentials issued by state governments and stored on a user’s smartphone. Unlike photos of paper IDs, they’re cryptographically signed, instantly verifiable, and privacy-preserving. This allows relying parties such as banks, fintechs, and marketplaces to instantly confirm authenticity without storing or interpreting sensitive user data.</p><p>For digital platforms, this means:</p>  Instant verification: no photos or manual review needed  Reduced fraud: credentials are cryptographically bound to specific devices  Streamlined UX: users can verify in seconds without leaving your flow  Privacy-first: only necessary data (ex. age, name) is shared  Compliance-ready: aligns with evolving KYC/AML requirements  <p>With more than <a href="https://www.govtech.com/biz/data/digital-ids-are-here-but-where-are-they-used-and-accepted?utm_source=chatgpt.com">5.6 million Americans now holding mDLs</a> and TSA actively accepting them at airports, real-world adoption is accelerating. States across the U.S. are continuing to expand issuance, creating a growing population of users with ready-to-use digital IDs.</p> A Strategic Shift <p>Platforms that embed verifiable digital credentials into their onboarding flows unlock many benefits, like fewer drop-offs, lower fraud risk, and stronger audit trails. They also gain operational efficiency, reducing the need for manual reviews and exception handling.</p><p>And this is just the beginning. As mDLs and other verifiable digital credentials become more widely adopted by governments, retailers, and beyond, those who invest early in integration will be positioned to lead in trust, speed, and compliance.</p> Learn More <p>SpruceID provides the secure infrastructure needed to issue and verify verifiable digital credentials, such as mobile driver’s licenses, helping organizations streamline identity workflows and reduce onboarding risk.

<p>The FBI is raising the alarm over an escalation in North Korean nation-state threat actors leveraging generative AI, laptop farms, and deepfakes to successfully infiltrate large companies through remote job applications, despite widely available solutions that can thwart such attacks.</p>
<p>We’ve discussed <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/gartners-right-why-workforce-identity-verification-cant-wait/">this threat</a> before. But according to a recent <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/north-korea-workers-infiltrate-fortune-500/">Cyberscoop.com</a> report, it’s getting worse. Thousands of North Korean operatives have secured jobs at more than a hundred Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Using stolen or synthetic identity information and generative AI, these impostors produce polished LinkedIn profiles and identity credentials. Deepfake technology is used for video calls, sometimes unconvincingly, though not often enough. Laptop farms in the US enable the infiltrators to spoof local IPs. Moreover, the imposters usually excel at the actual job, supported by an entire pod of 10 to 20 operatives performing the work for the fraudulent identity behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Speaking on a panel at the RSA Conference 2025, <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/fbi-warns-north-korean-agents-030300546.html">FBI Special Agent</a> Elizabeth Pelker reported that when employers find out these imposters may be agents, they often hesitate to terminate them. “I think more often than not, I get the comment, “Oh, but Johnny is our best performer. Do we actually need to fire them?’” There are plenty of reasons to say an easy yes.</p>
 Fake Workers, Real Money 
<p>According to WIRED, each impostor and pod can send as much as<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/north-korea-stole-your-tech-job-ai-interviews/"> $3 million</a> a year back to Pyongyang just in wages. In Cyberscoop’s estimation, that could be as much as <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/north-korea-workers-infiltrate-fortune-500/#:~:text=A%20thousand%20IT%20workers%20earning,different%20organizations%20concurrently%2C%20Carmakal%20said.">$100 million</a> funneled annually to the North Korean regime.</p>
<p>However, these operatives also use their corporate footholds to exfiltrate data and intellectual property, plant malware, and occasionally threaten executives with blackmail. They can also act on a larger scale, disrupting critical services or infrastructure. It’s no wonder the FBI is offering <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/dprk-it-workers">up to $5 million</a> for information that leads to the disruption of these operations.</p>
<p>It’s alarmingly easy to generate the identities used in these scams. Once the purview of skilled operatives, a steady flow of corporate data breaches coupled with the rise of “crime-as-a-service” outfits means even non-experts can leverage realistic personas complete with fabricated LinkedIn profiles, convincing virtual backgrounds, and digitally manipulated identity documents. And at <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/north-korean-synthetic-identity-creation/">sites like</a> personnotexist[.]org, even people with no image manipulation experience can easily generate <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/remote-workforce/north-korean-operatives-deepfakes-it-job-interviews">deepfake personas</a> for use in video.</p>
<p>For businesses increasingly reliant on remote teams, the sophistication of these outfits represents a significant threat. By some industry estimates, 40% of all cybercrime incidents in 2024 involved deepfake infiltration. At an average cost of<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1417720/worldwide-cost-per-record-by-initial-attack-vector/"> $4.99 million</a> per incident caused by malicious “insiders” like fraudulent remote workers, it can add up. For US-based companies, the average cost of a data breach tops <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec">$9 million</a>. As it stands, 34% of companies in North America report suffering a data breach that cost them between $1 million and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/34-Cybersecurity-Statistics-to-Lose-Sleep-Over-in-2020">$20 million</a> in the past three years. As many as <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/insider-threat-report-2024/">one in three</a> breaches now involve insiders.</p>
<p>Once breached, organizations face the loss or theft of data, compromised networks, ransomware, and blackmail. That’s before lawsuits or regulatory fines, reputational damage, and the fallout from lost customer trust, shattered shareholder confidence, and derailed strategic initiatives.</p>
 ‘How Ugly Is Kim Jong Un?’ Why Most Security Measures Fail 
<p>Identifying fake job candidates requires innovation and skepticism. Red flags include discrepancies between identity information and the candidates themselves. According to Cyberscoop, examples can consist of a person with a complicated Polish name who, in a Zoom call, turns out to be a military-age male Asian who can’t pronounce it.</p>
<p>When deepfakes are in use, telltale signs can be sudden jerkiness or a disconnect between audio and video. It’s also not uncommon for candidates to be fed answers to questions, creating latency as they read onscreen prompts. As a counter measure, some hiring managers ask candidates to hold up identity credentials to match face with identity. But the same AI tools behind the deepfakes can also be used to create counterfeit credentials, of course.</p>
<p>According to researchers, asking a candidate to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-job-seekers-flooding-market-artificial-intelligence/">wave their hand</a> in front of their face can reveal deepfake inconsistencies. Another tactic: asking unexpected questions like, “How ugly is Kim Jong Un?” Perhaps unsurprisingly, it can be enough of a curve ball to instantly trigger operatives to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/asking-remote-job-candidates-this-shocking-question-could-save-your-company-big-bucks-security-expert-says">disconnect</a> from the call abruptly. The technique is effective because North Korean agents are prohibited from saying anything negative about their leader. When asked to criticize him, they typically end the interview immediately rather than risk punishment for appearing disloyal.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Of course, that might not always work, nor is it ever enough.</p>
<p>Today’s typical security protocols—basic ID verification, standard biometric checks, and interview procedures—are no match for increasingly sophisticated deepfake schemes. Attacks now employ presentation attacks for printed and emailed identity credentials, voice cloning, face swapping, and manipulation of captured video of a legitimate user or candidate.</p>
<p>They can also include injection attacks to manipulate data streams between the camera or scanner and authentication systems. Fraudsters with access to an open device, for example, can inject a passing fingerprint or face ID into the authentication process—or text-to-speech tools to manipulate cloned voice samples—bypassing security measures and gaining unauthorized access to corporate networks and services.</p>
 What It Really Takes to Defeat Deepfake Identities 
<p>As I mentioned, the strongest countermeasure against deepfakes and workforce identity fraud in all its forms is already widely available: advanced biometric authentication, securely linked to verified identities. 1Kosmos is a case in point. Our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/identity-proofing/">identity proofing</a> solution leads potential employees through a mobile-first enrollment process in which they scan driver’s licenses, social security numbers, national identity documents, passports, or other government-issued credentials.</p>
<p>Automated workflows then verify the data, including any associated pictures and RFID-chip data, across more than 2,500 different identity documents <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/supported-documents/">from over 150 countries</a> with over 99% accuracy. These verified individuals are linked to a facial biometric that is dynamically compared to the photo on valid credentials, and the bound identity is then encrypted with the user’s private key and stored in our private and permissioned blockchain.</p>
<p>Passive liveness detection spots subtle digital markers indicative of manipulated images. Detection methods prompt users to perform specific, randomized actions—confirming genuine human presence at enrollment and, if desired, as a login measure for video interviews or meetings. Fraudulent identities are flagged during the time of capture. Our solutions are also built on the only platform certified to NIST 800-63-3, UK DIATF, FIDO2, and iBeta ISO/IEC 30107 standards with an SDK and standard APIs to avoid security exploits and prevent vendor lock.</p>
 Facing the Future: Stopping Deepfakes Before They Start 
<p>Unchecked, the epidemic of fraudulent job candidates threatens hiring integrity, cybersecurity infrastructure, and corporate reputations worldwide—and it will only get worse. According to <a href="https://www.inc.com/kit-eaton/how-fake-ai-job-applications-pose-risks-for-employers/91173748">Gartner</a>, 1 in every 4 job applicants will be fake by 2028. When you consider other “enhancements” made by otherwise legitimate job candidates, the need for objective, bullet-proof identity proofing grows more critical.</p>
<p>Along with fostering a culture of cybersecurity vigilance throughout the organization (looking at you, HR), implementing widely available biometric technologies that adhere to exacting identity verification standards offers the best—well, only—surefire way to defeat ever-evolving threats from workforce fraud, North Korean and otherwise. Which means the next time you ask a job candidate, “How fat is Kim Jong Un?” it’ll just be for the fun of it.</p>

 How Weak Identity Security Posture Affects Organizations&nbsp;  
<p>The report paints a clear picture: fraudsters are refining their strategies, targeting high-value credentials and exploiting vulnerabilities across all channels. Several statistics stand out, demanding immediate attention from security and risk leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  
 How Compromised Credentials Lead to The Rise of Identity Fraud  
  
  A particularly alarming trend highlighted is the increasing exposure of government-issued IDs in data breaches. In 2024, 31% of US data breaches included driver's licenses or other state IDs, a sharp rise from 19% in 2023.&nbsp; <br><br>  
  For years, presenting a physical ID or a scan of one has been a common identity verification step. However, when the digital versions of these documents are readily available to criminals due to breaches, relying solely on document verification becomes dangerously inadequate. <br><br>  
  Fraudsters can now more easily acquire the very credentials used in traditional proofing processes, making it essential to layer additional, dynamic verification methods.  
  
<p>Read our blog <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/ai-forgery-epidemic">The AI Forgery Epidemic: The Growing Threat of AI-Generated Fake Documents</a>&nbsp;</p> 
 How Fraudsters Use ID Spoofing and KBA To their Benefit  
<p>Fraudsters are becoming more adept at impersonating legitimate customers, and legacy verification methods are failing to stop them. The TransUnion survey found:</p> 
  
  55% of knowledgeable business leaders reported that call spoofing to impersonate a customer became more common in the past year.&nbsp; <br><br>  
  58% reported that the use of stolen personal information to pass knowledge-based authentication (KBA) became more common.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
  
  The Implication: These two statistics are intrinsically linked. Widespread data breaches have made personally identifiable information (PII) – the foundation of KBA questions like "What street did you grow up on?" or "What was your first pet's name?" – easily accessible to criminals. Simultaneously, spoofing technologies allow fraudsters to appear as legitimate callers. Relying on information recall (KBA) or caller ID is no longer a viable defense mechanism. Knowledge is not identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=144955ed-0aee-4519-80f5-8538b0cfd4c0&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 Call Centers and Help Desks Are Now Prime Targets of Identity Fraud  
<p>The human element in customer service remains a key target. The report reveals a significant increase in attacks targeting call centers:</p> 
  
  The percentage of high-risk calls into US call centers surged by 33%, rising from 4.5% in 2023 to 6.0% in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  This coincides with 43% of knowledgeable business leaders indicating fraudsters increased their attacks on call centers over the past year.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Understanding the Risk: Call centers and internal help desks often handle sensitive requests, including password resets, account changes, and information verification; actions that provide direct pathways for account takeover if compromised. The pressure on agents to provide quick support can conflict with rigorous security protocols, creating vulnerabilities that fraudsters exploit through social engineering and impersonation. The report also notes the specific risk posed by non-fixed VoIP calls, which are harder to trace and showed a high percentage of fraud risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 How to Ensure Identity Assurance For Your Organization  
<p>The insights from the TransUnion report demand a fundamental shift in how organizations approach <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/identity-security-guide">identity security</a>. Reactive measures and outdated techniques are insufficient. The goal must be Identity Assurance: establishing ongoing, high confidence in a user's identity across their entire journey through orchestrated, risk-appropriate verification.</p> 
 1. Adopt Identity Verification Solutions with Journey Orchestration  
<p>Given that even physical IDs can be compromised and personal knowledge is widely available, modern IDV must be dynamic and context-aware.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Move Beyond Static Checks: Merely scanning a driver's license is no longer enough. Effective solutions must layer multiple verification techniques. This includes document authentication (checking security features as well as against a reliable database), biometric verification (matching a live selfie to the ID photo), crucial liveness detection (to prevent spoofs using photos/videos), and potentially cross-referencing with trusted data sources or device intelligence.  
  Orchestrate Based on Risk: Not all interactions carry the same risk. Identity verification shouldn't be one-size-fits-all. Implement solutions that allow for fine-grained policies based on the specific action (e.g., onboarding vs. login vs. password reset), the user's privilege level, and real-time risk signals (like device health or location).  
  
 2. Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) is Broken  
<p>The data is clear: KBA is fundamentally broken. The sheer volume of breached PII, combined with the power of AI to gather and correlate information, makes relying on secret questions a critical vulnerability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Embrace Stronger Factors: Organizations must transition to phishing-resistant authentication methods. This includes passwordless, FIDO-certified authenticators like device-based biometrics or security keys, which prove possession of a trusted factor rather than relying on easily compromised knowledge.  
  Secure Recovery: Critically, this applies to recovery processes too. Using KBA for account recovery negates investments in strong primary authentication. Secure recovery must leverage other verified, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant factors</a>.  
  
 3. Harden Call Center and Help Desk Defenses Interactions  
<p>The sharp rise in high-risk calls targeting support channels necessitates specific countermeasures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Empower Agents with Better Tools: Equip support staff with integrated tools that provide stronger identity verification methods than simply asking KBA questions or trusting caller ID. Equip support staff with integrated tools that provide stronger identity verification methods, such as <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/call-center-verification">Call Center Identity Verification</a> from HYPR.&nbsp;  
  Implement Risk-Based Authentication: For high-risk requests (like credential resets or changes to sensitive account information), trigger strong step-up authentication challenges that cannot be easily socially engineered. This could involve pushing a notification to a user's registered and trusted device for biometric approval.  
  Orchestrate High Risk Workflows: Implement workflows that escalate high-risk verification scenarios. This might involve requiring approval from an employee's pre-verified manager through a secure channel or routing the interaction to a specialized risk team equipped with advanced verification tools.  
  
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=9b50cee6-bc8a-4f21-93f5-b04103b27804&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 Upgrade Your Security Posture with Identity Assurance  
<p>The TransUnion H1 2025 State of Omnichannel Fraud Report serves as a stark reminder: identity is the new security perimeter, and it's under constant attack. The rise in compromised identity documents, the blatant failure of KBA, and the relentless targeting of support channels demand immediate action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Organizations can no longer afford incremental improvements to outdated security models. A paradigm shift towards proactive Identity Assurance is essential for survival and growth. This means embedding strong, phishing-resistant identity verification across the entire user lifecycle, orchestrating verification based on risk, and eliminating reliance on easily compromised factors like passwords and shared secrets.<br><br>Discover HYPR’s Identity Assurance Platform</p> 
<p>HYPR, The Identity Assurance Company, is built to address these modern challenges head-on. Our platform delivers FIDO-certified, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a>, integrates high-assurance identity verification methods, and enables sophisticated journey orchestration to ensure the right users gain access, securely recover accounts, and interact safely across all channels, including vulnerable support touchpoints.</p> 
<p>Don't let legacy vulnerabilities dictate your security posture. Embrace Identity Assurance and build a resilient defense against the evolving threats highlighted by TransUnion.</p> 
<p>Key Takeaways</p> 
<p>1. Static Identity Verification is Obsolete</p> 
<p>Reliance on physical IDs or static document scans is increasingly less secure due to the amount of stolen PII credentials online. Identity verification must use a multi-layered approach that includes biometrics, liveness detection, and real-time risk assessment.</p> 
<p>2. Knowledge-Based Authentication is Broken</p> 
<p>Breached data and data aggregated by AI have rendered knowledge-based authentication nearly useless. Organizations must adopt phishing-resistant factors like biometrics and FIDO2 passkeys.</p> 
<p>3. Call Centers and Helpdesks Are the New Frontline</p> 
<p>The increase in spoofed calls and VoIP abuse increases the fraud risk for both call centers and help desks. Organizations must implement risk-based step-up authentication and use tools that provide more secure identity verification methods.</p> 
<p>4. Identity Assurance is the New Standard</p> 
<p>The security focus must shift from one-time, static checks to continuous identity assurance across the user journey. Modern <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification solutions</a> must be adaptive and risk-aware to meet the challenges of the current threat landscape.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=fb18a0a6-54ba-4774-9e36-f5e3e0465c01&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p>

<p>The crypto world moves fast—but so do regulations. One of the most impactful regulations for crypto businesses today is the FATF Travel Rule. It’s not just another checkbox to tick—it’s a global mandate designed to increase transparency and reduce financial crime in digital assets. If you’re a crypto asset service provider (CASP), understanding and complying with the Travel Rule isn’t optional—it’s essential to staying competitive and credible.</p>



<p>Let’s walk through what the Travel Rule requires and how you can stay compliant without slowing down your operations or alienating your customers.</p>



<p></p>



 What Is the FATF Travel Rule? 



<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule requires that CASPs—such as crypto exchanges, wallet providers, and custodians—collect and share certain information about the originators (senders) and beneficiaries (recipients) of crypto transactions over a specified threshold.</p>



<p>Think of it as the crypto equivalent of wire transfer rules in traditional banking. When funds move between two institutions, basic identifying information must travel with them.</p>



<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>



 
 Threshold Amount: The Travel Rule applies to crypto transactions over USD/EUR 1,000 (or local equivalent). 



 Required Information:
 
 For the Sender (Originator): Full name, wallet address (or unique account ID), physical address or national ID number, and transaction purpose if required by local regulations. 



 For the Recipient (Beneficiary): Full name, wallet address, and additional details if needed. 
 
 



 Cross-Border Compliance: The rule applies across jurisdictions, meaning you need to ensure both sides of the transaction are compliant, even if the recipient CASP is in a different country. 
 



<p></p>



 Why Compliance Matters 



<p>Failing to comply with the Travel Rule can lead to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, or even being cut off from global markets. But it’s not just about avoiding punishment—it’s about building trust. The Travel Rule is designed to make the crypto ecosystem safer by preventing money laundering, terrorism financing, and other illicit activities. For CASPs that want to thrive, being seen as compliant builds credibility with regulators, partners, and customers.</p>



<p></p>



 The Challenges of Travel Rule Compliance 



<p>Travel Rule compliance isn’t without hurdles:</p>



 
 Data Sharing Complexities: Sharing sensitive customer information across borders requires secure systems that comply with privacy laws like GDPR. 



 Transaction Delays: Manual verification can slow down transactions, frustrating customers and introducing operational inefficiencies. 



 Interoperability Issues: Ensuring compliance across different CASPs and jurisdictions can be tricky, especially if the other party uses different systems. 
 



<p>But these challenges don’t have to hold you back.</p>



<p></p>



 How iComply Simplifies Travel Rule Compliance 



<p>iComply’s end-to-end solution for KYC, KYB, and AML goes beyond basic compliance—it makes Travel Rule compliance smarter and faster with edge computing technology. Here’s how it works:</p>



 
 Seamless Data Collection and Verification<br>Instead of relying on third-party subprocessors that introduce data privacy concerns, iComply verifies and authenticates sender and recipient data locally on the client’s device using edge computing. This ensures that sensitive information is encrypted and verified before it leaves the device—minimizing data exposure risks and ensuring compliance with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA​. 



 Real-Time Screening and Alerts<br>iComply automatically screens transaction participants against global watchlists, PEP databases, and adverse media sources in real-time. Suspicious activity? Immediate alerts are sent to compliance officers to take action without interrupting transaction flow​​. 



 Interoperability and API Integration<br>iComply integrates easily with other CASPs’ compliance systems using its robust API. Whether your counterpart is using a different solution or in another jurisdiction, you can ensure data flows securely and meets FATF standards​​. 



 Automated Reporting and Audit Trails<br>Generate audit-ready reports with one click. Every verification step is logged and time-stamped, making it easy to prove compliance during regulatory inspections​​. 



 Configurable Rules Based on Jurisdiction<br>Compliance isn’t one-size-fits-all. iComply allows you to configure data requirements based on the jurisdiction of the sender and recipient, ensuring you meet local and international requirements. 
 



<p></p>



 Travel Rule Compliance in Action: A Case Study 



<p>Let’s look at how compliance plays out in real life.</p>



<p>Scenario: Alex, a customer of a U.S.-based crypto exchange, sends $5,000 in BTC to a friend’s wallet held at a European exchange.</p>



<p>Without iComply:</p>



 
 The compliance team manually collects Alex’s data, verifies it, and emails it to the European CASP. This takes time and risks data breaches during transmission. 



 If the receiving exchange uses a different system, compatibility issues may arise, delaying the transaction further. 
 



<p>With iComply:</p>



 
 Alex’s data is encrypted and authenticated directly on the exchange’s app using edge computing. No unnecessary data transfers. 



 iComply verifies the transaction participants in real-time and sends a secure compliance packet directly to the European exchange—fast, secure, and compliant. 
 



<p>The result? Faster transactions, stronger security, and a frictionless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



 Why Choose iComply? 



<p>iComply’s platform doesn’t just help you comply—it optimizes your entire compliance workflow. By using edge computing, automated risk screening, and seamless integration, iComply simplifies Travel Rule compliance without sacrificing security or efficiency.</p>



<p>In the fast-moving world of crypto, compliance isn’t just a necessity—it’s a competitive advantage. Ready to stay ahead of the curve and build trust with your users and regulators? Let’s make compliance work for you.</p>

									  The Case for Crypto Psychoanalysis   <p>Over the past two weeks, we’ve been riding the high and personally writing about what many are calling a “crypto renaissance” — a surge in innovation, cultural momentum, and renewed belief in the decentralized future.</p><p>From institutional adoption to meme coin mania, the energy is palpable. But behind the price action, protocol upgrades, and market narratives lies a more elusive force, one that drives both irrational exuberance and gut-wrenching fear: our minds.</p><p>Enter what we call crypto psychoanalysis — a framework for understanding the emotional, behavioral, and psychological dynamics shaping the crypto market.</p><p>We pulled the term out of thin air, but make no mistake, this isn’t armchair theory. It’s backed by data and increasingly seen as essential to navigating the world of digital assets. According to a 2023 study by Glassnode, nearly 3 in 4 short-term Bitcoin holders panic-sell within three weeks of entering a position during volatile markets. Meanwhile, only 12% of long-term holders react similarly, revealing stark behavioral patterns between experienced participants and newcomers.</p><p>These reactions aren’t just financial. They can be triggered by stress, uncertainty, and crowd psychology. Research from eToro found that nearly 40% of retail crypto investors admit to making impulsive trades based on social media trends. (Shitcoins, anyone?) In the last bull run, Google searches for “crypto anxiety” spiked over 400% between January and May 2021, further illustrating the mental toll of market swings.</p><p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) thrives on momentum and identity. Each token’s value goes beyond its conversion rate, cultivating its own ecosystem and culture. From Solana vs. Ethereum to Dogecoin vs. everyone, investors often form emotional attachments to their bags, leading to confirmation bias and herd behavior.</p><p>A University of Cambridge study in 2022 highlighted that emotional attachment to a project — rather than utility or fundamentals — was the #1 driver of long-term holding behavior among retail investors. We hold what we believe in, not always what performs.</p><p>Diving deeper, crypto is powered by storytelling. The success of Ethereum’s merge, the rise of Ordinals on Bitcoin, or even the explosive memecoin season we’re living through — these shifts didn’t happen in a vacuum. They were fueled by emotionally charged narratives, online echo chambers, and the innate human desire to believe.</p><p>A 2024 Binance Insights report showed that projects with strong community narratives outperform purely technical projects by 32% in average token retention over a 6-month period.</p><p>The psychological element of DeFi can take a very real toll too. In a world of 24/7 markets, dopamine hits from green candles, and devastating crashes at 3am, burnout is real. Over 60% of crypto traders reported symptoms of stress or sleep disruption in a 2023 OKX survey, with nearly one-third saying crypto had “negatively impacted their mental health.”</p><p>At <a href="http://www.playhaus.tv">playhaus</a>, we’re equally interested in the external evolution of web3 and the internal transformation happening within its participants. Crypto is changing how we think, feel, connect, and trust. And in that shift lies a profound psychological story waiting to be told.</p><p>So as we celebrate the breakthroughs, let’s not ignore the breakdowns. We urge you to take the time to offset the psycho with the analysis. Because the next frontier of crypto might not just be on-chain — it might be in the mirror.</p>  <p>— Muhammed</p>

									         The Show-Me State Just Showed Up   <p>Missouri just poked the proverbial bear with a cattle prod.</p><p>As of 2025, if you’re a Missouri resident, you won’t pay a single dime in capital gains taxes at the state level on profits from stocks, real estate, or crypto.</p><p>Yep. You read that right. No tax man coming for your investment wins. Just a clean break. How did we get here?</p><p>Before this new law, Missouri taxed capital gains like regular ol’ income — up to 4.7%, depending on your tax bracket. So whether you were flipping homes, selling off that Apple stock you bought during the iPod era, or finally unloading your crypto bag after HODLing since 2017, the state wanted a piece.</p><p>No more.</p><p>A handful of states — think Florida, Texas, Nevada — already don’t tax any personal income, so naturally capital gains are in the clear there. But Missouri? It’s in a different category. This isn’t a no-income-tax state. It’s one that looked at capital gains specifically and said, “Nah, we’re good.”</p><p>That makes this a first-of-its-kind move. It’s targeted, it’s bold, and it’s potentially game-changing.</p><p>Why? Because this could be the beginning of something bigger. By zeroing out capital gains for individuals, Missouri is basically hanging a big, flashing sign that says: “Invest here. Live here. Grow here.”</p><p>Think of it like this:</p>  That real estate developer weighing between Kansas City and Denver? He’s looking real hard at Missouri now.  That startup founder debating when to liquidate shares? She just found a way to save serious cash.  That crypto trader finally ready to cash out? Missouri just rolled out a digital red carpet.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>But who really benefits? Let’s keep it real: 80% of the financial benefit from this bill is expected to go to the top 5% of earners. So yes, it will favor the wealthy. Indeed, critics are already worried about the loss in state revenue — somewhere between $260M and $600M annually. That’s money that funds schools, roads, and public services.</p><p>But here’s the counterpunch: If the move spurs economic growth, pulls in new businesses, and juices up investment in-state, it could pay for itself in the long haul. That’s the bet Missouri’s making.</p><p>There’s also some crucial fine print. Specifically, this exemption is only for individuals, not corporations. At least for now. Businesses might get in on the fun once Missouri’s top individual income tax rate drops to 4.5%. But that won’t happen until at least 2028, if revenue keeps rising.</p><p>So what could/should you actually do with this info? Here are a few options:</p>  Re-think residency: If you’re in a high-tax state and sitting on major gains, moving to Missouri might suddenly look a lot more appealing.  Time your exits: Planning to cash out on an investment? You now have a major incentive to do so while under Missouri’s tax umbrella.  Get your CPA on speed dial: Tax strategies just changed in a big way. Whether a crypto investor or real estate pro, your accountant needs to be looped in.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Big picture.

 How you comply with anti-money laundering measures, and conduct identity verification is about to change forever. Are you ready for the Anti-Money Laundering Regulation? 



 



<p>The regulatory landscape for financial services will undergo the biggest change to date, when the <a href="https://accountancyeurope.eu/publications/navigating-the-eu-anti-money-laundering-regulation/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR)</a> replaces the current directive-based approach in 2027.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike previous approaches, where Anti-Money Laundering Directives (the most recent being <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">AMLD 6</a>) required national implementation, the AMLR will apply directly across all EU member states, resulting in a more harmonized approach to combating financial crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For financial institutions, AMLR represents both a significant compliance challenge and a strategic opportunity to modernize, and perhaps more importantly, harmonize identity verification processes. With implementation less than two years away, understanding the key changes and beginning preparations now is essential for a smooth transition.</p>



 5 main changes under AMLR: What’s new? 



<p>The AMLR brings several fundamental shifts in how financial institutions must approach customer identification and verification:</p>



 1. From directive to regulation. 



<p>Current approach: The AMLDs require implementation through national legislation, which leads to variations in interpretation and therefore different requirements across EU member states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: AMLR will apply to all member states without national implementation, which, in theory, will create a single, consistent rulebook for AML compliance across the EU.</p>



 2. Enhanced due diligence requirements. 



<p>Current approach: European financial services adhere to a risk-based approach to enhanced due diligence (EDD), with some flexibility in implementation. In practice, this means that EDD is required for high-risk customers, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">politically exposed persons</a> (PEPs) or those from high-risk jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: There will be more prescriptive requirements for customer due diligence, with specific mandates for identification methods and verification processes.</p>



 3. Stricter beneficial ownership rules. 



<p>Current approach: Varied thresholds and requirements for identifying beneficial owners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: Standardized approach with clearer definitions and lower thresholds for beneficial ownership identification.</p>



 4. Expanded scope to include crypto. 



<p>Current approach: Anti-money laundering directives were focused primarily on traditional financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: Broader coverage including crypto-asset service providers and other previously exempted entities.</p>



 5. Stronger enforcement mechanisms. 



<p>Current approach: Varied enforcement penalties, fines and punishments across member states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AMLR approach: More consistent penalties and enforcement mechanisms, with greater coordination through the new <a href="https://www.amla.europa.eu/about-amla_en">Anti-Money Laundering Authority.</a> Due to start operations from summer 2025, the AMLA will have a staff of 400 and will centralize AML efforts, coordinate national authorities and conduct cross-border investigations.</p>

 The 3 pillars of AMLR-compliant identification. 



<p>At the heart of AMLR is a fundamental shift in how financial institutions verify customer identities. It’s worth noting that AMLR will not be regulating KYC methods per se but merely adhering to the eIDAS 2.0&nbsp;identity framework. AMLR prescribes three compliant identification methods:<br></p>



 1. EUDI Wallet. 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> (EUDIW) represents a significant advancement in digital identity management. This user-controlled mobile application will allow EU citizens to store, and share verified identity credentials securely. The EUDI Wallet must meet either substantial or high assurance levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it means for financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>



  Customers will be able to prove their identity using government-issued digital credentials&nbsp;  



  Verification can happen remotely in an instant&nbsp;  



  Higher levels of assurance for digital onboarding&nbsp;  



  Reduced manual verification processes<br>  



 2. Notified eID systems. 



<p>Notified <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">Electronic Identification (eID) systems</a> provide secure digital identity verification through nationally recognized schemes. There are more than 27 eID systems across Europe, each with varying levels of assurance. Under the eIDAS 2.0 regulation and the upcoming AMLR, these systems are being brought under a single, interoperable EU framework to support cross-border KYC and customer onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be accepted for KYC purposes, eID systems must meet at least a “substantial” or “high” level of assurance, as defined by EU technical standards. This ensures that financial institutions and other obliged entities can rely on trusted digital identity methods for remote onboarding and customer due diligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it means for financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>



  Recognition of national eID schemes across borders&nbsp;  



  Standardized levels of assurance&nbsp;  



  Simplified customer onboarding for customers with existing eIDs&nbsp;  



  Reduced document verification requirements<br>  



 3. Trust Services. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">Trust Services</a>, as defined under&nbsp;eIDAS, provide the foundation for secure and authentic digital transactions through&nbsp;Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES),&nbsp;electronic seals,&nbsp;timestamps, and other regulated services. These play a key role in enabling&nbsp;secure identification under AMLR, particularly via&nbsp;QES&nbsp;and&nbsp;Qualified Electronic Attestations of Attributes (QEAA), which allow trusted identity and attribute information to be shared digitally across the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To enable these services, a&nbsp;Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP)&nbsp;is responsible for verifying the individual’s identity — whether through&nbsp;notified eID, an&nbsp;EUDI Wallet, or traditional documents such as a&nbsp;passport. This identity proofing must comply with&nbsp;high-assurance standards, which may involve&nbsp;video identification,&nbsp;automated verification, or&nbsp;in-person validation, as set out in&nbsp;eIDAS 2.0 implementing acts&nbsp;and&nbsp;ETSI technical standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this way, QTSPs offer a legally recognized and privacy-preserving path to AML-compliant digital onboarding — even for users without a national eID or EUDI Wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What it means for financial institutions:&nbsp;</p>



  Enhanced security for digital transactions&nbsp;  



  Legal recognition equivalent to handwritten signatures&nbsp;  



  Improved document integrity and non-repudiation&nbsp;  



  Streamlined digital processes with legal certainty&nbsp;  



<p>The significance of these three pillars cannot be overstated. Financial institutions that implement as many options as possible will provide customers with maximum flexibility while ensuring full compliance with AMLR requirements. As the majority joint venture partner of IDnow Trust Services AB – a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP), IDnow is uniquely positioned to support all three identification methods as a single vendor, offering a comprehensive solution for full AMLR compliance.</p>



<blockquote><p>By beginning preparations now, organizations can ensure a smooth transition to the new regulatory framework while minimizing disruption to operations and customer experiences. With the right partners and a proactive approach, AMLR compliance can become a catalyst for digital transformation rather than just another regulatory burden.</p>Uwe Pfizenmaier, Product Director at IDnow and Registration Officer at IDnow Trust Services AB.</blockquote>

 How businesses can prepare today for a more compliant tomorrow. 



<p>Although there are still two years until the 2027 deadline, the complexity of AMLR implementation means preparation should begin now. Here are key steps financial institutions should take:</p>



 1. Conduct a gap analysis.&nbsp; 



<p>Assess your current AML processes against AMLR requirements to identify areas needing improvement. This includes:&nbsp;</p>



  Reviewing existing customer identification methods&nbsp;  



  Evaluating beneficial ownership identification processes&nbsp;  



  Assessing risk assessment methodologies&nbsp;  



  Examining transaction monitoring capabilities&nbsp;  



  Reviewing staff training programs<br>  



 2. Budget planning.&nbsp; 



<p>For many financial institutions, AMLR compliance will require investment in new technologies and processes. As such, they need to ensure they:&nbsp;</p>



  Allocate resources for technology upgrades&nbsp;  



  Budget for staff training and potential new hires&nbsp;  



  Consider consulting services for specialized expertise&nbsp;  



  Plan for ongoing compliance costs<br>  



 3. Team training and awareness. 



<p>Begin building internal knowledge and expertise:&nbsp;</p>



  Educate compliance teams on AMLR requirements&nbsp;  



  Raise awareness among executive leadership&nbsp;  



  Develop training programs for customer-facing staff&nbsp;  



  Establish clear ownership of AMLR implementation<br>  



 4. Technology assessment.&nbsp; 



<p>Evaluate your current technology stack against future requirements. Do you have one of three AMLR-compliant ways of verifying identities implemented in your technology stack? Sooner rather than later, businesses should:&nbsp;</p>



  Assess identity verification systems for AMLR compatibility&nbsp;  



  Review customer due diligence technologies&nbsp;  



  Evaluate transaction monitoring capabilities&nbsp;  



  Consider integration requirements for new identification methods  



 IDnow’s unique position: Why being a QTSP matters. 



<p>A QTSP, such as IDnow Trust Services AB, is an organization that has been officially recognized by a national supervisory body to provide trust services that meet the strict requirements of the eIDAS regulation. This qualification involves rigorous assessment of security practices, technical capabilities and organizational reliability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-trust-services-ab-certified-qtsp-eu/">QTSP since 2024,</a> IDnow Trust Services AB holds a privileged position in the AMLR compliance landscape.&nbsp; For financial institutions preparing for AMLR, working with IDnow and its QTSP offers several competitive advantages:</p>



  Comprehensive compliance coverage: IDnow can provide all three prescribed identification methods (EUDI Wallet, eID, and Trust Services)&nbsp;  



  Legal certainty: Qualified trust services are considered critical infrastructure and have the highest level of legal recognition across the EU&nbsp;  



  Reduced compliance risk: Working with a qualified provider reduces the risk of non-compliance&nbsp;  



  Future-proof solutions: As regulations evolve, QTSPs tend to actively drive change and are the first to adapt and ensure continued compliance&nbsp;  



  Simplified vendor management: One single provider for multiple compliance requirements&nbsp;  



<p>With a long history in enabling financial services customers to comply with AML regulations,&nbsp; IDnow is actively preparing to support clients through the AMLR transition, with ongoing development of compliant solutions and close engagement with regulatory authorities.</p>



 Next steps: Your AMLR readiness checklist. 



<p>To begin your AMLR preparation journey, consider this initial checklist:&nbsp;</p>



  Assign responsibility: Designate an AMLR implementation team or leader&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Stay informed: Subscribe to regulatory updates and industry guidance&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Assess current state: Document existing identification processes and technologies&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Identify gaps: Compare current capabilities with AMLR requirements&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Develop a roadmap: Create a phased implementation plan through 2027&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Engage with partners: Begin discussions with technology providers about AMLR solutions&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Budget for change: Ensure financial planning includes AMLR implementation costs&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Monitor developments: Stay alert for regulatory guidance and industry best practices  



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>In the not-too-distant future, only three methods of identity verification will be allowed. Orchestrating each method in order to offer fallbacks and different ways of issuing Trust Services will therefore become key for the future of AML onboarding in EU.</p>Johannes Leser, Chief Executive Officer of IDnow Trust Services AB.</blockquote>



 Prepare today to succeed tomorrow. 



<p>While for many, AMLR will pose a significant compliance challenge, it also offers an opportunity to modernize and future-proof identity verification processes, enhance security and improve customer experiences. Financial institutions that approach AMLR strategically, rather than as a compliance box to check, can gain competitive advantages while strengthening their defences against financial crime and fraud that is becoming more sophisticated by the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>Last week, I wrote about how the real innovation is in centralized vs decentralized, it’s in building systems that can move between them. Flexibility and resilience go hand in hand. <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/07/engineering-vs-economics/">Engineering Meets Economics</a> if you missed it.</p>



<p>This week, we’re taking that one step further: If flexibility or even malleability is the goal, how much are you willing to pay for it?</p>



<p>Decentralization sounds empowering, and it is, but when you start pricing out the staff, contracts, and duplicated infrastructure required to make it real, it’s enough to light your hair on fire. But if the last few years have taught us anything, it’s this: centralization is comfortable, right up until it isn’t. The question isn’t whether decentralization is an all-or-nothing decision. Instead, you should ask how much of it you actually need, and whether you are building toward that, or are you hoping you’ll never be put to the test?</p>



 The Control We Live Without (Until We Can’t) 



<p>Most enterprise stacks are built on convenient centralization because it works. Until it doesn’t.</p>



<p>And to be fair, many centralized platforms aren’t fragile at all. Cloud providers like AWS or Azure, DNS services like Cloudflare, and global CDNs like Akamai offer incredible built-in resilience, failover, and distributed design, and for many organizations, that’s more than enough.</p>



<p>So when I talk about decentralization, I’m not saying “don’t use centralized platforms.” I’m asking:</p>



 
 Where does your dependency go beyond what the platform guarantees? 



 Where are you relying on a single identity flow, a proprietary API, or a vendor relationship that isn’t as durable or visible as you’d like? 
 



<p>Here are just a few common areas where centralization is accepted, sometimes wisely, sometimes dangerously.</p>



 Current Dependencies: What’s Normal (and Risky) 



Stack ComponentTypical Centralized ProviderWhy We Accept ItWhat It Takes to DecentralizeCloud InfrastructureAWS, Azure, GCPCost efficiency, built-in toolingMulti-cloud design, duplicated environmentsDNSCloudflare, Route53Stability, DDoS protectionRedundant providers, failover planningIdentity ProviderOkta, Entra, PingPolicy enforcement, ease of useFederation, verifiable credentials, trust governanceRouting &amp; CDNAkamai, CloudflareSpeed, coverageCustom PoPs, peering strategiesMessaging / CommsTwilio, Zoom, MicrosoftUnified experienceProtocol bridging, diverse vendor integration



<p>The point isn’t to avoid centralization. It’s to understand where you’re exposed, and whether you can live with that. I can’t answer that for you, but you can and should start answering it for your org.</p>



 The Real Cost of Optionality 



<p>There’s no shame in being centralized; there is shame in not being able to recover from locked-in choices. The value of decentralization shows up when:</p>



 
 A vendor outage takes down your login page 



 A change in platform policy breaks your consent flows 



 A new law forces you to isolate systems by country 



 A key provider is acquired, and your roadmap disappears overnight 
 



<p>Decentralization can offer you a way out or at least a way forward. But you only get that if you build for it. And yes, that comes with a cost. TANSTAFL.</p>



<p>Some of those costs include:</p>



 
 Financial: Redundancy means paying for parallel paths, including multiple vendors, more complex SLAs, and sometimes a few features you don’t use every day. 



 Operational: Diverse systems mean more moving parts. Teams need more discipline. More observability. Less “set and forget.” 



 Strategic: Procurement has to prioritize flexibility over feature count. Architecture has to balance performance with fallback. 
 



<p>And let’s not forget the cost of interoperability. The cost of decentralization isn’t just financial. You also need systems that can communicate across platforms, formats, and protocols.</p>



<p>Decentralization means maintaining systems that can work across different environments, many of which weren’t built with each other in mind. Your <a href="https://openobserve.ai/articles/observability-stack-understanding/">observability stack</a> needs to normalize across cloud regions. Your CI/CD pipelines need to deploy to more than one provider. And of course, your auth system needs to handle more than one flavor of token.</p>



<p>You’re not just buying a second system, you’re buying the glue. That glue, however, can be expensive. But it’s what turns “Plan B” into an actual option.</p>





 This Is Achievable, But Only If You Know What You’re Buying 



<p>The good news? You don’t need to decentralize everything. In fact, you probably shouldn’t. But you should know what you’re trading off.</p>



<p>Think of decentralization as buying protection against:</p>



 
 Lock-in: pricing hikes, roadmap divergence, license changes 



 Regulatory shifts: data residency rules, cross-border controls 



 Platform instability: outage, acquisition, end-of-life surprises 



 Geopolitical risk: sanction-driven service denial, regional throttling 



 Value misalignment: privacy erosion, surveillance, ethical conflicts 
 



<p>That’s not FUD. It’s a checklist that helps you determine where decentralization is a strategic safeguard and where centralization is still worth the risk.</p>



 Choose Your Investment Level 



<p>There’s a spectrum here. Not every organization needs multi-cloud failover, decentralized identity, and DNS across five providers. But every organization needs to ask:</p>



 
 Where are we so centralized that a single point of failure becomes an existential risk? 



 And what would it take to make that risk optional rather than inevitable? 
 



<p>You shouldn’t be looking for decentralization for its own sake. You’re looking for just enough optionality to survive a change in vendor policy, regulation, or business direction without rebuilding your stack from scratch. Ultimately, every team needs to decide how much of the cost of decentralization is justified by the control they gain.</p>



<p>Every small investment buys you breathing room. And breathing room is what makes resilience possible.</p>



 Closing Thought: Buy Control Before You Need It 



<p>You don’t have to decentralize everything. You probably can’t.</p>



<p>But if your entire digital operation depends on a single cloud region, vendor, or IdP that no one knows how to replace, then you’re not buying control; you’re borrowing it and hoping nothing goes wrong.</p>



<p>So, how much of the cost of decentralization are you willing to pay before you’re forced to?</p>



<p>Because waiting until you have to pay is rarely the cheapest option.</p>



<p>Bonne chance, mon ami!</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists. If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it. Welcome back! If you caught the last episode, you’ll remember that we talked about how the real innovation isn’t choosing between centralized or decentralized identity systems—it’s about the ability to shift between the two.</p>



<p>[00:00:44]<br>If you didn’t hear that episode, no worries. Here’s the short version:</p>



 
 When I talk about centralization, I’m not just talking about infrastructure, but also controls. 
 



<p>[00:00:56]<br>A centralized identity system relies on one authority—one identity provider, one source of truth, one way to enforce access. Everything flows through a single control point.</p>



<p>[00:01:06]<br>In decentralized models, control is distributed.</p>



 
 You might issue credentials that can be independently verified and used. 



 You might support federation or allow for local policy decisions. 



 All of that isn’t chaos—it’s coordination across more than one authority. 
 



<p>[00:01:24]<br>Most enterprise systems fall somewhere in the middle. It’s not a question of which is better, but how much flexibility you’ve built into your dependencies and whether you’re ready to shift between centralized and decentralized models when needed.</p>



<p>[00:01:39]<br>And just to clarify, if your mind jumps straight to blockchain when I say “decentralized identity,” you can let that go. That’s not what we’re talking about here.</p>



 



 The Cost of Flexibility 



<p>[00:01:51]<br>Today, we’re building on that story, because flexibility to shift between these two models isn’t free.</p>



<p>[00:01:58]<br>In enterprise identity systems especially, the cost of decentralization can sneak up on you—until one day, it’s the only thing you can do.</p>



<p>[00:02:09]<br>Centralization absolutely works—right up until it doesn’t. Most enterprise systems are mostly centralized by design because:</p>



 
 It scales 



 It’s familiar 



 It’s easier to manage and deploy 
 



<p>[00:02:27]<br>You pick a cloud provider, configure your identity flows, and build tools that make daily life easier for your teams. All reasonable decisions.</p>



<p>[00:02:37]<br>But centralization comes with trade-offs that don’t always show up on your architecture diagram.</p>



 
 They show up when your vendor changes policies 



 When a regulator demands regional data isolation 



 When the company that owns your login page gets acquired and suddenly nothing is where it used to be 
 



<p>[00:02:56]<br>That’s when the invoice for centralization shows up. If you’ve prepared for it, great. If not, keep listening.</p>



 



 Trade-Offs and Hidden Costs 



<p>[00:03:09]<br>Let’s talk about those trade-offs and where they show up.</p>



<p>[00:03:15]<br>Most organizations don’t decide to centralize everything all at once. It usually happens gradually—through tool choices, vendor decisions, and policies that favor simplicity.</p>



<p>[00:03:36]<br>You pick AWS or Microsoft Azure because they offer global infrastructure and built-in security.<br>You standardize on a single identity provider for simplified access control and audit logging.<br>You rely on a CDN, DNS service, or messaging platform—not because you want lock-in, but because it works and provides redundancy.</p>



<p>[00:04:09]<br>Those normal decisions can quietly create dependencies that are hard to unwind.</p>



<p>[00:04:18]<br>Centralization feels efficient, but it means you’re betting on your vendors never changing, your regulators staying predictable, and your systems remaining static.</p>



<p>[00:04:44]<br>The real question isn’t “Did we centralize too much?” It’s “Do we know which parts of our systems are built around a trust that hasn’t been stress-tested yet?”<br>That’s where decentralization—or even just having a plan for it—starts to pay off.</p>



 



 What Does Decentralization Actually Cost? 



<p>[00:04:52]<br>Decentralization isn’t just a design pattern or a configuration flag.<br>It shows up in:</p>



 
 How you hire teams 



 How you build systems 



 How you buy SaaS applications 



 How you plan for the future 
 



<p>[00:05:06]<br>Let’s talk about three kinds of cost:</p>



 Financial Cost 



<p>[00:05:09]<br>Redundancy means paying for more than one way to do something—running services in two cloud regions, contracting with two vendors for the same function.<br>This can look inefficient on a spreadsheet, but it’s really trading short-term inefficiency for long-term adaptability.</p>



 2. Operational Cost 



<p>[00:05:38]<br>Decentralized systems require discipline.</p>



 
 You have more services to coordinate 



 You need more observability 



 You need standardized policy enforcement<br>It’s not just a technical tax—it’s a cultural shift. 
 



<p>[00:06:06]<br>Assume failures will happen and design recovery plans before they do.</p>



 3. Strategic Cost 



<p>[00:06:11]<br>This is the hardest to measure.<br>Decentralization forces you to ask:</p>



 
 Do we want flexibility or feature velocity? 



 Are we optimizing for today’s comfort or tomorrow’s resilience? 



 Are we willing to make architectural choices that look less efficient but give us options when it counts? 
 



<p>[00:06:44]<br>If this sounds like tomorrow’s problem, you’re not alone—but chances are, you’ve already run into some version of this.</p>



 



 Real-World Scenarios 



<p>[00:06:59]<br>If you’ve ever had to “duct tape” your way out of a dependency, you’ve already felt the cost of not being flexible between centralization and decentralization.</p>



<p>[00:07:33]<br>This isn’t about building redundant systems for fun—it’s about investing in flexibility before you need it.</p>



<p>[00:07:39]<br>If the cost feels high now, ask: What will it cost to do it later, under pressure?</p>



 



 The Value of Optionality 



<p>[00:07:47]<br>Optionality is where decentralization pays off.</p>



 
 It’s not about building a parallel universe 



 It’s about designing systems with room to move 
 



<p>[00:07:53]<br>Examples include:</p>



 
 Backup login methods that don’t rely on a single provider 



 The ability to issue credentials even when your main service is down 



 Flexibility to shift data storage between jurisdictions without breaking compliance 
 



<p>[00:08:14]<br>If you’ve built in flexibility, you can adapt when something breaks. But it doesn’t come for free—it costs more planning, more conversations with legal and compliance, and more thoughtful procurement.</p>



<p>[00:08:32]<br>Sometimes, it means building things twice or building the glue that holds them together. But it gives you control before you need it.</p>



<p>[00:08:51]<br>It’s not overengineering—it’s building systems that don’t panic when the default plan fails. Because the default plan will fail.</p>



 



 A Personal Example 



<p>[00:09:03]<br>Let’s make this personal.<br>If you’ve worked in a high-security enterprise, you know the drill:</p>



 
 Company-managed device 



 Lockdown browser 



 VPN required for everything 
 



<p>[00:09:28]<br>It works—until you need to join a Google Meet with an external standards body and Google is blocked, or you need to access a shared document on a non-whitelisted domain.</p>



<p>[00:09:40]<br>Suddenly, your secure device becomes a wall—not because the technology failed, but because the policies are too rigid.</p>



<p>[00:10:06]<br>Imagine if you could submit for an exception—pre-modeled, well-governed, and aligned with business risk—without endless meetings and exceptions.<br>That’s what optionality would look like: not chaos, but structured flexibility.</p>



<p>[00:10:29]<br>Decentralization isn’t about removing control. It’s about creating trusted, intentional ways to shift it around when necessary.</p>



 



 Final Takeaway 



<p>[00:10:37]<br>Buy the control you need before you need it.</p>



 
 You don’t need to decentralize everything 



 You probably can’t and shouldn’t 



 But you do need to know where your dependencies live 
 



<p>[00:10:54]<br>When something goes sideways—a vendor acquisition, regulatory shift, or trust breakdown—you’ll want options.<br>And options must be built ahead of time.</p>



<p>[00:11:06]<br>Ask yourself:</p>



 
 Where are we so centralized that a single point of failure is an existential risk? 



 What would it take to make that risk optional instead of inevitable? 
 



<p>[00:11:15]<br>Even a small investment in flexibility buys you more breathing room—and breathing room is what makes resilience possible, not just technically but also operationally and strategically.</p>

			 Is the UAE Taking the Lead in the Tokenization Race? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>As you know, the U.S. is now pushing to become the crypto nation. It has capital, advanced bitcoin mining infrastructure, and some of the largest crypto-companies, but regulatory and political uncertainties continues to slow institutional adoption.</p>
<p>The EU has legal frameworks in place, but not simplicity. The complicated regulation works well for large financial players, however, it is proving a challenge for the next generation of blockchain innovators.</p>
<p>The UAE is taking a different approach, and it might just win the race. Rather than over-regulating or under-defining, it’s applying simple rules but selective authorizations, welcoming builders, and creating an environment where innovation can scale, fast.</p>
 A competitive edge built on openness and infrastructure. 
<p>We’ve just returned from Token2049 and RWAfi Live in Dubai, and one message is clear: The UAE is building the future of blockchain, faster, bolder, and more business-friendly than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>With 72 free zones, including DIFC, ADGM, and VARA, the UAE has created a system where local chambers of commerce and rulers compete to attract innovators. This friendly competition is pushing real-world asset tokenization forward. Project owners select the best place depending on their needs, and get access to a new blockchain-powered “American dream”.</p>
<p>Here are some recent innovation examples:</p>
 
 The <a href="https://dubailand.gov.ae/en/news-media/dubai-land-department-and-dubai-virtual-assets-regulatory-authority-collaborate-to-enhance-leadership-in-the-real-estate-sector-and-virtual-assets-regulation?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG#/">Dubai Land Department and VARA</a> are integrating real estate registries with blockchain. That means compliant, onchain property title transfers are now possible. 
 The <a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/innovation/tokenisation-regulatory-sandbox?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG">DFSA</a> has launched a dedicated regulatory environment to test tokenized securities like real estate shares, sukuk, and fund units, all under full overview. 
 <a href="https://www.ihcuae.com/media-centre/press-releases/ihc-adq-and-fab-pioneer-uae-dirham-backed-stablecoin-for-the-digital-economy?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG#:~:text=Abu%20Dhabi%2C%20UAE%2C%2028%20April,(subject%20to%20regulatory%20approval).">AE Coin</a>, a UAE Dirham backed stablecoin launched by FAB, ADQ, and IHC, is now live. This lays the foundation for compliant onchain payments at scale. 
 
<p>These aren’t isolated pilot projects. They are live infrastructure built to attract capital, global talent, and institutional adoption, and it’s working. From crypto startups to major financial institutions, builders are relocating to the UAE to benefit from its simple, selective, and scalable regulatory environment.</p>
 RWA: From trend to reality 
<p>At Tokeny, we are proud to help power this transition. Our infrastructure built on the ERC-3643 standard, enables institutions to:</p>
 
 Launch compliant RWA tokens with embedded control logic. 
 Execute atomic swaps between tokenized assets and regulated stablecoins. 
 Scale distribution across jurisdictions while enforcing compliance at every step. 
 
<p>At RWAfi Live during Token2049 Dubai, leaders from the DFSA, FSRA and MESA regulators shared a panel to discuss the future of onchain finance. The main takeaway? Regulation is not a blocker if you use the right tech. It’s the foundation for compliant onchain adoption.</p>
<p>This shift is happening faster than many expected, and the UAE is leading it.</p>
<p>For those of you who have missed this incredible panel, and the demos of the ERC3643 Association, <a href="https://youtu.be/viLyPOjuQRU?t=9760&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--LuEV2QuAyyi1u5KqkBvoa8NLSqAgv-GAyhrHWlDOSm8Q6fSxnZ_OsB60WiAp2pZdNfnrG">watch the livestream here</a>.</p>

   As part of Okta’s Secure Identity Commitment (OSIC) to lead the industry in the fight against identity attacks, we are making changes to improve our architecture related to developer organizations. 

 On May 22, 2025, our new Integrator Free Plan will become the default organization type when you sign up on developer.okta.com. If you are actively using an Okta Developer Edition org, please create

  <p>As part of <a href="https://www.okta.com/secure-identity-commitment/">Okta’s Secure Identity Commitment</a> (OSIC) to lead the industry in the fight against identity attacks, we are making changes to improve our architecture related to developer organizations.</p>

<p>On May 22, 2025, our new Integrator Free Plan will become the default organization type when you sign up on developer.okta.com. If you are actively using an Okta Developer Edition org, please create an Integrator organization and migrate to it. The Okta Developer Edition <a href="https://developer.okta.com/terms/">terms of service</a> will also be updated to clarify: neither your old Developer Edition organization nor your new Integrator organization is meant for production use cases.</p>

 New Okta developer organization types tailored for you 

<p>We’ve redesigned our developer orgs to better fit how you build. Whether you’re testing app integrations, validating identity flows, or preparing for OIN submission, the new Integrator Free Plan is purpose-built for iterative development—not production deployment.</p>

<p>This new structure reflects real-world developer needs:</p>

 
   A clean, focused environment optimized for building and validating integrations 
   Terms that match typical pre-production use cases 
   Streamlined signup and org management aligned with how developers work today 
 

<p>By moving to an Integrator organization, you’ll get an environment that’s aligned with modern dev workflows—simpler, more relevant, and built to support how you build.</p>

 Integrator organization benefits 

<p>This new organization structure will come with a number of benefits, such as improving integrator access to Okta support resources and expanding developer access to Okta product offerings for testing purposes.</p>

<p>The features available in the Integrator Free Plan are listed in <a>our reference docs</a>.</p>

 Deprecating Okta Developer Edition organizations 

<p>In July 2025, existing Okta Developer Edition organization will be deactivated. At this time, you will lose access to your old Okta Developer Edition organization and all resources in it.</p>

 How to tell whether your organization is affected 

<p>To check whether an organization is in Okta Developer Edition, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications in the Okta Admin Console. If you’re on Developer Edition, large text will inform you that “Developer Edition provides a limited number of apps”. This message appears below the Applications heading and above the Create App Integration button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Organizations in which this banner is absent from the Applications list are not part of Developer Edition, and are unaffected by the Developer Edition deprecation.</p>

 How to migrate your resources from Okta Developer Edition to Integrator Free Plan 

<p>Creating an Integrator Free Plan organization will give you a clean slate to test and develop in. However, you might want to replicate setup steps that you’ve performed in your Okta Developer Edition organization to continue work in progress. Several options are available for migrating your configuration from your Okta Developer Edition organization to your Integrator Free Plan  organization.</p>

<p></p>

 Migrating data is optional 

<p>If you want to discard the configuration and data from your Okta Developer Edition organization and start fresh in a new Integrator Free Plan organization, create a new Integrator Free Plan organization and begin using it. Your Developer Edition resources and configuration will be deleted when old organization are deactivated in July..</p>

 Re-create resources by re-running automation 

<p>If you automated the creation of resources in your Okta Developer Edition organization that you’d like to continue using in your Integrator Free Plan organization, your environment setup will be simple. Create an Integrator Free Plan organization, provide credentials to your setup tooling, and re-run that tooling.</p>

 Add automation for long-term management 

<p>If you created resources in your Okta Developer Edition organization by hand and you want to automate management of those resources going forward, this is a great time to build the tooling you want using  <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/okta/okta/latest/docs">Terraform</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">PowerShell</a>. <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer/blob/master/docs/okta.md">Terraformer</a> can help you generate Terraform configurations based on existing resources in your old organization.</p>

 Use our migration tool for one-off organization backup 

<p>If you’d like to capture a snapshot of your current Okta Developer Edition configuration, try <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-dev-account-migration-tool">our EnvSync migration tool</a>. It wraps the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> to create files representing all supported objects in your Developer Edition organization, and can use these backup files to automatically re-create many of the objects in your new Integrator Free Plan organization.</p>

 Migrate your public OIN Integration 

<p>If you have an integration in the <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/">Okta Integration Network</a> associated with your Okta Developer Edition organization, sign up for a new Integrator Free Plan organization and contact Developer Support to request that your integration be migrated to your new organization. Developer Support will link your new organization to your integration so that you can easily update it as needed.</p>

<p>If you have been working on an integration for the Okta Integration Network but it has not yet been accepted, you are responsible for migrating your work in progress from your Developer Edition organization to an Integrator Free plan organization.</p>

 Cutoff dates for OIN submissions 

<p>As of May 22, 2025, no new OIN integration submissions will be accepted from developer orgs.  After May 22, you must use an Integrator Free Plan organization to submit OIN integrations.</p>

<p>If you have submitted an OIN integration from an Okta Developer Edition organization, it must be approved by June 9. Any submissions coming from Okta Developer Edition organizations that are still in Draft or In Review status on June 9 will be automatically rejected, and you will need to re-submit the same integration from an Integrator Free Plan organization.</p>

 Key dates 


  
    
      Date
      What happens

<p>Holochain Core &amp; Networking: Since the last Dev Pulse, we’ve published the first three releases of Holochain 0.5 with our new networking engine <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune2</a>. While the focus of this release was network reliability, the improvements we’ve made will mostly be felt as dramatically better DHT performance. In our tests, and tests in the field, it shows shorter and more consistent syncing times for DHT data. CPU usage appears to have decreased significantly as well. One of the team is calling it “a good step forward for Holochain”.</p><p>There is a new behavior with Kitsune2 and performance enhancement. When a new node joins a network, there’ll be a time of initial DHT synchronization, during which they won’t immediately get any new data published by their peers since they joined. This is because they haven’t advertised themselves as full-arc nodes yet and so won’t be targeted for publishing to. But once they’ve synchronized with the other peers, it “goes like blazes and data just appears like it was authored locally”, in the words of a team member. So new users should still expect data to sync slowly for the first few minutes; this is normal.</p><p>It’ll still be a bit before we recommend that app developers update their projects to Holochain 0.5 — we’re seeing some connectivity issues which we believe we’ve identified as a simple misconfiguration which we’ll correct, test, and hopefully release soon. We also still need to update the scaffolding tool. If you’re brave and want to get a head start on an existing app, you can read the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/resources/upgrade/upgrade-holochain-0.5/?ref=blog.holochain.org">0.5 upgrade guide</a>.</p><p>In the Holochain 0.6 development line, the team is investigating bottlenecks in the conductor runtime. They’ve already addressed one long-standing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4079?ref=blog.holochain.org">issue</a> of degrading performance as source chains grow — we’re now seeing a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/4079?ref=blog.holochain.org#issuecomment-2863047641">30-40% improvement</a> in ad-hoc dev testing, with possibly more improvements to come.</p><p>Testing: All of the test scenarios in Holochain 0.4 have been converted from our older TryCP-based scale testing framework to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/wind-tunnel?ref=blog.holochain.org">Wind Tunnel</a> , and we’re now in the process of updating them for Holochain 0.5, as well as streamlining the process for deploying Wind Tunnel client nodes with <a href="https://developer.hashicorp.com/nomad?ref=blog.holochain.org">Nomad</a>. Dev team members are setting up test machines all around the world, and we’re looking at options for increasing the number of test machines.</p><p>Dev Docs: Lastly, we’ve published some new documentation in the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Build Guide</a>:</p>  Working With Data: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/validation-receipts/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Validation Receipts</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/using-the-host-api/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Host API</a>  Host API: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/cell-introspection/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Cell Introspection</a>  Host API: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/cryptography-functions/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Cryptography Functions</a>  Host API: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/miscellaneous-host-functions/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Miscellaneous Host Functions</a>  Validation: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/must-get-host-functions/?ref=blog.holochain.org">must_get_* Host Functions</a>  Validation: <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/dht-operations/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT Operations</a> (an advanced guide)

<p>In the first release of 2025 we have improved log correlation, adding&nbsp;both a Session and Correlation identifier. These additions enable more effective log correlation, making it easier to trace the full flow of authentication and related events across both audit and diagnostic logs.&nbsp;Links to specific documentation for this logging improvement can be found in the release notes. As always, we aim to improve a wide array of items and make corrections to simplify the use of the Identity Platform. These are shown in detail from the release notes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For our long-standing customers, we are working to release updates to a number of SSO service modules. &nbsp;These are external elements which ease configuration or use of SSO within Identity Platform. Our IDaaS service naturally receives these updates as they are available, however, if you have a premises-based installation, we would ask you to open a Service Desk ticket to request the updated code for these external to SSO modules. We would also like to point out that the modules&nbsp;have only been tested on SSO 9.6.0 found within this IDS 2025.1 release of Identity Platform, so would encourage you to update your Identity Platform prior to updating the modules. If you have any questions, Operations is happy to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all software, Ubisecure would like to encourage you to upgrade your Identity Platform in a timely manner. Please contact your Integration Partner or Ubisecure Account Representative with any questions. Ubisecure encourages all customers to review and schedule service upgrade to this latest release. Bringing system flexibility, security, and new features to ensure the best user experience possible for your businesses is our goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across private conversations with CISOs, CIOs, and heads of HR and identity, one issue continues to emerge as both urgent and unresolved:&nbsp;fake IT workers infiltrating enterprise environments&nbsp;under false or stolen identities.</p> 
<p>In many of these discussions, leaders admitted they’ve seen this problem up close, or know someone who has. Fake hires can linger undetected for months, perform well enough to avoid scrutiny, and quietly gain access to sensitive systems. Whether the goal is financial fraud, IP theft, or funding a foreign regime, the result is always dangerous: critical systems are compromised, trust is shattered, and the organization is left exposed.</p> 
<p>One of the most pressing challenges isn’t just how these bad actors get in, but&nbsp;who is responsible for stopping them. HR teams oversee hiring, but often lack the tools for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/candidate-verification-onboarding">candidate verification</a> beyond background checks. Security and IT teams are concerned about post-hire access and risk, but don’t own the onboarding funnel. The result? Confusion, finger-pointing, and growing vulnerability.</p> 
<p>Below I unpack four key insights from ongoing conversations with enterprise leaders who are trying to get ahead of this threat. If you’re in HR, IT, or security, these perspectives may sound familiar, and they offer a path toward better collaboration and stronger safeguards.</p> 
<p></p> 
 1. Employee Impersonation Has Become a Board-Level Concern  
<p>Executive leadership teams and boards of directors are no longer in the dark, directors are now demanding identity verification. High-profile media coverage in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/north-korean-spies-are-infiltrating-u-s-companies-through-it-jobs-e45a1be8">The Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/07/north-korean-it-workers-infiltrating-fortune-500-companies/">Fortune</a>, and other outlets has accelerated awareness and pressure. Directors are asking CIOs, CISOs, and HR leaders direct questions:</p> 
  
  Could this happen to us?  
  Have we already been compromised?  
  What safeguards are in place?  
  
<p>For companies in highly regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and defense, the scrutiny is even more intense. While some board members have suggested drastic measures, like requiring all new hires to verify their identity in person, most executives acknowledge that this alone won’t solve the problem. A more sustainable, digital-first strategy is needed.</p> 
 2.&nbsp;Who Owns Employee Identity Verification? Solving Accountability Gaps Across HR, IT, and Security  
<p>One of the most persistent issues? Nobody agrees on who owns the employee impersonation problem.</p> 
  
  Is it HR, responsible for hiring and onboarding?  
  Is it IT, responsible for managing account access?  
  Is it Security, who typically handles insider threats?  
  Or is it Legal or Compliance, given the regulatory exposure?  
  
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bojansimic/"></a></p> 
<p>The result is organizational paralysis, with each department assuming someone else is responsible, no one takes ownership, and the risk continues to grow unchecked. Some companies assign ownership to HR ops, only to discover their background check tools aren’t built for identity verification at scale. Others lean on security or insider threat teams, who are already overwhelmed and reluctant to take on additional responsibility without a clear mandate.</p> 
<p>The most successful organizations tackling this issue have one thing in common: collaborative, cross-functional alignment across HR, IT, and security, often driven by a central <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/identity-security-guide">identity security</a> program.</p> 
 3. Manual Identity Checks Can’t Stop Fake IT Workers: Why Traditional Onboarding Is Failing  
<p>When detection fails, prevention becomes a guessing game. Unfortunately, many companies are relying on labor-intensive, manual processes that don’t scale and are easy to bypass:</p> 
  
  Video-based interviews and onboarding: Helpful, but increasingly vulnerable to deepfakes.  
  In-person onboarding: Logistically difficult and only effective if the individual remains in the role.  
  Laptop shipping verification: Foiled when attackers use “mules” or remote access post-delivery.  
  Always-on video during virtual meetings: Easy to fake, hard to enforce.  
  Behavior-based 2FA triggers: Ineffective if the attacker already has valid credentials.  
  
<p>Worse still, many adversaries are using stolen identities purchased on the dark web or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/ai-forgery-epidemic">leveraging GenAI to create fraudulent documents</a> that pass background checks. The impersonation problem is outpacing traditional onboarding controls.</p> 
 4. How Global Worker Impersonation Goes Undetected  
<p>While North Korean infiltration garners headlines due to FBI intervention, similar incidents are happening globally. Attackers from Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and other regions are using identical playbooks.</p> 
<p>There’s also a related phenomenon gaining steam: job stacking, where one person holds multiple jobs under a single identity, often outsourcing tasks to others for profit. These schemes can fly under the radar for months and result in confidential data being shared with unauthorized third parties.</p> 
<p>Many security teams remain reactive, addressing these issues only after something suspicious surfaces. Given that some experts estimate over 500,000 impersonators may be employed by U.S. organizations today, this approach is no longer tenable.</p> 
 6 Actions CIOs and CISOs Can Take to Prevent Employee Impersonation  
  
  Reverify All Identities Using Multi-Factor Signals&nbsp;<br>Conduct a phased identity verification process using device checks, location data, government ID scans, and manager attestation. Move beyond one-time checks.  
  Make Identity Security an Ongoing Priority<br><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-identity-assurance">Identity assurance</a> isn’t a one-and-done task. Apply Zero Trust principles to continuously verify the human behind the login.  
  Scrutinize Third Parties and Contractors<br>Treat contractors and gig workers with the same rigor as full-time staff. Consider biweekly or monthly identity reverification cadences.  
  Bridge the Gap Between HR, IT, and Security<br>Establish shared KPIs and workflows across departments to ensure no gaps in accountability exist.  
  Leverage Existing Security Tools for Continuous Verification<br>Correlate identity assurance signals from IDPs, EDR tools, and network monitoring systems to flag suspicious behavior.  
  Report Incidents and Collaborate with Industry Peers<br>Engage with communities like FS-ISAC and share learnings. Open dialogue is critical to closing industry-wide gaps.  
  
 Why Continuous Employee Verification Is Now Essential  
<p>Impersonation-based attacks are no longer rare, and they’re not going away. These threats are stealthy, scalable, and extremely difficult to detect using traditional HR or IT processes alone.</p> 
<p>The only path forward is one built on <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">continuous identity verification</a>, from day zero through every access point of the employee lifecycle. At HYPR, we believe trust must be earned continuously, not just at the time of hire.</p>

 Open House: A Conversation with Blocko’s CEO on the Future of Enterprise Blockchain with Aergo &amp;&nbsp;HPP <p>This time, we sat down with Won Kim, CEO of Blocko, to discuss Blocko's critical role as a key partner in the Aergo ecosystem and explore how Aergo’s future, powered by the House Party Protocol (HPP) and Layer 2 innovation, will create new opportunities for enterprises. In this conversation, Won outlines how enterprise clients will transition through Aergo’s evolution, how the dual-layer approach strengthens the ecosystem, and how Blocko continues to drive real-world adoption of blockchain technology.</p> Q1: How would you describe the relationship between Blocko and&nbsp;Aergo? <p>Won Kim: The combination of Blocko and Aergo is quite rare in the blockchain industry. Blocko provides the full spectrum of services enterprise clients need — from architecture design to system customization and long-term maintenance.</p><p>In a way, you could compare it to the relationship between Ethereum and ConsenSys, but there’s a key difference: Blocko is much more hands-on in the actual building and deployment process.</p><p>This deep collaboration benefits both parties. Aergo can continuously enhance and advance Aergo Enterprise based on direct client feedback gathered through Blocko’s projects. At the same time, Blocko can focus purely as a Managed Service Provider (MSP), delivering end-to-end blockchain solutions. It creates a virtuous cycle of innovation and execution between the platform and the service&nbsp;layer.</p> Q2: How does Blocko’s role fit Aergo’s evolution with HPP and&nbsp;L2? <p>Won Kim: Blocko has always been focused on driving real-world adoption of blockchain technology. As Aergo evolves with the launch of HPP ETH Layer 2, our role remains critical: to penetrate the enterprise blockchain market by transitioning past Aergo Enterprise use cases into the AI-driven HPP ecosystem, while continuing to deliver enterprise-grade solutions built on Aergo Mainnet. While HPP ETH L2 will lead broader Web3 innovation, Aergo Mainnet will continue to serve as the trusted foundation for enterprises requiring security, compliance, and private deployments. Our clients rely on us to provide stability and continuity as the ecosystem continues to&nbsp;evolve.</p> Q3: How will enterprise clients be affected by the introduction of HPP ETH Layer&nbsp;2? <p>Won Kim: There will be no disruption for our enterprise clients. Aergo Mainnet will continue to operate as it has always, providing a stable and high-performance private blockchain infrastructure. Clients using Aergo Enterprise will not need to make any technical changes. However, for enterprises seeking AI-driven capabilities, the broader ecosystem of HPP will be available as an option through Layer&nbsp;2.</p><p>The launch of HPP ETH L2 is an expansion, not a replacement. It introduces a two-track strategy for the Aergo ecosystem: one track focused on public innovation (L2) and another anchored in private, enterprise-grade reliability (L1).</p> Q4: What are the benefits of maintaining both Aergo L1 and introducing HPP&nbsp;L2? <p>Won Kim: We offer flexibility that few ecosystems can match by maintaining both layers. Aergo Mainnet provides long-term support for enterprise solutions, including compliance, data protection, and custom deployments. At the same time, HPP ETH L2 opens the door for innovation with AI-native smart contracts, decentralized identity, and broader Web3 use cases. Together, they create a full-stack ecosystem that can scale with both corporate and Web3 ecosystem needs.</p> Q5: From an enterprise perspective, what excites you most about Aergo’s&nbsp;future? <p>Won Kim: What excites me most is the convergence between AI and blockchain. HPP ETH L2 introduces concepts like AI oracles, enabling smart contracts to dynamically process and respond to real-world data. This unlocks opportunities in areas such as automated compliance, supply chain verification, and real-time risk management, where enterprises seek blockchain to add real value, not just theoretical potential.</p> Q6: How is Blocko supporting this transition alongside Aergo? <p>Won Kim: Blocko is actively working with Aergo to ensure a smooth transition through close technical collaboration, client communication, and long-term roadmap alignment. We are expanding our solution stack to bridge traditional enterprise systems with the new opportunities presented by HPP ETH L2, particularly for clients seeking to integrate AI-driven data flows and smarter automation into their blockchain operations.</p><p>We view Aergo’s evolution not as a pivot, but as a natural expansion of what we started: making blockchain real, usable, and transformative for enterprises.</p> Q7: How is Blocko approaching overseas markets with less restrictive regulatory environments? <p>Won Kim: In the past, we saw significant growth internationally, securing projects with Bank of Singapore, Credit Suisse, and the Seed Group in Dubai. We even established a local branch in the UK to support global expansion. Our projects included building a Sharia-compliant distribution platform in Dubai and conducting successful STO-related PoC projects with Credit&nbsp;Suisse.</p><p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted us, prompting us to wind down our overseas operations. This experience prompted a strategic shift, moving from a solution-based delivery model to a fully cloud-based SaaS approach. Instead of deploying teams on-site, we now host our services on the cloud, enabling enterprises and consumers to access them remotely.</p><p>As a result, approximately 40% of the current inbound demand now comes from international customers. With Korea’s blockchain-related regulations becoming more defined, we believe the time is right to expand aggressively. Blocko is well-positioned to lead the way with our technology and operational experience.</p> Q8: Is there anything you would like to&nbsp;add? <p>Won Kim: Blocko has been committed to the potential of general-purpose blockchain technology even before the birth of Ethereum. For over a decade, we have focused on integrating blockchain into complex enterprise environments, consistently addressing real-world challenges and operational demands.</p><p>Now, as the rapid advancement of AI technology reshapes industries, it has become increasingly clear that enterprises need a foundational layer to fully harness the power of AI innovations. Recognizing this shift, Blocko fully aligns with the vision that the evolution of Aergo’s technology into the House Party Protocol (HPP) is not just necessary, but critical for leading the next era of enterprise blockchain and Web3 innovation.</p><p>We are proud to stand alongside Aergo as we move into this next chapter, building a blockchain infrastructure ready for an AI-driven future.</p><blockquote>“Blocko has been committed to advancing blockchain technology even before the birth of Ethereum, integrating it into complex enterprise environments for over a decade. As AI reshapes industries, we believe a robust blockchain foundation is essential — and the evolution of Aergo into the House Party Protocol (HPP) is critical for leading the next era of enterprise and Web3 innovation.”<br> — Won Kim, CEO of&nbsp;Blocko</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/open-house-a-conversation-with-blockos-ceo-on-the-future-of-enterprise-blockchain-with-aergo-aaf9f46e29f7">Open House: A Conversation with Blocko’s CEO on the Future of Enterprise Blockchain with Aergo &amp;…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In the increasingly modular world of Web3, crypto bridges have emerged as vital infrastructure, allowing not just digital assets but also data to flow across otherwise siloed blockchains. As decentralized applications and user bases grow across chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana, and others, bridges enable cross-chain functionality, improve liquidity distribution, and facilitate multi-chain user experiences.</p><p>But how do these bridges work, what risks do they carry, and how are projects like HPP (House Party Protocol) approaching them in a more secure and purpose-driven way?</p> What Is a Crypto&nbsp;Bridge? <p>A crypto bridge is a set of smart contracts and messaging infrastructure that allows users to move tokens or data from one blockchain to another. Users commonly “lock” assets on a source chain and receive a “wrapped” version on the destination chain. When they want to move back, the wrapped asset is burned, and the original is released.</p><p>Importantly, modern bridges are evolving to support not just tokens, but cross-chain data validation, state updates, and messaging, enabling a broader spectrum of interoperable applications.</p> Why Bridges&nbsp;Matter <p>Without bridges, liquidity and utility are locked within individual chains. That leads to fragmentation, inefficiency, and user friction. Crypto bridges solve this&nbsp;by:</p>  Enabling users to move assets freely across ecosystems  Allowing developers to tap into liquidity from other&nbsp;chains  Supporting cross-chain DeFi, gaming, NFT, and data-sharing applications  Reducing reliance on centralized exchanges  Facilitating cross-chain communication and AI agent orchestration  <p>Bridges are especially crucial in the Layer 2 and modular blockchain landscape, where chains are built for specialized functions (e.g., speed, privacy, compliance) but still need to interoperate.</p> HPP’s Approach to&nbsp;Bridging <p>As Aergo transitions to HPP, a Layer 2 network built on either Arbitrum Orbit or OP Stack depending on strategic and technical considerations, bridging becomes a central component of the roadmap. Aergo tokens exist on the Aergo mainnet and Ethereum (ERC-20). In the future, HPP tokens will be launched on the selected Layer 2 platform, and official bridges will be established to support a secure transition and enable seamless cross-chain interactions.</p><p>In the initial stage, the bridge will serve primarily as a secure and convenient method for converting assets between chains. However, as development progresses, this infrastructure will evolve into the core of HPP’s cross-chain architecture, enabling interaction between the Aergo mainnet (L1) and HPP ETH (L2). It will also serve as the foundation for AI-related features, facilitating the orchestration of agents, datasets, and verified compute across multiple environments.</p><p>While the initial focus is on the Aergo-ETH-HPP triad, the team will continue developing additional bridge features based on demand and the evolution of the ecosystem.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Crypto bridges are essential as they represent the frontier of blockchain scalability, data coordination, and user access. Bridges are not just a ‘token swapper’ — they will be the conductor of an AI-purpose network, orchestrating AI agents, datasets, and more. Let’s see how bridges will evolve in the coming age of&nbsp;AI.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bc-101-4-understanding-crypto-bridges-6c78937fe5f1">BC 101 #4: Understanding Crypto Bridges</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>On May 8th, 2025, we held our sixth weekly AMA. And for the first time, we hosted it on <a href="https://x.com/i/spaces/1OyJALokBMNGb">X/Twitter Spaces.</a> The session with hosts Ben and Raph covered everything from HPP’s roadmap and token migration to AI, ecosystem partnerships, and more. Here’s a numbered recap of the key questions and insights&nbsp;shared:</p>  Can you give us a clear elevator pitch for HPP?<br>HPP (House Party Protocol) is the next evolution of the Aergo public blockchain. Backed by a team with over a decade in Web3, HPP represents a pivot to an AI-first Layer 2 chain. It builds on Aergo’s strong enterprise foundation to support more adaptive, intelligent, and data-driven applications.  When will HPP launch?<br>HPP is targeting a launch in Q3 2025, which is when the current Aergo chain will transition into the HPP network. Until then, users can follow the project through its living roadmap and community channels like Twitter, Telegram, and Medium. Development updates, branding efforts, and offline appearances are ongoing in preparation for the official&nbsp;launch.  How will the token swap from AERGO to HPP work?<br>The AERGO to HPP token swap will happen at a 1:1 ratio. The process will depend on where the tokens are held. Most exchanges are expected to handle the swap automatically. A bridge may be required for self-custodied tokens. Official instructions will be provided ahead of the swap. Users are advised to stay vigilant and only trust verified channels.  Are there any Aergo or HPP tokens on other chains like BNB or Solana?<br>No. AERGO currently exists only on the Aergo mainnet and Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. If anyone is offering Aergo or HPP tokens on other chains (e.g., BNB or Solana), it is a scam. The only safe way to move tokens is through the official bridge provided by the&nbsp;project.  Is staking available for AERGO tokens?<br>Yes. AERGO staking is available on the Aergo mainnet. Community members regularly share updated staking options in the Telegram chat, which is the best place to learn more and get involved.  What is the relationship between Aergo and Blocko?<br>Aergo and Blocko are separate entities, although they share early founders. Blocko serves as a long-term technology partner and contributes development and infrastructure support to the Aergo ecosystem. Blocko also works with major enterprise clients and remains a trusted blockchain solution provider.  Why is HPP focused on AI?<br>AI is no longer just a trend; it is becoming a foundational layer of modern digital applications. HPP is designed to address AI accountability, data validation, and agent verification. The goal is to support both innovative AI use cases and safeguards against misuse by providing a secure blockchain environment for data and agent integrity.  What is VaaSBlock’s role in the HPP ecosystem?<br>VaasBlock is an independent company that focuses on Web3 accountability tools. It is closely aligned with Aergo and contributes to the HPP ecosystem through W3DB — a decentralized registry for datasets and AI agents. While separate, the collaboration is strong, and team members often work side-by-side.  Any updates on Binance spot listing?<br>Currently, Aergo is listed on Binance Futures. The team would like to see a Binance Spot listing but has no control over Binance’s listing decisions. The focus remains on building real products and delivering value through the HPP ecosystem in hopes of earning broader listings over&nbsp;time.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/hpp-ama-6-recap-from-aergo-to-hpp-ai-and-whats-coming-next-3f9f865549a2">HPP AMA #6 Recap: From Aergo to HPP, AI, and What’s Coming Next</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
