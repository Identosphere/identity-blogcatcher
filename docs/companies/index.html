<p>We know that the universe of knowledge surrounding identity verification and security can feel vast. We’re here to help! Consider this glossary your one stop shop, a way to help equip you with the ABCs of KYC. Share it with your friends or colleagues, or let it be your secret weapon as you become the resident expert—we won’t tell.&nbsp;</p>



 The Basics&nbsp; 



  Biometric is the “measurement of the human body”, the science of analyzing physical or behavioral characteristics specific to each individual. <br><br>  KYC means Know Your Customer. It is the process of a business verifying the identity of its customer and assessing their suitability. <br><br>  Identity Verification is the process of confirming a person’s identity. Easy!<br><br>  Selfie Authentication uses facial recognition and biometric data to allow users to verify and match themselves to the piece of identity used in the verification process.&nbsp;  



 The Tech 



  AI stands for artificial intelligence and is the simulation of human intelligence processes such as learning, reasoning, and self-correction by machines.&nbsp;  



  Facial Recognition is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or video. In identity authentication or verification, this is usually used to compare a selfie or with an image on file to see if the faces match.<br><br>  Machine Learning is a category of algorithms that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed.<br><br>  



 &nbsp;For the Experts <br><br> 



  AML stands for Anti-Money Laundering and refers to a set of laws, regulations, and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income.&nbsp;  



  GDPR means General Data Protection Regulation in the EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the EEA.&nbsp;  



  Hashing is meant to verify that a file or data is authentic and has not been altered. It uses an algorithm to map data of any size to a fixed length called a hash value/hash code and is one-way.<br><br>  Privacy by design means privacy is incorporated into technology and systems by default when designing a product. <br><br>  Private key is a type of lock used in asymmetric encryption that is used to decrypt the message by converting the received message back to the original message and is kept secret.<br><br>  Public key is a type of lock used in asymmetric encryption that is used to encrypt the message by converting it to an unreadable form and is widely distributed.<br><br>  Spoofing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain someone’s personal information by pretending to be a source known to the receiver. For tips to keep yourself and your company safe, head <a href="https://authenteq.com/anti-spoofing-tips-and-tools-to-keep-you-and-your-company-safe-and-secure/">here</a>. <br><br>

Community members were invited to vote for a change to the WING reward distribution rate during the WING Mining Celebration. Over 1/3 of all current WING in circulation participated in the vote. As a result, the distribution rate will change to twice, compared with the previous ten times, effective from 00:05, September 18th. <br>- From September 18th to 29th, through the Flash Pool Mining Celebration, users will be rewarded extra incentives. Users who deposit their WING in the Wing DAO Supply Pool during this period will receive a ten-fold increase in rewards between September 18th and 24th, and a five-fold increase in rewards between September 25th and 29th.<br>- On September 20th (UTC), the WING/EWING swap was launched in Flash Pool of Wing, with the aim of increasing the project’s liquidity&nbsp;. Recently, project teams such as OpenOcean.finance also announced that WING-related swaps would soon be launched online, opening new channels for WING’s circulation and increased scenarios where WING could be used. <br> <br>Global Events<br>- On September 18th, Jun LI (founder of Ontology) took part in a panel discussion themed “Prospects of Decentralized Finance” at 2020 International Fintech Innovation Conference (IFIC) in Shanghai. During the panel discussion, Li stated that should Ontology wish to stand out in the DeFi industry while avoiding stepping into the transaction-fee issue as faced by Ethereum, it needs to work harder on its strategy to support different charges in scenarios of different technical complexities. He said, “Ontology is determined to integrate all types of data, including real-life identity data, credit data and asset data of various groups of people, on the blockchain to build a ‘Super Oracle’ that provides the whole package of data and identity information in various DeFi services.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-september-16-22-634f2d3c6a24">Ontology Weekly Report (September 16–22)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Few strategies and strategic plans, if any, will survive COVID-19 unchanged. The pandemic recovery has prompted <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">a reset in business strategy</a>, and CIOs and other technology leaders have to determine whether, and by how much, to rethink the IT strategic plan and recalibrate execution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given today’s fast-changing conditions, senior business leaders are increasingly using <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">adaptive strategies</a> to (re)define the long-term direction of the enterprise. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-imperatives-for-streamlined-strategic-planning-for-functional-leaders/">Functional strategic plans</a> follow, with a roadmap of initiatives and investments required to achieve the objectives defined in the strategy. For most CIOs, it’s time to consider recalibrating those strategic plans for IT.</p>
<p>“First, you need to determine the impact of strategy shifts on the existing IT strategic plan,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/30969">Joanne Kopcho</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “Only once you know whether the impact is negligible, minor, major or critical can you determine whether you need to refresh or update the plan, or overhaul it completely.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37208"]&nbsp;</p>
 How far has and will the business strategy shift? 
<p>In their initial response to the pandemic, many enterprises had to halt certain activities or deploy temporary solutions on very short timelines. As organizations move past response and into recovery and renewal, senior leaders are deciding whether to reverse those initial changes or reinforce them over the long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many pandemic-driven changes are unlikely to reverse. A Gartner Board of Directors survey showed that seven out of 10 board directors believe the COVID-19 impact has already <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">accelerated digital business initiatives</a>. This acceleration is likely to have an ongoing and significant impact on in-flight IT strategic plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in these volatile conditions, senior leaders need a formal long-term strategy that articulates what the enterprise will do to compete and succeed in its chosen markets or, for the public sector, what the agency will do to achieve its mission. The question for functional leaders is how much those new strategies impact existing strategic plans.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz04OGU0ZWIwYmY4ZWUxMWVhYmQ1ZTBhN2YyMTUyMDQ0NQ=="></a></p>
 Initiate, update or refresh the IT strategic plan 
<p>By using the Gartner checklist approach, CIOs can determine the extent to which strategic actions, principles and metrics have changed in response to the crisis. The checklist contains a series of questions to guide CIOs, as they rethink or revisit changes to existing strategic plans, such as:</p>
 
 During our initial response to the crisis, did we build or acquire any new or temporary capabilities that we no longer need — or that need to be made permanent? 
 Have there been changes to the business objectives, goals or strategies that need to be reflected in the strategic principles? Have changes affected the business model or markets? 
 Has change occurred that is impacting the balance of cost, risk and value within the strategic plan? 
 
<p>As CIOs complete the checklist, the responses help to determine the degree of recalibration required, based on these impacts:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Critical change could require a new IT strategic plan built from scratch. 
 Major change likely requires key components of the plan to be rebuilt. 
 Minor change means adjusting execution within the existing plan. 
 No change means continuing to execute the existing plan as originally envisaged. 
 
 Recalibrate IT strategic plans for today and tomorrow 
<p>The extent of changes and recalibration for the IT strategic plan can vary by organization. Additional activities to recalibrate may require one or all of these actions:</p>
 
 Reprioritize and address conflicts, e.g., determine which initiatives to stop, pause or start. 
 Reset engagement and communication, e.g., articulate new priorities across the organization. 
 Validate strategic plan metrics and triggers, e.g., change dashboards and reporting practices to reflect new or changed roadmaps. 
 
<p>CIOs should establish checkpoints to continue recalibrating over time as conditions, digital trends and objectives evolve. The accelerated-digital trend adds unique demands on IT strategic plans. Under the microscope, for example, will be the composable technology foundation that’s needed to balance efficiency with resilience and the need for any-scale operations that can spin up and down with demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going forward, for example, organizations should be applying digital business acceleration to a range of activities, from meeting the needs of the “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-cios-design-for-the-everything-customer/">everything customer</a>” (who demands both personalization and privacy) to building an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/hybrid-workforce-models-speed-digital-transformation/">adaptable workforce</a> equipped with the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lack-of-skills-threatens-digital-transformation/">skills</a>, processes, information and autonomy to flex in the face of disruption.</p>
<p>And ultimately, the IT strategic plan must be able to flex not only with evolving strategy, but to accommodate <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-functional-leaders-should-know-about-scenario-planning/">scenario plans</a> and totally unforeseen circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When the products we develop collect sensitive data, it’s essential to secure and safeguard it to protect user privacy and the user’s identity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">Personally identifiable information</a> (PII) is any data that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as name, email address, phone number, US Social Security number, birth date, and so on. Yet companies also need to store user-related data that is not as sensitive as PII. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/">Entity Framework Core</a> together with Okta for storing user’s non-sensitive data and PII.</p>

<p>Entity Framework Core is an open-source, cross-platform object-relational mapper (ORM) that allows .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. With EF Core, you no longer need to write SQL queries and commands manually. Instead, you query data with strongly typed LINQ (Language Integrated Query) queries and EF Core automatically tracks any changes you make to the result of the query.</p>

<p>To continue you will need:</p>

 
   Basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio 2019</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core">.NET Core 3.1 SDK</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

 Create an ASP.NET Core MVC Web App with Entity Framework Core 

<p>Let’s build a web app for tracking personal expenses. Fire up Visual Studio and create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project select ASP.NET Core Web Application, and click Next. Name the app ExpenseTracker and click Create. On the next window, select Web Application (Model-View-Controller). As we need to create and store user accounts, click Change under Authentication on the right side of the window, select Individual User Accounts and click OK. Now, click Create and Visual Studio will create a new web project with Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core Identity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can create the project by running the following command in the terminal:</p>

   <code>dotnet new mvc --auth Individual -uld
</code>   

<p>ASP.NET Core Identity is the membership system for ASP.NET Core web applications that provides UI for login functionality and an API for managing users, roles, user data, and so on. Out of the box, ASP.NET Core Identity stores all data in a SQL Server database. The new project includes the migration code to create necessary tables and database objects—you just need to apply it using the <code>dotnet ef</code> tool.</p>

<p>If <code>dotnet ef</code> has not been installed, install it as a global tool:</p>

   <code>dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
</code>   

<p>To apply the migration open terminal in the project folder and run the following command to:</p>

   <code>dotnet ef database update
</code>   

<p>Finally, go to the <code>Startup.cs</code> file and change</p>

   <code>services.AddDefaultIdentity&lt;IdentityUser&gt;(options =&gt; options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
</code>   

<p>with</p>

   <code>services.AddDefaultIdentity&lt;IdentityUser&gt;(options =&gt; options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = false)
</code>   

<p>so that you don’t have to confirm the account after signup.</p>

<p>Let’s run the project now and see what our website looks like. Hit the F5 button and you will see a page like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you click the Register button you will see a sign-up page where you can create a local user and sign in to the website:</p>

<p>Now, let’s move on and add expense tracking with Entity Framework Core.</p>

 Create Data Model and Set Up Database 

<p>In the <code>ExpenseTracker</code> project inside the <code>Models</code> folder add <code>Category.cs</code> and <code>Expense.cs</code> classes:</p>

   <code>public class Category
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public IdentityUser CreatedBy { get; set; }
  public List&lt;Expense&gt; Expenses { get; set; }
}

</code>   

   <code>public class Expense
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public decimal Amount { get; set; }
  public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
  public IdentityUser CreatedBy { get; set; }
  public string CreatedById { get; set; }
  public Category Category { get; set; }
  public int CategoryId { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to update the <code>ApplicationDbContext</code> database context that was generated when you created the project. Open the <code>ApplicationDbContext.cs</code> file and add these two properties:</p>

   <code>  public DbSet&lt;Category&gt; Categories { get; set; }
  public DbSet&lt;Expense&gt; Expenses { get; set; }
</code>   

<p>After that override the <code>OnModelCreating</code> method like this:</p>

   <code>protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
{
  base.OnModelCreating(builder);

  builder.Entity&lt;Category&gt;().Property(category =&gt; category.Name).IsRequired();
  builder.Entity&lt;Category&gt;().HasMany(category =&gt; category.Expenses)
                            .WithOne(expense =&gt; expense.Category).IsRequired();

  builder.Entity&lt;Expense&gt;().Property(expense =&gt; expense.CreatedById).IsRequired();
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>DbContext</code> class serves as an entry point to the database. It represents a session to the database and is used to query and save instances of our database entities. The <code>DbSet</code> properties represent the entities exposed by the database that can be queried and modified. The <code>OnModelCreating</code> method allows you to configure the model using the Fluent API.</p>

<p>As you have modified the data model you need to create and apply a database migration to create corresponding tables for the new entities. Run the following commands in terminal:</p>

   <code>dotnet ef migrations add AddCategoryExpense
dotnet ef database update
</code>   

<p>The first command generates a new migration called <code>AddCategoryExpense</code> and the second one applies it to the database.</p>

<p>Now let’s populate the database with some dummy data. In the <code>ApplicationDbContext</code> class add the following at the end of <code>OnModelCreating</code> method:</p>

   <code>builder.Entity&lt;Category&gt;().HasData(new Category { Name = "Travel", Id = -1 }, new Category { Name = "Education", Id = -2 },
                                   new Category { Name = "Food", Id = -3 }, new Category { Name = "Healthcare", Id = -4 });
</code>   

<p>Once again add a new migration for the seed data and apply the migration to the database:</p>

   <code>dotnet ef migrations add SeedData
dotnet ef database update
</code>   

<p>Our database setup is now complete and you are ready to build a web app around our database.</p>

 Build a Simple CRUD with Entity Framework Core 

<p>Let’s start with building a simple Create/Read/Update/Delete form for <code>Categories</code>. In Visual Studio, right click on the Controllers folder, click Add and click Controller. In the window that appears select MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework and click OK. Select Category (ExpenseTracker.Models) for the model class, select ApplicationDbContext (ExpenseTracker.Data) for the data context class and click Add.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After code generation is complete, you will see a new controller in the Controllers folder and new views in the Views-&gt; Categories folder. Run the app, visit the <code>/Categories</code> url and you should see a list of available categories:</p>

<p>As you can see, you can also create a new Category, view details of the existing category, modify it, or delete a category. Before moving on to Expenses let’s make some changes to the Categories page.</p>

<p>First, let’s disable editing and deleting for the built-in categories and categories belonging to other users. Open the <code>Views\Categories\Index.cshtml</code> file and replace:</p>

   <code>@model IEnumerable&lt;ExpenseTracker.Models.Category&gt;
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Index";
}
</code>   

<p>with this:</p>

   <code>@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity
@model IEnumerable&lt;ExpenseTracker.Models.Category&gt;
@inject UserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt; userManager

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Index";
    var currentUser = await userManager.FindByNameAsync(User.Identity.Name);
}
</code>   

<p>Now replace</p>

   <code>&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;a asp-action="Edit" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Details&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a asp-action="Delete" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code>   

<p>with</p>

   <code>@if (item.CreatedById != null &amp;&amp; item.CreatedById == currentUser.Id)
{
  &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;a asp-action="Edit" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Details&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a asp-action="Delete" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
}
else
{
  &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;a asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Details&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>UserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt;</code> class provides an API for managing users of the application. I use it to get the <code>Id</code> of the current user and toggle <code>Delete</code> and <code>Edit</code> link visibility.</p>

<p>This way <code>Delete</code> and <code>Edit</code> links are only visible if the category was created by the current user. Now, open the <code>CategoriesController</code> class and add <code>UserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt;</code> parameter to the constructor.</p>

   <code>public CategoriesController(ApplicationDbContext context, UserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt; userManager)
{
  this.context = context;
  this.userManager = userManager;
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add the following lines to the <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Edit(int id, [Bind("Id,Name")] Category category)</code> method:</p>

   <code>var existingCategory = await context.FindAsync&lt;Category&gt;(id);
var user = await userManager.FindByIdAsync(category.CreatedById);

if (existingCategory.CreatedById == null || user.UserName != HttpContext.User.Identity.Name)
{
  return NotFound();
}
</code>   

<p>The code loads the category with the specified id from the database and checks if the category was created by the current user or not.</p>

<p>Add the same snippet to the <code>DeleteConfirmed</code> method too.</p>

<p>Secondly, modify <code>Create</code> method like this:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Create([Bind("Id,Name")] Category category)
{
  if (ModelState.IsValid)
  {
    category.CreatedById = (await userManager.FindByNameAsync(User.Identity.Name)).Id;
    context.Add(category);
    await context.SaveChangesAsync();
    return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index));
  }
  return View(category);
</code>   

<p>Finally, as you want only authentication users making the changes to categories, add the <code>Authorize</code> attribute to the <code>CategoriesController</code> class:</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public class CategoriesController : Controller
{
  //Rest of the code
}
</code>   

<p>Now, let’s build a CRUD for expenses. Right-click the Controllers folder again, click Add and click Controller. Select MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework in the new window, and click OK. This time select Expenses (ExpenseTracker.Models) for the model class, ApplicationDbContext (ExpenseTracker.Data) for the data context class and click Add:</p>

<p></p>

<p>I will update the <code>Create</code> and <code>Edit</code> methods in the <code>ExpensesController</code> so that <code>CreatedBy</code> and <code>CreatedAt</code> are set correctly and also update every corresponding cshtml file so that it doesn’t show textbox for <code>CreatedAt</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, I will add the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute to the <code>ExpensesController</code> class and also add <code>UserManager</code> parameter to the constructor:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Create([Bind("Id,Amount,CategoryId")] Expense expense)
{
  if (ModelState.IsValid)
  {
      expense.CreatedAt = DateTime.Now;
      expense.CreatedById = (await userManager.FindByNameAsync(User.Identity.Name)).Id
      _context.Add(expense);
      await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
      return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index));
  }
  ViewData["CategoryId"] = new SelectList(_context.Categories, "Id", "Name", expenseCategoryId);
  return View(expense);
}
</code>   

<p>Also, as I need to show the expenses belonging to the current user I will add a filter for that too:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Index()
{
  var user = await userManager.FindByIdAsync(User.Identity.Name);
  var applicationDbContext = context.Expenses.Where(expense =&gt; expense.CreatedById == user.Id)
                                              .Include(e =&gt; e.Category);
  return View(await applicationDbContext.ToListAsync());
}

</code>   

<p>Before running the app, open the <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> file in <code>Views/Shared</code> folder and add categories and expenses menu items to the <code>ul</code> with the <code>navbar-nav</code> class:</p>

   <code>&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
  &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="asp-action="Index"&gt;Categories&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
  &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controllerasp-action="Index"&gt;Expenses&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now, run the app and you should be able to manage your expenses:</p>

<p></p>

 Store a User’s Personally Identifiable Information in Okta 

<p>The sample website already supports user authentication but all the user PII is stored in SQL Server database. Instead of that, I will store users’ personal information in Okta and secure the web app. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication, as well as all OpenID Connect flows out of the box—it can take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>To get started, log in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer account</a>, via the URL you were emailed after signing up, to access your org’s portal dashboard. Once you log in, make sure to note your Org URL from the upper right corner of the screen:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, go to API in the menu, click Tokens, and click the Create Token button. Enter the name of the token (I will use ExpenseTracker) and click the Create Token button. Make sure you copy the token because you won’t be able to view it again:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, create a new application. Click Applications in the top menu and then Add Application. Select Web and click Next. Enter a name for the app (I will use ExpenseTracker again), replace <code>8080</code> with your local port number (in my case it’s <code>44376</code>), and set the Login redirect URIs to <code>signin-okta</code> and click Done.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the next screen, you will see <code>Client Id</code> and <code>Client Secret</code> of the application. You will need these to configure the Okta middleware, so take note of them:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In Visual Studio, open the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file and add a new section <code>Okta</code> below the <code>Logging</code> section and put the details of your app and token:</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": "",
    "ApiToken": "{yourToken}"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now, you are ready to store users in Okta. Switch to Visual Studio and add the <code>Okta.Sdk</code> Nuget package:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.Sdk
</code>   

<p>Next, create a new folder called <code>Identity</code> and add these two classes:</p>

   <code>public class OktaUserManager&lt;T&gt; : UserManager&lt;T&gt; where T : IdentityUser&lt;string&gt;, new()
{
  private OktaClient oktaClient;

  public OktaUserManager(IConfiguration configuration, IUserStore&lt;T&gt; store,IOptions&lt;IdentityOptions&gt; optionsAccessor,
                         IPasswordHasher&lt;T&gt; passwordHasher,IEnumerable&lt;IUserValidator&lt;T&gt;&gt; userValidators,
                         IEnumerable&lt;IPasswordValidator&lt;T&gt;&gt; passwordValidators,ILookupNormalizer keyNormalizer,
                         IdentityErrorDescriber errors, IServiceProvider services,ILogger&lt;UserManager&lt;T&gt;&gt; logger)
  : base(store, optionsAccessor, passwordHasher, userValidators, passwordValidators, keyNormalizer, errors, services, logger)
  {
    oktaClient = new OktaClient(new OktaClientConfiguration
    {
        OktaDomain = "https://${yourOktaDomain}",
        Token = configuration["Okta:ApiToken"]
    });
  }

  public override async Task&lt;IdentityResult&gt; CreateAsync(T user, string password)
  {
    var validate = await ValidatePasswordAsync(user, password);
    if (!validate.Succeeded)
    {
        return validate;
    }

    var result = await CreateAsync(user);
    if (!result.Succeeded)
    {
        return result;
    }

    await oktaClient.Users.PartialUpdateUserAsync(new User
    {
        Credentials = new UserCredentials
        {
            Password = new PasswordCredential
            {
                Value = password
            }
        }
    }, user.Id);
    return result;
  }
}
</code>   

   <code>public class OktaUserStore&lt;T&gt; : UserStore&lt;T&gt; where T : IdentityUser&lt;string&gt;, new()
{
  private OktaClient oktaClient;

  public OktaUserStore(IConfiguration configuration, DbContext context, IdentityErrorDescriber describer = null) : base(context, describer)
  {
    oktaClient = new OktaClient(new OktaClientConfiguration
    {
        OktaDomain = "https://${yourOktaDomain}",
        Token = configuration["Okta:ApiToken"]
    });
  }

  public override async Task&lt;IdentityResult&gt; CreateAsync(T user, CancellationToken cancellationToken = new CancellationToken())
  {
    var result = await oktaClient.Users.CreateUserAsync(new CreateUserWithoutCredentialsOptions
    {
        Profile = new UserProfile()
        {
            Login = user.NormalizedUserName,
            Email = user.NormalizedEmail,
            PrimaryPhone = user.PhoneNumber
        }
    }, cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
    user.Id = result.Id;
    return IdentityResult.Success;
  }

  public override async Task&lt;T&gt; FindByIdAsync(string userId, CancellationToken cancellationToken = new CancellationToken())
  {
    var user = await oktaClient.Users.GetUserAsync(userId, cancellationToken);
    return MapUser(user);
  }

  public override async Task&lt;T&gt; FindByNameAsync(string normalizedUserName, CancellationToken cancellationToken = new CancellationToken())
  {
    var user = await oktaClient.Users.ListUsers(filter: $"profile.login eq \{normalizedUserName}\"").FirstOrDefaultAsync(cancellationToken);
    return MapUser(user);
  }

  protected override Task&lt;T&gt; FindUserAsync(string userId, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
    return FindByIdAsync(userId, cancellationToken);
  }

  public override async Task&lt;T&gt; FindByLoginAsync(string loginProvider, string providerKey, CancellationToken cancellationToken = new CancellationToken())
  {
    return await FindByIdAsync(providerKey, cancellationToken);
  }

  public override async Task&lt;T&gt; FindByEmailAsync(string normalizedEmail, CancellationToken cancellationToken = new CancellationToken())
  {
    var user = await oktaClient.Users.ListUsers(filter: $"profile.login eq \"{normalizedEmail}\"").FirstOrDefaultAsync(cancellationToken);
    return MapUser(user);
  }

  private static T MapUser(IUser user)
  {
    if (user == null)
    {
      return null;
    }
    return new T
    {
      Id = user.Id,
      PhoneNumber = user.Profile.PrimaryPhone,
      UserName = user.Profile.Login,
      NormalizedUserName = user.Profile.Login,
      Email = user.Profile.Email,
      NormalizedEmail = user.Profile.Email,
    };
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>OktaUserStore</code> class derives from the existing <code>UserStore</code> class used by ASP.NET Core Identity, overrides existing methods, and uses <code>OktaClient</code> from the Okta SDK to store users in Okta. The built-in ASP.NET Core dependency injection will inject the current <code>IConfiguration</code> object that will read configuration values from the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>OktaUserManager</code> derives from the built-in <code>UserManager</code> class and overrides the <code>CreateAsync</code> method to create a user in Okta and set the user’s password.</p>

<p>Finally, open the <code>Startup</code> class to plug these classes instead of the built-in ones. Add <code>AddDbContext&lt;DbContext, ApplicationDbContext&gt;()</code> after the call to <code>AddDbContext</code> and add <code>AddUserManager&lt;OktaUserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt;&gt;().AddUserStore&lt;OktaUserStore&lt;IdentityUser&gt;&gt;()</code> after the call to <code>AddEntityFrameworkStores</code>:</p>

   <code>services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;
    options.UseSqlServer(
        Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")))
    .AddDbContext&lt;DbContext, ApplicationDbContext&gt;();

services.AddDefaultIdentity&lt;IdentityUser&gt;(options =&gt; options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = false)
    .AddEntityFrameworkStores&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;()
    .AddUserManager&lt;OktaUserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt;&gt;().AddUserStore&lt;OktaUserStore&lt;IdentityUser&gt;&gt;();
</code>   

<p>As a result of this, all our users and their PII will be stored in Okta instead of the SQL Server database. The only remaining thing is to configure the web app so that it uses Okta for login too.</p>

 Configure Okta Middleware 

<p>You can use the official <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Okta.AspNetCore">Okta OIDC integration for .NET Core</a>, but for this sample, I chose Martin Costello’s <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Okta">NuGet package</a> for configuration. Feel free to use whatever library you like for handling an Open ID Connect / OAuth provider in your .NET Core application.</p>

<p>First, run the following command in terminal to install <code>AspNet.Security.OAuth.Okta</code> package:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package AspNet.Security.OAuth.Okta
</code>   

<p>Go the <code>Startup</code> class and add this code in <code>ConfigureServices</code> before <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>:</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication().AddOkta(options =&gt;
{
  options.Domain = Configuration["Okta:Domain"];
  options.ClientId = Configuration["Okta:ClientId"];
  options.ClientSecret = Configuration["Okta:ClientSecret"];
});
</code>   

<p>You have now configured the app to use the Okta Sign-In widget. Before running the app let’s get rid of the <code>Use a local account to log in.</code> section from the login page.</p>

<p>In Visual Studio, right-click on the project, click Add, click New Scaffolded Item…, click Identity on the left side of the window and select Identity again. In the new window check Account\Login, select ApplicationDbContext (ExpenseTracker.Data) in Data context class (even though you aren’t using it any more) and click Add:</p>

<p></p>

<p>After code generation is complete, open the <code>Login.cshtml</code> file from the <code>Areas\Identity\Pages\Account</code> folder and delete the first <code>div</code> with <code>col-md-4</code> class. Also, replace <code>&lt;h4&gt;Use another service to log in.&lt;/h4&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;h4&gt;Use Okta to log in.&lt;/h4&gt;</code></p>

<p>Finally, you are ready to run the app! Run the app, click Register, and create a new user account. If you now go to your Okta Developer Console and click Users, you will see the new user account that you just created:</p>

<p></p>

<p>To test the login flow, click the Logout button in the web app then click Login. Click the Okta button and you will be redirected to the Okta’s Single Sign-On page for authentication. Once you log in, you will be redirected back to the app and you will be logged in with your Okta account.</p>

<p>That’s it! We now have a web app that uses Okta to securely store users and their personally identifiable information and Entity Framework Core for other data.</p>

   New CA SiteMinder Plug-Ins Enable Coexistence and Just-In-Time User Migration Between SiteMinder and ForgeRock 

 The Agonizing Decision to Modernize or Stay Put 

<p>Whether it’s to adapt the realities of a digital transformation program, addressing problems with scaling to provide access to new apps and services, managing the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT), or the handling of challenges associated with a growing number of CIAM (customer IAM) and workforce users due to COVID-19, many organizations are currently exploring the options to update or “modernize” their existing legacy identity and access (IAM) systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What we now refer to as “legacy” IAM systems are, in fact, platforms developed 10 to 15 years ago, back when most applications were on-premises and built on a client-server model. Fast forward to today, and these systems are struggling to keep up with cloud-first enterprise application needs. Support options are dwindling because vendors and developers are not keeping pace to support the latest feature sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Legacy IAM systems are functionally at their end-of-life. While they may continue to crank along and seem to perform the old workhorse identity functions, they are unable to meet new business needs. For example, updates on these legacy systems are expensive and time-consuming, and stability challenges can arise as more identities and attributes are added. Integrating new apps is cumbersome. As many of these legacy solutions live on premises, the timeframe for new apps to “go live” is often measured in months, if not years. This is not exactly what you would call “agile IT.”</p>

<p>Modern identity platforms in contrast, are built to truly enable digital transformation, operate at IoT scale, provide continuous security, support cloud and hybrid deployments, seamlessly integrate new applications, and support security models like Zero Trust and the Gartner CARTA (Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment) model. They are continuously adding new features and staying on the cutting edge of the market to keep organizations at a competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>

 Not a “Rip and Replace” Decision 

<p>But why might now be a good time to consider making this move? Well, for starters, everything is going digital, and your users and customers are expecting an optimized, online digital channel experience. Access problems, slow app performance due to identity-related issues, and poor authentication experiences will send them looking for workarounds--which your competitors are more than happy to provide.</p>

<p>But just as importantly, the decision to migrate at this time isn’t a binary one. As “rip and replace” is an option for the few, what is needed is a more seamless, step-by-step approach that allows you to go at your own pace, migrate the apps you need to migrate, and achieve a smooth transition to a modern IAM solution with a committed innovator in this space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock and our partners are here to help. We have assisted countless organizations on the journey from legacy to modern. We stand ready to do the same for your organization, no matter how difficult the challenge or how complex your IAM system may be. We have built a robust set of tools, guides, and documentation to help you make the transition to modern IAM. And it’s all available to you for free.&nbsp;</p>

 Making It Easy: New CA SiteMinder Plug-Ins from ForgeRock 

<p>ForgeRock is excited to announce the latest of these tools – a new set of Open Source <a href="https://github.com/ForgeRock/modernize-accelerators/tree/master/forgerock-am-siteminder-migration-sso-jit">CA SiteMinder Plug-Ins</a> joining the existing <a href="https://github.com/ForgeRock/modernize-accelerators">Oracle Plug Ins</a> as part of its portfolio of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-simplifies-process-companies-migrate-legacy-products-modern">Modernize IAM Accelerators</a>. The CA SiteMinder Plug-Ins enable coexistence and just-in-time user migration between SiteMinder and ForgeRock, so you can migrate at your own pace. For instance, you can choose to migrate 10 apps per week, one app per month, or whatever your organization may call for. ForgeRock Accelerators enable this migration to occur without any disruption to your customers or employees. It’s all done in a totally transparent manner. One of the benefits of this approach is that you can make immediate use of the new capabilities of the ForgeRock platform – &nbsp;like Intelligent Access, self-service trees, and passwordless authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, the new SiteMinder Plug-Ins for the Modernize IAM Accelerators can help in the following areas:</p>

  Authenticate in SiteMinder and single sign-on (SSO) to ForgeRock 
	 Authenticate in ForgeRock and SSO to SiteMinder 
	 SSO to legacy apps integrated via CA agents 
	 Migration of user profiles 
	 Secure migration of user passwords 
	 Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning&nbsp; 
	 Modular and extensible for easier integration into current environments 
	 Open source so it relies on industry standard protocols and libraries 
 <p>In the end the SiteMinder Plug-Ins are designed to help make migration seamless and invisible to the user, while having a significant impact in time to value around the design and build of coexistence and user migration strategies.&nbsp;</p>

With President Trump giving his blessing to the TikTok/Oracle deal and his WeChat ban running into some legal challenges, Ray Dalio has published a timely post on China, his latest in his Big Cycles&nbsp;series.   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chapter-6-big-cycle-china-its-currency-ray-dalio/">Chapter 6: The Big Cycle of China and Its&nbsp;Currency</a>  Photo: Web&nbsp;Summit<p>We won’t dive too deep into this one, but he provides a neat overview on how the Chinese historically think and operate by drilling down on its core philosophies:</p><blockquote>The Chinese culture developed as an extension of the experiences the Chinese had and the lessons they learned over the millennia. They were set out in philosophies about how things work and what ways work best in dealing with these realities. These philosophies made clear how people should be with each other, how political decision making should be done, and how the economic system should work. In the Western world the dominant philosophies are Judeo-Christian, democratic, and capitalist/socialist. Each person pretty much chooses from these to come up with the mix that suits them. In China, the main ones were Confucian, Taoist, and Legalist until the early 20th century when Marxism and capitalism entered the mix. The most desired mix to follow has historically been the emperor’s most desired mix. Emperors typically study Chinese history to see how these have worked and come up with their own preferences, put them into practice, learn, and adapt. If the mix works, the dynasty survives and prospers (in their parlance it has the “Mandate of Heaven”). If it doesn’t, it fails and is replaced by another dynasty. This process has gone on from before history was recorded and will go on as long as there are people who have to decide how to collectively do&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>While I can’t do these philosophies justice in a couple of sentences each without digressing too deeply (though I will go into them more deeply in Part 2), here is the best I can&nbsp;do:</blockquote>  Confucianism seeks to bring about harmony by having people know their roles in the hierarchy and know how to play them well starting from within the family (between the husband and the wife, the father and the son, the older sibling and the younger sibling, etc.) and extending up to the ruler and their subjects, with them bound together by benevolence and obedience. Each person respects and obeys those above them, who are both benevolent and impose standards of behavior on them. All people are expected to be kind, honest, and fair. Confucianism values harmony, broad-based education, and meritocracy.  Legalism favors conquest and unification of “all under heaven” as soon as possible by an autocratic leader. It believes that the world is a “kill or be killed” jungle in which the strength of the emperor’s central government and strict obedience to it must exist without much benevolence given to the people by the emperor/government. The Western equivalent is&nbsp;fascism.  Taoism teaches that the laws of nature and living in harmony with them are of paramount importance. Taoists believe that all of nature is composed of opposites and that harmony comes from balancing them well — yin and yang. This plays an important role in how the Chinese seek the balance of opposites.  <p>And how China’s culture fundamentally differs from the&nbsp;U.S.:</p><blockquote>All of these Chinese systems from the beginning of recorded history were hierarchical and non-egalitarian. I was told by one of the most senior Chinese leaders, who is also a highly informed historian and an extremely practical top policy maker, that the core difference between Americans and the Chinese is that Americans put the individual above all else and the Chinese put the family and the collective above all else. He explained that Chinese leaders seek to run the country the way they think parents should run the family — from the top down, maintaining high standards of behavior, putting the collective interest ahead of any individual interest, with each person knowing their place and having filial respect for those in the hierarchy so that the system works in an orderly way. He explained that the word “country” consists of two characters, “state” and “family,” which represents how the leaders view their roles in looking after their state/family — like strict parents. So one might say that the Chinese government is run from the top down (like a family) and optimizes for the collective while the American approach is run from the bottom up (e.g., democracy) and optimizes for the individual. (These differences of approach can lead to policies that those on the opposite side find objectionable, which I will explore in more detail in the next chapter.)</blockquote><p>These are fundamental differences that are hard to reconcile. Extrapolating this framework to the current ongoing conflicts around the internet and platforms makes you think that existing divisions will only deepen without some sort of new approach.</p> 2. And so you have&nbsp;this: <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-china-d42ab331-0cb3-4d2a-9b36-bce6e6610df7.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>A group of researchers from Europe, the U.S. and Japan are proposing a “tech alliance” of democratic countries in response to the Chinese government’s use of technology standards and its tech sector as instruments of state power abroad, according to a version of the proposal viewed by&nbsp;Axios.</blockquote><blockquote>The proposal, called “Common Code: An Alliance Framework for Democratic Technology Policy” to be published next month, recommends that founding members of the new tech alliance include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the U.S., as well as the European&nbsp;Union.</blockquote><blockquote>What they’re saying: “The status quo of uncoordinated and reactive technology policymaking for the major democratic technology powers in Asia, Europe and North America means growing risk of ceding their technological leadership,” the authors&nbsp;write.</blockquote> 3. All of this of course coincides with the ongoing shift to digital as a result of the pandemic. <p>And there’s plenty to figure out on that front as well — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-da0f7769-d5e3-4a59-810d-3525a43b4e63.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The shift to online schooling is running roughshod over children’s privacy rules and rights and creating new inequalities, experts tell Ashley&nbsp;Gold.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: Minors are the only group that enjoys federal online privacy protections in the U.S., but that’s not enough to protect their privacy rights as school districts and teachers scramble to move all classwork to the internet amid the pandemic.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: These rules aren’t just technicalities. If companies don’t maintain rigorous data security and privacy practices, children’s personal information, photos and video could end up in the wrong&nbsp;hands.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: “We’re trying to take brick-and-mortar school and shove it onto the internet, and the two things just aren’t compatible,” Karen Richardson, executive director for the Virginia Society for Technology in Education, told&nbsp;Axios.</blockquote> 4.

The solution can help travelers keep their identity and health information private, while allowing organizations to create safe spaces on airplanes, in hotels, and at large gatherings. It is built to comply with international GDPR and CCPA and other data privacy regulations.</p>



<p>For travelers, providing health status verification to gatekeepers is as easy as getting a vaccine from a qualified partner and then setting up Health Key by Civic in our Civic Wallet app. When a user signs up, they are authenticated as a real person, using both AI and blockchain-based technology. Civic does not take custody of personal data or medical records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For businesses, Health Key by Civic streamlines the management of entry points. This is critical because there are complicated logistics that the industry will need to navigate. First, there are many vaccines currently undergoing testing with varying efficacy rates. Second, there are <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/24-08-2020-172-countries-and-multiple-candidate-vaccines-engaged-in-covid-19-vaccine-global-access-facility">172 economies</a> collaborating on distribution. This means that countries and organizations will need to confirm that an individual has received a vaccine, whether the vaccine received is effective, and which local entry point regulations must be followed around the world. It’s a problem that may be solved with thoughtful technology.</p>



<p>While we’ve been working hard to provide the right kind of technology solutions, we also know that collaboration on health status verification is essential. Civic partnered with <a href="https://www.circlemedical.com/">Circle Medical</a> to supply testing for interested San Francisco Bay Area companies. Additional regional testing partners will be coming online to support customers in other locales. Together, we seek to give individuals control over their own credentials and facilitate economic rebuilding.</p>



<p>And, along with collaborating in the medical and international communities, Civic has been making progress on other fronts. Recently, we’ve been <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004">working with California lawmakers</a> on a bill that will provide privacy-oriented guidelines for proof-of-health technology.</p>



<p>To learn more about proof-of-health and the travel industry, we invite you to watch the UNWTO forum and <a href="https://youtu.be/U4TnqeG_F5g?t=5136">check out Health Key by Civic</a>.</p>

   For today’s companies, IT service management is more than IT support. ITSM is about working behind the scenes to help employees to do the work that drives your business – providing a one-stop shop for service needs, upgrades, improvements, and asset management.

  <p>For today’s companies, IT service management is more than IT support. <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/itsm.html">ITSM is about working behind the scenes</a> to help employees to do the work that drives your business – providing a one-stop shop for service needs, upgrades, improvements, and asset management.</p>
<p>If IGA doesn’t play a critical role in your ITSM strategy, it should. We frequently hear from customers who are looking to better align IGA and ITSM, and our conversations with the analyst firm KuppingerCole often focus on this topic as well.</p>
<p>Simply put, it just makes sense to marry IGA and ITSM. There’s a relationship between every service that an employee can access and the role of that employee within your organization. Sometimes it’s a simple matter of convenience, such as automatically granting new hires in Sales access to the sales software. Sometimes it’s a matter of security and risk management, so employees with privileged accounts can safely view mission-critical data when they aren’t on the physical network.</p>
<p>On Oct. 1, I’ll be delivering a keynote at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/iga-servicenow">KuppingerCole IGA Solutions for ServiceNow Infrastructures virtual event</a> focused on the alignment of ITSM and IGA. <a href="https://clearskye.com/">At Clear Skye</a>, we’re well positioned to talk about this, since we’re an IGA solution built on top of the ServiceNow platform – running natively without the need for custom integrations. Here’s a look at five key ways your company performs better when IGA and ITSM are able to work hand in hand.</p>
<p>Read Martin Kuppinger's Executive View |&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.clearskye.com/kuppingercole">Clear Skye IGA: IGA on the ServiceNow NOW Platform</a><a href="https://identity.clearskye.com/kuppingercole"></a></p>
<p>Self-Service Requests. It’s one thing to automate service requests such as account or group access. Why not take that to the next level and apply logic to the request based on a user’s role? Say a VP of Operations in the Dallas office requests permission to join one Active Directory group. There are likely other groups for Operations personnel, VPs, and the Dallas office that she should also join – as well as legacy Active Directory groups that she should be steered away from. The same is often true for many other types of requests. If an employee wants access to the travel booking software, for example, he probably wants access to the expense reporting tool, too. Identifying and taking action on similar requests simultaneously will save time for users and ITSM alike. As an added bonus, your end-users will be using an interface that they already feel comfortable with: ServiceNow. That means increased productivity and faster time to value.</p>
<p>Separation of Duties. If a software engineer based in Asia is logging onto the network in the middle of the night to access a dev server, that’s not unusual. If a VP of Accounting is logging on from New York at 3 a.m. to access financial software, well, that’s a problem. Restricting access to certain systems – by requiring higher-up approval or denying access outright – can prevent activity both nefarious and accidental (such as an HR rep accidentally attaching the salary spreadsheet to a company-wide email). You could also take this level of access a step further – and protect valuable assets to boot – by restricting access to certain systems unless a user has completed security training, installed required patches, or updated potentially vulnerable systems, all by matching their privileges to the systems they have access to and the level of security those systems require. The ServiceNow Common Services Data Model (CSDM) gives you visibility and alignment in data value, utilization, hygiene, compliance, governance, risk and security.</p>
<p>Incident Management. Responding to open tickets is often a matter of hunting for valuable information such as what permissions a user has, what software versions a user is running, or whether that security training was completed. When you bring together ITSM and IGA, the analyst working on a ticket can pull up this information right away and solve the problem – along with identifying other issues that a user may need to address, such as expiring credentials. For organizations with thousands of employees, this improved efficiency can quickly save a full FTE on the Help Desk.</p>
<p>Change Management. Knowing the roles and privileges of all end users who will be impacted by a software upgrade or hardware replacement helps organization manage risk, plan backup support, schedule outages, and identify vulnerabilities. This has the clear benefit of minimizing the disruption to clinical business services. It also provides predictive and retrospective insight into which changes can be treated as low-risk repeatable actions and which changes require more extensive preparation, as well as knowledge of which roles are most likely to request which changes. Instead of being a hassle, change management can become an efficient and differentiating process for your organization.</p>
<p>Mobility. Employees who respond to incidents or manage deliveries on a large campus rarely have a physical office, so mobile apps are critical for their fay-to-day role. They’ve also become a lifeline for remote employees who are juggling school and family care and need the flexibility of mobile solutions. Marrying IGA and ITSM on the Now Platform is more than just being able to offer SSO for multiple mobile solutions – it’s giving employees a single point of entry for those solutions, one that’s maintained by a trusted partner in ServiceNow.</p>
 Looking to the Future 
<p>The ultimate goal of marrying IGA and ITSM is taking a more holistic approach to enabling your staff / people / teams. Instead of the stimulus-and-response process of opening and closing tickets to fix a single issue, it’s being able to draw on a wealth of data that’s no longer sitting in silos to automate when possible and evaluate risk when necessary – whether it’s risk from outdated security settings, risk from the combination of a user’s privileges, or a bit of both. This enables an organization to manage the present and plan the future, whether it’s updating critical systems, culling obsolete Active Directory groups, or updating admin privileges.</p>
<p>Few organizations have truly reached this point, however. Instead of breaking down silos and leveraging single control plans and common interfaces, the market has primarily focused on integrating and synchronizing data and workflows across two or more disparate systems. This only adds complexity – which is the last thing ITSM needs.</p>
<p>At Clear Skye, we believe there’s a better way. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/iga-servicenow">Register to join our keynote discussion on Oct</a>. 1 and learn more about our vision to bring IGA and ITSM together natively on the Now Platform.</p>

  <p>Cloud migrations picked up at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak as organizations shifted to support remote work. However, some workloads had to remain on-premises.</p>
<p>Ahead of the virtual 2020 Gartner IT Infrastructure, Operations &amp; Cloud Strategies Conference —&nbsp; 7 to 10 December 2020 in the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/infrastructure-operations-cloud-us">Americas</a> and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/infrastructure-operations-cloud-uk">EMEA</a> —&nbsp; Smarter With Gartner asked <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/4800">David Cappuccio</a>, Conference Chair and Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, for insight on how traditional infrastructure and operations (I&amp;O) teams are adapting to the new normal and how I&amp;O leaders can tackle their most imminent challenges.</p>
 What is the difference between cloud infrastructure and data centers? 
<p>From an IT planner perspective, the primary difference between cloud and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/data-center">data center</a> infrastructures revolves around how you deliver a given workload to your business. A simplified view is that data centers own the physical infrastructure and deliver business value via that infrastructure.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some organizations use a cloud infrastructure to deliver that workload, using the cloud provider’s physical infrastructure and paying for consumption of resources, rather than the physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 With the rise of cloud computing, how are traditional enterprise data centers adapting and evolving? 
<p>Most data centers owners have realized that while <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> may not be the answer to all of their problems, it still needs to be a part of every application or workload delivery conversation. In some cases, cloud computing could be an ideal solution; for instance, when high availability websites or applications require rapid scale (up or down).</p>
<p>In other cases, on-premises computing may be the best solution; for example, when data location is critical or latency-sensitive applications are involved. The end result is <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-steps-to-adapt-io-to-the-hybrid-world/">a hybrid world</a> where the focus is to deploy workloads from the best location to solve business problems.</p>
 What are the benefits of cloud computing compared with data centers? 
<p>Gartner clients consistently tell us that the real benefits of cloud computing are enterprise agility —or developing and deploying workloads quickly — and the ability to move toward a consumption-based solution where heavy investment in IT infrastructure is no longer required. However, migrating to the cloud is not simple, as there is a significant impact on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-must-have-competencies-for-infrastructure-operations-leaders/">I&amp;O skills</a>, tools, governance, process and cost management, to name a few.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For data centers themselves, the core benefits are those that have been around for years, namely total control of both the facility and IT computing environments. For mission-critical applications, especially those with tight audit or compliance requirements, or those requiring specialty hardware/software, on-premises data centers will remain viable solutions.</p>

 Gartner says that modern “infrastructures are everywhere.” What does that mean? 
<p>For the past decade, the number of options that IT and the business have had for deploying computing workloads has continued to grow, whether it’s on-premises, colocation, hosting, cloud computing (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas">IaaS</a>, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/platform-as-a-service-paas">PaaS</a>, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/software-as-a-service-saas">SaaS</a>) or edge computing. In most enterprises, the answer for where to deploy workloads is “all of the above,” which means that the infrastructure for IT services is no longer just in the data center, but essentially everywhere. And yet, even though it’s out of sight, IT is still responsible for that service.</p>
<p>Gartner predicts that by 2025, 85% of infrastructure strategies will integrate on-premises, colocation, cloud and edge delivery options, compared with 20% in 2020.</p>

<p>Prepare I&amp;O to Enable the Everywhere Enterprise, a session with Roger Williams, VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
 Although migrations to the cloud picked up during COVID-19, some workloads had to remain on-premises. How can I&amp;O leaders improve enterprise data center delivery while reducing costs? 
<p>The interest in cloud migrations has increased due to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-cloud-providers-to-support-customers-through-covid-19/">COVID-19,</a> but the focus was often driven by data center teams rethinking their delivery models around the idea of what services must remain on-premises versus which ones could be safely migrated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Once enterprises completed such analysis, the focus shifted to optimizing costs and increasing efficiencies for on-premises delivery of the remaining workloads. The options to do so were via hyperconverged solutions, increased floor and rack densities, increased automation and consolidation of redundant systems or offerings.&nbsp;</p>

 What are the biggest challenges facing I&amp;O leaders today? 
<p>IT leaders today are dealing with competing objectives: To keep the lights on — running mission-critical applications while protecting the business from outages — and to enable the business to react to market changes quickly and adopt new technologies or services when they need them (not necessarily when IT is ready or has the cash to spend on them).</p>
<p>Essentially, I&amp;O needs to develop a toolbox of choices that enable the rapid development and deployment of services, but at the same time set the guide rails for the infrastructure delivery model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this year's IT Infrastructure, Operations &amp; Cloud Strategies Conference, my colleagues and I will discuss how I&amp;O leaders must adapt and innovate IT to deliver competitive advantage and keep core systems operational and resilient in a world that is full of disruptions, like COVID-19.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Hi, my name is Joël Franusic and I’m happy to announce that I am,
once again, a developer advocate at Okta, focusing on the Python and Go communities.</p>

<p>(Why do I say “once again”? Because six years ago, I started my Okta career as a
developer advocate but over the course of time I worked in a series
of other roles including: “Software Engineer”, “Technical Marketing
Manager”, and “Product Marketing Manager”)</p>

<p>This blog post has two parts:</p>

 
   An introduction to myself and my personal mission statement 
   An example of how to run Python from inside of a web browser - which is an example of how I’m putting my personal mission statement into action 
 

 Introducing myself 

<p>The best way that I can think of to introduce myself is by sharing
my “personal mission statement”.  Before I do that, though, 
I want to give some background on why I have
one in the first place.</p>

<p>It’s common for corporations to have a “mission statement” — a short
statement on what they view as their goals.</p>

<p>People often mock corporate mission statements, and for
good reason. Mission statements are frequently long, vague, and uninspiring.
But not always! Sometimes a company will create a mission statement that
is truly great: short, inspiring and so lofty it almost seems unachievable.</p>

<p>For example. Microsoft’s statement once was: “A computer on every desk and in every home.”
This mission statement probably seemed unachievable
when it was first announced by Bill Gates in 1980. Forty years later, it’s
clear that this mission statement wasn’t grand enough!</p>

<p>One day, as I was reflecting on mission statements that sound impossible, I
started brainstorming joke statements to share with a friend. In the process, I stumbled across a statement that I couldn’t
stop thinking about:</p>

<p>“Make all software, from all time, instantly available for use by any
programmer” — this is now what I consider my personal mission statement to be.</p>

 My personal mission statement: 

<p>There are a lot of ways to interpret this mission
statement-which I like. I want this mission statement to be
flexible and able to grow and change over time.
That said, let me break down how I’m thinking about it right now:</p>

<p>Let’s start with the first part of the mission statement: “Make all software,
from all time”. My thinking here is that, given enough time, software can be refined to the point that it’s nearly perfect, or at least its inadequacies are well
understood. When software reaches this level of perfection, it
doesn’t really make sense to re-write it. So, why should we have to?
It should be easy to use code from any programming language in
any other programming language. Most programming languages have
limited support for this type of functionality, though it usually
involves bindings into code written in C. Why should it end there? I want to be able to use, Haskell code from Python, Java from Lua, or
Fortran from Go, and so on.</p>

<p>Now, for the next part of the mission statement: “instantly available”. I  believe that a programmer’s code should go into production as soon as they lift their finger off the keyboard. They shouldn’t have
to wait for a compile to finish, for tests to pass, or for an
interpreter to reload their code. All of those things, especially
testing, are important, but they should happen automatically and
finish within milliseconds.</p>

<p>Now for the last part of the mission statement: “for use by any programmer”.
My opinion is that any programmer should be able to leverage code written by
another programmer, no matter what the skill level or programming language
either programmer has. This distinction is important to me because nearly
everything I’ve described above is already possible, but only for very
experienced programmers. As William Gibson famously said, “The future is
already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.”</p>

 That all sounds great, but what are you going to do about it? 

<p>Even if you agree that the things I want to do are worthwhile, it’s
still fair to ask what that means in concrete terms.</p>

<p>One of things that I’m passionate about is making software
development more “instantly available”. There are many problems that need solving in this
area. For example, much of software development today involves unnecessary waiting. As
programmers, we spend a lot of time waiting for software to install, tests to
pass, a deploy to finish-the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be this way, though. We can and should make better tools for
ourselves and each other.</p>

<p>One example of something I’ve made is a page that lets
you <a href="https://developer.okta.com/live-widget/">edit the code of the Okta Sign-In Widget with instant feedback, from inside
your web browser</a>. However, it uses JavaScript and, since I’m focusing
on Python and Go, I wanted to make an example of running Python from inside of
the browser. So, I wrote a game for you to play which I have included below:</p>

 Running Python in a Web Browser 

<p>This is a simple game where the goal is to write a Python function (<code>answer()</code>) that takes
three numbers of a sequence as input (we label these <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>) and
returns the next number in that sequence.</p>

<p>For example, let’s imagine that the <code>answer(a, b, c)</code> function is given part of this
integer sequence as input:</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://dilbert.com/strip/2001-10-25">
    
  </a>      
</p>

<p>In this case, <code>answer()</code> would be called with the first three numbers of the sequence, like so:
<code>answer(9, 9, 9)</code>. In this case, the correct answer would be <code>9</code> and the code
to “solve” this sequence might look something like this:</p>

   <code>def answer(a, b, c):
    return 9
</code>   

<p>To win this game, you have to write a function that will be able to give
the correct answer for all of the sequences that show up on the
checklist below. The checklist will update as you solve for each sequence.
Update the Python code below to start playing!</p>

<p>Sequence checklist:</p>

 
   
   
   
    You did it!
    Reward yourself by <a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome">learning more about The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> ®
    and why Donald Knuth says you can use it to
    <a href="https://youtu.be/BxQw4CdxLr8?t=1187">"compute your way into the literature"</a>.
   
  def answer(a, b, c):
    return True

play(answer)
 


<p>Edit the code above to play. No need to press a “save” button or anything. Your code will run once you’ve
stopped typing for a bit.</p>

 “That’s interesting, I guess. Why should I care?” 

<p>Perhaps you played the game, perhaps you didn’t. But in either case, the reason
I included this game in this blog post might not be apparent. I
did so to show that, not only is it fairly easy to run
a non-JavaScript interpreter in the browser, it can be a lot of fun when you do.</p>

<p>I wanted to make something that:</p>

 
   Involves writing some mildly-complex code, something just a little bit more complicated than “hello world”. 
   Runs as soon as you stop typing. 
   Teaches the player something new. 
   Shows that it’s fairly easy, and fun, to run Python directly from a browser. 
 

<p>If you want to see how all of this works, just use the “View Source”
functionality of your browser. The entire game is written in Python and I plan
on writing an in-depth explanation of the code behind this game in a subsequent
post.</p>

 That’s all for now 

<p>In closing, I hope you found my “personal mission statement” to be as thought
provoking as I do and I hope that you had as much fun playing
my little game as I did making it.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear from you in the comments below, or <a href="https://twitter.com/jf">on Twitter</a>.</p>

  <p>At ForgeRock, we like partnerships that deliver real business and technical value to our customers and prospects. Today’s <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-joins-microsoft-intelligent-security-association">announcement</a> that we’ve joined the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) is a text-book example of two organizations coming together to provide even greater value for its shared customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re proud to earn a spot in the MISA ecosystem. Membership means an organization has met a high bar for delivering an integration with Microsoft Cloud Security services that will make a meaningful difference for customers. In our case, the new integrations we’ve delivered will help reduce risk and strengthen compliance for joint customers using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Azure Sentinel.&nbsp;</p>

 Microsoft Graph Integrations 

<p>We approached the ForgeRock integrations in a way that would allow customers to benefit from Microsoft Cloud Security’s vast threat intelligence data to deliver a multi-layered risk mitigation strategy throughout a user's authentication and authorization journey. We did this by working with Microsoft to help strengthen the security of the user, the device they are on, and understand the user’s activities. This required three integrations with three different services, all enabled by ForgeRock’s integrations with the Microsoft Graph.</p>

<p>To understand the risk associated with a user we can check the posture of that user by leveraging a component of Azure Active Directory (AAD) called Confirm Compromise (a feature of their <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection">Azure Active Directory Identity Protection</a>). We built an <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7/authentication-guide/about-authentication-trees.html">authentication node</a> for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a> that reaches out to the Microsoft Security Graph. This node&nbsp; checks whether or not AAD thinks a particular user is risky. Depending on the risk level reported by Microsoft Identity Protection, ForgeRock Intelligent Access can adjust the user’s journey to require additional step-up authentication or deny the user access altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next layer in this risk mitigation strategy is to understand the security of the device the user has. To understand the user’s “device posture”, we once again built a ForgeRock authentication node that utilizes the Microsoft Graph to query Microsoft’s Unified Endpoint Management solution, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-endpoint-manager">Microsoft Endpoint Manager.</a> We do this in order to understand whether or not the end user’s device satisfies a Compliance Policy. These organizationally defined policies may require a device to not be jail-broken, or that a machine is running the latest OS, before it is allowed to access a protected resource. Once ForgeRock Intelligent Access understands this device context from Microsoft Endpoint Manager, it can use it to make runtime decisions about the user’s authentication and authorization journey.</p>

<p>The final component in our layered approach required integration with one of the Microsoft Cloud’s newest solutions <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/">Microsoft Azure Sentinel</a>. Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a cloud-based Security Information Event Management (SIEM) that leverages advanced machine learning capabilities. To integrate with Sentinel, ForgeRock used our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/common-services/common-audit">Common Audit Framework</a> (CAUD) which allows us to monitor user activity across our entire platform. This enables us to record any ForgeRock event, logging it to disk, relational databases, Splunk, or even syslog. We built a deep integration between CAUD and Azure Sentinel by leveraging a data format standard called Common Event Format (CEF). Since Microsoft has a number of pre-built visualizations, reports, dashboards and alerts that work out of the box on CEF data, our integration seamlessly leverages these powerful artifacts Microsoft has already built.</p>

<p>We believe these integrations are going to make a real impact in reducing risk for our joint customers and we look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>

<p>We believe the decentralized identity layer is finally mature enough to enable the next phase of development in DeFi. In an upcoming series of posts we will dive into the components that need to be built to enable unsecured DeFi lending, and lay out our vision for how to get there.</p><p>What has Bloom been up to?</p><p>For the last two and a half years, Bloom has been working towards the vision of a financial services ecosystem which is open and accessible to all individuals with any amount of inclusion in the traditional credit system.</p><p>In our original whitepaper, we outlined a multi-phase approach to achieve a decentralized credit system: First, we needed an identity layer that allowed individuals to receive, store, and share verified attributes about themselves. Next, we built a competitive marketplace to efficiently seek prices for identity verifications. Finally, with the first two pieces in place, we could build a system to aggregate data and build open risk assessment systems.</p><p>In April 2018, we built a <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/introducing-bloom-payment-channels-enabled-by-ethereum-whisper/">discovery marketplace</a> based on the BLT token, using a combination of smart contracts and Ethereum Whisper, which enabled vendors and individuals to find each other, in order to facilitate payment for identity verification related work. Shortly thereafter, we engaged in negotiations with data vendors to get the right data into the Bloom ecosystem and built connectors that enabled users to pull in data about their phone numbers, email addresses, watch-list screens, social media, identity documents, income &amp; assets.</p><p>First Key Lesson: Ecosystem Data</p><p>Attaining vendor participation in Bloom’s marketplace presented challenges. On the one hand, most vendors require custom enterprise contracts with monthly or yearly minimums. On the other hand, the scalable approach to these marketplaces requires transaction-based pricing. The vendors simply didn't understand the potential in a decentralized data marketplace. So, we got to work on building the demand for that data, with the goal of re-introducing the marketplace at the right time.</p><p>Second Key Lesson: Built-In User Privacy</p><p>By the EthSanFrancisco Hackathon in Fall 2018, Bloom had a fully functional end-to-end flow - Users could sign up, generate a unique identifier, receive credentials, and share with any 3rd party that integrated Bloom’s free-to-use <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/share-kit">Bloom Share Kit</a>. The overwhelming number of project submissions (<a href="https://bloom.co/blog/built-on-bloom--lending-party-lets-anyone-get-a-decentralized-fiat-loan-with-bloom-protocol-and-/">Lending Party</a>, <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/built-on-bloom--how-sendput-makes-employee-expense-reimbursements-instant-with-bloom-protocol/">SendPut</a>, <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/built-on-bloom--blocusign-makes-digital-signatures-provable-and-secure-with-bloomid/">BlocuSign</a>) at that first hackathon led the Bloom team to expand Bloom’s vision of the identity layer.</p><p>Users wanted the ability to selectively disclose identity traits, share data without being tracked by an Ethereum address, and pull in traits we hadn't considered before. Our team responded to that need by building the <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/how-does-share-kit-work/">Selective Disclosure Merkle tree spec</a>.</p><p>Third Key Lesson: No Point in Doing This Alone</p><p>In February 2019, our team went to EthDenver to share the latest Share Kit improvements and review the next round of feedback and submissions from developers (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-mpOEjT9D0">Check out the workshop video here</a>). When we arrived, we learned the conference was using UPort decentralized identity wallets to register attendees for events. We each downloaded uPort, claimed a credential that verified our email addresses, and shared them by scanning a QR code. We realized that interoperability would have enabled us to register for the events using the Bloom app. Clearly, we needed to expand BloomID to be part of the wider decentralized identity community! This realization compelled the Bloom team to join the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> and start collaborating with the 100+ other companies working to make decentralized identity a reality.</p><p>How has Bloom decentralized the identity layer?</p><p>Since Bloom began, we have migrated the protocol to adopt the most open, interoperable, and extensible proposals from the community.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core/blob/master/contracts/AccountRegistryLogic.sol">BloomID</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> (Decentralized Identifier)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core/blob/master/contracts/AttestationLogic.sol">Bloom Attestations</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-vault">Bloom Vault</a> → <a href="https://digitalbazaar.github.io/encrypted-data-vaults/">Encrypted Data Vault</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">Secure Data Store</a> community  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/hellobloom.github.io/blob/master/attestation-data/Bloom-Merkle-Tree-22facf0b-bedb-4b45-bb7d-edcd57213eb0.md">Bloom Selective Disclosure Merkle Tree</a> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">Mattr BBS signatures</a> (among others)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core">Bloom Attestation Smart Contracts </a>→ <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-rl-2020">W3C RevocationList2020 spec</a> (among others)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/share-kit">Bloom Share Kit</a> →<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange"> Presentation Exchange Specification</a> &amp; <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API (CHAPI)</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/verify-kit#example">Bloom Share Kit Payload</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">Verifiable Presentations</a>  <p>More than 60 DID methods have been invented, none by Bloom. Bloom products have adopted the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/element">Element</a> specification which is supported by multiple companies and is based on a protocol called Sidetree, maintained by <a href="https://www.transmute.industries">Transmute</a> and Microsoft, among others.</p><p>Why do we think the identity layer is ready?</p><p>The decentralized identity space is rapidly maturing. Additionally, developer tooling is becoming more and more accessible. The following examples illustrate an industry shift to make decentralized identity significantly more approachable for companies</p>  <a href="https://didproject.azurewebsites.net/docs/overview.html">Tutorial from Microsoft on generating DIDs &amp; Verifiable Credentials using Azure</a>  <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/issue-basic">Mattr tutorial for issuing credentials</a>  <p>What is the role of the Bloom App?</p><p>Think of the Bloom App as your DeFi credit utility. We aim to provide users with the best on-ramp experience to DeFi with vetted service providers, and access to all the data you need to get started. We want to open up the world of DeFi savings &amp; lending products to traditional users. That's why in the app today, you'll find an experience that is familiar and close to many other free credit monitoring applications, with a live integration with TransUnion for credit scoring, and breach monitoring powered by Have I Been Pwned.</p><p>Why isn't there already an affiliate marketplace in the app?</p><p>Some users may remember we briefly had a BloomID based marketplace in the app, but restrictions from Apple forced us to move this online. We will be revamping our approach to this marketplace with instant onboarding opportunities for users, in a way that also allows us to stay within Apple's guidelines.</p><p>What do we need to make it happen?</p><p>We need to call on all of our early partnerships from the early days of crypto, as well as newer companies that are working towards the vision of accessible DeFi products for consumers like <a href="https://www.teller.finance">Teller</a>.</p><p>At the same time we have prepared ourselves for the next step</p><p>We have built the first specification &amp; reference implementation for a Verifiable Credential Aggregator (BloomIQ) that solves the issue of user controlled aggregation without self-censoring negative signals. In an upcoming series of DeFi related posts, we will expand on BloomIQ and how we plan to roll it as part of our journey to enabled unsecured DeFi loans and credit-based crypto on-ramps.</p>

  <p>Apple announced a Sign in with Apple service at its WWDC developer conference in June 2019. If you’re familiar with social login with Google or Facebook, it’s very similar. Most of these identity services use OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC), and Apple’s implementation is similar.</p>

<p>Today I’d like to show you how to develop a mobile application with Ionic, add OIDC authentication, retrieve the user’s information, and add social login (aka federated identity) with Apple and Google. I’ll even show you how to test it in a phone simulator, as well as on your device.</p>

 Create an Ionic App 

<p>To begin, you’ll need to install the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/">Ionic CLI</a>.</p>

   <code>npm i -g @ionic/cli@6.11.0
</code>   

<p>Then, use <code>ionic start</code> to create a new Angular app with tabs. You might notice this command also specifies Capacitor. Using Capacitor is the recommended way to run Ionic apps on mobile devices from 2020 onward.</p>

   <code>ionic start ionic-social tabs --type angular --capacitor
cd ionic-social
</code>   

<p>Run <code>ionic serve</code> and make sure you can see the app in your browser.</p>

<p></p>

 Add Authentication with OpenID Connect 

<p>The easiest way to add OIDC authentication to an Ionic app is with OktaDev Schematics. Before I show you how to do that, you’ll need to create an Okta developer account and register your app to get a client ID. Head on over to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">developer.okta.com/signup</a> if you’d like to do this in your browser.</p>

<p>If you prefer the command line, install the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>. Run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta Developer account or use <code>okta apps create</code>. If you use your browser, go to Applications &gt; Add Application.</p>

<p>On the Create New Application page, select Native. Name your app <code>Ionic Social</code>, and configure it as follows:</p>

 
   Login redirect URIs:
     
       <code>http://localhost:8100/callback</code> 
       <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/callback</code> (where <code>dev-133337.okta.com</code> is your Okta Org URL) 
     
   
   Logout redirect URIs:
     
       <code>http://localhost:8100/logout</code> 
       <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/logout</code> 
     
   
   Grant type allowed:
     
       Authorization Code 
       Refresh Token 
     
   
   Click Done 
 

<p>If you’re using the command line, you’ll have to use your browser to adjust the redirect URIs. Your app’s settings should look similar to the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Run the following command to add a sign-in feature to your Ionic + Capacitor app.</p>

   <code>ng add @oktadev/schematics --platform=capacitor
</code>   

<p>Running this command will prompt you for an issuer and client ID. If you used your browser to create an app, the client ID is displayed on your screen. You can find the issuer in your Okta dashboard at API &gt; Authorization Servers. It usually looks something like <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>If you used the CLI, you should have this information in your terminal. You can run <code>okta apps</code> to see your apps and <code>okta apps config --app=&lt;appName&gt;</code> to get your app’s info.</p>

<p>This process will install several dependencies and a plethora of files to handle OIDC authentication.</p>

<p>Run <code>ionic serve</code> and open <code>http://localhost:8100</code> in a new incognito window.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Login to sign in to your Okta developer account.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll be redirected back to your app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Get User Details to fetch the user’s information using the following code in <code>src/app/tab1/tab1.page.ts</code>.</p>

   <code>public async getUserInfo(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
  this.userInfo = await this.authService.getUserInfo&lt;IUserInfo&gt;();
}
</code>   

<p>Your user information will be rendered in <code>src/app/tab1/tab1.page.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;ion-card *ngIf="userInfo"&gt;
  &lt;ion-card-header&gt;
    User Info
  &lt;/ion-card-header&gt;
  &lt;ion-card-content&gt;
    {{userInfo | json}}
  &lt;/ion-card-content&gt;
&lt;/ion-card&gt;
</code>   

<p>One of the neat things you can do with your Okta developer account is add additional identity providers. This means you can add Apple as an identity source and easily add Sign in with Apple to your Ionic app!</p>

 Configure Sign in with Apple 

<p>To begin, you must have an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple developer account</a>. You’ll need to create an App ID, a Services ID, and a private key.</p>

 Create an App ID on Apple 

<p>Log in to <a href="https://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a> and go to Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles. Select Identifiers on the left and click the blue + icon. Select App IDs and Continue. Select App and Continue. Enter a description and bundle ID. I used <code>Ionic Social</code> and <code>com.okta.developer.ionic-social</code>.</p>

<p>Scroll down and select Sign in with Apple, click Continue, and then Register.</p>

 Create a Services ID on Apple 

<p>To create a Services ID (with allowed redirect URIs), go to Identifiers &gt; blue + icon Services IDs &gt; Continue. I used <code>Okta</code> for the description and <code>com.okta.developer.ionic</code> for the identifier. Click Continue, then Register.</p>

<p>Select the identifier that you just created.</p>

<p>Select the Sign in with Apple checkbox, and then click Configure to define the domain your app is running on and the redirect URLs used during the OAuth flow.</p>

<p>Enter the domain name where your app runs in the Domains and Subdomains box (e.g., <code>dev-133337.okta.com</code>). In the Return URLs box, enter your Okta tenant’s <code>/authorize/callback</code> URL, for example <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback</code>.</p>

<p>Click Next, Done, Continue, and then Save.</p>

 Create a Private Key for Client Authentication 

<p>On the Certificates, Identifiers, &amp; Profiles page, select Keys, and then Create a key.</p>

<p>Give your key a name (e.g., <code>AppleLoginKey</code>), select Sign in with Apple, and click Configure.</p>

<p>Select your App ID from the Primary App ID drop-down box and click Save. Apple will generate a new private key.</p>

<p>Click Continue, Register, and then Download.</p>

<p>Click Done, and then on the Keys page, click the key that you just created and make a note of the Key ID. You need it in the next section.</p>

<p>Make a note of your Team ID in the upper-right corner of your Apple developer dashboard (just below your account name).</p>

<p>TIP: See Okta’s <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/apple/create-an-app-at-idp/">developer docs for Sign in with Apple</a> if these steps don’t work.</p>

 Add Apple as an Identity Provider in Okta 

<p>Open your Okta developer console in a new tab and navigate to Users &gt; Social &amp; Identity Providers &gt; Add Identity Provider &gt; Add Apple.</p>

 
   Name: <code>Apple</code> 
   Client ID: <code>com.okta.developer.ionic</code> (your Services ID from Apple) 
   Client Secret Signing Key: upload the <code>.p8</code> file you downloaded 
   Key ID and Team ID: available in your last tab 
   Scopes: defaults (<code>name</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>openid</code>) are fine 
 

<p>Click Add Identity Provider. Click the arrow next to your new IdP, and you’ll see its ID.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy this ID and open <code>src/app/auth/auth.service.ts</code> in a text editor. Add <code>auth_extras</code> as a property to <code>authConfig</code> and add your Apple IdP’s ID as an <code>idp</code> property.</p>

   <code>const authConfig: any = {
  ...
  usePkce: true,
  auth_extras: {
    idp: '&lt;your-apple-idp-id&gt;'
  }
};
</code>   

<p>Restart your Ionic app and open <code>http://localhost:8100</code> in a private window. Click Login 
and you’ll be redirected to Apple to sign in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in, and you should be redirected back to your app.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you receive an error about <code>Missing fields: 'firstName','lastName'</code>, you’ll need to remove the app from your Apple ID. On a Mac, go to System Preferences &gt; Apple ID &gt; Password &amp; Security &gt; Apps Using Your Apple ID &gt; Edit. Go to Ionic Social and click Stop Using Apple ID. This error happens because Apple sends the name only the very first time you log in.</p>

<p>Click Get User Details, and your info will be fetched from Apple via Okta.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s pretty cool that you can add Sign in with Apple via Okta, don’t you think?! 😀</p>

<p>But what if you want to allow people to sign up for an account and you want to manage your users? The good news is you can configure Okta as your main login screen with buttons to sign in with Apple, Google, and many other identity providers.</p>

<p>TIP: To see how to enable user registration, see <a>Tutorial: User Login and Registration in Ionic &gt; Add User Registration</a>.</p>

 What about Okta’s Angular SDK and Sign-In Widget? 

<p>Okta provides an <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/okta-angular">Angular SDK</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget">Sign-In Widget</a>. I’ve encountered quite a few developers that want to have an in-app login screen without popping a browser.</p>

<p>The Sign-In Widget seems like a good solution for this. However, in a Capacitor app, <code>capacitor://localhost</code> is sent as an <code>origin</code> header, and Okta only allows <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> as schemas. This means the CORS request for the <code>./well-known/openid-configuration</code> metadata fails.</p>

<p>I thought the <a href="https://github.com/capacitor-community/http">Capacitor Community’s HTTP module</a> would fix this, but <a href="https://github.com/capacitor-community/http/issues/45">it does not</a>. I’m currently trying to convince Okta to allow <code>capacitor://</code> as a schema for trusted origins.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can customize the Okta-hosted version of the Sign-In Widget. To do this, you need to create a custom domain.</p>

 Create a Custom Domain and TLS Certificate with Cloudflare 

<p>To use a custom domain with Okta, you need to have access to its DNS settings and create a TLS certificate.</p>

<p>Cloudflare makes this easy. <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up">Sign up for Cloudflare</a> if you don’t have an account.</p>

<p>Log in to Cloudflare and select +Add Site. It’s best if you point a whole domain at Cloudflare. For example, I used <code>mattraible.com</code>. The free plan is good enough for this tutorial.</p>

<p>After transferring your domain, you’ll need to create an origin CA certificate.</p>

 
   Click the SSL/TLS app 
   Click the Origin Server tab 
   Click Create Certificate to open the Origin Certificate Installation window 
   Select Let Cloudflare generate a private key and a CSR 
   Change Certificate Validity to 1 year (Okta will reject the certificates with a 15-year expiration) 
   Click Next 
 

<p>Copy the Origin Certificate to a <code>tls.cert</code> file on your hard drive. Copy the Private key to <code>private.key</code>.</p>

<p>In Okta, go to Customization &gt; Domain Name &gt; Edit &gt; Get Started. Enter a subdomain name (e.g., <code>id.mattraible.com</code>) and click Next. You’ll be prompted to verify domain ownership. Add the specified <code>TXT</code> record on Cloudflare via the DNS &gt; + Add record option.</p>

<p>Click Verify &gt; Next on Okta.</p>

<p>For the Certificate field, copy/paste the contents of <code>tls.cert</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a Mac, you can use <code>cat tls.cert | pbcopy</code> in a terminal to copy the file to your clipboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put the contents of <code>private.key</code> in the Private key box. Click Next.</p>

<p>You’ll be prompted to add a CNAME record. Add this to your Cloudflare DNS. Click Finish.</p>

<p>NOTE: When I first tried this, I found that my home network caches DNS entries, and I was unable to get to <code>id.mattraible.com</code> for days. However, if I connected with my phone, I was able to load it. I grabbed the IP address when I was connected to my phone and added an entry to my <code>hosts</code> file as a workaround.</p>

<p>Wait until <code>https://&lt;id.domain.name&gt;</code> resolves in your browser before continuing.</p>

 Configure a Custom Domain for Your Authorization Server 

<p>The OpenID Connect specification requires a <code>./well-known/openid-configuration</code> endpoint with metadata about your app’s endpoints. You should be able to see yours at:</p>

   <code>https://&lt;id.domain.name&gt;/oauth2/default/.well-known/openid-configuration
</code>   

<p>You might notice that it has your Okta <code>dev-*</code> domain, rather than your custom domain name.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You need to update your authorization server to use your custom domain to fix this. Log in to your Okta account and go to API &gt; Authorization Servers &gt; default &gt; Edit. Change the Issuer to use Custom URL.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Try <code>./well-known/openid-configuration</code> again; it should have your custom domain now.</p>

 Configure Apple to Allow Your Custom Domain 

<p>Since you’ve added a new domain, you’ve created another possible redirect URL. Log in to your <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple developer account</a> and go to the Service ID you created. Edit your service and configure Sign in with Apple. Add a new Website URL with your domain and authorize callback.</p>

 
   Domains: <code>&lt;id.domain.name&gt;</code> 
   Return URLs: <code>https://&lt;id.domain.name&gt;/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback</code> 
 

<p>You can see the values I used below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done, Continue, and Save.</p>

 Configure Ionic to use Your Custom Domain 

<p>Open <code>src/app/auth/auth.service.ts</code> in your Ionic app and change the configuration to use your custom domain. Remove <code>auth_extras</code> too.</p>

   <code>const issuer = 'https://&lt;id.domain.name&gt;/oauth2/default';
const authConfig: any = {
  identity_client: clientId,
  identity_server: issuer,
  redirect_url: redirectUri,
  end_session_redirect_url: logoutRedirectUri,
  scopes,
  usePkce: true
};
</code>   

<p>Now you can customize the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget.</p>

 Add Sign in with Apple to the Hosted Sign-In Widget 

<p>In Okta, go to Customization &gt; Sign-in Page. Make sure you’re using the latest version, then modify the HTML on the right. Find the line with <code>var config</code> and add the following after it, where <code>&lt;apple-idp-id&gt;</code> can be found at Users &gt; Social &amp; Identity Providers &gt; (&gt;) before Apple.</p>

   <code>config.idps = [
  {type: 'APPLE', id: '&lt;apple-idp-id&gt;'}
];
config.idpDisplay = "PRIMARY";
</code>   

<p>Scroll up and click Save and Publish.</p>

<p>Navigate to your custom <code>id.domain.name</code>, and you should see a Sign in with Apple button.</p>

<p></p>

 Add Social Login with Google 

<p>If you want to add Sign in with Google, you can do it with very similar steps. Rather than repeat all the steps verbatim here, I invite you to check out Okta’s <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/google/create-an-app-at-idp/">Google Social Login Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Tip: You’ll need to add <code>http://localhost:8100</code> as a JavaScript origin to sign in with Google via your browser in development.</p>

<p>After you’ve registered Google as an identity provider, update your sign-in page’s code.</p>

   <code>config.idps = [
  {type: 'APPLE', id: '&lt;apple-idp-id&gt;'},
  {type: 'GOOGLE', id: '&lt;google-idp-id&gt;'},
];
</code>   

<p>Click Save and Publish. Now you should be able to sign in with Apple or Google. How cool is that?! 😎</p>

<p></p>

 Run Your Ionic App in iOS Simulator 

<p>To build your app and run it on iOS Simulator, run the following commands:</p>

   <code>ionic build --prod
npx cap add ios
npx cap open ios
</code>   

<p>Add your custom scheme to <code>ios/App/App/Info.plist</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
  &lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.getcapacitor.capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;com.okta.$dev-subdomain&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
  &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
</code>   

<p>In Xcode, go to App &gt; Signing &amp; Capabilities and select your team. Then, click the ▶ button in the top left and deploy to an iPhone X. Click the Login button, and you should see options to sign in with Apple, Google, or your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>NOTE: If you want to debug your Ionic app in Simulator, you can use Safari to debug Simulator in its Develop menu.</p>

<p>Sign in with Apple and then click the button to get your user details. You should see everything working.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Google should work too!</p>

<p></p>

 Deploy Ionic App to iOS Phone 

<p>If you have an iPhone, you should be able to deploy your Ionic app to it. Plug your iPhone in via USB, and it should show up as a target in Xcode. You should see an App &gt; Your Phone Name at the top. Click ▶ to deploy to your (unlocked) phone.</p>

<p>I dig the Sign in with Apple experience on my iPhone 11! iOS takes over without a redirect and makes it seamless.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For me, Face ID is even part of the flow! 😃</p>

 

  

 

 Learn More about Ionic and Social Login 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this tutorial on how to add Sign in with Apple (and Google) to your Ionic apps. The thing I dig about Okta’s setup is that I can use the same identity provider for all my apps that use my authorization server. That means I only have to configure external IdPs once, and all my apps can take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Presentation by Dr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianluca-misuraca-4a04a61/">Gianluca Misuraca</a>, Senior Scientist, European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, Spain</p>



<p>The
Procivis Think Tank meeting of 3 September 2020 took place against the backdrop
of a corona flare up and new travel restrictions in Europe. Accordingly, at
short notice we switched to our first-ever webinar format. </p>



<p>Our
first speaker, MEP Eva Kaili, shared her views against the background of the announcement
of the EU’s €750 billion “Next Generation” pandemic recovery plan in addition
to its new long-term budget of €1,100 billion. She highlighted the EU’s priorities
– “green and digital” and security in North Africa/Middle East.</p>



<p>How
did the European parliament operate during the lockdown? </p>



<p>Eva
Kaili explained that ballots were submitted via email. This illustrates how one
always makes do with the technology that one has during an emergency. Projects
were under way to make the system more resilient. During the Q&amp;A with Eva
Kaili it was also helpful to be reminded again that the EU only has the
competences that were conferred to it by member states in treaties. </p>



<p>Shaping
Digital Europe 2040</p>



<p>Gianluca
Misuraca presented his research on “Shaping Digital Europe 2040: Artificial intelligence
&amp; public sector innovation in a data-driven society”. It was interesting to
see that the EU is funding such long-term research. Looking ahead to 2040, he presented
scenarios based on a sliding scale of digital participation by citizens vs. the
degree to which this participation was regulated. &nbsp;The digital future might not be knowable, but
we can imagine its contours, challenges and opportunities.</p>

<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> has some very happy news to share about a new partnership with <a href="https://heder.be">Heder VZW</a> and a new&nbsp;KidTech&nbsp;product planned to launch December 2020. But first, we would like to share a little about why we believe this is so important.



Back in April 2019, we presented our thoughts at the World Government Summit on the digital future for Kids.




<blockquote>“Every child born in today’s digital world will live a dual physical and digital life. How we enable privacy and security for their digital twin in as important as the rights afforded to them in the physical world. If we don’t get this right, we risk a generation born into digital slavery”<p></p>– Katryna Dow, Meeco<br>World Government Summit, 2019</blockquote>




Sadly, a year on from the Summit and our concerns are evidenced all too often. This week by the news that the parents of 5 million British children under the age of 13, are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-14/google-faces-3-billion-u-k-suit-over-use-of-children-s-data?srnd=technology-vp">mounting a legal battle</a> with the tech giant Google, for $3 Billion.



At the heart of their claims is the desire to protect the digital rights of their children. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube’s method of targeting underage audiences constitute “major breaches” of UK and European privacy and data rules designed to protect citizens, especially kids.




 




This month NETFLIX released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0">The Social Dilemma</a>, a must watch documentary on the social media addiction that is both alluring and alienating for each of us, especially our children. The documentary includes alarming statistics on the increase in childhood depression, self-harm and suicide.




 




Most alarming is that the age group impacted is getting younger and younger and directly linked to their early access to social media. These platforms make it all too easy for underage children to access and be subjected to unfiltered feedback that contributes to feelings of inadequacy, dissatisfaction and isolation.




<blockquote>“There has to be a better way for us to enable children to participate in the digital world, along with making their first digital experiences safe.”  

<br>– Katryna Dow, Meeco</blockquote>





 




Enter <a href="https://heder.be">Heder</a>, a not-for-profit organisation based in Antwerp, Belgium. Heder provides care and guidance to improve quality of life for children with different abilities, along with their families and extended networks.




 




Heder’s philosophy is to always start from present strengths. Finding small things or looking for bigger solutions that enable people to focus on their unique strengths. Fostering pride and allowing themselves to experience joy from everyday things. Cultivating this from early childhood, together with support from family and community really makes a difference.




 




Their multidisciplinary experts work together to give support in different ways including creative play, adjusted sports, training, physical and psychological therapy.&nbsp;Heder offers services in the home, at day-care, school or on campus, and is just some of the ways Heder contributes to a more inclusive society.




 




And now, there’s another way; drawing on Heder’s philosophy of building on strengths, the idea for mIKs-it was born. After a number of years of research, the inspiring vision of Gaby Pereira Martins (Masters in Educational Sciences) and Kim Struyf (Director of Early Development), supported by Heder’s Senior General Manager, Erik Van Acker, will now become a reality.




 





<blockquote>“Together with Meeco we can give mIKs-it a strong foundation” 



<br> – Kim Struyf, Heder</blockquote>




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is honoured to announce our partnership with Heder to co-develop a media platform for kids, focussing on the developmental stages of 0-7 years. The platform is called mIKs-it. It has been designed to foster joy and connection to everyday life for kids, with privacy, security and control as the foundation.




 




Early childhood is the most vulnerable time in a child’s development as they are totally dependent on family and society for nurturing and protection. It is also likely the period when they will first come into contact with technology. Whether it is playing with their parents’ phone, watching YouTube or listening to content, all these media choices present new challenges to navigate in order to keep children safe.




 




In designing mIKs-it we had the privilege to work with <a href="https://trendwolves.com">Trendwolves</a>, who validated the design, usability and kid’s experience through a series of research projects. The research was led by Maarten Leyts, the founder of Trendwolves. Maarten brought unique insight to the project, given his expertise in KidTech. Many of the issues we wanted to understand were addressed by Maarten in his upcoming book “Generation Alpha in Beta”, due for release later this year.




 





<blockquote>“Today’s and tomorrow’s kids swipe before they draw. Say hi to Generation Alpha. But we’re facing a challenge here. Fully immersed in technology during their formative years and in a fast-changing world, differentiates Gen Alpha from previous generations.”

<br>– Maarten Leyts, Trendwolves</blockquote>





 




Working with Trendwolves was the obvious choice as they specialise in trend research focusing on families and global youth culture. Their insights help shape and validate product design, always focussing on how we can enhance meaningful human relationships.&nbsp;




 




Following a successful proof-of-concept completed earlier in the year, the decision to develop the platform was clear. The results of the research, and especially observing kids with a wide range of abilities interact with personal content touched our hearts and motivated our action. Especially as the study included kids with a diverse range of physical and developmental abilities, focussing on media formats for kids with reduced motor skills or that are visually or hearing impaired.




 





<blockquote>“Meeco’s guiding principle in the digital world is the same as Heder’s principle for the physical world: children are entitled to a safe and positive climate in which to flourish.”   

<br>– Gaby Pereira Martins, Heder</blockquote>




<a href="https://miks-it.com">mIKs-it</a> has been designed to provide a safe digital place for children to interact with multimedia; photos, video and audio files. The platform is developed using Meeco’s globally awarded technology, with content secured and encrypted using the same approach Meeco developed to protect bank applications, like the digital vault for KBC Bank in Belgium.




 




mIKs-it is a family platform and not a social network. There are two companion apps – a media app for kids, supported by an app for their trusted grown-ups to manage connections, consent and content. The features of mIKs-it are all the things that it doesn’t do, such as:




 
 
  no ads  no tracking  no manipulation  no unauthorised access  no contacts without your approval  no content without your consent  no unauthorised access to your media  no data mining  
 



 








  
 
 




Most importantly, the control is always with parents and guardians, and personal data is never sold!








<blockquote>“Heder and Meeco is a purpose driven partnership, our shared goal is to enable a more empowering digital experience for all children.”

<br>– Erik Van Acker,  Heder</blockquote>





 




If you would like to know more about our progress over the coming months and the launch you can register your interest at the <a href="https://miks-it.com">mIKs-it</a> website.
<br>












 




We realise there’s still a lot to do to help our kids develop healthy and empowering digital habits, but our hope is that mIKs-it is a small, but meaningful step in the right direction.




 




Now we invite you to join us on this most wonderful adventure, into the land of mIKs-it: a playground where children and their grown ups can connect and safely share snippets of everyday life and build lasting memories.

  <p>As the risks of digitalization evolve and cybersecurity threats grow, there’s only one way for security and risk leaders to effectively protect the organization — institute a continuous, sustainable <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/hire-the-right-teachers-for-better-security-awareness/">security program</a>. Yet all too often, organizations prioritize ticking compliance boxes over establishing effective, risk-based controls.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Executives are more likely to subscribe to a vision when the components and objectives are relevant and laid out in nontechnical terms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result? Programs lack defensibility at the business level, leading to mistrust and making it harder to gain adequate support and investment.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Business leaders continue to treat security as a business inhibitor due to the lack of a defensible security program that links into business outcomes,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/26004">Tom Scholtz</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>

<p>To achieve a defensible information security management program, security and risk management leaders must <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/security-experts-must-connect-cybersecurity-to-business-outcomes/">bring the business along</a> as they establish governance and develop the ability to assess and interpret risk effectively.&nbsp;</p>
 Establish accountability with a security charter 
<p>A key aspect of defensibility is having the proper documentation and processes in place to&nbsp; enable risk-based control decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To form the foundation of your security program, create an Enterprise Security Charter. This short, plain-language document establishes clear owner accountability for protecting information resources and provides a mandate for the CISO (or equivalent) to establish and maintain the security program.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-security-questions-board-will-definitely-ask/">Executive leadership </a>must read, understand, visibly endorse and annually review the charter, ensuring sign-off on roles, scope and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Establish an information security steering committee to ensure decisions aren’t made in a vacuum by the security team. Include direct, decision-making representation across business units and functions.</p>
<p>By creating a place for ongoing input and support for security programs from senior business leaders, other leaders are able to see the risks not only to their own business unit, but across the business.</p>
 Set a clear vision for security programs 
<p>Business support for the security program hinges on conveying a clear vision that reflects the unique business context of the enterprise. Has there been recent cost cutting? Where’s the organization on its digital journey? What regulatory requirements have shifted?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executives are more likely to subscribe to a vision when the components and objectives are relevant and laid out in nontechnical terms. The vision should reflect the mid and long-term business needs for security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-security-and-risk-leaders-can-prepare-for-reduced-budgets/">How Security and Risk Leaders Can Prepare for Reduced Budgets</a></p>
<p>Provide a prioritized roadmap that clearly links projects and corrective actions to risks, vulnerabilities and the relevant business, technology and environmental drivers.&nbsp;</p>
 Demonstrate a quick response to changing threats 
<p>Security is a moving target, and executives are under pressure to demonstrate that the enterprise can handle changing threats. By gearing programs toward anticipating and reacting to frequent, unexpected changes, security and risk management leaders illustrate their ability to protect the organization — no matter what happens in the business environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To guide agile security planning implementation and operations day to day, develop a set of agreed-upon principles with business partners.&nbsp;Examples of principles include:</p>
 
 
<p>Supporting business outcomes rather than solely protecting the infrastructure</p>
 
 
<p>Considering the human element when designing and managing security controls</p>
 
 
<p>Conducting regular/periodic vulnerability assessments of the enterprise’s environment</p>
 
 
<p>Laying out these principles can help you continuously improve the effectiveness and efficiency of security controls while also reacting to change.</p>

  <p>Okta is an identity platform focused on making authentication easy to build with minimal code. Our goal at Okta is to build a solution so flexible and easy to use, that you’ll never have to build authentication again.</p>

<p>And while Okta can provide a lot of new functionality to your application, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) based on contextual policies, self-service password resets, and federation to enterprise identity providers and social media accounts, we’ve found that the biggest hesitation for many customers is password migration.</p>

<p>If your passwords are hashed and salted, you can do a bulk import with <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-imported-hashed-password">Okta Users API</a>. Hashing functions supported include SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, BCRYPT, and MD5. However, if your passwords are not salted, or if you do not have the option for a bulk export, you can still migrate a user’s password with a just-in-time migration. This guide will show you how to do that.</p>

<p>For the just-in-time migration, you will leverage the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/password-hook/">Password Import Inline Hook</a>. Using the Password Hook, migration is done the first time the user authenticates to Okta by first verifying the password against the current user store. If the password matches the current user store, Okta will allow the user to log in and simultaneously hash, salt and store the password in Okta’s Universal Directory. If the password does not match the user is blocked from signing in and the password is not stored. This will continue until the user is verified successfully, or the user’s password is reset in Okta.</p>

<p>The following guide will show you how to use Okta’s Password Hook to verify a user’s password against a SQLite Database. The database will be initiated for you with credentials for two users, one with a plain text password and the other with a hashed (not salted) password to demonstrate your options. This guide will test against both requirements, so  that you can test both or whichever is most relevant for you.</p>

<p>But first I’ll address a few key questions you may be wondering about.</p>

 What Are Inline Hooks? 

<p>If you’re familiar with webhooks, then you’ll recognize the similarities with inline hooks, but with a tie to a specific Okta process, allowing you to add custom functionality. For example, the Password Import Inline Hook is tied to the Okta authentication process, allowing us to verify the user’s password against a database before determining whether to grant access and migrate the password.</p>

<p>Inline Hooks do require a web service with an internet-accessible endpoint. In this example you’ll be using Glitch, a simple-to-use app-hosting platform, to both host and run the custom process flow. However, generally users host the Inline Hook service within a web server they already have in place.</p>

<p>The call is synchronous, so that Okta pauses the process that triggered the flow (in this example, authentication) until a response from the service or endpoint is received. Every inline hook takes the form of HTTPS REST, and includes a JSON object, but the specifics of the <code>data.context</code> object within will vary by inline hook. The response from the service back to Okta will also typically include a JSON payload with a <code>commands</code> object to specify actions and communicate back to Okta.</p>

<p>For example, with the Import Password Inline Hook, the JSON <code>data.context</code> object includes credentials typed in by the user. The service is expected to evaluate if the credentials match the original user store and send a response. The response is expected to include the command <code>com.okta.action.update</code>, specifying if the credentials are <code>VERIFIED</code> or <code>UNVERIFIED</code>.</p>

<p>For more information, visit our  (Inline Hooks documentation)[https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/] and specifically <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/password-hook/">Password Import Inline Hooks</a>.</p>

<p>All the code is already written for you, all you have to do is copy the application I created, create an Inline Hook within your Okta tenant and you’re ready for testing. I’m using Node.js, but you can convert the steps I’m using to the language of your choice.</p>

 Use Import Password Inline Hook 

<p>Remix This Glitch App: <a href="https://okta-inlinehook-passwordimport.glitch.me/">https://okta-inlinehook-passwordimport.glitch.me/</a></p>

<p></p>

<p>Remixing will create a name and URL that you’ll be able to use for testing. For example:</p>
 
   Glitch app name: snapdragon-foremost-flat 
   Glitch app URL: https://snapdragon-foremost-flat.glitch.me/ 
 

<p>The code is written to automatically initialize a SQLite database and insert the first two rows of data. To confirm this, click Show (next to Glitch App Name) and select In a New Window.</p>

<p>Add <code>/getUsers</code> to your URL and you should see the following JSON output with user credentials for two users.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The first user is stored with a plain text password and the second is stored with a hashed password so that you can test both use cases.</p>

 Create an Inline Hook in Okta 

<p>You will point the inline hook to the <code>/passwordImport</code> endpoint, as I’ve created a <code>POST</code> Request to receive the credentials from Okta and send a response of <code>VERIFIED</code> or <code>UNVERIFIED</code> dependent on if the password was validated against the original user store.</p>

<p>The code  below is already in the Glitch app you remixed, but is also  provided here for visibility.</p>

   <code>// Attempt to verify user password and return result to Okta
app.post("/passwordImport", async (request, response) =&gt; {
  console.log(" "); // for separation of logs during testing
  var verify = await comparePassword(request.body.data.context.credential);
  console.log('Password for ' + request.body.data.context.credential['username'] + ": " + verify);
  var returnValue = { "commands":[
                          { "type":"com.okta.action.update",
                            "value":{ "credential": verify } }
                    ]}
  response.send(JSON.stringify(returnValue));
})

// If database password stored as hash, call hashpassword() to convert typed in password
// Compare typed in password to database password and return result 
async function comparePassword(creds) {
  var pwd = "";
  if (Boolean(hashed)) {
    pwd = await hashPassword(creds['password']);
    console.log('Text Password: ' + creds['password']);
    console.log('Hashed Password: ' + pwd);
  } else {
    pwd = creds['password'];
    console.log('Text Password: ' + creds['password']);
  }
  var db_password = await getDbPwd(creds['username'].toLowerCase());
  console.log('Database Password: ' + db_password);
  if (pwd === db_password) {
    return('VERIFIED');
  } else {
    return('UNVERIFIED');
  }
}
</code>   

<p>In your Okta tenant, navigate to Workflow &gt; Inline Hooks &gt; Add Inline Hook in the Admin Portal and select Password Import.</p>

<p>Give the hook a name and enter your Glitch base url + /passwordImport as the URL. Select Save.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: For this test, authentication verification has not been added but would be recommended in a production environment.</p>
</blockquote>

 Test Your Password Import Hook 

<p>That’s it, since all the code has already been written in your remixed Glitch application, you just need to test.</p>

<p>You will need to use Okta’s [Create User with Password Import Inline Hook API Request]](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/#create-user-with-password-import-inline-hook). This will indicate to Okta that the Import Password Inline Hook we created should be called the next time the user authenticates. The hook will continue to be called until the user’s password is verified successfully or until the password is reset in Okta.</p>

<p>The easiest way to use the API is to create and use an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/rest/">Okta Postman Environment</a>. We will be working off the Users Collection, but will need to duplicate an existing request to create one for the Password Import Hook. For this example, I copied Create User with Password by selecting the three ellipsis to the right of the request and selecting Duplicate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once duplicated, I renamed the request to Create User with Password Hook and set activate to <code>true</code>. The body of the request should be modified so that the password value is a hook with a default type. If you want to test with the data already inserted into the database you’ll want to create two users tinatest@doesnotexist.com and timtest@doesnotexist.com.</p>

<p>The  screenshot below shows the request body format in Postman with the data set to match the first user in the database. You’ll need to send the request twice, once for the Tina Test user and a second time for the Tim Test user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the user is added to your Okta tenant, you can attempt to log in. I’ve included message outputs via the console of the Glitch application. If you’d like to confirm the service receives the request and the data retrieved, select **Tools &gt; Logs **. For the initial tests with tinatest@doesnotexist.com, first type in an incorrect password to confirm the user is blocked from signing in and the password is not stored, requiring the inline hook to be called again during the next user login attempt. Once sign-in is blocked, you can attempt to log in with the correct password: textPassword.</p>

<p>The user should be signed in, landed on the Okta dashboard. If checking the console, your output should look similar to this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Optionally, you can sign out and log in again to confirm the inline hook is no longer called for this user now that the password has been successfully stored in Okta.</p>

<p>##Test Your Password Import Hook with Hashed Password</p>

<p>For the second user, timtest@doesnotexist.com, you’ll be using a hashed password, so you’ll need to make a slight modification to the code of the glitch application.</p>

<p>On line 44, there is a line of code setting the variable hashed to false. Change the value to true.</p>

 <code>// Determines if password needs to be hashed prior to comparing
// This example uses SHA-512 (already imported), but can be modified to include more or alternate hashes
// If true, the password typed in by the user will be hashed before comparison
// If false, the plain text password will be used for comparison
var hashed = true;
</code> 

<p>This will result in a function being called to convert the password typed in by the user to a hashed value for comparison to the value in the database.</p>

 <code>// Function to convert password to hashed password for comparison
// Can be modified for alternate hash functions or to add salt if needed
function hashPassword(pwd) {
  return sha512(pwd);
}
</code> 

<p>The code above is separate from the rest of the application logic, to allow for easy modification to an alternative hashing function depending on what is used to store passwords in your database or user store.</p>

<p>Optionally, clear the log for the app, so that only messages for this new user will be visible.</p>

<p>The user timtest@doesnotexist.com should already be in your Okta tenant from the previous step, but if not, add the user following the steps and formatting described above.</p>

<p>Once the user is created in your Okta tenant, attempt to log in first with an incorrect password and then with the correct password: hashedPassword.</p>

<p>Similar to the first user, the incorrect password should result in the user being blocked from signing in and the password not being stored. The second attempt, with the correct password, should allow the user access to the Okta dashboard and the password should be stored. Console Log output should  look similar to this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>As before, you can sign the user out and log back in to confirm the inline hook is not called again now that the password is stored.</p>

<p>It’s as easy as that! You now have a working inline hook that can migrate your user’s password at the time of first login.</p>

 Continue Developing with Okta and Event Hooks 

<p>This post walked through using the Import Password Inline Hook, but there are additional inline hooks to expand functionality for user import, registration, or customizing SAML Assertions and OIDC tokens. If you’re interested in learning more about these, visit our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/inline-hooks/">Inline Hooks documentation</a> for resources on how to build and use them.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier in this post, Inline Hooks are synchronous, pausing the process that triggered the flow until a response is received. However, if you would like an asynchronous option that will allow the process to continue running without disruption, we have options for this as well with <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/event-hooks/">Event Hooks</a>. View our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/event-types/?q=event-hook-eligible">Event Hook Eligible documentation</a> to see options for triggering asynchronous hooks.</p>

<p>MATTR is proud to announce we’ve added support for privacy-preserving verifiable credentials on our platform using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures-spec">BBS+ signatures</a>. Using a technique to implement selective disclosure, we’ve added the ability to generate credentials that support zero knowledge proofs without revealing any unnecessary information about the end-user, or placing any added burden on issuers, in the process. Since we&nbsp;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">open-sourced</a>&nbsp;JSON-LD BBS+ Signatures at&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a>&nbsp;in April of this year, we’ve received lots of engagement, feedback and contributions from the broader technical community to further develop the implementations and specifications we presented. You can read more about our approach to privacy-preserving verifiable credentials on our introductory&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">blog post</a>.</p>



<p>One of the benefits of using the BBS+ cryptographic scheme to sign credentials is the ability to derive a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero knowledge proof</a>&nbsp;from the signature, where the party generating the proof can choose to partially disclose statements from the original message. When enabled, this feature allows issuers to create a credential that effectively enforces minimal data disclosure using the MATTR Platform and a compliant digital wallet.</p>



Issuers can create ZKP-enabled credentials that allow the user to selectively disclose data



<p>To support this functionality, we generate the keys required to support these signatures and create a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a>&nbsp;(DID) with the keys referenced in the DID Document. BBS+ signatures require what’s called a&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03">pairing-friendly curve</a>, we use&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. This DID can be referenced in credentials to establish the issuer of the data, a common practice to allow a verifier or relying party to trace the root of trust in a credential.</p>



<p>To issue a ZKP-enabled credential, simply use our API endpoint to create a new DID Key with type set to BLS 12–381. Then, create a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a>&nbsp;(VC) using your new DID Key as the issuer DID. Our platform will automatically detect this capability is available in your DID and create a ZKP-enabled BBS+ credential for you. You can use the platform this way to create a privacy-enabled credential, or you can create a regular credential by providing a DID with a different key type — you have the option.</p>



<p>On the user side, you can hold ZKP-enabled credentials in your wallet alongside all of your other credentials. We’ve designed this process in a way that minimizes friction to the user. In future updates, our Mobile Wallet App will be able to detect if BBS+ signatures are being used in a credential. When you get a request to verify some information contained in one of these privacy-enabled credentials, it will derive a new presentation that selectively discloses the required info using a zero-knowledge proof. The platform will then allow verification of the proof using the same interface as any other type of presentation.</p>



<p>Our integrated approach treats zero-knowledge proofs as an extension of VCs, rather than an entirely new framework with a separate set of dependencies. We have built BBS+ Signatures and privacy-enabled credentials into our platform for anybody to experiment with, in what we think is a significant milestone for standards-based credential solutions on the market today.</p>



<p>As a technology, BBS+ digital signatures can be used to sign more than just verifiable credentials. Combining these technologies is quite effective, though they can also be treated as modular or separate components. We’ve open-sourced software for creating and verifying BBS+ signatures in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">browser</a>&nbsp;environments as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures">node.js</a>, and we’ve also published a library for generating&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bls12381-key-pair">BLS 12–381</a>&nbsp;keypairs for signing and verifying BBS+ Signatures.</p>



<p>By leveraging pairing-friendly elliptic-curve cryptography in the context of&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>, our approach provides an unprecedented way to perform zero-knowledge proofs using the semantics of&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>. This allows credential issuers to tap into vast data vocabularies that exist on the web today, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">Google Knowledge Graph</a>, making user data more context-rich without sacrificing security and privacy of the user in the process. Not only is this approach more interoperable with existing implementations of the VC data model and semantic web technologies, it also doesn’t rely on any external dependencies to operate (like a distributed ledger), meaning it’s&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">far more efficient</a>&nbsp;than other approaches based on&nbsp;<a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/cl">CL-signatures</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">zk-SNARKs</a>. We’ve open-sourced our&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">LD-Proofs suite for VCs</a>&nbsp;including performance benchmarks so you can check it out yourself.</p>



<p>We’re excited to finally make these powerful privacy features easily accessible for everyone, and we can’t wait to see what you build with it.

<p>I’ll start working on the content this week and have some questions on format and delivery:</p>
 
 Is there a preferred slide template or format? 
 What is the optimum approach record heads-up and rotate slides in a split-screen 
 Will each presenter go over their slides live or are things pre-recorded?

  <p>Organizations have been managing the identity and access of employees for many years to protect data and the overall security of the enterprise. However, the onset of digital transformation has driven a need for faster, cost-effective innovation and with it the increased utilization of third-party resources. Consequently, organizations have a greater need to manage third-party access to data, systems, and facilities. This includes contractors, vendors but also partners, affiliates, volunteers, and even service accounts and bots. Modern organizations are much more collaborative and open structures than those of even just a few years ago and continue to change.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/managing_vendor_and_partner_identity"></a>

  <p>It used to be that before you walked out the door, you always made sure you had your keys and your wallet. The “key and wallet check” was essential to leaving your home with a clear head. Now, your smartphone has undoubtedly joined the fray as something equal to, or even more important than, those other vital items. Leaving your house without your smartphone likely seems inconceivable, and whether we want to admit it or not, it is one of the most ubiquitous things in our lives.</p>

 Your Smartphone Can Do More 

<p>Your phone understands who you are, knows where you are, it’s connected to a powerful network that is your portal to the world. So why not use that knowledge? Why do websites continue to ask me to register and log in with usernames and passwords when there is a device in my pocket that can authenticate me? Could the networks that power our smart devices play a role by adding additional, seamless security?</p>

 Using ZenKey to Unlock Trust 

<p>These questions now have an answer. AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon have created something meaningful with the launch of ZenKey. ZenKey is a new solution that leverages the&nbsp; network and SIM card details to deliver authentication and identity verification features to web and mobile applications. ZenKey is differentiated because it relies on network and device data and can’t be hacked using only a stolen username and password or even a malicious SIM swap.</p>

 What This Means for Your Security 

<p>Even more exciting is that ForgeRock is a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-wireless-providers-and-consumer-brands-go-live-with-zenkey-301132800.html?tc=eml_cleartime">launch partner</a> with ZenKey, giving customers the ability to leverage the ZenKey Authentication Node in ForgeRock’s Intelligent Access solution. This node provides instant, drop-in support for the ZenKey service. By simply leveraging the ZenKey node, any website or service can offer an alternative to long registration forms and password-based logins with a highly secure, device-based, multifactor authentication.</p>

<p>Now, ForgeRock customers can quickly reduce abandonment during sign-ups while receiving trusted user attributes from MNOs. This capability helps reduce the risk of fraud while creating an identity pre-populated with user attributes. Once a user is enrolled in ZenKey, ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access </a>can use ZenKey to power a highly secure passwordless authentication experience. This integration delivers a tremendous balance between security and usability, something every ForgeRock customer is trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>As more apps, websites and services take advantage of the combination of ZenKey and ForgeRock for seamless registration and authentication, one of the keys you will never leave home without will be your ZenKey.</p>

  <p>The shortage of technical security staff, the rapid migration to cloud computing, regulatory compliance requirements and the unrelenting evolution of threats continue to be the most significant ongoing major security challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-security-areas-to-focus-on-during-covid-19/">responding to COVID-19</a> remains the biggest challenge for most security organizations in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The pandemic, and its resulting changes to the business world, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">accelerated digitalization </a>of business processes, endpoint mobility and the expansion of cloud computing in most organizations, revealing legacy thinking and technologies,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/25610">Peter Firstbrook</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner, during the virtual Gartner Security and Risk Management Summit, 2020.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="28186"]</p>
<p>COVID-19 refocused security teams on the value of cloud delivered security and operational tools that don’t require a LAN connection to function, reviewing remote access policies and tools, migration to cloud data centers and SaaS applications, and securing new digitization efforts to minimize person-to-person interactions.</p>
<p>Gartner has identified nine annual top trends that are the response by leading organizations to these longer-term external trends. These top trends highlight strategic shifts in the security ecosystem that aren’t yet widely recognized, but are expected to have broad industry impact and significant potential for disruption.</p>
 Trend No. 1: Extended detection and response capabilities emerge to improve accuracy and productivity 
<p>Extended detection and response (XDR) solutions are emerging that automatically collect and correlate data from multiple security products to improve threat detection and provide an incident response capability. For example, an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/analysts-answer-how-security-leaders-can-secure-against-an-evolved-threat-landscape/">attack</a> that caused alerts on email, endpoint and network can be combined into a single incident. The primary goals of an XDR solution are to increase detection accuracy and improve security operations efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>“Centralization and normalization of data also helps improve detection by combining softer signals from more components to detect events that might otherwise be ignored,” said Firstbrook.</p>
 Trend No. 2: Security process automation emerges to eliminate repetitive tasks 
<p>The shortage of skilled security practitioners and the availability of automation within security tools have driven the use of more security process automation. This technology automates computer-centric security operations tasks based on predefined rules and templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automated security tasks can be performed much faster, in a scalable way and with fewer errors. However, there are diminishing returns to building and maintaining automation. SRM leaders must invest in automation projects that help to eliminate repetitive tasks that consume a lot of time, leaving more time to focus on more critical security functions.</p>
 Trend No. 3: AI creates new security responsibilities for protecting digital business initiatives 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">AI</a>, and especially machine learning (ML), continues to automate and augment human decision making across a broad set of use cases in security and digital business. However, these technologies require security expertise to address three key challenges: Protect AI-powered digital business systems, leverage AI with packaged security products to enhance security defense and anticipate nefarious use of AI by attackers.</p>
 Trend No. 4: Enterprise-level chief security officers (CSOs) emerge to bring together multiple security-oriented silos 
<p>In 2019, incidents, threats and vulnerability disclosures <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-cisos-need-cloud-to-secure-the-network/">outside of traditional enterprise IT systems</a> increased, and pushed leading organizations to rethink security across the cyber and physical worlds. Emerging <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-ways-to-stop-insider-threats/">threats</a> such as ransomware attacks on business processes, potential siegeware attacks on building management systems, GPS spoofing and continuing OT/IOT system vulnerabilities straddle the cyber-physical world. Organizations primarily focused on information-security-centric efforts are not equipped to deal with the effect of security failures on physical safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, leading organizations that deploy cyber-physical systems are implementing enterprise-level CSOs to bring together multiple security-oriented silos both for defensive purposes and, in some cases, to be a business enabler. The CSO can aggregate IT security, OT security, physical security, supply chain security, product management security, and health, safety and environmental programs into a centralized organization and governance model.</p>
 Trend No 5. Privacy is becoming a discipline of its own 
<p>No longer “just a part of” compliance, legal or auditing, privacy is becoming an increasingly influential, defined discipline of its own, affecting almost all aspects of an organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a rapidly growing stand-alone discipline, privacy needs to be more integrated throughout the organization. Specifically, the privacy discipline co-directs the corporate strategy, and as such needs to closely align with security, IT/OT/IoT, procurement, HR, legal, governance and more.</p>
 Trend No. 6: New “digital trust and safety” teams focus on maintaining the integrity of all interactions where consumer meets the brand 
<p>Consumers interact with brands through an increasing variety of touchpoints, from social media to retail. How secure the consumer feels within that touchpoint is a business differentiator. Security for these touchpoints is often managed by discrete groups, with specific business units focusing on areas they run. However, companies are increasingly moving toward cross-functional trust and safety teams to oversee all the interactions, ensuring a standard level of safety across each space where consumers interact with the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Trend No. 7: Network security transforms from the focus on LAN-based appliance models to SASE 
<p>Cloud-delivered security services are growing increasingly popular with the evolution of remote office technology. Secure access service edge (SASE) technology allows organizations to better protect mobile workers and cloud applications by routing traffic through a cloud-based security stack, versus backhauling the traffic so it flows through a physical security system in a data center.&nbsp;</p>
 Trend No. 8: A full life cycle approach for protection of the dynamic requirements of cloud-native applications 
<p>Many organizations use the same security product on end-user-facing endpoints as they did for server workloads, a technique that often continued on during “lift and shift” cloud migrations. But cloud-native applications require different rules and techniques, leading to the development of cloud workload protection (CWPP). But as the applications grow increasingly dynamic, the security options need to shift as well. Combining CWPP with the emerging cloud security posture management (CSPM) accounts for all evolution in security needs.&nbsp;</p>
 Trend No. 9: Zero-trust network access technology begins to replace VPNs 
<p>The COVID pandemic has highlighted many of the problems with traditional VPNs. Emerging zero-trust network access (ZTNA) enables enterprises to control remote access to specific applications. This is a more secure option, as it “hides” applications from the internet — ZTNA only communicates to the ZTNA service provider, and can only be accessed via the ZTNA provider’s cloud service. </p>
<p>This reduces the risk of an attacker piggybacking on the VPN connection to attack other applications. Full-scale ZTNA adoption does require enterprises to have an accurate mapping of which users need access to what applications, which will slow adoption.</p>

His commitment to innovation and democratization in banking and payments has led to his involvement in other projects such as <a href="https://aptopayments.com/">Apto</a>, a Y-Combinator alum focused on developer-first card issuance he co-founded with CEO Meg Nakamura.</p><p>In 2014, after several years working for a regulatory and compliance advisory company, I co-founded Apto with my colleague and friend Meg Nakamura. It became apparent from my experience that the financial services landscape was in need of a significant upgrade — the industry was dependent on outdated, legacy infrastructure and entangled in a web of opaque regulatory requirements, making it difficult to build and launch innovative and bespoke card programs specifically designed for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>The system was set up to serve only the most highly-resourced, established players in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Since those foundational experiences in finance, we’ve been passionate about creating a payments ecosystem that is more fair and equitable, allowing the most aspirational companies to enter the market quickly and responsibly. To this end, we’ve prioritized working with those who are equally as enthusiastic about creating user-first experiences in the financial services sector as we built Apto. Since its Y-Combinator days, when Apto was known as Shift Payments, we now support several of the fastest growing fintech companies in the U.S. and expanded our business to Europe as of 2019. After building cutting-edge card programs for fintech innovators like Venmo and Coinbase, we’re expanding our purview to make card programs truly accessible for&nbsp;all.</p><p>I’m thrilled to announce that in the coming weeks, Apto will be taking an exciting and important step forward in democratizing fintech by launching an instant card issuance portal for developers at companies of any&nbsp;size.</p><p>Launching a card program is historically a long, painful process. Our goal in designing this program is to remove barriers to entry and shield you from the technical complexities to make it fast and easy to design and launch card programs in&nbsp;minutes.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/aptopayments/the-democratization-of-financial-services-fe257c223ba3">Read Greg’s full post over at&nbsp;Apto</a>  <a href="https://aptopayments.com/">Sign up for Apto’s&nbsp;waitlist</a>  <p>You might also&nbsp;like:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team — Erik Westra, head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-sepa-and-crypto-transfers-to-your-wallet-6147deb5f6cd">GlobaliD App: Introducing SEPA and crypto transfers to your&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-coronavirus-developer-first-matters-amazon-declining-trust-and-super-apps-6656ed1f58e3">Why “developer-first” matters</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-introducing-developer-first-instant-card-issuance-from-apto-e22915bba322">Partner Spotlight: Introducing Developer First, Instant Card Issuance from Apto</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The rise of&nbsp;CBDC <p>CBDC has received unprecedented attention, but the motives, policies, and technical design of each country are different. On August 24, BIS released a working paper entitled ‘The Rise of CBDC: Driving Factors, Methods, and Technologies’. The article introduces the current status of CBDC research by central banks in various countries, calls on central banks to learn from each other, and gives three representative cases of&nbsp;CBDC.</p> 80% of the central banks surveyed are engaged in the research, experimentation, or development of&nbsp;CBDC <p>For centuries, a series of new payment technologies have met social needs. Coins, banknotes, checks, and credit cards are all innovations of their era. Now, there are more and more discussions about a new payment technology-CBDC. CBDC represents the digital liabilities of the central bank. Wholesale CBDC may become a new settlement tool between financial institutions, while retail CBDC will be the liability of the central bank that everyone can use. Although the concept of CBDC has been proposed decades ago, in the past year, the attitude of central banks on whether to issue CBDC has changed significantly.</p><p>During the Covid-19 epidemic, the public worried that the virus would spread through cash. The payment plan from government to individual is accelerating the transition to digital payment. Over time, the decline in cash usage in some countries has aroused people’s attention, and central banks in many countries have begun to consider issuing CBDC. As of the end of 2019, A total of central banks representing one-fifth of the world’s population stated that they may issue CBDC soon. Similarly, the proportion of central banks considering the issuance of retail CBDC within 1–6 years doubled in 2019 to 20%. Among the central banks surveyed, 80% are engaged in the research, experiment, or development of&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>CBDC is mentioned more and more in speeches and reports. In the 12-week moving average of Google searches, the peak of Bitcoin appeared in early 2018, the peak of Libra in 2019, and the number of searches for CBDC is increasing.</p><p>Source: Rise of the central bank digital currencies: drivers, approaches and technologies</p> DC/EP may be the most advanced CBDC project currently <p>For many years, central banks around the world have been studying the concept and design of CBDC. Such as the ‘Dinerolectrónico’ of the Central Bank of Ecuador, the ‘Dukaton’ of the ABN-AMRO Bank, and the ‘Ubin’ of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p><p>Currently, the most advanced CBDC may be the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DC/EP) of the People’s Bank of China. DC/EP represents debt in the form of cash from the People’s Bank of China, which can be used by the public and foreign tourists to China through an account-based interface.</p><p>The Bank of Canada stated that it is leading the work of the retail CBDC in response to emergencies such as a sudden decline in cash usage or widespread use of private digital currencies. The Central Bank of the Eastern Caribbean launched the ‘DXCD’ pilot. The Central Bank of the Bahamas launched the ‘Sand Dollar’&nbsp;pilot.</p><p>Source: central banks’&nbsp;websites</p> Commonality in&nbsp;CBDC <p>The development of global business digitization, the rise of private digital currencies, and concerns that cash may spread the COVID-19 virus have all contributed to the increase in interest in CBDC. However, the economic and institutional motivations for issuing CBDC vary from country to country. This part of the content hopes to cross the national dimension, explain the research and development of CBDC from the economic and institutional drive, and find common ground to explain why some countries/regions increase the research and development of CBDC. This will also help us understand how they designed CBDC projects.</p><p>Research has found that the development of CBDC is closely related to mobile and Internet utilization, innovation capabilities, and government efficiency. It develops faster in places with high per Capita GDP and high levels of financial development. Retail CBDC develops faster in areas with high innovation capabilities. Wholesale CBDC is positively related to financial development, which also reflects the role of wholesale CBDC in improving the efficiency of wholesale settlement. Many wholesale CBDC focus on cross-border dimensions.</p> Technical design of&nbsp;CBDC <p>‘CBDC pyramid’ is a classification method designed by CBDC. This method starts from the consumer needs addressed by retail CBDC, determines the technology, and then arrives at the final design&nbsp;plan.</p><p>The first thing to choose is the technical architecture. According to the roles played by central banks and private intermediaries in CBDC, the technical architecture of CBDC is divided into four types: direct CBDC, hybrid CBDC, intermediary CBDC, and indirect or synthetic CBDC.</p><p>The second layer is the infrastructure. It can be based on a traditional centralized database or distributed ledger technology (DLT). The difference in technology also leads to differences in the efficiency of CBDC and the degree of single point failure protection. However, among all the central banks engaged in the research of CBDC, no central bank is willing to take the risk of using the same distributed ledger technology without permission as&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>The third layer is the admission of CBDC. The combination of account-based CBDC and identity verification can provide a basis for payment activities. But for those without a bank account or who care about privacy, it may be difficult to gain access. If the barriers to entry are lowered, it may bring new illegal activities.</p><p>The fourth layer is the cross-border payment of CBDC, which involves the interconnection of the retail and wholesale of&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>In terms of structure, four central banks in the survey sample considered adopting a direct model, and seven central banks considered a hybrid or intermediary model. Many central banks have not yet determined the structure, but no central bank said they would adopt indirect or synthetic CBDC.</p><p>In terms of infrastructure, seven central banks are considering running CBDC on DLT, three are considering using traditional technology, and one is considering a combination of the&nbsp;two.</p><p>In terms of access, account-based access is the most&nbsp;common.</p><p>CBDC of most central banks focused on domestic use. Only a few projects, such as the CBDC built by the European Central Bank, France, Spain, and the Dutch Central Bank, will focus on cross-border payments.</p> Three examples of CBDC design&nbsp;method <p>Although the CBDC schemes of various countries may be different, central banks of different countries can also learn from each other. The following describes three unique CBDC schemes, which are located in Asia, North America, and Europe geographically. That is, the DC/EP of the People’s Bank of China, the e-krona of the Riksbank, and the work of the Bank of Canada on the&nbsp;CBDC.</p> The People’s Bank of China: DC/EP project (pilot&nbsp;phase) <p>Among all the current CBDC projects, the DC/EP of the Bank of China is at the highest stage of development, and China’s efforts on CBDC can be traced back to 2014. At the end of 2019, the Chinese announced a pilot study on the retail CBDC — digital currency and electronic payment tool (DC/EP) project. On April 20, 2020, a spokesperson for the People’s Bank of China confirmed that it is currently piloting projects in several cities including Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu, Xi’an, and&nbsp;Beijing.</p><p>China’s CBDC has developed under the circumstances of a highly digital economy and the widespread use of digital payment services. In addition to facilitating online transactions, CBDC will also bring diversity to the current payment monopoly of Alipay and WeChat, which controls 94% of mobile payments. China’s DC/EP will serve as a supplement to M0, and it is not intended to completely replace physical&nbsp;cash.</p><p>The structure of DC/EP belongs to ‘hybrid CBDC’. CBDC represents direct claims to the People’s Bank of China, but access and real-time payment services are operated by intermediaries (authorized operators), and the central bank regularly receives and stores retail holdings and transaction copies.</p><p>The People’s Bank of China provides core infrastructure, while commercial banks, other payment service providers, telecommunications, and other intermediaries will provide services to the public. This method prevents risks from being concentrated in the central bank and also prevents duplication and waste of resources.</p><p>The People’s Bank of China does not require intermediaries to use specific infrastructure or specific technical routes. Financial intermediaries will be responsible for KYC verification obligations and retail services.</p><p>In terms of access, the People’s Bank of China decided to use value-based, semi-account-based, and account-based hybrid payment tools. The identity will be based on ‘loosely coupled account links’. Users can use DC/EP anonymously in daily transactions, but allow the central bank to track necessary data, implement prudential supervision, combat money laundering, and other criminal&nbsp;crimes.</p> Riksbank: Electronic Krona&nbsp;Project <p>Sweden is a highly digitalized economy. Sweden is experiencing the largest and fastest decline in cash usage, and more and more stores no longer accept cash. Therefore, Sweden is more likely to issue&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>The Riksbank, like other central banks, has studied a variety of CBDC technologies and methods. The proof of the concept of the electronic Krona project is currently underway, and the purpose of CBDC is also to supplement cash.</p><p>The current proof-of-concept structure of the Riksbank is a hybrid CBDC. This design will require the Riksbank to provide emergency solutions when the intermediary fails to prevent users from being unable to use the electronic Krona in the&nbsp;end.</p><p>The architecture and technical implementation of electronic Krona are based on&nbsp;DLT.</p><p>In terms of access, the CBDC piloted by the Riksbank is account-based, but it also considers low-value prepaid cards. The Riksbank may also develop a CBDC payment card, which can be used directly for micropayments without accessing the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Bank of Canada: CBDC Emergency Plan <p>The Bank of Canada conducted effective research and policy communication on the topic of digital currency. Despite an early start, the Bank of Canada has not yet announced a retail CBDC pilot or proof of concept. Canada’s CBDC outlines a comprehensive plan, also lists potential structures, and accumulates relevant technology and knowledge through new projects, which also cooperate with other central&nbsp;banks.</p><p>However, the Bank of Canada stated that there is currently no compelling reason to issue CBDC, and Canadians will continue to receive good services from the existing payment ecosystem, provided that it is modern and still suitable for current goals. The world is changing rapidly, the Bank of Canada will consider the scenario of issuing the CBDC so that it can continue to provide Canadians with a reliable payment&nbsp;method.</p><p>The Bank of Canada considered reducing or eliminating the use of physical cash, as well as the significant progress made in the use of private cryptocurrencies or stablecoin as a means of&nbsp;payment.</p><p>Architecturally, Canada’s CBDC will not adopt an indirect/synthetic model and consider the use of direct CBDC, hybrid CBDC, or intermediary CBDC.</p><p>In terms of infrastructure, the Bank of Canada has a lot of DLT-based proof-of-concept experience. DLT can be used as an infrastructure solution, but it is not necessary.</p><p>In terms of access, the Bank of Canada considers access solutions based on accounts and coupons. Anonymous coupons will be allowed to be used for micropayments. Large usage will require the use of account-based access&nbsp;rights.</p> Sum up <p>CBDC is a new type of payment technology that may soon be launched in many countries around the world. Research shows that CBDC is developing faster in countries with higher mobile phone usage and innovation capabilities. Countries will vary according to their economic situation and priorities, but they also have some key common characteristics. All of the CBDC designs investigated are supplements of cash, none of the designs adopt an indirect model, and no central bank is willing to take the risk of using the same distributed ledger technology without permission as&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

<p>Here at MATTR, we have been hard at work building a suite of products to serve the next generation of digital trust. We’ve designed our products based on a few key principles: extensible data formats, secure authentication protocols, a rigorous semantic data model, industry-standard cryptography, and the use of drivers and extensions to allow modular and configurable use of the platform over time. By combining our core capabilities with extensions and drivers, our platform offers developers convenience without compromising flexibility or choice.</p>



  



<p>The MATTR Platform delivers digital trust in a scalable manner. Our belief is that a modular security architecture is one which can work across many different contexts. When it comes to trust, context is everything, and we know our users each have their own unique requirements and expectations when it comes to their digital interactions.</p>



<p>We provide flexible and configurable building blocks for trust on the web in order to create a digital ecosystem that can support global scale.</p>



<p>The platform consists of 3 main components:</p>



  Platform Core  Platform Extensions  Platform Drivers  



<p>Our platform provides the capabilities needed for digital trust through a set of modular and flexible building blocks known as our&nbsp;Platform Core. This includes the ability to establish and use DIDs, sign and encrypt messages, manage the verifiable credentials lifecycle, and share privacy-preserving verifiable presentations. Platform Core is designed as a set of simple APIs that are available for all of our users, with operational tools and documentation.</p>



<p>We’ve designed the platform to have cryptographic agility and flexibility built in at a fundamental level.&nbsp;Platform Drivers&nbsp;are pre-configured integrations that allow our capabilities to be pluggable and extensible over time, preventing vendor lock-in and enabling user choice. They identify key areas where flexibility, choice, and optionality are desirable and surface them to the user to promote more resilient security architectures for the future. They are typically surfaced to the user as pluggable parameters in our Platform Core.</p>



<p>Extensibility is a key component of our platform architecture.&nbsp;Platform Extensions&nbsp;are higher level capabilities that plug in to our platform, providing convenient and easy-to-access application logic, such as service orchestration and workflow. They are built on top of our Platform Core, allowing users to smoothly onboard and extend our platform as well as enabling MATTR’s digital trust infrastructure to integrate with digital services and protocols that exist outside of our products. They are modular components in terms of logic and configuration, operating independently of Platform Core as an extensible set of APIs.</p>



<p>Finally, we offer a growing number of&nbsp;Developer Tools&nbsp;to simplify the user experience by providing additional interfaces and ways to interact with our platform. These tools are free and mostly optional to use, though they do simplify setting up the infrastructure needed to get started experimenting with the platform. Some tools, like some of the features exposed by MATTR’s Mobile Wallet, may be required to use certain features of the platform. Our Developer Tools are designed to work natively with Platform Core as well as our Platform Extensions.</p>



 



<p>Over the past 6 months, we have been working in close collaboration with a number of preview customers to create a great developer experience and identify features that are important for a wide variety of use cases. We’ve been working with partners from industry and government to make sure we’ve built a solution for the problems that matter to you.</p>

   What is Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)?&nbsp; 

<blockquote><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance and administration (IGA)</a> enables admins, security teams, and internal auditors to manage and reduce the risk that comes with excessive or unnecessary user access to applications, systems, and data.</blockquote>

<p>As the digital world continues to evolve, IGA is now mission-critical to secure every organization. Yet few know what it is. With new <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">data privacy and security regulations</a> constantly emerging, organizations must now balance risk and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">customer experience</a> while achieving regulatory compliance. Having the right identity governance and administration solution in place can play a crucial role in achieving this balance, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">keeping workforces productive</a>, and enterprises secure. To fully understand what IGA is and why it’s become such a priority, we must look at how the need for it emerged in the first place.</p>

 The Early Years: User Provisioning and Mounting Regulations 

<p>To understand IGA, it’s important to understand what provisioning is and how user data was initially stored. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/identity-provisioning">User provisioning</a> is the process that ensures that user accounts are created with the proper permissions. IT administrators use provisioning to monitor and control access to systems and applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the early years of the digital age (1980s - early 90s), user provisioning was rather straightforward as it focused solely on users (employees) within an organization. Access to users outside an organization, like customers or citizens, was not common. Additionally, there weren’t as many systems within an organization to manage access to, making the provisioning process relatively manageable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this time, servers housed user accounts and identity data centrally on on-premises systems within the enterprise. However, in the mid-late 1990s as the .com market rapidly took off and external user access to systems and applications became ubiquitous, more sensitive user data such as name, address, social security number, country code, email address, bank account number, etc. were collected by global organizations. The need to protect this personally identifiable information (PII), the systems and applications that hosted this information quickly became critical. To address these requirements, new regulations were enacted that mandated stricter security protocols for user access permissions, required improved controls and policies to prove to auditors that the protocols had been implemented.&nbsp;</p>

 The Rise of Identity Governance Regulations 

<p>Introduced in 1996, the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a> (HIPAA) was created to provide stronger data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. As physicians later moved to digitized health records, the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html">HIPAA Security Rule</a> was issued as a best practice for securing sensitive digital information and establishing national standards to protect individuals’ electronic personal health information. This rule required appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the security of patient data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2002, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763">Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)</a> was introduced to bolster stronger trust and security around the financials of publicly traded companies. SOX imposed even more regulatory protocols regarding electronic records. It mandated the joint responsibility of auditors and management for the detection of fraud and external threats, requiring stringent record keeping, audits, and controls. Noncompliance with SOX can cost organizations up to $25 million in fines, criminal and civil prosecution, and prison sentences of up to 20 years for those found in breach of the mandate.</p>

<p>In 2006, the PCI Council (formed by American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard and Visa) created a body of security standards known as the <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</a>. Every merchant that <a href="https://www.fisglobal.com/insights/merchant-solutions-worldpay/article/how-to-accept-credit-cards">accepts credit card payments</a> must be in compliance with PCI DSS. PCI DSS includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, and other critical protective measures. Failure to comply with PCI mandates leaves businesses vulnerable to the negative impacts of data breaches, such as fines, fees, and lost business.</p>

<p>With these new regulations and stricter protocols, organizations began to feel the strain of ensuring and proving compliance. This pressure only intensified in the mid-2000s as the market saw a massive increase in enterprise user demand for access to cloud-based applications and systems. As a result, this created a larger provisioning problem. Existing user provisioning solutions only supported internal user (employee) populations. They were not equipped to handle the growing numbers of users, accounts, systems and applications while trying to continue to meet regulatory compliance requirements. The need for a solution that supported <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/identity-provisioning">user provisioning and management for internal and external systems and applications</a> thus emerged.&nbsp;</p>

 Turning to Identity Management as a Possible Fix 

<p>As traditional provisioning solutions struggled to keep up with increasing identity demands and regulations, many organizations turned to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management (IDM) solutions</a> to address these challenges. With the digital landscape evolving at a rapid pace as the introduction of cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and solutions began sweeping through the enterprise landscape. The transition to these technologies meant that internal user identities were now being used to access new external cloud-based applications and systems outside of the enterprise network. The result was a tangled web of access to internal and external systems; a disorganized mass of accounts for workforce, consumers, and partners; and varying levels of access across multiple environments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of these new and ever-growing challenges, identity management solutions were unable to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">meet compliance regulations</a> to ensure user access was reviewed, allowed, and/or revoked periodically. As a result, organizations would manually create and review user access certifications via spreadsheets distributed by email to business line managers annually or biannually for review and approval. Yet, with the exploding number of internal and external user identities, systems, and cloud applications, this process was no longer a scalable or viable option. With pressure mounting on organizations to achieve regulatory compliance, a new approach was needed.</p>

 The Emergence of Identity Governance and Administration 

<p>With a new approach, the existing user provisioning market morphed into identity management. In parallel, the genesis of identity governance came about due to the growing number of compliance regulations. Over time, both the identity management and identity governance markets merged into one market: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance and administration</a> (IGA). IGA solutions address the needs of regulatory compliance through identity governance and user provisioning requirements through administration. In addition, identity governance and administration addresses user access privileges for both on-premises systems and applications, as well as cloud-based applications and systems, bridging the gap where previous solutions fell short.</p>

<p>Today, identity governance and administration helps organizations address common business challenges throughout their network and users. Benefits include better access compliance through certifying the appropriate level of users’ access and enhanced business productivity by providing this access to the right resources at the right time. IGA also benefits security and risk management by allowing organizations to govern user access with policy-based controls and minimizing operational inefficiencies by streamlining business processes.</p>

<p>In addition to helping overcome business challenges, Identity Governance and Administration supports a number of underlying use cases. These use cases include;&nbsp; access requests (users requesting access to systems and applications), access approvals (managers approving user requests), access reviews (managers confirming user approvals or revoking user access), and role optimization (reviewing and updating role definitions).</p>

<p>Munich / September 16th, 2020 – IDnow, a leading Identity verification specialist, welcomes that Germany’s 16 states have agreed to a transition period incorporating the new and upcoming legal framework by October 15th. This transition clarifies existing and new mandates including, and importantly, age verification requirements for online gambling. The new regime officially enters into effect in July of next year. </p>
<p>IDnow, in its mission, is to make the connected world a safer place, is pleased about this decision among the German states. The company looks forward to supporting the operators in order to provide greater safety for users. For IDnow, this ensures better protection for customers under German law as well as clearer rules in regard to responsible gambling.</p>
<p>“This is a big step for Germany’s online gambling industry, and again, it shows the importance of eKYC methods and their need to evolve. In a world that becomes more and more digital by the day, we need to stay vigilant and constantly adapt our security requirements,” says Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow. “IDnow strives to contribute to responsible corporate citizenship, ensuring that the social responsibility for this industry can be achieved effectively through innovative methods. This is the strong desire of the federal and state governments within Germany, and IDnow has been and –&nbsp; will continue to be –&nbsp;an active supporter of those efforts,” she adds.</p>
<p>“We have developed our products together with our clients – the biggest players in the market –&nbsp; to perfectly meet their needs. IDnow offers AML compliant video verification, but also an approved automated verification solution. Gambling operators can choose, depending on their security needs, which of those multiple solutions they want to use. All of them fulfill mandatory age verification requirements.” says Oliver Obitayo CSO at IDnow. “To us, it is more than important that our clients can offer safe service platforms to customers so underage use can be prevented,” he adds.</p>
<p>After a period of uncertainty, each of Germany’s 16 states have agreed to a transition period for online gambling in Germany before the official start date of July 1, 2021. This transition period is noted by the shared agreement to not punish gambling companies who conform to the new law that will officially go into effect next year.</p>
<p>In January 2020, the German states agreed on an amendment to the State Treaty on Gambling (Glücksspielstaatsvertrag) that also comes into effect on July 1, 2021. This date was partly put into jeopardy, as was the process to issue sports betting licenses, in the first half of this year when matters came to a halt due to a court injunction sought by an Austrian gambling operator.</p>
<p>In a welcome development last week, Germany’s 16 states agreed to a transition period for gambling activities. This will allow operators to offer casino-style gaming and poker as long as such activities are fully compliant with the draft for the new Glücksspielstaatsvertrag. Online gambling operators must meet all licensing requirements by an October 15 deadline. This will include an Age Verification (AV) solution for online operators.</p>
<p>Under the new and upcoming regulatory regime, the following changes will be implemented:</p>
 
 It will be possible for German players to play online casino games and online poker under strict regulations 
 A wagering limit of €1 will be placed per spin for slot games 
 The number of licenses for table games will be limited to the number of physical locations for casinos in each state 
 A €1,000 deposit limit will now be implemented across all online gambling verticals in Germany. 
 
<p>&nbsp;With the recent acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services into the IDnow Group, the Munich based company has created additional capacities and possibilities for more flexibility in order to be able to adequately support its customers in every situation.</p>

Within the scope of the acquisition, she has already assisted in the valuation of the company. Her main task in the coming months will be to integrate the former Wirecard Communication Services GmbH – now IDnow Services GmbH – into the existing processes and to optimally position the business unit for the foreseeable growth.</p>
<p>In the last 12 years Bettina Pauck has been working with her own company as a consultant for companies like N26, reBuy or Axel Springer and has optimized their customer operations. She has been working in customer service since 2004 and now brings her many years of experience in strategic, tactical and operational customer management as well as in the conception and control of service structures to IDnow.</p>
<p>“Identity verification is at the heart of many industries, but most of all it ensures the security and sense of security of many customers. Since the customers are the focus of all my activities, I am particularly pleased to be able to make a real difference for the customers – and for IDnow – in this central function,” says Bettina Pauck. “IDnow is a company with a strong vision and my goal is to take the Operations division to a new level together with the outstanding team,” she adds.</p>
<p>“I am pleased that we were able to win Bettina Pauck as COO for IDnow. She will play a central role in the scaling of our operations area, also and especially in the context of the recent strong increase in demand. With the acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services, we have created additional capacity and infrastructure in order to further improve our range and service quality,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>

He also noted that Wing’s infrastructure demands are met by the credit-based identity and data framework exclusively provided by Ontology. He added, “The power of blockchain lies in consensus. It could be found in something as trivial as the record of a single transaction, or as big as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It’s what enables us to envision a future where blockchain technology facilitates the process of globalization, and is on the way to breaking the barriers between races, national borders, assets and social classes.

  <p>Eighty-two percent of security and risk leaders do not adjust their budgets based on environmental or business impact, which means they operate in a silo and are not aligned with the business.</p>
<p>Without that solid alignment, when a disruption happens, it can be difficult to ensure security is supporting what is important to the organization.</p>
<p>“With any disruption, with any crisis, you’re always going to have uncertainty, and uncertainty has a negative impact on your budget,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/47425/Sam-Olyaei">Sam Olyaei</a>, Director Analyst, during the virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/security-risk-management-us">Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit, 2020</a>. “Ultimately there has to be some sort of trigger or change within the budget planning process to navigate past the challenges.”</p>
<p>Gartner suggests five action items to guide security and risk leaders through cost optimization to enable a balanced and valuable outcome.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="28186"]</p>
 Action item 1: Identify crisis phase and what actions you will take 
<p>Leaders must be able to know <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">which phase of the crisis</a> the organization is currently in to be able to respond accordingly. The first is the respond phase, which focuses on keeping the lights on, essential services and making sure cost optimization is in place. In this phase, an organization might make policies more flexible or focus on tech that provides immediate value.</p>

<p>The next phase is recovery. This is where the strategic cost optimization begins now that leaders can look beyond the day to day. In the recovery phase, optimize for value and manage risk in comparison to cost. Effective security and risk leaders will use this phase to demonstrate value in the business by stretching staff skills and accelerating automation.</p>
<p>The final stage is the renew phase. Discussions will move past cost cuts to drive innovation and exploit opportunities to create value. This is the phase to scale digital with agile practices and prepare for a new normal. Arguably, this is where most leaders differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack.</p>
 Action item 2: Equip yourself with data for decision making 
<p>Whether it’s gathered from business reports, benchmarking, current state assessment or asset inventory, data is critical. Ideally, you’ll want to use a combination of all the sources to get the best pictures of the organization. Data can be used to move away from making decisions based on legacy or emotions, and toward efficiency and metrics. It will enable you to showcase and highlight how security and risk is making decisions and why you’ve reached a particular conclusion.</p>
 Action item 3: Build adaptable and realistic budget scenarios 
<p>Although scenario planning isn’t usually a large part of the security and risk business unit, it’s important to plan, test and design budgets for scenarios that you might face in the near or short term.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-balance-risk-trust-and-opportunity-in-an-uncertain-world/">Gartner Keynote: Balance Risk, Trust and Opportunity in an Uncertain World</a></p>
<p>For example, how would security handle an emergency budget cut, like being asked to cut spending by half through 2Q? What about selective cost reduction of 10% of the budget every quarter? What if security was asked to preserve costs and emphasize growth by maintaining the current budget but focusing aggressively on delivering business value?</p>
 Action 4: Align based on business unit value, risk and cost 
<p>Consider how to allocate resources to particular business units based on the potential value of each unit as it relates to the business. Look for indicators like revenue, business value or number of employees to help balance risk, value and cost.</p>
<p>For example, at an entertainment company, hospitality has high business value, but a bad risk posture. For security and risk, this represents a true opportunity to increase investment in ensuring better security posture for a business unit that is vital to the overall business.</p>
 Action 5: Take a portfolio view of cost optimization 
<p>Security and risk leaders need a holistic view of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/set-up-a-budget-friendly-application-security-program/">cost optimization</a>. It boils down to two pieces: Supply and demand. Supply has two main areas, security contract management and cost savings, within security. Here are opportunities to negotiate strategies and deliver technology value efficiently.</p>
<p>On the demand side, focus on joint business as well as security and business optimization. This includes activities/actions such as accelerating business outcomes by looking a little further out and enabling new digital business models.</p>

  <p>For years the go-to HTML/CSS framework of choice for developers was Bootstrap. A new contender has appeared in the form of Ant Design. Ant should feel familiar to veteran developers but it’s built on new principles. Their <a href="https://ant.design/">site</a> spends a good amount of effort distinguishing between good and bad design. There is an emphasis on clarity and meaning. Ant Design is heavily based on psychological principles to anticipate—and be customized for—user behavior.</p>

<p>Ant Design is built for React. In this tutorial, you will build a small React app that displays transactions to the user based on the Ant Design principles. You will use Okta to secure your web application. Okta is very easy to set up and using the libraries for integrating into React is simple. You will learn how to secure your app with Okta and how to put certain pages under authentication.</p>

 What is Ant Design? 

<p>Ant Design principles were developed for Ali Baba. Ali Baba is one of the largest companies in the world who’s B2B E-Commerce site is the backbone of a multinational Chinese corporation. Ant Design of React is a set of React components using the Ant Design principles.</p>

<p>It’s virtually impossible to cover all of Ant’s concepts in one article but I’ll attempt to give you a high-level look. Ant aims to be natural, clear, and concise in the presentation of material. It relies on natural user cognition and natural user behavior to dictate where elements are most likely to be seen and how to enable users to quickly identify what type of information they are being shown. Ant is designed to allow for growth in your website as your company and/or line of business grows with it. Ant focuses on developer certainty, rather than relying on what component to use. Ant attempts to guide the developer to user-specific components for a task. Ant is also designed around the concept of helping users achieve their mission. To do this, Ant is focused on providing clear feedback to the user if they are on the right path.</p>

<p>Ant provides many common components you will need to develop any website. This includes the basics like tables and forms, down to alerts, calendars, and tabs. You can also upgrade to a professional license and get access to graphs, charts, dashboards, and much more. Ant also provides several templates along with an online editor to rapidly prototype your site’s design.</p>

 Set Up Your Okta Application 

<p>Okta aims to make its SSO service as simple as possible for developers. They have taken on most of the middleware logic with their suite of packages for React. Before you can build your application you will need to set up an application in Okta’s developer console. Navigation to your developer’s console and log in. Click on Applications and click on Add Application. On the next page select Single-Page App and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next section, you will configure your application settings. Give your application a meaningful name. I named my application Transactions but you can name yours whatever you like. Next, you should change the references to <code>localhost:8080</code> to <code>localhost:3000</code> as that is the default development server for React. Click Done and take note of your Client ID on the next page. You will need this in your application.</p>

<p></p>

 Create Your React Application 

<p>As this application will be in react you can use the <code>create-react-app</code> toolchain to quickly scaffold your app. To do this open the folder where your application will be and run:</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app transactions
</code>   

<p>It takes a moment but after it’s complete you can use <code>cd transactions</code> to switch to your new React app.</p>

<p>You’ll need to get a couple of packages from npm. First is the Ant Design of React package that contains the components based on Ant Design.</p>

   <code>npm i antd@4.3.3
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to get Okta’s React library to help manage your authentication.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-react@3.0.2
</code>   

<p>You’ll also need the React Router package for the web from npm.</p>

   <code>npm i react-router-dom@5.2.0
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will want to use <code>dotenv</code> to store your sensitive values in the <code>.env</code> file. This file can be added to your <code>.gitignore</code>.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>After <code>dotenv</code> is completed you can add a new file to your root directory called <code>.env</code>. Add the following code to it. <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE</code> is the same that you use to log in to create your application. <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID</code> is the ClientId that you obtained after creating your application on Okta’s developer console.</p>

   <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE={yourOktaDomain}
REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code>   

 Add Your React Components 

<p>The basic setup is done and it’s time to start putting Ant Design of React to work. Add a new folder in your <code>src</code> directory called <code>Components</code>. In this folder add a new file called <code>LoginForm.jsx</code>. Add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import OktaAuth from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

import { Form, Input, Button, Alert, Row, Col } from 'antd';

const LoginForm = ({ baseUrl, issuer }) =&gt; {

  const { authService } = useOktaAuth();
  const [sessionToken, setSessionToken] = useState();
  const [username, setUsername] = useState();
  const [password, setPassword] = useState();
  const [error, setError] = useState();

  const handleSubmit = (e) =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault();

    const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({ url: baseUrl, issuer: issuer });
    oktaAuth.signIn({ username, password })
      .then(res =&gt; setSessionToken(res.sessionToken))
      .catch(err =&gt; setError(err));
  };

  const layout = {
    labelCol: { span: 8 },
    wrapperCol: { span: 8 },
  };

  const tailLayout = {
    wrapperCol: { offset: 8, span: 16 },
  };

  const handleUsernameChange = (e) =&gt; {
    setUsername(e.target.value);
  };

  const handlePasswordChange = (e) =&gt; {
    setPassword(e.target.value);
  };

  if (sessionToken) {
    authService.redirect({ sessionToken });
    return null;
  }

  const errorAlert = error ? &lt;Row&gt;
    &lt;Col span="8"&gt;&lt;/Col&gt;
    &lt;Col span="8"&gt;
      &lt;Alert message="Authentication Failed" type="warning"&gt;&lt;/Alert&gt;
    &lt;/Col&gt;
  &lt;/Row&gt; : ''

  return (
    &lt;Form
      {...layout}
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
    &gt;

      &lt;Row&gt;
        &lt;Col span="8"&gt;&lt;/Col&gt;
        &lt;Col span="8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please Login with your Okta Account&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/Col&gt;
      &lt;/Row&gt;

      &lt;Form.Item
        label="Username"
        name="username"
        value={username}
        onChange={handleUsernameChange}
        rules={[{ required: true, message: 'Please input your username!' }]}
      &gt;
        &lt;Input /&gt;
      &lt;/Form.Item&gt;

      &lt;Form.Item
        label="Password"
        name="password"
        value={password}
        onChange={handlePasswordChange}
        rules={[{ required: true, message: 'Please input your password!' }]}
      &gt;
        &lt;Input.Password /&gt;
      &lt;/Form.Item&gt;

      &lt;Form.Item {...tailLayout}&gt;
        &lt;Button type="primary" htmlType="submit" onClick={handleSubmit}&gt;
          Login
        &lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;/Form.Item&gt;

      { errorAlert }

    &lt;/Form&gt;
  );
};
export default LoginForm;
</code>   

<p>This component is a basic login form with username and password fields along with a button and some validation. You can see that your components are imported from the Ant library. Rows and Cols are fairly self-explanatory. One note is that Ant uses a 24-cell grid rather than the 12-cell grid you may be used to from Bootstrap. The form component here has some layout options and an override for the submit. You are tying into the submission to use Okta’s React package for authentication. Ant also provides <code>Form.Item</code> components. These components can have their own validation rules right on the component. Finally, you have an <code>Alert</code> component that will flash a simple validation message if the authentication fails.</p>

<p>Next, you can add a new file in <code>Components</code> called <code>SiteHeader.jsx</code>. The code follows.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { Layout, Menu } from 'antd'

const { Header } = Layout;

const SiteHeader = (props) =&gt; {
  const {authState, authService} = useOktaAuth();

  if (authState.isAuthenticated) {
    return (
      &lt;Header&gt;
        &lt;div className="logo"/&gt;
        &lt;Menu theme="dark" mode="horizontal" defaultSelectedKeys={[props.selectedKey]}&gt;
          &lt;Menu.Item key="dashboard"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/Menu.Item&gt;
          &lt;Menu.Item key="logout" onClick={() =&gt; {
            authService.logout()
          }}&gt;Logout&lt;/Menu.Item&gt;
        &lt;/Menu&gt;
      &lt;/Header&gt;
    );
  } else {
    return (
      &lt;Header&gt;
        &lt;div className="logo"/&gt;
        &lt;Menu theme="dark" mode="horizontal" defaultSelectedKeys={[props.selectedKey]}&gt;
          &lt;Menu.Item key="home"&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/Menu.Item&gt;
          &lt;Menu.Item key="login"&gt;&lt;a href="/Login"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/Menu.Item&gt;
        &lt;/Menu&gt;
      &lt;/Header&gt;
    );
  }
};
export default SiteHeader;
</code>   

<p>To avoid a naming conflict with the <code>Header</code> component from <code>antd</code>, this component is called <code>SiteHeader</code>. This component will be placed at the top of each of your pages. The component uses Okta to check the <code>authState</code> and chooses which menu to show. Here is your first exposure to the <code>Menu</code> component provided by Ant. You are passing a <code>selectedKey</code> into the props of this component to set the <code>defaultSelectedKeys</code>. This property will highlight the selected menu item to make it clear to the user what page they are on.</p>

<p>Finally, add a new component called <code>SiteFooter.jsx</code>. Add the following code to it:</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Layout } from 'antd';

const { Footer } = Layout;

const SiteFooter = (props) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Footer style={{textAlign: 'center'}}&gt;Ant Design ©2020 Created with Ant Design of React using Okta by &lt;a
      target="_blank" href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/Footer&gt;
  );

}

export default SiteFooter;
</code>   

 Create Your Pages 

<p>Now you can use these components to help build your pages. Create a new folder in your <code>src</code> directory called <code>Pages</code>. Add a new file for <code>Home.jsx</code> first.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import SiteHeader from '../Components/SiteHeader'
import SiteFooter from '../Components/SiteFooter';
import { Layout, Row, Col, Card } from 'antd';
import { SearchOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons';

const Home = () =&gt; {

  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();
  const { Content } = Layout;
  const { Meta } = Card;

  return (authState.isAuthenticated ?
    &lt;Redirect to={{ pathname: '/Dashboard' }} /&gt; :

    &lt;Layout&gt;
      &lt;SiteHeader selectedKey='home'&gt; &lt;/SiteHeader&gt;
      &lt;Content&gt;
        &lt;Row style={{ padding: 20 }}&gt;
          &lt;Col span="4"&gt;&lt;/Col&gt;
          &lt;Col span="4"&gt;&lt;/Col&gt;
        &lt;/Row&gt;

        &lt;Row style={{ padding: 20 }}&gt;
          &lt;Col span="4"&gt;&lt;/Col&gt;
          &lt;Col style={{ padding: 10 }} span="4"&gt;

      &lt;SiteFooter&gt;&lt;/SiteFooter&gt;
    &lt;/Layout&gt;
  );
};
export default Home;
</code>   

<p>Here you see the usage of the <code>selectedKey</code> property on the <code>SiteHeader</code>. As you’ll recall this property will be set on the <code>defaultSelectedKeys</code> property of the <code>Menu</code> component. You are also checking the <code>authState</code> here and redirecting the user to their dashboard page if they are already logged in.</p>

<p>You can also see the <code>Layout</code> and <code>Content</code> section. Ant Design provides many well-designed examples for the basic layout of your page. The home page (and the login page) will have a simple Header/Content/Footer layout.</p>

<p>Next, you can add the <code>Login.jsx</code> page which will make use of your <code>LoginForm</code> component.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Redirect } from 'react-router-dom';
import LoginForm from '../Components/LoginForm'
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';
import SiteHeader from '../Components/SiteHeader';
import SiteFooter from '../Components/SiteFooter';
import { Layout } from 'antd';

const { Content } = Layout;

const Login = ({ baseUrl, issuer }) =&gt; {
  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();

  if (authState.isPending) {
    return &lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;;
  }
  return authState.isAuthenticated ?
    &lt;Redirect to={{ pathname: '/Dashboard' }} /&gt; :
    &lt;Layout&gt;
      &lt;SiteHeader selectedKey="login"&gt;&lt;/SiteHeader&gt;
      &lt;Content&gt;
        &lt;LoginForm baseUrl={baseUrl} issuer={issuer} /&gt;
      &lt;/Content&gt;

      &lt;SiteFooter&gt;&lt;/SiteFooter&gt;
    &lt;/Layout&gt;
};

export default Login;
</code>   

<p>Again you are passing the <code>selectedKey</code> value of login to the <code>SiteHeader</code> component. This page also checks an authenticated user and moves the user to the <code>Dashboard</code> page.</p>

<p>Finally, add <code>Dashboard.jsx</code> to your <code>Pages</code> folder and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React, { Component } from 'react';

          &lt;/Content&gt;

          &lt;SiteFooter&gt;&lt;/SiteFooter&gt;
        &lt;/Layout&gt;
      &lt;/Layout &gt;
    );
  }
};
export default Dashboard;
</code>   

<p>The layout here is a little more exotic. You are adding a sidebar menu, called a <code>Sider</code> in Ant Design, that will contain the user’s accounts. You can see at the top of this file you added some sample data to display on this page. There are three accounts. Of course, the <code>Sider</code> menu also accepts <code>defaultSelectedKeys</code> which you are setting to the first account unless a specific account is passed into this page. The <code>Sider</code> is collapsible, providing a collapse button on the bottom of the menu. The <code>Breadcrumb</code> navigation can help users navigate on more complex web structures. This app is simple enough that the breadcrumbs are mostly for show, but they can be instrumental if your users are going to navigate down multiple paths.</p>

<p>You’ll see here you are also using the Row/Col paradigm that you are likely familiar with. In keeping with the 24-grid system, your column spans add up to 24, although the last column isn’t necessary. Finally, you are making use of the <code>Table</code> component provided by Ant Design of React. The table accepts a data source and some column definitions and uses these to generate a table for you. No more loops or maps in your code. The column definitions are very robust. In this example, you are presenting the user with some tags that describe the transactions. Because these tags are in an array you need to use the <code>render</code> function on the column definition to tell Ant what to do with this. In this case, you are creating a <code>Tag</code> for each tag in your array. A sorter on your <code>Amount</code> column allows the user to sort by the transaction amount.</p>

 Set up your App.js 

<p>Finally, you will need to define your routes and set up your <code>App.js</code> file. First, add a new file to the <code>src</code> folder called <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Route, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import Home from './Pages/Home'
import Dashboard from './Pages/Dashboard'
import Login from './Pages/Login'

const AppWithRouterAccess = () =&gt; {
  const history = useHistory();
  const onAuthRequired = () =&gt; {
    history.push('/login');
  };

  const baseDomain = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_URL_BASE;
  const issuer = baseDomain + '/oauth2/default'
  const clientId = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID;
  const redirect = process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_APP_BASE_URL + '/login/callback';

  return (
    &lt;Security issuer={issuer}
              clientId={clientId}
              redirectUri={redirect}
              onAuthRequired={onAuthRequired}
              pkce={true}&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/' exact={true} component={Home}/&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/login' render={() =&gt; &lt;Login baseUrl={baseDomain} issuer={issuer}/&gt;}/&gt;
      &lt;SecureRoute path='/Dashboard' exact={true} component={Dashboard}/&gt;
      &lt;Route path='/login/callback' component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
};

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>This is where you tie together the magic of Okta. By defining <code>Dashboard</code> as a <code>SecureRoute</code> to ensure that the application will check for authentication before allowing the user to process. The function <code>onAuthRequest()</code> is passed into the <code>Security</code> component and moves the user to the <code>Login</code> page if the user isn’t authenticated. The rest of the routes are defined here as well, including one for <code>/login/callback</code> which Okta will use when returning user information to your application.</p>

<p>You need to make your <code>App.js</code> show the application rather than the boilerplate react page.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import AppWithRouterAccess from './AppWithRouterAccess';
import './App.css'

const App = () =&gt; { 
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;AppWithRouterAccess/&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>And finally, you will need to import the Ant Design CSS. To do this, open your <code>App.css</code> file and add the line <code>@import '~antd/dist/antd.css';</code> to the top of the file.</p>

 Run and Test 

<p>Your application is now complete. In the terminal run the command <code>npm start</code> and see the results. You should be presented with the Home page. From here you can click on Login and use your Okta credentials to log in. Afterward, you will be directed to the dashboard page.</p>

<p>Honestly, there is far more to Ant Design than what you have read here. One could take an entire course on the subject. But Ant can help developers understand what components they should be using and why. The principles developed of studies of human behavior can streamline the design process and make developers certain of which tools to use. I encourage you to try a couple of projects in Ant Design and take the time to learn the principles. In the long run, the knowledge and experience will make you that much better.</p>

The pandemic has changed the way we work, play, and connect, accelerating brewing trends. What was once a ten-year horizon has transpired overnight, the domain of nerds and early adopters suddenly mainstream. And Zoom is one of the hottest stocks around because it’s all about video. The thing is, this is just the beginning. <p>Here’s a great overview from the Telegraph via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> (pdf attached):</p><blockquote>If Wu and other start-ups get their way, Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams will one day seem like the Model T of video calling services: functional and pioneering, but primitive. As the stubborn coronavirus continues, and the likelihood of increasing reliance on screens even after it passes, investors and entrepreneurs are now going through an explosion of dedicated video apps intended to replace today’s one-size-fits-all services.</blockquote><p>In a sense, it’s not so different from how Ayo thinks about fintech (re: vertical neobanks). One-size-fits-all is a reasonable way to start. But it’s only a matter of time before fine-tuned UX for specific target groups will rule the&nbsp;roost.</p>Photo: cottonbro<blockquote>Cannon says Zoom fulfils the specific and valuable task it was designed for: virtual workplace meetings. But it was not designed for classrooms, doctors’ appointments, live concerts or hen parties, all of which it has been co-opted for in the last six&nbsp;months.</blockquote><blockquote>The most recent batch of companies at Y Combinator, the leading Silicon Valley start-up school that is seen as a barometer of new tech trends, had at least a dozen video-related services. They ranged from Together, a video chat app for grandparents and grandchildren that includes games and bedtime stories, to Zuddl, for holding and streaming large business conferences online.</blockquote><blockquote>Another, Rally, aims to let people hold parties online without everyone shouting over one another: individuals can “take the stage”, for example when delivering a speech, or groups can split off into “tables”, where the muffled noise of the rest of the party can still be heard in the background.</blockquote><blockquote>Former yoga teacher Rachel Lea Fishman founded Sutra, which lets fitness instructors host classes online, earlier this year. The service was originally designed to let instructors rent out space and host classes, but was forced to shift to video as coronavirus closed&nbsp;gyms.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together/">Facebook introduces a co-viewing experience in Messenger, ‘Watch Together’ — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/know-identity-digital-forum-recap-identitys-role-re-opening-the-economy/">KNOW Identity Digital Forum Recap: Identity’s Role in Re-Opening the Economy — One World&nbsp;Identity</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a> — <a href="https://www.netflix.com/si/title/81254224">The Social Dilemma | Netflix Official&nbsp;Site</a>  <a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-reports-second-quarter-results-fiscal-year-2021/">Zoom is killin’&nbsp;it</a>   2.

We’ll dive into this later in the week with the Book&nbsp;Club.</p> 3. The last decade of tech has naturally gravitated us towards a more dystopian outlook on technology, further emphasized by popular culture with TV shows like Black Mirror and books like The Circle. Given the outcomes, challenges, and unintended consequences of this last cycle of tech, the reaction feels natural. But maybe it’s time for a more positive narratives to take hold to balance all the negativity. <p>Here’s <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20200901&amp;instance_id=21808&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=37277&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fdb7a24ca-9d2d-586c-b9ec-d10ceb772efd&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Sriram Krishnan, a technology executive whom I respect, tweeted a few days ago asking for more optimistic descriptions in movies and television of people building technology. He didn’t put it quite this way, but I imagined he wanted less fiction like “The Circle,” about a surveillance-state corporate cult, and more like “Iron Man,” in which a tech nerd cobbles together a suit that saves his life and gives him superhero powers.</blockquote><blockquote>I get what Krishnan is saying, and there’s a bigger meaning behind it. Right now, there’s a lot of pessimism about the harm of social media, the creepiness of digital surveillance of our smartphones and our faces and the nefarious power of tech&nbsp;giants.</blockquote><blockquote>Those downers sometimes drown out the ways that we know technology has made many of our lives immeasurably better. Both “The Circle” and “Iron Man” encompass some form of reality, but it’s easy to see technology as either one or the&nbsp;other.</blockquote><p>Which I believe is very apt for the work we’re trying to do here at GlobaliD. Technology shouldn’t force you to undermine your values or concede your individuality. There’s a hugely positive story to tell here and we’re writing it every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Speaking of which — why <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-15c454b7-d99f-4cdc-bfb2-ccbb2a66d76f.html">telling that story in the right way from day one is so important</a>:</p><blockquote>Zuckerberg says he regrets not explaining Facebook’s free-speech ideals from the&nbsp;start.</blockquote><blockquote>“I just wish that I’d spent more time earlier on communicating about what our principles are and what we stand for — you know, things like free expression and voice and that we’re going to defend&nbsp;those.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Now a lot of people look at us and they see this as a successful company. With a lot of money. And it’s a little hard now, I think, for us to go back and talk about our principles and have people see the principles for anything but, you know, some talking&nbsp;points.”</blockquote> 4. Along with video, the pandemic has also put a spotlight on digital identity. <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/09/05/covid-19-strengthens-the-case-for-digital-id-cards">The Economist</a>:</p><blockquote>In countries without a system of secure digital identities, the closure of bricks-and-mortar government offices and the shift of public services online have caused havoc (see article). Divorces and adoptions have run into a virtual brick wall. Italy’s system for doling out emergency payments crashed and then demanded paperwork that applicants could not obtain because government offices were shut. In America, Washington state paid $650m in unemployment insurance to fraudsters who made applications using stolen identities.</blockquote><blockquote>No such havoc occurred in Estonia, a tiny Baltic state where every citizen has an electronic identity. More than just an identity card, it links every Estonian’s records together. So when the government created a furlough system for workers affected by the pandemic, it already knew where they worked and how to pay them. Nobody in Estonia had to join a queue on a pavement to claim benefits, as people in other places&nbsp;did.</blockquote><p>See also: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2020/08/29/apple-pay-was-not-disruptive-but-apple-id-will-be/">Apple Pay Was Not Disruptive But Apple ID Will Be</a> (via&nbsp;Luka)</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/u-k-digital-id-tool-passes-big-test/">U.K. digital ID tool passes big test — SecureIDNews</a>  Phil Windley — <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a>  <a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=51193&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=94620315&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--JebTsL19WdjcZszHMnrGsAJaWvma_91VeJzQhDEJ5plstlAwLi73eXBJyhR9l6qP7rxqHSI6_UDJSzBZJM1ea2cPJCA&amp;utm_content=94620315&amp;utm_source=hs_email">LG CNS to Take Lead in Developing Next-generation Digital Identification Technology</a>   5.

 And how zero-trust biometric solutions can help you transition to a more secure digital workplace <p>We’re rapidly approaching a future fueled by digital technology — one where users and employees frequently access private systems outside the security perimeters of a workplace.</p><p>Traditional security systems, which are flawed to begin with, fail to offer adequate protection from cyber threats outside of the security perimeters of a workplace.</p><p>To properly secure remote working environments, organizations must start thinking about implementing radically different security&nbsp;models.</p> In this article, we’ll&nbsp;cover:   Traditional security models and their&nbsp;failings  Zero-trust security&nbsp;models  A biometric multi-factor authentication alternative   What are traditional security&nbsp;models? <p>Traditional security models refer mainly to perimeter network firewalls.</p><p>Firewalls were designed to protect corporate systems from malicious attacks by erecting security defenses that ward off threats from outside of the perimeters of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Security experts often refer to this as the “castle and moat” approach. The idea is based on the assumption that anyone outside the “moat” (firewall), cannot be trusted; and that anyone in the “castle” (the network) can&nbsp;be.</p> The issue with this approach is that it assumes anyone within the network can be&nbsp;trusted.  This is problematic for two&nbsp;reasons:   The assumption that everyone inside a network is trusted leaves organization’s vulnerable to insider-orchestrated attacks  This approach fails to protect organizations when employees are accessing systems from outside the security perimeters of a firewall. With the dramatic increase in remote work — firewalls are not just weak, they’re redundant.  <p>Remote-work security is traditionally tackled with VPNs, but with the rising adoption of smart technology comes the proliferation of security backdoors — greatly increasing the likelihood of a hacker successfully breaching a corporate network via poorly protected remote&nbsp;devices.</p><p>If a hacker compromises one smart-device within a home network, then the potential to launch further attacks on other devices (used to access company systems) greatly increases. In theory, hackers could potentially hijack a user’s device, steal their login credentials, and use them to bypass a&nbsp;VPN.</p> Hackers only need to find the weakest entry point to a network in order to infiltrate it. <p>Once a hacker has gained access to a network, they’re then free to move laterally within the network until reaching a target — usually a highly sensitive database that contains the private data of users, employees or&nbsp;clients.</p><p>According to IBM, the average breach went <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-07-23-IBM-Study-Shows-Data-Breach-Costs-on-the-Rise-Financial-Impact-Felt-for-Years">unnoticed for up to 206 days</a> (just under six months), giving malicious parties plenty of time to steal such&nbsp;data.</p> Zero-trust security: assume no one is&nbsp;trusted <p>Zero-trust authentication systems take a radically different approach to network security.</p><p>They assume that no-one can be trusted — whether inside a network or not. Therefore anyone attempting to access systems must be authenticated no matter where, when or how they access&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Since no trust is assumed, zero-trust models make a point of frequently authenticating users as they move through a&nbsp;network.</p> Zero-trust solutions protect against insider&nbsp;threats <p>Insider threats and cybersecurity incidents doubled between 2018 and 2019 — meaning it’s absolutely true that not everyone who has permissions to a network can be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Since zero-trust models assume that no one is trusted, they protect organizations from such threats. Insider organized threats can otherwise have large-scale financial and reputational consequences for organizations.</p> Zero-trust multi-factor authentication <p>Zero-trust multi-factor authentication solutions combine the principles of zero-trust security, with the principles of strong authentication.</p><p>Strong authentication, or MFA, improves security by presenting users with at least two different kinds of security challenges.</p><p>For example, an MFA solution may require a user to enter their login credentials, followed by a one-time-password sent to the user’s registered phone&nbsp;number.</p><p>Traditional MFA solutions create a range of user-experience problems when combined with the idea of zero-trust security: having to authenticate at every level of access can be disruptive when the authentication experience is cumbersome.</p><p>Plus, legacy MFA solutions are not immune to threats — since 2015, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/30/bank-customers-lose-91-million-five-years-sim-swap-scams/">customers in the UK lost £9.1 million due to SIM swapping attacks</a>. (SIM swapping is where a bad actor is able to bypass 2FA by having the ‘one-time code’ sent to the victim’s phone number, diverted to a new&nbsp;SIM).</p><p>Read more about security issues with 2FA solutions like YubiKey <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/local-authentication-vs-keyless-pt-1-faceid-and-yubikey-cb1b594d399c">in this&nbsp;article</a>.</p> The Keyless solution: Zero-Knowledge Biometrics <p>At Keyless, we combine multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing secure multiparty computation to provide a passwordless, secure and privacy-first way to authenticate users that is minimally disruptive to the user-experience.</p><p>Our privacy-enhancing biometric authentication solutions offer multi-factor (MFA) security by&nbsp;design:</p>  Keyless verifies users are authenticating from their trusted device. If a device is not registered, the user won’t be able to authenticate.  Keyless uses facial biometrics to verify users across every touchpoint — a universal inherence factor as an added level of security.  Keyless will soon also leverage behavioral biometrics, which serves as another, transparent third authentication factor.  <p>Once a user is registered, all they need to do to access their accounts is look into the camera of their&nbsp;device.</p><p>This simple, user-friendly solution can be implemented at multiple access points, ensuring that only the right users have the right access at the right time, while offering cutting-edge security.</p><p>To protect end-users and organizations against fraudulent takeovers, Keyless leverages advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing techniques, in addition to the built-in multi-factor security. This allows Keyless to ensure that the user is in fact,&nbsp;real.</p><p>Simple, secure, and above all, private authentication</p><p>To recap&nbsp;that’s:</p>  No passwords  No one-time&nbsp;codes  No secret questions  <p>Or in other words that’s nothing to remember, nothing to type, nothing to lose, nothing to forget, nothing to phish and nothing to copy and&nbsp;paste.</p><p>To find out how Keyless’ ZKB™ biometrics work, watch the&nbsp;video!</p> How we protect biometric data <p>Keyless never stores sensitive information on a user’s device or on centralized servers. Instead, encrypted shares of data are stored on the Keyless Network, a distributed cloud&nbsp;network.</p><p>This is possible thanks to our patent-pending technology zero-knowledge biometric (ZKB™) authentication — enabled by the unique combination of state-of-the-art biometrics with <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/how-keyless-uses-zero-knowledge-proofs-to-protect-your-private-data-255d936be4fd">zero-knowledge cryptography</a> and privacy-enhancing <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">multi-party computation.</a></p><p>This breakthrough technology allows Keyless to authenticate users, without needing or being able to access the raw contents of someone’s sensitive information. In other words, we don’t trust anyone, not even ourselves.</p> Request a Free Trial of&nbsp;Keyless <p>Keyless™ authentication can help deliver secure and seamless digital experiences for your end-users and for your increasingly remote workforce.</p><p>Head to our <a href="http://keyless.io/">website</a> to learn more about our biometric authentication and identity management solutions.</p><p><a href="http://www.keyless.io/">www.keyless.io</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can email us directly at <a href="http://info@keyless.io/">info@keyless.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/why-legacy-security-models-dont-work-5ea3b0f192da">Why legacy security models don’t work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>“Are you trying to ensure security for your remote workforce but don’t want to hinder business productivity?” “Are you struggling with identifying risks and gaps in security capabilities?” “Where should CISOs focus time and resources?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security and risk management experts constantly ask these questions, but the real question should be what projects will drive the most business value and reduce risk for the organization in a constantly shifting security landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We can spend too much precious time overanalyzing choices we make about security, striving for this notion of perfect protection that just simply does not exist,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/53783/Brian-Reed">Brian Reed</a>, Sr. Director Analyst, during the virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/security-risk-management-us">Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit, 2020</a>. “We must look beyond basic protection decisions and improve organizational resilience through innovative approaches to detection and response, and ultimately, recovery from security incidents.“</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="28186"]</p>
<p>The key is to prioritize business enablement and reduce risk — and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/security-experts-must-connect-cybersecurity-to-business-outcomes/">communicate those priorities</a> effectively to the business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year’s top 10 security projects, based on Gartner forecasts and adjusted for the impact of COVID-19 — feature eight new projects, focused heavily on risk management and understanding process breakdowns. These projects, which aren’t listed in order of importance, can be executed independently.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 1: Securing your remote workforce 
<p>Focus on business requirements and understand how users and groups access data and applications. Now that a few months have passed since the initial remote push, it’s time for a needs assessment and review of what has changed to determine if access levels are correct and whether any <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-principles-for-employee-privacy/">security measures</a> are actually impeding work.</p>
 No. 2: Risk-based vulnerability management 
<p>Don’t try to patch everything; focus on vulnerabilities that are actually exploitable. Go beyond a bulk assessment of threats and use threat intelligence, attacker activity and internal asset criticality to provide a better view of real organizational risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 No. 3: Extended detection and response (XDR) 
<p>XDR is a unified security and incident response platform that collects and correlates data from multiple proprietary components. The platform-level integration occurs at the point of deployment rather than being added in later. This consolidates multiple security products into one and may help provide better overall security outcomes. Organizations should consider using this technology to simplify and streamline security.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 4: Cloud security posture management 
<p>Organizations need to ensure common controls across IaaS and PaaS, as well as support automated assessment and remediation. Cloud applications are extremely dynamic and need an automated DevSecOps style of security. It can be challenging to secure the public cloud without a means to ensure policy uniformity across cloud security approaches.&nbsp;</p>

 No. 5: Simplify cloud access controls 
<p>Cloud access controls typically are done through a CASB. They offer real-time enforcement through an in-line proxy that can provide policy enforcement and active blocking. CASBs also offer flexibility by, for example, starting out in monitoring mode to better ensure fidelity of traffic and understand security access.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 6: DMARC 
<p>Organizations use email as the single source of verification, and users struggle to determine real messages from fakes. DMARC, or domain-based message authentication, reporting and conformance, is an email authentication policy. DMARC is not a total solution for email security, and should be one piece of a holistic security approach. However, it can offer an additional layer of trust and verification with the sender’s domain. DMARC can help domain spoofing but will not address all email security issues.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 7: Passwordless authentication 
<p>While employees may not think twice about using the same password for their work computer as they do for the personal email, it can cause major security headaches. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-a-passwordless-approach-to-improve-security/">Passwordless authentication</a>, which can functionally work in a few different ways, offers a better solution for security. The goal should be to increase trust and improve the user experience.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 8: Data classification and protection 
<p>All data is not the same. A one-size-fits-all security approach will create areas of too much security and others of too little, increasing the risk for the organization. Start with policies and definitions to get the process right before beginning to layer in the security technologies.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 9: Workforce competencies assessment 
<p>Install the right people with the right skills in the right roles. It’s critical but challenging to combine hard technical skills with softer leadership expertise. There are no perfect candidates, but you can identify five or six must-have competencies for each project. Assess competencies in a range of ways, including cyber-ranging and cybersimulations and softer skill assessments.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 10: Automating security risk assessments&nbsp; 
<p>This is one way to help security teams understand risks related to security operations, new projects or program-level risk. Risk assessment tends to be either skipped entirely or done on a limited basis. These assessments will allow for limited risk automation and visibility into where risk gaps exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>2020 has been a year of immense challenge for organizations, and especially for those tasked with securing them. When COVID-19 swept the world, security and risk leaders were suddenly responsible for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/are-your-new-remote-workers-visible-to-security-operations/">securing remote employees </a>on an extremely aggressive timeline. While some organizations had an established infrastructure for a seamless transition, others were scrambling to supply employees with hardware, often resorting to older machines with less than ideal security parameters.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enterprise project portfolios are changing on the fly, and of course, increasing our risk landscape</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Distracted employees in less-than-ideal work-from-home environments became potential sources of risk, and hackers began exploiting newly presented opportunities. After the initial response, CISOs needed to continue to recommend and guide their businesses, which were operating under unprecedented and daunting conditions.</p>
<p>“Over the past six months, defining risk appetite has become even more of a challenge for security leaders. Enterprise project portfolios are changing on the fly, and of course, increasing our risk landscape,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/28714">Jeffrey Wheatman</a>, VP Analyst, during the opening keynote of the virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/security-risk-management-us">Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit, 2020</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="28186"]</p>
<p>“Security leaders are focusing on reprioritizing projects and initiatives, which involves dropping some, adding and accelerating others, all while trying to hit the moving target of risk appetite.”</p>
 The security risks of 2020 
<p>Even before COVID-19, new and different<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-security-areas-to-focus-on-during-covid-19/"> security challenges</a> were present in 2020. More digital services were being delivered on a global scale and tensions were high in international communities; for example, trade disputes that often incited cyberwars. Further, more digitalization of physical objects means more cyber-physical risks that security and risk leaders must address. And a general increase in digital services with increased customer touchpoints, from banks to utility companies, creates even more vulnerabilities ripe for exploitation by a nefarious party.</p>
<p>And then came COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some industries — travel, retail, entertainment — experienced catastrophic impact, while others — online shopping, telemedicine — saw huge growth. Each of these situations comes with unique security and risk challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial scramble to keep businesses operating, people working and money moving afforded an opportunity to identify new risks, reassign resources and shift investments to meet outcomes. Now that organizations have moved past the initial response phase, security and risk leaders can review what was done and identify new risks on the horizon — as well as new opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
 The drive to digital business 
<p>New opportunities bring with them new risks, and CISOs worry the business will fail to prepare for some of them. The Gartner CEO survey revealed that 82% of CEOs have a digital transformation or management initiative, up from 62% in 2018. However, a Gartner survey of CISOs found that while 90% of respondents believe digital business will create new types and new levels of risk, 70% felt the investment in risk management was not keeping up with the newer higher level of risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is that the business continues to value cybersecurity as an essential function and executives will look to CISOs to secure the business and limit risk, while also enabling opportunities for technology to transform operating models. This is especially important as CEOs look to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">accelerate digital business</a> to survive and thrive in a post-COVID-19 environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal should be to balance risk, trust and opportunity as businesses and organizations enter the “renew” stage of pandemic planning. New technologies will help accelerate and guide this process, whether it’s XDR or the rapidly increasing push to cloud, or what role automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will play as the world reacclimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your disciplines are fundamental to addressing the risks inherent in the technology solutions your enterprises are embracing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, at the beginning of 2020, a large government agency responsible for gathering, analyzing and storing immense amounts of personal data started the year with a slate of 19 active security projects. Once COVID started to ramp up, the agency realized it would be unable to sustain the work effort. But when the organization reframed its approach to security projects with a renewed focus on balancing risk, trust and opportunity, the team was able to narrow the list to just nine active projects — including three new opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a renewed mindset and focus on balance, security and risk leaders must guide and drive the business to remain secure and limit risk as they accelerate digital and move into a new phase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As risk and security experts, you cannot change the course of the major disruptions impacting your enterprises,” said Wheatman. “But your disciplines are fundamental to addressing the risks inherent in the technology solutions your enterprises are embracing to help them recover and renew in the post-pandemic era — and with your expertise in identifying, assessing and managing the new risks inherent in these technologies, the opportunity to succeed is endless.”</p>

   Symantec Enterprise: With more informed decisions comes more automated security. 
<p>In today’s Zero Trust world, where the principle of least privilege is ubiquitous, enterprises are struggling to balance security while simultaneously enabling a highly agile business environment. There has always been friction with security and making highly specific security decisions quickly and efficiently contributes to this. Moreover, decision-making in enterprises exists on a spectrum from completely manual to completely automated. Regardless of where your organization resides on this scale, you are moving more and more towards automation--whether you know it or not. The real question is, as your business becomes more agile, how can you keep your security posture from falling off a cliff?</p>
<p>Traditional security tools can help with decision-making, but oftentimes there isn’t enough data to automate this decision-making process, or there isn’t enough confidence with the data that does exist. This results in a lot of manual effort, which cannot be supported by overworked and understaffed security teams. The solution to this challenge is more data; the more data you have, the more informed any automated decision will be to grant access (and specifically which type of access). Thus, from a Zero Trust standpoint more data is almost always better, and as we move towards a more secure enterprise environment, it will be essential to draw on data from numerous sources, including access requests, authentication, authorization, session activity, user behavior, etc. The more data, the clearer the picture - the clearer the picture, the safer and faster the decision.</p>
<p>But where do we collect this data? The answer is, you already have some of it - you just aren’t leveraging it. The data that your existing identity and access management solutions are collecting while they are continuously monitoring user access and activity is invaluable. This data might include things like login times, login locations, associated roles/access, etc. But the marginal benefits of additional data, which might initially seem irrelevant, should not be underestimated. For example, suppose we gather average session data for users, which on its own might not be predictive of risk. It could be that longer average session time combined with administrator access is the single most predictive measure of malicious behavior, but if we don’t bother collecting the data, we’d never know that.</p>
<p>The upside of collecting and consolidating identity and other data is that machine learning tools can continually analyze this data to search for new patterns that enable more informed decisions. These tools are capable of learning not only which data is valuable for risk assessment at any given time, but also how to apply that risk assessment to make informed security decisions. And through more informed decisions comes more automated security, which enables business agility.</p>
<p>At Broadcom, we are focused on a future state where all data inputs - from authorization, access requests, authentication, session monitoring, and contextual user behavior - are used at the business level. <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/info/symantec/global-intelligence-network">Symantec’s Global Intelligence Network</a> (GIN) is one of the largest civilian data repositories in existence, providing an extraordinary amount of data to inform security decisions. As the mindset of security has evolved, we are capable of making much more granular decisions with a greater level of context, creating and enforcing policies that are highly contextual. We are evolving beyond identity, because the data we gather allows businesses to function at the next level.</p>

  <p>The creator of Node.js, Ryan Dahl has authored a new framework for designing web applications. He went back and fixed some mistakes he made in hindsight, taking advantage of new technologies that were not available at the time he originally wrote Node. The result is <a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a> (pronounced DEH-no), a framework for writing “Node-like” web applications in TypeScript. Here, I will walk you through creating a basic web application with authentication.</p>

<p>You can find almost all the information you need at the Deno website—along with information on all the third-party libraries that are currently available for Deno. That is really the biggest drawback to the framework right now. It just hit version 1.0 on May 13th of 2020, so even though there are quite a few essential libraries, there are not nearly as many libraries as there are for Node. For those who are proficient in Node however, the transition to Deno should be pretty easy.</p>

<p>You can find the installation instructions at <a href="https://deno.land/#installation">https://deno.land/#installation</a>.</p>

 Create Your Deno Application 

<p>There aren’t any basic scaffolding libraries that I could find, so I just started with an empty folder. In the application’s root folder, create a file called <code>index.ts</code> that will be the starting point of your Deno application. You’ll use <a href="https://deno.land/x/opine">Opine</a>, which is an Express clone for Deno to make building and routing easier.</p>

<p>One thing that is different about Deno is that there are no package managers for bringing in third-party libraries. You do this by using the library’s full URL. Do that at the top of the <code>index.ts</code> file, then set up a basic web application.</p>

   <code>import { opine } from 'https://deno.land/x/opine@0.12.0/mod.ts';

const app = opine();

app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.send('Deno Sample');
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log('running on port 3000');
</code>   

<p>You can then run this very basic application by going to the terminal in the application’s folder and entering:</p>

   <code>deno run -A index.ts
</code>   

<p>The <code>-A</code> is a shortcut for development purposes. Deno is completely locked down by default, so you’ll need to pass arguments to the <code>run</code> command to allow access like <code>--allow-net</code> to allow networking, and <code>--allow-read</code> to allow the application to read from the file system. The <code>-A</code> used here allows everything, effectively disabling all security. When you run this application and then go to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> you should be greeted with Deno Sample on a blank page.</p>

 Build a Real Web Application with Deno 

<p>While this is a good first step, it’s not very useful. You’ll want to add some real functionality that’s a little more “real-world”, so change the <code>index.ts</code> file so that the contents are:</p>

   <code>import { opine, serveStatic } from 'https://deno.land/x/opine@0.12.0/mod.ts';
import { renderFileToString } from 'https://deno.land/x/dejs@0.7.0/mod.ts';
import { join, dirname } from 'https://deno.land/x/opine@main/deps.ts';

import { ensureAuthenticated } from './middleware/authmiddleware.ts';
import users from './controllers/usercontroller.ts';
import auth from './controllers/authcontroller.ts';

const app = opine();
const __dirname = dirname(import.meta.url);

app.engine('.html', renderFileToString);
app.use(serveStatic(join(__dirname, 'public')));
app.set('view engine', 'html');

app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Deno Sample' });
});

app.use('/users', ensureAuthenticated, users);
app.use('/auth', auth)

app.listen(3000);
console.log('running on port 3000');
</code>   

<p>You’ll notice some more <code>import</code> statements which bring  in some third-party libraries. Here, I am using <a href="https://deno.land/x/dejs">dejs</a> which is an <a>EJS</a> port for Deno. I’ve also included some utility classes from the Opine library for manipulating directory names. I will explain what the three files imported locally are in a moment. For now, just know that you’re importing them.</p>

<p>The line below the instantiation of the <code>opine()</code> app creates a reference to the local directory. The three lines below use this to set the view engine to DEJS for processing the HTML-like files, similar to the way EJS does for Node. The next section has been changed slightly to render one of those HTML template files, and the last two lines bring in some external routes. One thing of note is that the <code>/users</code> route has an <code>ensureAuthenticated()</code> middleware function. This will force users to log in before being allowed to visit the page. You’ll create that middleware shortly.</p>

 Fill In Your Deno Application 

<p>Now, you’ll want to create some of the missing pieces that you imported above. Start with the routes. Create a folder called <code>controllers</code> in the root of the application. Then add a <code>usercontroller.ts</code> file inside that folder with the following contents:</p>

   <code>import { Router } from 'https://deno.land/x/opine@0.12.0/mod.ts';

const users = new Router();

// users routes
users.get('/me', (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.render('users/me', { title: 'My Profile', user: res.app.locals.user });
});

export default users;
</code>   

<p>This is a simple routing file. It gets the router from Opine and creates a new instance to hang routes from. Then there is code to add a route for <code>/me</code> to render the HTML view in <code>users/me</code>. The <code>render()</code> call also passes a title and the logged-in user to the page. This page will be protected so that there will always be a user to pass to the page.</p>

<p>Next, create some views to show when the routes are hit. In the root folder, add a <code>views</code> folder. Inside that, create a <code>shared</code> folder and a <code>users</code> folder. In the <code>shared</code> folder create a <code>header.html</code> and <code>footer.html</code> file. In the <code>users</code> folder add a <code>me.html</code> file. Finally, in the <code>views</code> folder itself create an <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

<p>These are pretty bare-bones, but it demonstrates how to create views that can be reused by other views. In the <code>shared/header.html</code> file add the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;&lt;%= title %&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
</code>   

<p>This outputs the top of an HTML page and injects the title into the page. Next, add the following to the <code>shared/footer.html</code> file:</p>

   <code>&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now you can use those partials in the <code>index.html</code> file:</p>

   <code>&lt;%- await include('views/shared/header.html', { title }); %&gt;

&lt;a href="/users/me"&gt;My Profile&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;%- await include('views/shared/footer.html'); %&gt;
</code>   

<p>This includes the footer and header partials and adds a link to the profile page. The contents of the <code>users/me.html</code> file are:</p>

   <code>&lt;%- await include('views/shared/header.html', { title }); %&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;% for(var p in user){ %&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;%= p %&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;%= user[p] %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;%- await include('views/shared/footer.html'); %&gt;
</code>   

<p>Again, this page includes the header and footer, and loops through the properties of the <code>user</code> object. Granted, it’s not a super-sexy profile page, but it will let you know that the authentication steps all worked.</p>

 Add Authentication with Okta 

<p>If you don’t already have an Okta account, you can get a free developer account <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">here</a>. Once you’ve signed into Okta, you’ll land on the dashboard. You’ll need to create an Okta application to take advantage of Okta as an Identity Provider for your project.</p>

<p>Click on Applications in the menu, then Add Application. This will take you to the application wizard. Choose Web for your platform, then click Next. The next page is the Application Settings page. Give your application a name (I named mine DenoExample). Change all the URLs to use port <code>3000</code> instead of <code>8080</code>, then change the Login Redirect URIs to <code>http://localhost:3000/auth/callback</code>. This is a route you’ll be implementing shortly. Finally, click Done to finish creating the application in Okta.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you’re on the page for your newly-created application, make sure you’re on the General Settings tab and scroll to the bottom until you see a Client Credentials section. You’ll be using these values momentarily, so keep this window open.</p>

<p>Back in your application, create a new file in the root of the application called <code>.env</code>. The contents of the file will be:</p>

   <code>issuer=https://{yourOktaOrgUrl}/oauth2/default
clientId={yourClientID}
clientSecret={yourClientSecret}
redirectUrl=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
state=SuPeR-lOnG-sEcReT
</code>   

<p>Copy the Client ID and Client Secret from the Client Credentials section of your Okta application. Then go back to the dashboard and copy your Okta org URL from the right-hand side just below the menu.</p>

<p>Now you’re ready to start talking to Okta for authentication. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any OpenID Connect (OIDC) libraries to make authentication with OAuth 2.0 and OIDC easier than this, so you’ll have to create it by hand. However, this can be an awesome exercise to help understand how OAuth and OIDC work. In the root folder of your application, create a new folder called <code>middleware</code> and add a file called <code>authmiddleware.ts</code>. Then add this content:</p>

   <code>import { config } from 'https://deno.land/x/dotenv/mod.ts';

export const ensureAuthenticated = async (req:any, res:any, next:any) =&gt; {
  const user = req.app.locals.user;
  if (!user) {
    const reqUrl = req.originalUrl;
    const {issuer, clientId, redirectUrl, state} = config();
    const authUrl = `${issuer}/v1/authorize?client_id=${clientId}&amp;response_type=code&amp;scope=openid%20email%20profile&amp;redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(redirectUrl)}&amp;state=${state}:${reqUrl}`;
    res.location(authUrl).sendStatus(302);
  }
  next();
}
</code>   

<p>First, bring a library for reading the <code>.env</code> file. The <a href="https://deno.land/x/dotenv">dotenv</a> does this beautifully. Then you’ll implement the <code>ensureAuthenticated()</code> middleware that starts the first step of the authentication process. First, it checks to make sure the user isn’t already logged in. If they are, it just calls <code>next()</code> because there is nothing to do.</p>

<p>If there isn’t a currently logged in user, it builds a URL made up of the issuer, clientId, redirectUrl, and state properties from the <code>.env</code> file. It makes a call to the <code>/v1/authorize</code> endpoint of the issuer’s URL. It then redirects to that URL. This is a login page hosted by Okta. Kind of like when you’re redirected to Google to log in with Google as the identity provider. The URL that it will call when login is done is the <code>http://localhost:3000/auth/callback</code> URL that’s in the <code>.env</code> file. I’ve also tagged the original URL that the user was going to when they were redirected to the <code>state</code> query parameter. This will make it easy to direct them back there once they’ve logged in.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll need to implement the <code>auth/callback</code> route to handle the result from the login page and exchange the authorization code that you’ll receive from Okta. Create a file called <code>authcontroller.ts</code> in the <code>controllers</code> folder with the contents:</p>

   <code>import { Router } from 'https://deno.land/x/opine@0.12.0/mod.ts';
import { config } from "https://deno.land/x/dotenv/mod.ts";

const auth = new Router();

// users routes
auth.get('/callback', async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const { issuer, clientId, clientSecret, redirectUrl, state } = config();
 
  if (req.query.state.split(':')[0] !== state) {
    res.send('State code does not match.').sendStatus(400);
  }
 
  const tokenUrl: string = `${issuer}/v1/token`;
  const code: string = req.query.code;
 
  const headers = new Headers();
  headers.append('Accept', 'application/json');
  headers.append('Authorization', `Basic ${btoa(clientId + ':' + clientSecret)}`);
  headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
 
  const response = await fetch(tokenUrl, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: headers,
    body: `grant_type=authorization_code&amp;redirect_uri=${encodeURIComponent(redirectUrl)}&amp;code=${code}`
  });
 
  const data = await response.json();
  if (response.status !== 200) {
    res.send(data);
  }
  const user = parseJwt(data.id_token);
  req.app.locals.user = user;
  req.app.locals.isAuthenticated = true;
  res.location(req.query.state.split(':')[1] || '/').sendStatus(302);
});

function parseJwt(token:string) {
  const base64Url = token.split('.')[1];
  const base64 = base64Url.replace(/-/g, '+').replace(/_/g, '/');
  const jsonPayload = decodeURIComponent(atob(base64).split('').map(function(c) {
    return '%' + ('00' + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
  }).join(''));

  return JSON.parse(jsonPayload);
};

export default auth;
</code>   

<p>There is actually a lot less going on here than you might think. First, the imports bring in the <code>Router</code> from Opine and read in the <code>.env</code> file again. Then they instantiate the router like in the <code>usercontroller.ts</code> file. The next thing I did was deconstruct the config object  to make it easier to use the values. Next, I checked the <code>state</code> query parameter to make sure it matches. This helps ensure that Okta is the one who sent the authorization code. Then the authorization code gets pulled off the query string with <code>req.query.code</code>.</p>

<p>What happens next is a call to the token endpoint. You’ll send the authorization code in a <code>POST</code> request to Okta to exchange for an ID Token. So, here I’ve built some headers for the request. The most important is the <code>Authorization</code> header that has a value of <code>Basic {yourClientId}:{yourClientSecret}</code> the client ID and secret are base64 encoded. Then the <code>POST</code> call is finally made to the token endpoint with those headers and a body with a <code>grant_type</code> of <code>authorization_code</code>—the same redirect URL as before—and the authorization code I just received from Okta.</p>

<p>The <code>fetch()</code> call returns a promise resolved with the <code>then()</code> function. I get the <code>response</code> object’s JSON value, make sure the call was successful, parse the <code>id_token</code> value with the <code>parseJwt()</code> function below and stick it into a local variable called <code>user</code>. Finally, the user is sent to the URL they originally requested before being redirected for authentication.</p>

 Run the Deno Application 

<p>You can now run the application from the terminal again with:</p>

   <code>deno run -A index.ts
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Once it’s running you will be able to click on the profile link on the home page and will be redirected to Okta’s hosted login page. Once you’ve logged in, you’ll be directed back to the profile page and you’ll see your ID token’s properties displayed in a list.</p>

<p>My name is Nick Gamb and I am excited to be joining the Okta Developer Advocacy team for the .NET community after a year and a half as a developer specialist for enterprise sales. The crazy pace and high pressure of enterprise sales was an interesting experience that allowed me to rapidly become intimately close to the Okta platform. As great as drinking water from a fire hose was, I longed to be back doing what I love most… providing a great experience for developers… and breaking stuff to see how it works.</p>

 Who Am I 

<p></p>

<p>At heart, I am just an inquisitive nerd who has had a very fortunate career getting to do many different things. I love video games, anime, boating, computers, programming, hacking, security, dev ops, data, animals, nature, film, photography, sound design, editing -it’s a long list. For the brave and interested, the longer, but still condensed, version of my professional story is below. Outside of my profession, my life is my family, and I would not have it any other way. I have an amazing wife who is my best friend. I have two beautiful daughters who fill my life with love, joy, and chaos. I have 3 big dogs who constantly keep us moving, cuddled, and slobbery. I have a full, happy, life.</p>

<p></p>

 Doing All the Things 

<p>I have a personality trait that has been both good and bad for me. I am interested in everything and can’t settle on one thing. This has been the case since before young Nick decided to go to film school, when he spent all his spare time taking every electronic apart (to see how it worked) and hacking up video game engine code (Never-ending thanks to John Carmack for id Tech!). While tech might have been the obvious path for me, my MO seems to be to try to do all of the things. Hang on tight…whiplash ahead.</p>

 Invent, Transform, Create, and Destroy 

<p></p>

<p>I have always loved technology… especially taking it apart. As a kid, nothing was safe from my screwdriver. This destructive inquisitiveness paved the way to a healthy and productive love for building computers and programming them… and exploiting them. I built my first computer with a Pentium 200 MHz processor, 16 MB RAM, and Windows 95. This gaming rig was a beast and ran Quake like a champ. As great of an achievement as this was, especially without Google to guide me, it was later that my interest in hardware turned software. It was the release of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech">id Tech 1</a> engine source code for me. This was the beginning of a snowball effect that inevitably ended up with my learning the foundations of programming, and then expanding into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a> and physics. I was no longer limited to just playing games like everyone else. I now had the power to invent, transform, create, and destroy. But even more exciting to me was when I discovered how video games can be used to influence people.</p>

 The Detour 

<p>So you will understand everyone’s surprise and confusion when young Nick started applying to film school instead of pursuing tech. Because of this detour I have worked on the set of major TV sitcom productions, I have been a director for a Fox News affiliate, I have been a chief editor/photojournalist for an NBC news affiliate, and I have hung suspended out of the side of a helicopter with a camera that cost more than I made in 2 years. Really cool right? I hated it. From a young age, I was really drawn to the way that a story can affect people’s emotions and perceptions. It is why I was so drawn to video games and game engines. It’s also why I am so interested in psychology. Film to me was a draw because of its ability to reach more people than any other medium. Sure, I also love photography, sound design, and editing just as much as everyone else - but the drive for me was in using the art and the technology to make people feel… anything… everything. Unfortunately, my romanticized vision of the film and broadcasting industry was not what I had hoped it would be, and ultimately that led me to decide to leave it.</p>

<p></p>

 The Reboot 

<p>I rebooted my career in tech climbing a common ladder… in support. I quickly automated my job with my programming skills and ended up on a team coding new apps for the support people to use. From there I moved on to sales engineering, programming data transformations, coding HP printer drivers and installers, professional services, and many other things. Every role I took I spent the majority of my time reverse-engineering everything and programming whatever interested me. I particularly liked finding ways to break or manipulate software. It was developing data transformations that got me into C# and .Net, and I have been faithful ever since. Yes, I have had a tryst or two with the likes of Python and Java, but C# is and will always be my one true love.</p>

 Finding Focus 

<p>That brings me to identity security and the part where I finally found a focus. In early 2014 I was brought on to build professional services for a new cloud identity solution that was getting rave reviews from Gartner. It did not take long for me to reverse engineer the platform and start creating against it. When my code started to be sold it grabbed the attention of our leadership. You would think it was positive attention since I just identified a new market for revenue generation, but apparently there are other things to consider like support, quality of the code, and API’s that were built to scale. It’s not only about breaking stuff and putting it back together in different ways. The storm to follow was my entry into corporate politics and all of the fun that brings.</p>

 Burnout 

<p>Fast forward to 2016. I had managed to convince the powers that be that we needed to be building a platform, not just a product. A platform that could be adopted by developers, not used by just an IT Admin. One that could power identity security across the internet. The product was rapidly changing in this direction and I began building a new developer experience/relation organization. I was the head of developer relations but I was also solo for the majority of it… which was a fast track to burnout. The struggle became real in 2017 when Okta, my competitor at the time, acquired Stormpath. How can one person compete with that?</p>

 Breaking Stuff and Telling People How It Works 

<p>Now it’s 2020. With one quick step into sales engineering again, I found my footing at Okta. Learning the platform was quick and easy considering my experience as an identity security expert and developer advocate. Sales, however, is not where my passion lies. In joining Okta Developer Advocacy, I am finally back to doing what I love most. Breaking stuff and telling people how it works! My focus as an Okta Developer Advocate is .NET/C# but you can expect to see a variety of things from me that are as wide-ranging as my never-ending list of interests, passions, and skills. .NET, Security, DevOps, even video games / XR is on the list, along with much more.</p>

<p>Stay tuned and buckle up. This is going to be an exciting ride!</p>

					 <p>Over the past few months, a number of apps have been developed that use verifiable credentials to streamline the transfer of data in the COVID-19 testing process. However, Bart Cant, Founder and Managing Partner of <a href="http://www.rtledgers.com/">Rethink Ledgers</a>, decided to use a unique approach in developing his prototype app. Not only did he use verifiable credentials for the secure sharing of COVID-19 test results and vaccine information, but he also based his app on smart contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bart’s app uses the Trinsic platform for the verifiable credentials portion, so we interviewed him further about his app, how it works, and future plans.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Let's dive right in. What is the app called, and what does it do? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The app is called “State Surveillance System for Covid19 Testing and Vaccine Distribution Management”. It is a prototype app developed using <a href="https://daml.com/">DAML</a> (Digital Assets Modeling Language) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C’s verifiable credentials</a>. The app showcases a prototype solution that provides a digital, secure experience for citizens, health clinic providers, and state agencies to share COVID-19 test results, “proof of vaccine” administration, and other “immunity proofs” using a centralized ledger.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What inspired you to build this app? What problems are you trying to solve? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>My background has been in digital transformation, and I spent the last few years building blockchain-based solutions for large enterprises at Capgemini and IBM. While blockchain and distributed ledger technology provide many opportunities, I realized in the last few years that for many use cases and processes, there are some components of blockchain that are really valuable (e.g., cryptography, tamper-proof evidence), but some processes could be better served in a more centralized way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I wanted to apply my knowledge and talent, so I decided to join the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI). By contributing to the use case and development of a prototype application, I hope to contribute to building solutions that can help keep people safe and bring back some normalcy in our daily lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The problems I am trying to solve include the secure and timely sharing of COVID-19 testing data. Specifically in the case of COVID-19 testing, it is essential that all test results are communicated in a secure, privacy-enhanced, and safe environment. Secondly, accurate and timely data is critical for policy setting, so sharing data with state or local agencies in an automated way is also achieved. </p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How does the app use both smart contracts and verifiable credentials? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>As I mentioned previously, the app was developed using a combination of the DAML privacy-enhancing, smart contract language and W3C’s verifiable credentials. DAML guarantees privacy by coding the solution as rights and obligations. The information is stored, so it cannot be accessed unless the party accessing that data has been explicitly configured in the smart contracts to access it. DAML is also one of the few solutions that allows interoperability across networks. The solution is built on a centralized ledger based solution (<a href="https://projectdabl.com/">https://projectdabl.com/</a>) but could be easily deployed on other blockchain networks (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, Besu or R3 Corda), centralized ledgers (e.g., AWS QLDB), or traditional databases (e.g., Postgres).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second major technical component of the solution is how it interacts with verifiable credentials. Verifiable credentials are used to securely transmit COVID-19 test information from the health clinics to the patient. The application provides a digital workflow for this experience (including a mobile experience) while still being HIPAA compliant and providing a safe and secure mechanism for sharing COVID-19 test data that allows the recipient to be in control of his or her data and decide on what to share and with whom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The application is already looking forward to the future situation where COVID-19 vaccines will become available. When vaccines are available, at least a portion of the population will receive the COVID-19 vaccine and therefore will be better protected from contracting the virus or potentially infecting others in their communities. By providing verifiable credentials for vaccine proofs, we enhance the trust factor of sharing and disclosing medical information.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What role does Trinsic play in the app? How was Trinsic's platform helpful in the development of your app? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic is a critical component of the overall architecture of the solution. It is the glue for connecting the smart contracts to the distribution of verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It uses the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a> for setting up DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and schemas and can be used as a monitoring tool for connections and distribution of the verifiable credentials. The Trinsic Studio is an easy-to-use web interface for managing verifiable credential exchange with no code. It’s so easy to use that it makes it possible to issue a verifiable credential in less than five minutes! The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> is also used for accepting and presenting the verifiable credentials.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How does this solution balance the need to track, analyze, and share COVID-19 related data and the privacy concerns that come with that? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>With COVID-19, there is a great emphasis on privacy and regulation. Verifiable credentials allow you to share medical data directly from the issuer to the holder without the need to store the data. Smart contracts can be leveraged to orchestrate this process. Additionally, smart contracts can be used to anonymize data by using DIDs, for instance. Additionally, the critical medical data can be blinded and encrypted by the DAML smart contract, so the solution can be both HIPAA and GDPR compliant. </p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What is the next step from here? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Since the release of my prototype and associated video, I have received a lot of feedback from healthcare professionals and self-sovereign identity advocates. I also am exploring further enhancements to a variety of use cases. There are many similar opportunities to leverage smart contracts and verifiable credentials for COVID-19 tests or vaccines in the entertainment, travel, or education industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the solution could be very helpful in international travel. By using the app, tourists from the US that are planning to go to the Caribbean islands can easily share their pre-boarding screening information about COVID-19 tests or vaccines and then provide additional test information upon returning back to the US, avoiding long lines upon entry or mandatory quarantine requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(end of interview)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes joined Bart and DAML representatives in a webinar to discuss and demo the prototype app. To view the webinar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0mSf0TNz9M&amp;utm_campaign=DAML%20for%20Enterprise&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=94512634&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_WANWD3dc6FImKtBVJDX9cdEjmDaQSXbXomOS-1tYSITgnPfyO5_U7tpgTLvFnUpH5bFF8G6jdHxt8kE-4YBg9Cz_WPg&amp;utm_content=94512634&amp;utm_source=hs_email">click here</a>.

<p>OScore is a self-sovereign credit evaluation system based on user data stored on the Ontology blockchain. With full integration of ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, OScore supports cross-chain interaction and verifiable credentials, connecting user identities with personal accounts on the Ontology blockchain, eliminating third parties from the process. Once a user authorizes their financial data, Ontology’s OScore system generates a quantifiable credit score, while ensuring the user’s privacy is fully protected.</p><p>OScore gives users full control over their digital assets and contracts addresses through a mechanism that gives them full autonomy regarding who has access to their data. Users are permitted to bind their digital assets or contract addresses to their ONT ID, and subsequently unbind them whenever they wish to do so. It is entirely up to the user to authorize third-party access to their data. Data used in OScore calculations includes the user’s digital asset balance, historical holding records, transaction records, records dApp&nbsp;usage.</p><p>OScore is an independent on-chain reputation system, generated by specific onchain user data that is not associated with their off-chain identities. In this way, OScore protects the user’s privacy and supports full anonymity.</p><p>In the financial sector, a huge chasm remains in the data collaboration between both the off-chain and on-chain worlds. For most blockchain users, on-chain assets and actions constitute a significant aspect of their financial profile. However, most credit-related scenarios in the world today still require the user’s off-chain information to be reliable, without taking into account that their onchain data could also give insight into their credit&nbsp;history.</p><p>OScore seeks to bridge the gap between users and DeFi services, allowing users to enjoy the DeFi projects, dApps and blockchain platforms suited to their needs. Users can manage their on-chain credit data at their will, and if they have a positive credit history, they can put their credit data to use in more rewarding financial products, all the while knowing that their privacy is safe from intrusion. In addition, users can bind their OScore and off-chain real-name data to their ONT ID, pooling their off-chain and on-chain data to form a more complete credit profile for themselves that can be applied in both the on-chain and off-chain worlds.</p><p>OScore finds an optimal application in Wing, a DeFi project based on the Ontology blockchain. Wing integrates OScore into its credit evaluation module to support its DeFi services. Each Wing product pool can use OScore to increase the credibility of its DeFi services. Users can benefit from OScore in the following ways:</p><blockquote>OScore helps users avoid over-collateralization when looking to borrow a variety of digital&nbsp;assets</blockquote><p>An OScore is generated for the user based on a hybrid calculation of their digital identity and assets. Users with a high OScore may enjoy under-collateralization in crediting digital assets, such as collateralizing 8 bitcoins to get&nbsp;10.</p><blockquote>OScore users can enjoy WING incentives</blockquote><p>Based on the user’s level of participation, the product pool will distribute extra WINGs in every transaction as incentives for crediting participants with an OScore. Users who return their credited assets on time will receive extra OScore points as a reward. Other DeFi projects or credit-evaluating products can also utilize OScore for similar functions.</p><blockquote>OScore protects user privacy, even when they have not met contractual terms</blockquote><p>Users who breach terms will be listed on an OScore privacy-protecting list. Despite this, they still have control over which entities have access to this list, as they have completed the authorization process before joining the crediting activities.</p><p>OScore offers a framework where users can find credit evaluating tools that serve different purposes. Every user can write their own credit evaluation algorithm or re-use the credit score issued by a trusted third party. From the user’s perspective, OScore can be used to desensitize their credit data and provide verifiable credentials with scoring algorithms and credit data as trust endorsement for credit-related business.</p><p>Currently, OScore’s primary credit evaluation mechanism calculates the user’s balance and historical holding records of digital assets and supports blockchain platforms based on BTC, ETH, and ONT. In the future, updated OScore systems will continue to incorporate more types of on-chain data and evaluation mechanisms. In addition, Ontology also has plans to integrate OScore into the ONTO wallet. Relevant SDKs and APIs will also be released to allow integration and deployment by third-party apps.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/oscore-everything-you-need-to-know-57aa88b7b96f">OScore: Everything You Need to Know</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Decentralized payment protocol&nbsp;Celo <p>The stablecoin in the blockchain combines the advantages of digital currency and can maintain price stability. The payment market has a very broad prospect and is an area that many people are optimistic about. The decentralized payment protocol Celo contains stablecoins that can be used for payment, mainly for mobile payment systems. Celo is based on the two core values of ‘special purpose’ and ‘connection’. Its pronunciation /ˈtselo/ means ‘purpose’ in Esperanto. In this report, we will introduce to you the differences of&nbsp;Celo.</p> Address-based Encryption <p>With the development of stablecoins, USDT and USDC with stable value gradually replaced the Bitcoin feature of ‘point-to-point payment’. When using these stablecoins for payment or transfer, we must first know the address of the other party, which increases the threshold for the use of stablecoins.</p><p>Celo proposed an address-based encryption scheme. The user generates a public/private key pair traditionally, and then registers his public key to a public database, which stores the tuple of [address-&gt;public key]. Users can attach any character string to the address of the database key, and each address can store multiple public keys. Through this protocol, users can use e-mail addresses, mobile phone numbers, etc. as public keys, but need to be able to receive secure messages.</p><p>In the digital currency wallet disclosed by China Construction Bank last month, the digital RMB also has a similar feature, which can be transferred through the wallet address of the other party or the bank&nbsp;account.</p> Price Stabilization Mechanism <p>The Celo protocol contains two tokens. One is the reserve token CELO (formerly known as Celo Gold), and the other is the stablecoin Celo USD (cUSD, Celo USD) used for payment. Although the stablecoin cUSD is also supplied flexibly, unlike Ampleforth, Celo only maintains the value of cUSD by adjusting the total supply of cUSD, without changing the number of stablecoins held by users. When the price of cUSD is higher than $1, arbitrageurs can buy $1 CELO, exchange it for 1 cUSD, and sell it on the market. When cUSD is lower than $1, arbitrageurs can buy cUSD and exchange it for $1&nbsp;CELO.</p> Diversity of Reserve&nbsp;Assets <p>In MakerDAO, the tokens selected by the holders of MKR through voting, such as ETH, WBTC, etc., are mortgaged, while Synthetix is used to mortgage its native token SNX. The reserve assets of Celo include not only the native token CELO, but also commonly used cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, and DAI. This increases the diversity of collateral assets and makes it easier to expand the scale of cUSD. Initially, the target of the Celo reserve was 50% CELO, 30% BTC, 15% ETH, and 5% stablecoins.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://cello.org/">cello.org</a></p> Shared Reserve&nbsp;System <p>At present, there is the only cUSD as a stablecoin in Celo, but Celo has positioned itself as a multi-asset encryption protocol for decentralized payments and introduced a shared reserve system. For example, when the protocol is to introduce the Celo euro linked to the euro, the Celo euro uses the same reserve as the Celo dollar. When the supply of stablecoins expands, the protocol issues new stablecoins and uses them to buy a basket of encrypted assets. When the demand for stablecoins shrinks, the protocol uses the same mechanism to sell reserve assets for stablecoins. CELO has played the role of the central bank in traditional finance, maintaining the prices of stablecoin through open market operations.</p><p>The shared reserve system can also improve the efficiency of the process. For example, when the demand for Celo euros decreases, before preparing to sell reserves, it will first check whether the supply of Celo dollars needs to be expanded. If necessary, Celo USD will be issued and Celo Euro will be directly exchanged at the current exchange&nbsp;rate.</p><p>The shared reserve system does not require all new stablecoins to be used. The Celo protocol also allows the use of its reserves to issue new tokens. When using the shared reserve system to introduce a new stablecoin, thorough consideration must be made. If a stablecoin with negative effects on the ecosystem is introduced, it may have a marginally negative impact on the stability of other currencies. Only when people generally expect that the introduction of new stablecoins will increase the long-term demand for the monetary system, will they be considered.</p> The Value of&nbsp;CELO <p>CELO is also the governance and incentive token of the Celo protocol. Holding CELO will enjoy the benefits of network&nbsp;growth.</p><p>As the use of Celo increases and new stablecoins are introduced, more CELO needs to be mortgaged, and the demand for CELO will increase.</p><p>In order to maintain the BFT consensus of the Celo network, Celo needs to elect validator nodes, and validators need to mortgage a certain amount of CELO&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The block rewards of Celo will be distributed to those who contribute to the system, including those who maintain the stability of the system by selecting validators, verifying transactions, verifying users, and participating in the discovery mechanism of the price of Schelling Point, as well as those who bear the risk of austerity, those who use the protocol as a payment method, those who invite others to use the protocol, and those who improve the protocol.</p><p>CELO holders can govern the protocol by voting, such as proposing a proposal to introduce a new stablecoin, and if the vote reaches a certain threshold, the new stablecoin is introduced into the shared&nbsp;reserve.</p><p>Similarly, holding CELO is also at risk. When the supply is tight, if the demand for Celo stablecoins shrinks for a long time, the value of CELO may&nbsp;decline.</p> Celo Usage <p>The current market capitalization of CELO has reached $423 million, and it is listed on Coinbase, the largest Exchange in the United States. Celo has formed alliances with payment institutions, digital wallets, payment solution companies, digital asset lending companies, educational institutions, investment institutions, etc. to promote the use of the Celo protocol.</p><p>But there are few stablecoins in the Celo protocol. According to the latest data on the official website, the stablecoin in Celo is now only cUSD, and the circulation of cUSD is only 7.33 million. Reserve funds include CELO, BTC, ETH, DAI, and each asset is stored in a specific blockchain address.</p> Sum up <p>Celo has special features in address-based encryption schemes, reserve assets, and shared reserves. It increases the usability of stablecoins, the diversity of reserve assets, and improves the efficiency of process. The market capitalization of CELO is high enough, but the current circulation of stablecoins in Celo is not high, and the types of stablecoins need to be increased.</p> 3. Questions of&nbsp;Readers <p>1. Is DeFi disrupting the entire blockchain ecology?</p><p>Answer: DeFi is indeed changing the entire blockchain ecology on a large scale. For example, because of the demand of DeFi, the oracle Chainlink is used more. Because liquidity mining requires LP tokens, the liquidity and transaction volume of Uniswap have doubled. Because of the popularity of DeFi, the Ethereum network has become very congested, and miners’ fees have increased, which may make it impossible for some other types of DApps to develop. In addition, DeFi is also changing the pattern between public blockchains. EOS, whose stablecoin USDT is insufficient, lags behind TRON in this wave of DeFi&nbsp;boom.</p><p>2. Why was SUSHI listed in three major Exchanges in one day? Is it just because of the money-making effect?</p><p>Answer: It’s not just for making money. It is certain that the token listing strategy of centralized Exchanges is now different from before, and even the largest Exchanges have generated the FOMO sentiment of token listing. At the end of August, the daily trading volume of Uniswap surpassed that of Coinbase, the largest Exchange in the United States, and centralized Exchanges could no longer ignore decentralized Exchanges.</p><p>In addition, there are also reasons for the SushiSwap project itself. Now Uniswap is the largest decentralized Exchange, and the LP tokens obtained after depositing in Uniswap can be transferred, which gives SushiSwap an opportunity. SushiSwap wants to allow users to provide liquidity on Uniswap by giving users SUSHI token incentives, and pledge LP tokens to SushiSwap, and finally convert it into its own liquidity. It now appears that this approach is effective. In the past week, the liquidity on Uniswap has increased from $308 million to $1.9 billion, most of which are to pledge LP tokens in Uniswap to SushiSwap for liquidity mining. If there is indeed a lot of liquidity left in SushiSwap in the end, then the position of Uniswap will face serious challenges.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>As organizations begin to shift from the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">recovery phase</a> of COVID-19 to the renewal, many are focused on what comes next and capitalizing on the changes made to the business during COVID-19. The Gartner Board of Directors survey highlighted that seven out of 10 boards have accelerated digital business initiatives in the wake of COVID-19 disruption.</p>
<p>One question we hear frequently when discussing digital business strategy now is, “Why is this digitalization different from digital prior to COVID-19?” And the answer is pace — the pace of adoption. With a potentially short window of time before a resurgence of the virus or other related disruption, organizations need to act quickly.</p>
<p>The digital part isn’t new, but the acceleration part is crucial. This is about the urgent adoption of established patterns, many of them digital, but also patterns of psychology (how do we survive), organization (are we equipping people with the best skills and cohorts?) and governance (do we need so much ritual, or can we move faster?)</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36189"]</p>
<p>Organizations have to change, now. There is no option to continue on as they have. It has to be done to preserve the business and the future of the business. When economics are going as well as they had been, more or less, for the past decade, organizations didn’t have to make the hard choices or tackle underlying faults. Pre-COVID business and operating models could probably improve with certain digitalization efforts, but why change what’s working well enough? Now, the path forward is clear: Accelerate digital business or risk the survival of the organization.</p>
<p>Organizations need to be making better-informed and faster decisions, focusing on automation, real-time risk assessment and mitigation, continuous value delivery and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">agile strategy</a> making. And they need to be doing it now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The acceleration we are experiencing is the search for new solutions in the face of broken assumptions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disruption is useful: We need it to make progress. The acceleration we are experiencing is the search for new solutions in the face of broken assumptions. We have an opportunity to make things better, rather than falling back on what worked before. Over time, we will build a new set of business practices, forever changed by COVID-19.</p>
 What does digital business acceleration look like? 
<p>The answer to this question will depend on your organization's strategies and business. Consider the larger goals and initiatives that drive the business — how can those be improved through effective use of known technology and information design patterns?</p>
<p>Consider automation in the call center. Many companies have been increasing this specific automation over the years, but now implementation is accelerating. COVID-19 meant people couldn’t physically be in call centers, and at the same time, many call centers experienced a massive uptick in demand.</p>
<p>Chatbots become an efficient, but more importantly now, a necessary, digital tool for the organization. It’s not a new technology; it’s just that organizations were pushed to find solutions. Now they have to be adopted at an accelerated rate.</p>
 How will we speed up? 
<p>Acceleration has some specific requirements, both in the digital and the physical worlds. First, you must banish drags: Remove those things that will slow you down. This could mean modernizing a piece of your legacy technology or removing unnecessary ritual from change management processes.</p>
<p>Second, you need fuel to boost you: These patterns, like call center automation or social marketing (proven implementations), can get you moving quickly. Third, you must adjust resources: Shift funding from less valuable initiatives to those focused on new channels, products or services that will have greater, faster returns.</p>
<p>Finally, seize value: Sweat the assets you own, like cloud platforms, that are likely underutilized and that could be used for rapid innovation and resilience.</p>
 What should we stop doing? 
<p>In the spirit of banishing drags, a number of Gartner analysts had a brainstorming thread with a simple question: What is the one thing that you should stop doing to go faster? Here are a few of their suggestions:</p>
 
 Stop trying to centralize everything: Provide autonomy and accountability throughout the organization 
 Stop believing (and working toward the idea) that digital will transform your company into Google or Amazon or Alibaba. Digital transformation doesn’t alter the purpose of your company’s existence. 
 Stop staying in your lane. Change lanes to follow new demand. 
 Stop pining for the “good old days” of January 2020 and get on to January 2021. 
 Stop innovation initiatives that were conceived pre-pandemic. Reset. Then only restart innovation initiatives that make sense for the post-pandemic organization. 
 Stop doing staff appraisals/performance reviews (this year only). 
 
 What will digital business do for us? 
<p>Digital will “remote-stabilize” the organization to the right mix of remote and in-person business, which is a much-needed exercise after the initial pandemic push. It will enable organizations to react to external context and enable them to move resources in response to emergent needs in society. We’re looking for new patterns of scale that can be applied now, but can also be adjusted for future disturbances.</p>
<p>Right now, clients are focused on “Right-Scale”, which is asking things like “What do I keep? What do I change?” For example, this could mean moving aggressively to cloud providers instead of using an on-site data center. Essentially, these are projects that organizations might have been doing before, but now they’re being done with more urgency and speed.</p>
<p>Another part of this is “Right-Balance” which is examining the balance between traditional analog options and digital. COVID-19 drove this transformation more quickly than some organizations would have otherwise chosen.</p>
<p>Working toward the future, organizations should be applying digital business acceleration to these dimensions:</p>
 
 The “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-cios-design-for-the-everything-customer/">everything customer</a>,” who requires both deep personalization and ironclad privacy 
 Right-scoped growth, which may involve new customer segments and the abandonment of incumbent value propositions 
 A composable technology foundation that balances efficiency with resilience 
 An adaptable workforce, equipped with the skills, processes, information and autonomy to flex in the face of disruption 
 Any-scale operations that can spin up and down with demand and unforeseen circumstances

<p>To quote every television commercial, these are unprecedented times. But we were more prepared for them than we realized. A pragmatic optimism is emerging, grounded in known practices and patterns. We need to stay open, curious and future-focused. Now is the time to renew our businesses, our work and ourselves. Don’t miss this opportunity.</p>

  <p>While digitalization is a major challenge for all kinds of enterprises, it is particularly hard for medium sized enterprises. For many years, medium sized enterprises have struggled to deploy Identity Management as well as Identity Governance (IGA) solutions and show true business value and a return on investment. This is largely due to the complexity of implementation and the level of configuration and customization to fulfill the requirements. As a result, many companies have deployed Access Management solutions like single sign-on only to find that while great for user convenience, they bring little to the table for proper lifecycle management and governance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity_for_all_not_for_the_few"></a>

  <p>For these organizations, an adaptable Active Directory-centered (AD) approach can address the areas of highest impact. By adding cloud-based access request and access certification functionality to the mix, a company can achieve a basic IGA solution for a fraction of the cost, complexity, and deployment time. This approach also provides the opportunity to expand the scope beyond AD and Azure AD by embracing many non-Windows systems (such as Unix/Linux) and SaaS applications (via SCIM connectivity). Learn how to build a strategy for a modular approach to identity that can be custom fit to company needs, size, complexity, and budget.</p>
<p>This webinar will equip you to:</p>
 
 Provision your AD and Azure environment – and beyond 
 Approach baseline IAM implementation efficiently 
 Plan a short track for improving security and compliance 
 Set up your identity program for ongoing success 
 Be well-positioned to expand to IGA and PAM when the time is right. 
 
<p>In the first part, KuppingerCole Principal Analyst Martin Kuppinger will give a brief overview of identity in general as well as of IAM, IGA and PAM strategies, and will look at what every business, regardless of size and industry, needs in IAM.</p>
<p>He will be joined by One Identity Field Strategist Dan Conrad, who will explain how to prioritize IGA capabilities for maximum impact and show why you should opt for a modular approach with AD-optimized tools.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/iam_strategies_that_grow_with_your_business"></a>

				 <p>I have been talking to numerous founders lately about the various oddities and niceties of raising funds – and the crazy things that VCs and aggressive angels do. Over the years I have advised many companies and I thought that there was a page that gave the founder-centric view of things – but I can’t find it. So… Here we go.</p>
<p>General Terminology – <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-venture-capital-terms">CB Insights</a> does a good job here. Key for raising are the following phrases (go to the page for the definitions):</p>
 
 pre-money valuation and post-money valuation are crucial terms – simple to get but if you haven’t heard them they sound odd. 
 liquidation preferences and especially any mention of a full ratchet. 
 
<p>Key warnings:</p>
 
 Be really careful about <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2004/07/liquidation-preferences.html">liquidation preferences</a>.&nbsp; 
 Watch out for the <a href="https://venturehacks.com/option-pool-shuffle">employee stock option game</a> that aggressive VCs play. This seemingly simple concept creates massive dilution that isn’t in a founder’s favour.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Interesting Approach – Vesting for Founders – One interesting thought is that some of the best places have quite long vesting periods, even for founders. AngelList, for example, has a <a href="https://venturehacks.com/6-year-vesting">6-year vesting period</a> – for everyone, including Naval.</p>

<p>We have had a very exciting week here at Ontology as <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing</a>, the first credit-based DeFi project based on the Ontology blockchain, released its first whitepaper. Integrated with Ontology’s decentralized identity and credit evaluation systems, Wing fuels cross-chain interaction for various DeFi products and decentralized governance.</p><p>We are also delighted to share that our tokens ONT and ONG can now be swapped to eONT and eONG on the Ethereum blockchain, and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ont-ong-now-listed-on-uniswap-to-support-all-types-of-defi-products-on-ethereum-852f3268a8f0">eONT and eONG are listed on the UniSwap platform</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, we continued performance testing with bloXroute by providing reliable technical assistance to our partners.</p><p>Back-end</p><p>- Completed 50% of Ontology GraphQL interface development</p><p>- The Rust Wasm contract development hub released ontio-std v0.3</p><p>Product Development</p><p>ONTO</p><p>- ONTO v3.3.0&nbsp;released</p><p>- Completed the connection with&nbsp;Tron</p><p>- Completed the connection with&nbsp;Polkadot</p><p>- Upgraded credential functions</p><p>- Upgraded asset score functions by including stablecoins into the calculation of asset&nbsp;score</p><p>- Upgraded asset score and credential tutorial</p><p>dApp</p><p>- 71 dApps now live on&nbsp;Ontology</p><p>- 6,065,687 dApp-related transactions since genesis&nbsp;block</p><p>- 14,320 dApp-related transactions in the past&nbsp;week</p><p>Bounty Program</p><p>- 1 new application for the technical documentation translation and 1 new application for SDK&nbsp;bounty</p><p>Community Growth</p><p>- We onboarded 753 new members across Ontology’s Vietnamese, Swedish, and Romanian communities.</p><p>Newly Released</p><p>- Wing, the first credit-integrated DeFi project based on the Ontology blockchain, released its first whitepaper. According to the whitepaper, Wing serves as a DeFi platform based on Ontology’s decentralized identity and credit evaluating systems. It supports cross-chain interaction between various DeFi products and decentralized governance and introduces a risk control mechanism that promotes a healthy relationship between borrowers, creditors, and guarantors, breaking the barriers with traditional finance through the incorporation of&nbsp;credit.</p><p>- Ontology’s digital assets, ONT and ONG, have completed mapping to the Ethereum blockchain platform. ONT and ONG are now listed on UniSwap to support all types of DeFi products on Ethereum. This move marks Ontology as the first mainstream public blockchain that has completed cross-chain communication for Ethereum. Digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain can now be swapped to the Ontology blockchain as bi-directional cross-chain communications are enabled between Ontology and Ethereum.</p><p>- Ontology continued its performance testing with bloXroute, with a focus on BDN performance during periods of slow internet. Ontology improved the speed of block propagation, block recovering speed, and transaction stream speed, and announced a partnership with Chainstack.</p><p>Global Events</p><p>- From September 2–4, Ontology co-organized the event ‘Cointelegraph China’s DeFi Marathon’. On 2 September, the launch of the event, professionals including DeFi project teams, high-tech individuals, senior investors, community enthusiasts, investment research organizations, and media personnel met at the Shanghai site to discuss DeFi topics and the future growth of decentralized finance. Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, addressed the audience during “Ontology: Empowering DeFi with Credit” and joined a panel discussion themed “Public Chain’s Choice amid DeFi Pressure”. He shared inspiring insights on why Ontology decided to get involved with DeFi, our technical upgrading and ongoing development, our new governance and staking economic model, and empowering DeFi with Wing, Ontology’s latest credit-based DeFi project. He added, “By empowering DeFi with credit, we are poised to build the next ‘Super-Oracle’”. In addition, during the event, Erick Pinos, Americas Ecosystem Lead, was engaged in a discussion with the lead of Aave as well as other renowned projects.</p><p>- On September 4, Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, participated in a live AMA panel hosted by HyperPay on the topic of “Braving the DeFi-spurred Storm: Where Will Public Chains Head”. During the panel, he unveiled Ontology’s blueprint for DeFi, and briefed community users on the innovative and transformative features of Wing, the credit-based DeFi cross-chain platform.</p><p>- On September 3, Kendall MAO, Dean of Ontology Institute, discussed the dilemma posed by DeFi to public chains at a SheKnows live panel organized by 8BTCnews, along with representatives from Bytom Blockchain. Kendall mentioned, “Wing, Ontology’s latest cross-chain DeFi project, is integrated with the element of credit. We believe that a dynamic integration with the OScore system will create new paradigms for DeFi innovations, opening up new opportunities for Ontology.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-september-1-7-90d60ee16104">Ontology Weekly Report (September 1–7)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The hype around artificial intelligence (AI) has led to exaggerated expectations. For security leaders, the reality is that current AI technology, including machine learning (ML) techniques, can augment security capabilities. In the area of anomaly detection and security analytics, humans working with AI accomplish much more than without it. And while not risk-free, AI within security is more likely to create jobs rather than eliminate them.</p>
<p>However, simpler solutions can be as effective and cost less. And AI solutions for security can still be immature technologies. Given current technology restraints, AI should be an addition to existing security practices rather than a complete solution.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>CISOs should ask these five questions before investing in the technology for their security programs:</p>
 1. What should CISOs and their teams know about AI? 
<p>One major challenge surrounding AI is the hype. Buzzwords like “next-generation” and “holistic approach” make big promises but most likely just mean “our latest release” and “multifunction.” Security and risk (SRM) leaders and teams must be savvy about marketing and the myths that exist in the AI world.</p>
<p>Focus on the actual benefits of the technology rather than rely on vendor claims or assumptions. It is key that security teams understand <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">the basics about AI</a> to assess how the technology might reasonably help security strategy.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-9-security-and-risk-trends-for-2020/">Gartner Top 9 Security and Risk Trends for 2020</a></p>
 2. What is AI’s impact on SRM? 
<p>The promise of AI technology is that it will process data and apply analytics much better than human teams. Improved automation and data analytics applied to security analytics and infrastructure protection offer to:</p>
 
 
<p>Find more attacks</p>
 
 
<p>Reduce false alerts</p>
 
 
<p>Perform faster detect-and-respond functions</p>
 
 
<p>The CISO should take the lead in establishing what the organization requires and how <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-build-a-business-case-for-artificial-intelligence/">AI</a> can assist in that. CISOs should also set reasonable expectations for what AI can realistically provide and select projects based on areas where <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-3-benefits-of-ai-projects/">AI can have the greatest impact</a>.</p>

 3. What is the state of AI in security? 
<p>Recognize that the technology is not mature and continue to treat AI offerings as experimental, complementary controls. “AI as a feature” is applied on existing platforms across a variety of key initiatives, including:</p>
 
 Threat and anomaly detection 
 Identity analytics and fraud detection 
 Compliance and privacy risk management 
 Bot mitigation 
 Data discovery and categorization 
 Asset discovery 
 Policy automation 
 Security orchestration 
 
 4. What should CISOs ask vendors about AI security? 
<p>Although AI has a coolness factor, other existing solutions can achieve similar results. Understand the risks of a new solution and how the AI offering will outperform what the team is already using. Some questions for vendors include:</p>
 
 How can we view/control data used by the solution? 
 Does the solution send data outside of our organization (call home)? 
 What are the relevant security and performance metrics to measure the results from AI? 
 Are there peer reviews of the solution? 
 How much staff and time are required to maintain the solution? 
 How does your solution integrate into our enterprise workflow? 
 Does your solution integrate with third-party security solutions? 
 
<p>Depending on the answers, leaders may decide the costs and risks outweigh the benefits and decide to skip the extra expense.</p>

 5. How does AI impact your workforce strategy? 
<p>AI might require additional roles or skill sets. Competition for these new skills is fierce, and finding “data security scientists” or “threat hunters” can be challenging. Because skills are constantly evolving, it can be more productive to focus on hiring people with trainable traits like digital dexterity, innovation and business acumen. Consider how to approach talent and skills gaps before purchase.</p>
<p>CISOs armed with the answers to these questions will be better prepared to decide whether and how to<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lessons-from-artificial-intelligence-pioneers/"> invest in AI.</a></p>

   Ah, migration! Let’s say you have an ASP.NET application that has been running fine for years. You have kept up with the various .NET Framework updates and then suddenly you get told that you need to migrate to the latest and greatest, ASP.NET Core using .NET Core. .NET Core is the successor to the .NET Framework we’ve been using for years. It is open-source and supports cross-platform application

  <p>Ah, migration! Let’s say you have an ASP.NET application that has been running fine for years. You have kept up with the various .NET Framework updates and then suddenly you get told that you need to migrate to the latest and greatest, ASP.NET Core using .NET Core. .NET Core is the successor to the .NET Framework we’ve been using for years. It is open-source and supports cross-platform applications. To a veteran .NET developer it should look relatively similar to ASP.NET applications but there are some differences. In this article, we will migrate an existing ASP.NET application to ASP.NET Core that has an external auth provider - like Okta!</p>

 Requirements 

 
   A computer with .NET Framework and .NET Core-compatible operating system 
   A modern internet browser 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer account</a> 
   Your IDE of choice (I used Visual Studio 2019) 
   The <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">.NET Core 3.1 SDK</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet">ASP.NET</a> 
 

 Create your Okta application 

<p>For this application, you will use Okta for your authentication.  The <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> makes implementing secure authentication in your application easier than ever.  All you need to do is set up a new application on Okta’s developer website and configure the authentication in your project on startup, and Okta handles the rest.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta Developer Console and click on Applications. Click on the Add Application button and select Web. On the next page, give your application a meaningful name. I named my application Conversion App. Change your URIs from localhost:8080 to localhost:3000.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done at the bottom of the form and you will be redirected to the application’s settings page. Make sure to note your Client ID and Client secret as you will need these in your application.</p>

 Build an ASP.NET MVC Application to Migrate 

<p>Now it is time to create an ASP.NET application, that we will eventually migrate to .NET Core. You can use an existing application, of course, but for the purpose of this tutorial, we will create one from scratch. The application will consist of a home page and a dashboard page for users after they are authenticated. The dashboard will retrieve a list of users from a web service and provide a way to send emails. To authenticate users you will use Okta. Okta’s <code>Okta.AspNet</code> package makes using Okta for authentication as simple as a few lines of code.</p>

 Create an ASP.NET Framework MVC Application 

<p>Open Visual Studio and select New Project. Under the Web section select ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) and give it a name. On the next screen select MVC and select OK. After the application is scaffolded, you can get to work.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Right-click on your project name and select Properties. Under the Web section set your Project Url to localhost:3000.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Install Okta’s ASP.NET library with the package command <code>Install-Package Okta.AspNet -Version 1.5.0</code>.</p>

<p>In your <code>web.config</code> file add the following entries to the <code>&lt;appSettings&gt;</code> node.</p>

   <code>    &lt;add key="okta:OktaDomain" value="{yourOktaDomain}"/&gt;
    &lt;add key="okta:ClientId" value="{yourClientId}"/&gt;
    &lt;add key="okta:ClientSecret" value="{yourClientSecret}"/&gt;
    &lt;add key="okta:RedirectUri" value="http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback"/&gt;
    &lt;add key="okta:PostLogoutRedirectUri" value="Home/Index"/&gt;
</code>   

<p>You should also add the SMTP configuration to your <code>web.config</code>. Add the code below and replace the asterisks with your SMTP configuration values.</p>

   <code>&lt;system.net&gt;
    &lt;mailSettings&gt;
      &lt;smtp from="*"&gt;
        &lt;network enableSsl="true" host="*" port="*" userName="*" password="*"/&gt;
      &lt;/smtp&gt;
    &lt;/mailSettings&gt;
  &lt;/system.net&gt;
</code>   

 Create your Controllers 

<p>Under your <code>Controllers</code> folder add or update the following controllers; <code>HomeController</code>, <code>AccountController</code>, and <code>DashboardController</code>.</p>

<p><code>HomeController</code> is the simplest. It has one action that returns a view called <code>Index</code>.</p>

   <code>using System.Web.Mvc;

namespace ConversionApp.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>AccountController</code> will contain your <code>LogOff</code> method that will log the user out of your website using Okta.</p>

   <code>using System.Web;
using System.Web.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNet;

namespace ConversionApp.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult LogOff()
        {
            if (HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.SignOut(
                    CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType,
                    OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationType);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, <code>DashboardController</code> will have an <code>Index</code> action that returns a view, but it also has two more actions. One sends an email and the other gets a list of users from a mock web service.</p>

   <code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Mvc;
using System.NET;
using System.NET.Mail;
using System.IO;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace ConversionApp.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class DashboardController : Controller
    {
        // GET: Dashboard
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

        //send email
        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult SendEmail()
        {
            SmtpClient smtpClient = new SmtpClient();
            smtpClient.EnableSsl = true;
            MailMessage mail = new MailMessage();

            //Setting From , To and CC
            mail.From = new MailAddress("nik@fishbowlllc.com", "Nickolas Fisher");
            mail.To.Add(new MailAddress("nik@fishbowlllc.com", "Nickolas Fisher"));

            mail.Subject = "Hello From the Conversion App";

            mail.Body = "this is my test email";

            smtpClient.Send(mail);

            return new JsonResult(){ Data = true };
        }

        public ActionResult GetUsers()
        {
            WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
            request.Method = "GET";

            WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();

            using (var reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()))
            {
                var text = reader.ReadToEnd();
                var userList = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;Models.UserModel&gt;&gt;(text);
                return new JsonResult()
                {
                    Data = userList,
                    JsonRequestBehavior = JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet
                };
            }

            throw new Exception("There was a problem fetching the users");
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>A model called <code>UserModel</code> is added to the <code>Models</code> folder and contains the relevant data from the web service call to send down to your client.</p>

   <code>namespace ConversionApp.Models
{
    public class UserModel
    {
        public int id { get; set; }
        public string name { get; set; }
        public string username { get; set; }
        public string email { get; set; }
        public string website { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

 Add your Views 

<p>There are four views you need to add or edit. The first is the <code>Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> file. Most of this is the automated code Visual Studio created.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;@ViewBag.Title - Conversion - An Okta Demo&lt;/title&gt;
    @Styles.Render("~/Content/css")
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/modernizr")

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top"&gt;
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="navbar-header"&gt;
                &lt;button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse"&gt;
                    &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/button&gt;
                @Html.ActionLink("Conversion", "Index", "Home", new { area = "" }, new { @class = "navbar-brand" })
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse"&gt;
                &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav"&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
                @Html.Partial("_LoginPartial")
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="container body-content"&gt;
        @RenderBody()
        &lt;hr /&gt;
        &lt;footer&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; @DateTime.Now.Year - Conversion by &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Nik Fisher.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jquery")
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/bootstrap")
    @RenderSection("scripts", required: false)
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, you can edit the <code>Shared/_LoginPartial.cshtml</code> file. This partial view will display a login button to an authenticated user, and a logout button if the user is logged in. You do not need the register button that Visual Studio adds in, since Okta is handling the authentication.</p>

   <code>@if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
{
    using (Html.BeginForm("LogOff", "Account", FormMethod.Post, new { id = "logoutForm", @class = "navbar-right" }))
    {

    &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Hello + @User.Identity.Name + !
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:document.getElementById('logoutForm').submit()"&gt;Log off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    }
}
else
{
    &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink("Log in", "Index", "Dashboard", routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = "loginLink" })&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you will edit the <code>Home/Index.cshml</code> page. Again, Visual Studio has some stock marketing for ASP.NET here. You can just replace it with some information about your site.</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Home Page";
}

&lt;div class="jumbotron"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Conversion&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class="lead"&gt;A demo using .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Okta&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"&gt;Learn more &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Learn how to convert a .NET Framework MVC web application using Okta to a .NET Core application.  
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="btn btn-default" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301865"&gt;Learn more &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Okta&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Powerful Single Sign-On provider &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="btn btn-default" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301866"&gt;Learn more &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Author&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Written by Nik Fisher&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="btn btn-default" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301867"&gt;Learn more &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally, add the dashboard page where most of your functionality lives. This page will populate a table asynchronously with data that is fetched from the mock API. There is also some Javascript for sending the email.</p>

   <code>
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Index";
}

&lt;div class="row mb-2"&gt;
    &lt;div class="alert alert-dismissable"&gt;
        &lt;button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="sendEmail()"&gt;Send Email&lt;/button&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Username&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Website&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

@section scripts
{
&lt;script&gt;

        $(document).ready(function () {
            $.get('@Url.Action("GetUsers", "Dashboard")', function (data) {
                $.each(data, function (key, value) {
                    var row = '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + value.name + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + value.username + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + value.email + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + value.website + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;';
                    $('table').append(row);
                });
            });
        });

        function sendEmail() {
            $.post('@Url.Action("SendEmail", "Dashboard")', function (data) {
                console.log(data);
            })
        }

&lt;/script&gt;
}
</code>   

 Set up the Startup.cs file 

<p>To allow Okta to work with your ASP.NET application you will need to set it up in the <code>App_Start/Startup.Auth.cs</code> file.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies;
using Owin;
using Okta.AspNet;
using Microsoft.Owin.Security;
using System.Configuration;

namespace ConversionApp
{
    public partial class Startup
    {
        // For more information on configuring authentication, please visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301864
        public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
        {
            app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);
            app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());

            app.UseOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
            {
                OktaDomain = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["okta:OktaDomain"],
                ClientId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["okta:ClientId"],
                ClientSecret = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["okta:ClientSecret"],
                AuthorizationServerId = "default",
                RedirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["okta:RedirectUri"],
                PostLogoutRedirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["okta:PostLogoutRedirectUri"]
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

 Migrate your .NET Framework App to .NET Core 

<p>Your ASP.NET sample application is complete and you are ready to migrate to ASP.NET Core!</p>

<p>Open Visual Studio and create a new project. This time, select ASP.NET Core Web Application. Give it a name and click Create. For this, select No Authentication and Web Application (Model-View-Controller). You can also uncheck Configure for HTTPS as this won’t be necessary immediately.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will want to set your App URL to localhost:3000 as you did with the ASP.NET application.</p>

 Install dependencies 

<p>As with any project, start by installing the dependencies. For this, you will use <code>MailKit</code> and <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code>. With the release of .NET Core, Microsoft now recommends not using the <code>System.NET.Mail</code> libraries that you may be familiar with. MailKit is the preferred library to send emails according to their documentation. <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> is the .NET Core version of Okta’s authentication library. There are minor changes when migrating to this package but it’s just as easy as the .NET Framework version.</p>

   <code>    Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 3.1.1
    Install-Package MailKit -Version 2.8.0
</code>   

 Configure Appsettings.json 

<p>Chances are you are familiar with the <code>web.config</code> that ASP.NET has used for years. With .NET Core, <code>web.config</code> is no longer used. Instead, you will use <code>appsettings.json</code> for any of your configuration settings. By default, Visual Studio will add both <code>appsettings.json</code> and <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> files. If you decide to add new appsettings files, such as <code>appsettings.Production.json</code> you can change the <code>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT</code> variable to Production to use that file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For this application, you can use <code>appsettings.json</code>. Add the following code to it. Again, you will need to replace the SMTP values with your configuration settings.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Okta": {
    "OktaDomain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  },
  "Smtp": {
    "Host": "",
    "Port": 0,
    "Username": "",
    "Password": ""
  }
}
</code>   

 Startup.cs for .NET Core 

<p>Another core element of ASP.NET that is gone is the <code>global.asax</code> file. If you used OWIN in the past, you are familiar with the <code>Startup.cs</code> file. In ASP.NET Core the Startup file is the main way you set up your application. Here you will register middleware, leverage .NET Core’s built-in dependency injection, and configure your application.</p>

<p>Before you start that, create a new folder called <code>Settings</code>, and in it, add a file called <code>SmtpSettings.cs</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>namespace Okta_Conversion_Core.Settings
{
    public class SmtpSettings
    {
        public string Host { get; set; }
        public int Port { get; set; }
        public string Username { get; set; }
        public string Password { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now open your <code>Startup.cs</code> file and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;

namespace Okta_Conversion_Core
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddControllersWithViews();

            services.Configure&lt;Settings.SmtpSettings&gt;(Configuration.GetSection("Smtp"));

            var oktaMvcOptions = new OktaMvcOptions()
            {
                OktaDomain = Configuration.GetSection("Okta").GetValue&lt;string&gt;("OktaDomain"),
                ClientId = Configuration.GetSection("Okta").GetValue&lt;string&gt;("ClientId"),
                ClientSecret = Configuration.GetSection("Okta").GetValue&lt;string&gt;("ClientSecret"),
                Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
            };

            services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
            {
                options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
            })
            .AddCookie()
            .AddOktaMvc(oktaMvcOptions);

            services.AddMvc();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
            }
            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();

            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
            {
                endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Most of this code is boilerplate from selecting MVC as your project type in the project creation. You will need to add <code>app.UseAuthentication()</code> to your <code>Configure</code> method. In <code>ConfigureServices</code> you will add the setup logic for Okta. With these two setups, you will be able to use the <code>Authorize</code> attribute on your actions or controllers the same as you did in ASP.NET.</p>

<p>You also added a line for configuring the SmtpSettings as a service in your application. This line will pull the <code>Smtp</code> section from your appsettings file and bind it to the selected model. Then it will make the configuration available using the IOptions Pattern in .NET Core.</p>

 Migrate controllers 

<p>You can now begin the process of migrating your controllers. First is the <code>HomeController</code>. This is also the simplest in your application. This controller will look also exactly as it did in ASP.NET, except that the directive will point at the new <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc</code> namespace.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace Okta_Conversion_Core.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you can implement your <code>AccountController</code>. In ASP.NET Core you will add a <code>SignIn</code> action that will return a <code>Challenge</code> if the user isn’t authenticated. The internal logic of this is contained in the Okta Asp.NET Core library. You also have the <code>LogOff</code> action which looks a little different than the classic ASP.NET version but is still simple to implement.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_Conversion_Core.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult SignIn()
        {
            if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        [Authorize]
        public ActionResult LogOff()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(
                    new[]
                    {
                            OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                            CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
                    },
                    new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/Home/" });

                    }
         }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, you will need to add your <code>DashboardController</code>. Since this is where the bulk of your logic is, we should take a little extra time to go over it. Add your <code>DashboardController</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

using MailKit.NET.Smtp;
using MimeKit;

using System.NET;
using System.IO;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;

namespace Okta_Conversion_Core.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class DashboardController : Controller
    {
        IOptions&lt;Settings.SmtpSettings&gt; _smtpSettings;

        public DashboardController(IOptions&lt;Settings.SmtpSettings&gt; smtpSettings)
        {
            _smtpSettings = smtpSettings;
        }

        // GET: Dashboard
        public ActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

        //send email
        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult SendEmail()
        {
            SmtpClient smtpClient = new SmtpClient();

            MimeMessage message = new MimeMessage();

            MailboxAddress to = new MailboxAddress("Nik Fisher", "nik@fishbowlllc.com");
            MailboxAddress from = new MailboxAddress("Nik Fisher", "nik@fishbowlllc.com");

            message.To.Add(to);
            message.From.Add(from);

            message.Subject = "Hello From the Conversion App";

            BodyBuilder bodyBuilder = new BodyBuilder();
            bodyBuilder.HtmlBody = "&lt;p&gt;this is my test email&lt;/p&gt;";
            bodyBuilder.TextBody = "this is my test email";

            smtpClient.Connect(_smtpSettings.Value.Host, _smtpSettings.Value.Port, true);
            smtpClient.Authenticate(_smtpSettings.Value.Username, _smtpSettings.Value.Password);

            smtpClient.Send(message);
            smtpClient.Disconnect(true);
            smtpClient.Dispose();

            return new JsonResult(true);
        }

        public ActionResult GetUsers()
        {
            WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
            request.Method = "GET";

            WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();

            using (var reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream()))
            {
                var text = reader.ReadToEnd();
                var userList = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;Models.UserModel&gt;&gt;(text);
                return new JsonResult(userList);
            }

            throw new Exception("There was a problem fetching the users");
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>First, the entire controller is under the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute. This is the same as it was in ASP.NET.</p>

<p>You make use of the <code>IOptions</code> pattern by injecting the <code>SmtpSettings</code> into the controller. Now this controller will have access to the configuration you set up in your appsettings file.</p>

<p>The <code>SendEmail</code> action is considerably different. Microsoft has depreciated the <code>System.NET.Mail</code> libraries that were used in ASP.NET to send emails. Now they recommended using MailKit to send emails. MailKit is very simple though. If you are familiar with the <code>System.NET.Mail</code> libraries implementing the MailKit version is very similar.</p>

<p>The last thing to notice here is that <code>JsonResult</code> now has a constructor that takes a parameter containing your data. In ASP.NET you had to set the data manually after calling the constructor. The new syntax makes for cleaner code and allows you to inject the data right into the <code>JsonResult</code> object.</p>

 Migrate Your Views to .NET Core 

<p>Finally, it’s time to migrate your views. There are only a few changes here. To start, <code>Dashboard/Index.cshtml</code> and <code>Home/Index.cshtml</code> are the same as they were in the ASP.NET project. The nice thing is Razor hasn’t changed much.</p>

<p>For reference see below for the <code>Home/Index</code> page.</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Home Page";
}

&lt;div class="jumbotron"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Conversion&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p class="lead"&gt;A demo using .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Okta&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.okta.com/" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg"&gt;Learn more &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Learn how to convert a .NET Framework MVC web application using Okta to a .NET Core application.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="btn btn-default" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301865"&gt;Learn more &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Okta&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Powerful Single Sign-On provider &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="btn btn-default" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301866"&gt;Learn more &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Author&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Written by Nik Fisher&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="btn btn-default" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=301867"&gt;Learn more &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>And now you can add your code for the <code>Dashboard/Index</code> page.</p>

   <code>
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Index";
}

&lt;div class="row mb-2"&gt;
    &lt;div class="alert alert-dismissable"&gt;
        &lt;button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="sendEmail()"&gt;Send Email&lt;/button&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Username&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Email&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Website&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

@section scripts
{
    &lt;script&gt;

        $(document).ready(function () {
            $.get('@Url.Action("GetUsers", "Dashboard")', function (data) {
                $.each(data, function (key, value) {
                    var row = '&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + value.name + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + value.username + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + value.email + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;' + value.website + '&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;';
                    $('table').append(row);
                });
            });
        });

        function sendEmail() {
            $.post('@Url.Action("SendEmail", "Dashboard")', function (data) {
                console.log(data);
            })
        }

    &lt;/script&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you can update your <code>Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> file. There are a couple of small changes here as the ASP.NET application was written using Bootstrap version 3 while this application was shipped with Bootstrap version 4.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;@ViewData["Title"] - Okta_Conversion_Core&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top"&gt;
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="navbar-header"&gt;
                &lt;button type="button" class="navbar-toggler" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse"&gt;
                    &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="icon-bar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/button&gt;
                @Html.ActionLink("Conversion", "Index", "Home", new { area = "" }, new { @class = "navbar-brand" })
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse"&gt;
                &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav"&gt;
                    &lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            @Html.Partial("_LoginPartial")
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="container body-content"&gt;
        @RenderBody()
        &lt;hr /&gt;
        &lt;footer&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&amp;copy; @DateTime.Now.Year - Conversion by &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Nik Fisher.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    @RenderSection("Scripts", required: false)
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally, you can update your <code>Shared/_LoginPartial.cshtml</code> with the code below. It is very similar to the ASP.NET code but there are a couple of changes to be aware of. First, to check if the user is authenticated, you need to check the <code>Context</code> object rather than the <code>Request</code> object. Also, note that you are using the new <code>TagHelpers.AnchorTagHelper</code> class to build your anchor link for signing on. You can declare the controller and action as attributes of the anchor rather than manually type in a URL.</p>

   <code>@if (Context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
{
    using (Html.BeginForm("LogOff", "Account", FormMethod.Post, new { id = "logoutForm", @class = "navbar-right" }))
    {

        &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                Hello @User.Identity.Name !
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="javascript:document.getElementById('logoutForm').submit()"&gt;Log off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    }
}
else
{
&lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
    &lt;a asp-controller="Account" asp-action="SignIn"&gt;Sign In&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
}
</code>   

 Wrap up 

<p>At this point, it’s recommended that you test all your actions and make sure they are still working properly. Between the upgrade path provided by Microsoft and the ease of using Okta, converting ASP.NET applications to ASP.NET Core can be a painless process.</p>

 The Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle Explained – Brian Burke 
 What is the Gartner Emerging Technologies Hype Cycle, and what makes it different from other Hype Cycles? 
<p>The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies is unique among Gartner Hype Cycles because we really look at all of the technologies on all of the Hype Cycles. So that's 1,700 technology profiles. And then we distill that down into a set of 30 or so technology profiles that we believe will be most impactful for organizations over the next five to 10 years.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-trends-on-the-gartner-hype-cycle-for-the-digital-workplace-2020/">6 Trends on the Gartner Hype Cycle for the Digital Workplace, 2020</a></p>
 And how do you get from 1,700 technologies down to a list of 30? 
<p>It takes a couple of months, but we start by looking at all the technology profiles that we're creating and we create a shortlist of technologies that we believe will be the most impactful. We go from about 1,700 to about 150, and then we have a broader group of analysts who actually vote on those technology profiles. The top 30 are selected during the voting process.</p>
<p>We also have an algorithm that's applied to the scoring, which basically considers whether a technology is new to all Hype Cycles. If so, that technology will get a few points extra. If the technology existed on any of the previous year’s Hype Cycles, it loses some points.</p>
<p>This is to combat the fact that in the past we had technologies that hung around on the Hype Cycle for years and years. For example, smart dust, which was a technology that was on the Hype Cycle as a perennial favorite for six years. This approach ensures that we're having a fresher view on the Hype Cycle. This is especially important given that we have limited real estate.</p>
 What are this year's trends?

<p>[swg_ad id="37038"]</p>
 Composite architectures: Composable enterprises – Yefim Natis 
 What are composite architectures and why do they matter? 
<p>A composite architecture is made up of packaged business capabilities, built on a flexible data fabric. Basically this enables an enterprise to respond really rapidly to changing business needs.</p>
<p>The ultimate benefit of composable thinking, composable architecture, composable enterprise technology is that their organization unifies resources. Composite enterprises bring business expertise and technology expertise together to reengineer decision making and establish the policies and the structures of their organizations from a focus on stability to focus on agility and continuous change.</p>
 And why is this technology featured on the Hype Cycle? 
<p>Every organization today is seeking greater resilience, greater responsiveness to change, greater ability to integrate, and greater involvement of business and of IT together in making strategic, technology and business decisions. Composable enterprise promises to significantly improve each one of these capabilities of a modern enterprise. So it's no surprise that composable enterprise generates a lot of interest, a lot of hype, promise and investment from vendors and, increasingly, from users as well.</p>
 Algorithmic trust: Authenticated provenance – Avivah Litan 
 What is authenticated provenance?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;Authenticated provenance is part of algorithmic trust. Basically what it does is authenticate the origin of something. Algorithmic trust applies to the whole life cycle. Authenticated provenance asks how do you know something is real and valid when it is created? You can use many different methods to authenticate provenance.</p>
<p>One method is humans. You can have regulators go and look at the wheat field and say, ‘Yes, this is definitely organic wheat’, but that doesn't scale very well. The second way is to use AI models and have one that distinguishes organic wheat from nonorganic wheat by looking at the different composition and biology or DNA of the wheat itself.</p>
<p>The third way you can tell that something is authentic is through certifying at the point of origin, using some technique that's relevant for that domain. So let's take a pharmaceutical, a drug that's manufactured in a plant. As soon as it's signed off by the QA process in the factory, that data is locked in, and now you have a record of that pharmaceutical drug provenance that you can track until the time someone takes the drug.</p>
 This feels really relevant to the current state of the world. Is that why it's featured this year? 
<p>The reason this technology is featured now is because it's so needed in our digital world. You can't trust anything anymore. And I know that sounds very extreme, but it's actually true. There's so much ability to insert fakes and counterfeits into processes, whether it's manufacturing or content, that we need to be able to trust the source and trust the provenance. There's also a bigger demand from consumers to know that things are trustworthy, so the need for an authenticated provenance is stronger today than it's ever been in our history.</p>
 Beyond silicon: DNA computing and storage – Nick Heudecker 
 What is DNA computing, and how does it work? 
<p>DNA computing plays into the beyond silicon trend because it introduces a brand-new computing substrate instead of using silicon. It use molecules and the reactions between those molecules to not just store data, but give you a new way to process it as well.</p>
<p>Storing data in DNA sounds hopelessly complex, but the technologies are well-established and understood. First, the digital content is compressed and mapped to the four nucleotides in DNA (adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine, or “ATGC”). Because there are four nucleotides, each nucleotide can represent two digital bits. These nucleotide codes are used to create matching synthetic DNA, which is then replicated and stored in DNA strands. Those strands are then “amplified,” or copied millions of times, to make reading the data easier when material is extracted from its storage container.</p>
<p>When the data needs to be read, the opposite process occurs. The DNA strands are prepared and sequenced back into nucleotide codes, which are then converted back into digital content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a resiliency and storage density perspective, nothing beats DNA. Properly stored, DNA can last for at least 500 years. And a gram of DNA can store over 200PB of data</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With digital data represented as DNA, the next step is introducing a processing mechanism to create a full DNA computing environment. While it is still a highly experimental domain in DNA computing, enzymatic processing is gaining prominence.</p>
<p>Enzymatic processing uses enzymes, which are proteins that act as catalysts, to perform a logical operation on a collection of DNA. This mechanism is inspired by how DNA is replicated and error-checked in organisms. Custom-designed enzymes can take the form of “logic gates” that process data and create new DNA strands as output, which can then be read by a DNA sequencer. Recent experiments have used enzymatic processing to perform machine learning over data represented as DNA.</p>
<p>From a resiliency and storage density perspective, nothing beats DNA. Properly stored, DNA can last for at least 500 years. And a gram of DNA can store over 200PB of data. Another advantage of DNA is it's never going to go out of style. We are made from it. Unlike other technologies that might be fads or become incredibly difficult to maintain, DNA is pretty straightforward. And the technologies that synthesize it and the technologies that sequence it are well- understood and falling in price every day, making it much more approachable.</p>
 How might this be used today?&nbsp; 
<p>You might see DNA computing in any industry that has a massive amount of data. A good example is <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">CERN with the Large Hadron Collider</a>. They collect petabytes of data every year. Storing that in magnetic tape is incredibly expensive. It takes a lot of room and they can only store it for about 10 years before they have to move it to fresh tape. Other use cases include storing national archives, scientific endeavors producing large amounts of data like astronomy, or industries like oil and gas.</p>
<p>But that's only half the story — you also have to be able to process that data. And this is one of the real advantages of DNA computing. You can have millions of copies of a given dataset, and you can replicate it very cheaply. Once you have that data represented millions of times, you can introduce enzymes into that pool of DNA strands, and using enzymatic reactions, it will do whatever kind of computing you might want to do. Viable DNA processing is several years away, but the possibilities are fascinating.</p>
 Where is technology in terms of market adoption? 
<p>DNA computing is at a very early stage. We've seen some early investments from large and small technology vendors. A lot of research is happening at universities, but it is very early. I think we'll see DNA storage as a viable option within three to five years, likely in a cloud infrastructure scenario. And then DNA computing will take longer to develop. I predict that's going to happen within eight to 10 years.</p>

 Formative AI: Generative AI – Svetlana Sicular 
 What is generative AI? 
<p>Generative AI is not a single technology, but it's a variety of machine learning methods that learn a representation of artifacts from data and use the data to generate brand-new, completely original, realistic artifacts. Those artifacts preserve a likeness to the training data, but they don't repeat it. It can produce novel content such as images, video music, speech, text and even materials, and all of this can be produced in combination. It can improve or alter existing content and it can create new data elements or data itself.</p>
 What are the downsides of generative AI? 
<p>Generative AI has gained a partly negative reputation because of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-ways-to-spot-fakes-and-counterfeits/">deep fakes</a>. If AI can generate a face, text or video, it could be used to compromise someone for political or blackmailing purposes. We’ve already seen the first case of a generated voice being used to embezzle money. A voice of a CEO was generated and used to request the quick transfer of a large sum of money.&nbsp; But we cannot negate the pluses, such as generative technology being used to predict how some conditions, like arthritis, will develop in the next three years.</p>
 Digital me: Bidirectional brain machine interface – Sylvain Fabre 
 What does a bidirectional brain machine interface do? 
<p>Bidirectional brain machine interfaces can turn the human brain into an Internet of Things (IoT) device. It's an interface where you can record brain activities over time and guess or infer the mood of someone or their emotional state. We call it bidirectional because you can also write just like you would write to a memory device or a computer and you can send or remove currents from the brain.</p>
<p>One early application is sending currents to change people's moods. In China, for example, experimentation has started on monitoring whether coworkers started to become angry or agitated and so on. So it's basically reading the mental state of the individual, as well as potentially changing it.</p>
 Can you share an instance of bidirectional machine interface in practice? 
<p>In terms of the applications, early examples for wellness and fitness are monitoring recorded brain activity. Another example is professional driver safety, with detection of micro sleeps. You can monitor employees’ stress and wellness. We've seen early examples of controlling machines for medical applications, for example for people with paralysis, where they could use the brain to control an exoskeleton.</p>
<p>There could also be some outcomes that are not positive for the individual, fFor example, antidepressants that today are used mostly in chemical form. Antidepressant waves dispensed via a bidirectional brain machine interface could be used to make people more pliable. You could have addiction issues where people get accustomed to sending pleasure-inducing pulses via their brain machine interfaces. So there are some dark aspects that need to be monitored.</p>
<p>We looked at the investments from venture capitalists, which gives us a direction from what has been prioritized with bidirectional brain machine interfaces. We found nothing about security or privacy,which is a bit of a concern. You have this great potential for positive use cases, together with a nonnegligible risk both for personal data and corporate information privacy and security, as well as risk of physical harm to the users. These risks need to be addressed to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-principles-for-employee-privacy/">protect individuals</a> and corporations.</p>
 This technology has a very sci-fi feel to it, but just how far out is this reality? 
<p>Beyond research in the lab, there are early products that are noninvasive. We think the next step will be more invasive variants, where people might choose to do this on their own for an advantage in sports or at work or in school. That's where the “bring your own” and shadow aspects of this would be a significant concern for corporate CIOs.</p>
<p>Our own assumption at the moment in terms of planning is that by 2025, employees experimenting with bidirectional brain machine interfaces would cause at least one major corporate data security outage. And we think by 2030, about 5% of employees in North America will use some form of bidirectional brain machine interface.</p>
<p>For example, teachers, nurses or drivers, could be monitored for alertness and their ability to be positive at work, and may be required to opt in on brain wave management, for example, to boost alertness or cognition. And again, some of that would be through the employee bringing their own, some of that would be corporate. This raises issues of consent, data privacy and security.</p>

   How ForgeRock and Secret Double Octopus Are Paving the Way for a Passwordless User Journey&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>We’re living in a world where managing digital identities is becoming an increasingly complex and tedious task. Every organization must deal with multiple accounts and credentials for users, employees, and devices. Sometimes, these siloed identities can span across dozens or hundreds of locations, and number in the thousands – or even millions. All this chaos is accelerating the adoption of passwordless technologies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all these moving parts, it can be extremely difficult to secure company information – and this results in a frustrating experience for both users and IT teams. With the infrastructure inside many organizations becoming increasingly fragmented across different servers, cloud services, and online platforms, the identity and access management problem becomes even more complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is where passwordless authentication can help. The ForgeRock Identity Platform enables fully password-free user journeys out of the box, and with technology partner Secret Double Octopus, the experience can be extended to the users <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/marketplace/api/catalog/entries/AXMAu_gtTBzErls7wdtH">workstation authentication</a>. This frees employees and administrators from the pain of remembering and managing passwords throughout the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>

 The Growing Challenge of Enterprise Identity and Access Management 

<p>Companies often struggle to set up identity and access management (IAM) solutions in a secure, easy-to-use, scalable, and future-proof way. Unfortunately, many organizations end up outsourcing this task to expensive integration specialists to make complex systems work together and to maintain these integrations over time. Either way, organizations gradually get stuck with overly complicated systems that are costly, create unnecessary risk, and can’t scale with their growing needs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The mounting challenge of identity management has spurred collaboration among different vendors to create scalable, integrated solutions that provide robust security and easily integrate with the different on-premises and cloud-based solutions that the enterprise has already invested in. These efforts have become even more important as the COVID-19 pandemic has driven&nbsp; many companies to adopt work-from-home models, making them even more dependent on reliable and scalable digital infrastructure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The addition of Secret Double Octopus’ technology to the ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/partner">Trust Network</a> extends the reach of Intelligent Authentication to the desktop login experience and provides passwordless authentication to any application protected by the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we’ve covered in a previous <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/passwordless-future-here-now">blog series</a>, passwords are a weak spot that continues to give organizations IT cost overhead and security nightmares. The deployment of passwordless authentication provides increased security, lower operational costs, less downtime, and an enhanced user experience that results in improved productivity across the organization.</p>

 How Do We Do It? 

 
 


<p>With the integration of Secret Double Octopus, ForgeRock customers can improve security, creating a more pleasant user experience for employees, and change the way IT departments handle user authentication.</p>

<p>The change starts at the workstation level – with a choice between Desktop Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using the ForgeRock app or a passwordless desktop experience that removes passwords altogether when logging in to Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac, or Linux workstations. With additional support for existing one-time password (OTP) tokens, offline scenarios, and FIDO2 keys, the workstation becomes the first step towards a passwordless enterprise.</p>

  <p>The next change happens at the directory level, with a choice to use to an existing Active Directory (AD) or Azure Active Directory (AAD) datastore, or to remove AD all together and rely on the ForgeRock Directory Service as the source of user profile data for workstation authentication.</p>

<p>Organizations have the flexibility to adopt different scenarios based on their policies, preferences, and available technology. For instance, they can choose between the ForgeRock Authenticator, the Octopus Authenticator, or a combination of both. If the work environment does not allow mobile devices, they can use FIDO2 keys as a second factor, or they can use an offline OTP if users can’t access the internet.</p>

<p>Integrating Octopus Authentication with the ForgeRock Identity Platform eliminates the need to create, change, manage or remember passwords, saving many headaches and complexities for IT teams and users. This directly results in boosted uptime and productivity, as well as increased security, thanks to a universal user experience across all applications.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Together, ForgeRock and <a href="https://doubleoctopus.com/">Secret Double Octopus</a> provide customers with a clear path to transition from costly and risky user-managed passwords toward a passwordless future. Organizations can now deploy a single authentication mechanism to serve all their needs in a frictionless, cost-efficient way through a known and trusted platform.</p>

<p>The magic of innovation means that once a technology, product or tool becomes mainstream, it’s difficult for people to remember a time without it. E-commerce and same-day delivery options are to be expected whether you’re buying clothing, household items, electronics, and now even groceries. While the online grocery store market has seen steady growth, COVID-19—<a href="https://authenteq.com/how-covid-19-have-changed-the-self-tour-industry/">as it did with many industries</a>—dramatically shifted consumer behavior and, seemingly overnight, became the new norm. And yet, even for those grocery stores who were already operating online, there is one item on their shelves that presents a unique problem: alcohol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a<a href="https://research.rabobank.com/far/en/sectors/beverages/the-2020-alcohol-e-commerce-playbook.html"> RaboResearch report</a>, online alcohol sales reached $2.6 billion in the US in 2019, up 22 percent. Despite this growth, the same report predicts that alcohol brands are losing billions of dollars in online sales opportunities and missing out on building digital relationships with their consumers.</p>



<p>The physical sale of alcohol is one area where the legislation is very clear. A legal purchasing limit is set. Age verification is required. Fines are actively enforced. In Europe and the US, alcohol can be purchased in grocery stores, corner stores, specialty shops, and even in some pharmacies. These purchases require a face to face interaction solely because of the age verification step. But while good innovation can feel like magic, legislation often lags behind, as is the case with online alcohol sales. Add in a global pandemic, social distancing, and isolation, and suddenly what felt more like an exception becomes the rule.</p>



<p>Bier mich</p>



<p>In Germany, a system has been honed over the years that have in fact included the online purchase of alcohol. Wine or beer can be ordered and delivered to a private residence, but to receive the alcohol, a government-issued ID needs to be provided by the purchasing party and verified by the delivery person. Before COVID-19 hit, there were issues with deliveries being sent to locations like DHL boxes which meant the identity verification step could not be completed. However, by and large, the system was working, and it was working well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As COVID-19 spread, Germans, and citizens around the world for that matter, needed more space and less interaction. E-commerce and shipping providers began offering zero contact delivery in response. With no human exchange taking place at all anymore, what does this mean for alcohol sales? In the absence of updated nationwide regulations, the onus of how to navigate increased online alcohol sales has been left up to the individual shops. As it turns out, ensuring that alcohol is not being purchased and consumed by minors is much harder to regulate during a global pandemic.</p>



<p>More than money&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underage drinking poses a number of risks. In the US, alcohol plays a role in over 180,000 injuries and 4,000 deaths<a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/underage-drinking"> annually</a>. Selling alcohol online is more than a matter of profit or meeting economic demands, it is also a matter of corporate social responsibility. For any company that values protecting minors online, selling any product or service that could be classified within the vice industry—that is alcohol, tobacco, gaming and betting, adult websites—proper age and identity verification absolutely needs to be baked in.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Retailers across Europe and the US, both large multinationals and smaller brick and mortar shops, can easily integrate a KYC solution into their online systems. Rather than implementing a basic age checkbox, an automated identity and age verification system can protect your business and your customers.</p>



<p>Authenteq allows you to verify your customers and their identity through any channel without compromising their privacy or security. The omnichannel solution is fully automated and provides verification within minutes. With desktop and mobile solutions, it can be easily integrated into the sales process without channel breakage to keep your customer retention and completion rates high. Of course, a KYC tool with manual verification of online sales is better than no KYC at all, but with the expected immediacy of online purchases, manual intervention is both costly and lengthy.</p>



<p>By implementing an identity and age verification process like Authenteq’s into your own solution, you can unlock new growth potential in a safe and secure way for all.</p>



<p>Looking ahead</p>



<p>COVID-19 has taught us many things, but perhaps one of the biggest lessons so far is how adaptable companies and consumers must be. Consumer buying behavior evolves over time, but it can also change overnight.</p>



<p>As e-commerce sales continue to grow across all sectors, the barriers to entry are, for now, harder for alcohol marketplaces. Those that see these barriers as a reason to not enter the space at all, will see profound consequences. Participating in the online ecosystem is necessary for brands to stay connected to their customers, but brands that also consider and incorporate their own corporate social responsibility goals into that online presence are much better poised to respond to changes, and flourish while doing so.</p>

Users can choose these Exchanges for depositing and trading (all withdrawals from the Exchange to MYKEY account are not affected).</p><p>If users inadvertently deposit to the Exchange that does not support smart contracts, users can send a ticket order to the Exchange, and in most cases, users will do manual receipt processing. If not properly handled, users can contact MYKEY for further assistance.</p><p>If the Exchange has supported contract deposit but not be listed, it can submit PR in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mykeylab/smart-contract-friendly-exchanges">github</a>.</p><p>We believe a smart wallet will be an important product to help blockchain enter thousands of households. The consensus on smart contract needs to be established by the whole industry.

  <p>IAM implementations are not all same, but for sure there is not as many implementations as there are situations.I have selected 3 major factors which defined our IAM project. Of course, final result was a consequence of lot more things.</p>
<p>And yes, we succeeded to implement full Identity lifecycle in the enterprise where starting point is a complex matrix of requirements like&nbsp;multiple legal entities, multiple contracts, kinds of work relationships, several account directories, manual processes.</p>
<p>Just name any situation, we had it. We were on the edge of failure and almost ready to add yet another failed IAM project to the list.&nbsp;But we made it and if I had to do it yet again in another place, in another situation, I would take these 3 with me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<p>-Correct data is vital for every IT project, IAM is not special. But where to exactly look in the IAM project? Which issues with the data are toxic?</p>
<p>-The analysis of the system drives implementation architecture and design. Thereby the steering must be correct.</p>
<p>-And finally, how to bring it out in the enterprise scale if you cannot do big bang but same time you cannot left anybody behind?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve8_2020_09_03_vool"></a>

<p>In this session, learn 10 key steps to achieving Universal Privilege Management, and how it is used to secure every user, session, and asset across your IT environment. Covered topics include:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Why relying on password management alone leaves dangerous gaps in protection 
 Disrupting the cyberattack chain with privileged access security controls 
 Essential steps to achieving rapid leaps in risk reduction 
 Keys to a frictionless PAM solution that is invisible to end users 
 
<p>We will also share how the BeyondTrust Privileged Access Management (PAM) platform enables absolute control over every privilege in your environment to drastically reduce your attack surface and windows of exposure, while boosting business productivity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve8_2020_09_03_haber"></a>

<p>Given that background, you might assume that this was another session about zero trust. It’s not.</p>
<p>Recently, a growing emphasis on data privacy has sought to treat identities and their associated data as valuable works of art as well, worthy of protection and compensation for use. Through the lens of the Gardner Theft, we’ll evaluate the current proposals and concepts around user-owned data and explore the benefits and pitfalls of each.</p>
<p>We'll step through the heist, recreate those 81 minutes, and discover how identity data is the new Vermeer. Note: If we somehow crack the case together, we'll split the $10 million between us all.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve8_2020_09_03_kiser"></a>

<p>Der Regierungsrat hat am 25. April 2018 die
Strategie «<a href="https://rr.zh.ch/dam/regierungsrat/rat/pdf/kommissionen/sdi/strategie/Strategie_Digitale_Verwaltung.pdf.spooler.download.1531402793115.pdf/Strategie_Digitale_Verwaltung.pdf">Digitale
Verwaltung</a>» festgesetzt. Sie zeigt auf, wie die Verwaltung die digitale
Entwicklung gestalten und die Chance der Digitalisierung nutzen will. Teil der
Strategie ist ein Impulsprogramm mit Digitalisierungsvorhaben, die vorrangig
und eng koordiniert angegangen werden. Das Impulsprogramm umfasst unter Ziel 1
«Vereinfachung und Ausbau des digitalen Leistungsangebotes» auch das Projekt
«IP1.5: Studie zum Einsatz der Blockchain-Technologie». Procivis&nbsp;wurde
mit der Ausarbeitung dieser Studie betraut. Wir veröffentlichen hier die
Zusammenfassung der Studie.&nbsp;Den Link zur gesamten Studie&nbsp;ist am Ende
des Blogs zu finden</p>



 Zusammenfassung 



<p>Eine Blockchain ist die
Aneinanderreihung von Datensätzen, Blöcke genannt, die durch kryptographische
Verfahren miteinander fest verkettet sind. Die Darstellung von Informationen
als Kette (“Chain“) von Blöcken (“Block“)
ergibt das Kunstwort Blockchain. Die Verkettung der Blöcke mittels Hashes
erlaubt es, die gesamte Vorgeschichte einer Blockchain jeweils in den neuesten
Block zu kondensieren. Damit entsteht ein unverfälschbarer Audit-Trail.</p>



<p>Blockchains können
unterschiedlich konzipiert werden. Erstens wird differenziert bezüglich des
Grads der Zugangsrechte (Unterscheidung nach Lese- und Schreiberechten).
Zweitens wird unterschieden nach Konsensregeln, die festlegen, wer den
nächsten Block berechnen und publizieren darf. Es besteht eine logische
Abhängigkeit zwischen Zugangsrechten und Konsensregeln. Blockchains, die Lese-
und Schreibrechte uneingeschränkt gewähren, wenden normalerweise die
Konsensregel Proof-of-Work an. Bei dieser Konsensregel ist die Rechenleistung
der einzelnen Teilnehmer der entscheidende Faktor. Bekannteste Beispiele dieser
Art von Blockchain sind Bitcoin und Ethereum. Diese Art von Blockchains hat
sich bezüglich der Sicherheit als robust erwiesen; ihr grösster Nachteil ist,
dass der Skalierung – also der Fähigkeit, grosse Mengen von Transaktionen
durchzuführen, Grenzen gesetzt sind. Zudem brauchen sie grosse Mengen Energie.
Am anderen Ende des Blockchain-Spektrums bewegen sich private Blockchains, wo
sowohl Lese- wie auch Schreibrechte auf einen ausgewählten Kreis beschränkt
sind. Hier stellt die Skalierung kein sonderliches Problem dar; auch der
Energieverbrauch ist bei solchen Blockchains vernachlässigbar. Allerdings
bieten solche Blockchains aufgrund der fehlenden Transparenz und
Dezentralisierung nicht die gleichen Vorteile wie öffentliche Blockchains.</p>



<p>Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass
Blockchains dynamischen Charakter haben, also die Entwicklung von einzelnen
Datenpunkten über die Zeit darstellen, ist es möglich, auf der Blockchain
Transaktionen in Abhängigkeit von Bedingungen zu programmieren. Dies geschieht
mittels Smart Contracts. Diese sorgen dafür, dass Transaktionen
ausgeführt werden, sobald eine gewisse Bedingung erfüllt ist. Dies erlaubt es,
auch komplexe Transaktionen weitergehend zu automatisieren.</p>



<p>Die Blockchain-Technologie wurde
ursprünglich entwickelt, um über eine Infrastruktur zu verfügen, die ohne eine
zentrale Autorität auskommt. Deshalb stellt sich die Frage, inwiefern es für
den Staat Sinn macht, diese Technologie einzusetzen, ist er als Inhaber des physischen
Gewaltmonopols doch das Sinnbild einer zentralen Autorität. Im Falle eines idealen
Staates, der effizient und ordnungsgemäss arbeitet, bedeutet die Anwendung
der Blockchain-Technologie eine Verkomplizierung; zentrale Datenbanken genügen.
Ein besonderer Anwendungsbereich bilden demokratische Wahl- und
Abstimmungsverfahren, bei denen Bürgerinnen und Bürger ihr Wahlgeheimnis
gewahrt wissen, gleichzeitig aber auch sicher sein wollen, dass ihr politischer
Wille korrekt ins Ergebnis einfliesst. Auf öffentlichen Blockchains wäre dies
möglich; allerdings zum Preis der Unmöglichkeit der späteren Vernichtung der
Wahlunterlagen.</p>



<p>Staaten weichen vom Ideal ab, indem sie Strukturen und Prozesse aufweisen,
die einen mehr oder weniger effizienten Mitteleinsatz zur Folge haben. Zudem
können sich Amtsträgerinnen und Amtsträger und Staatsangestellte mehr oder
weniger gesetzeskonform verhalten bzw. Fehler machen. Blockchains können die
damit verbundenen Ineffizienzen mildern, indem sie die Grundlage für
Datenkonsistenz bieten. Darauf aufbauend können Prozesse weiter digitalisiert
und automatisiert werden, und (unbeabsichtigtes) menschliches Fehlverhalten
kann besser kontrolliert werden. Blockchains verhindern gesetzeswidriges
Verhalten nicht per se, aber ein jederzeit einsehbarer und unverfälschbarer
Audit-Trail erhöht den Druck, sich korrekt zu verhalten.</p>



<p>Der Nutzen einer
Blockchain-Lösung kann sich nur entfalten, wenn die entsprechenden
Rahmenbedingungen gegeben sind. Jeder Veränderungsprozess setzt politischen
Willen und Führungsverantwortung voraus. Dies ist bei allfälligen
Blockchain-Anwendungen umso mehr der Fall, weil deren Implementation
Konsequenzen haben, die über technische Aspekte weit hinausgehen. Neben
organisatorischen und kulturellen Fragen sind insbesondere auch rechtliche
Fragen zu beachten: Erstens ist jeweils zu prüfen, ob für eine
Blockchain-Anwendung die erforderliche rechtliche Grundlage vorhanden
ist und zweitens, ob diese mit dem Datenschutzrecht in Einklang, und
drittens, ob eine rechtskonforme Archivierung möglich ist. Den
verfassungsmässig garantierten Rechten – Schutz von Personendaten, Recht auf
Korrektur und Löschung, Recht auf Erinnerung (die zueinander in Konkurrenz
stehen können) – ist Rechnung zu tragen.</p>



<p>Im Zuge der allgemeinen
Begeisterung über die Blockchain-Technologie im Allgemeinen und Kryptowährungen
im Speziellen sind weltweit hunderte Konzepte formuliert und Pilotprojekte für Blockchain-Anwendungen
in öffentlichen Verwaltungen durchgeführt worden. Produktive Anwendungen
mit namhaften Transaktionsvolumina sind aber noch keine bekannt. Dieser Befund
trifft auch auf die Schweiz zu: IIm Rahmen dieser Studie konnten acht
Blockchain-Projekte identifiziert werden, in denen kantonale Verwaltungen und
das Fürstentum Liechtenstein in den Bereichen Register, elektronische
Identitäten, E-Voting und Bezahlung von Gebühren erste Erfahrungen gesammelt
haben oder sammeln. Diese Projekte sind abgeschlossen worden, teilweise noch im
Gang oder in Vorbereitung. </p>



<p>Auf der Grundlage von
Prozessbeschreibungen, die im Rahmen des Projekts «Strategie Datenmanagement
und Data-Governance IP3.1» erarbeitet worden sind, wurden im Rahmen der
vorliegenden Studie vier mögliche Anwendungsbeispiele für den Kanton Zürich
entwickelt:</p>



  Registrierung von amtlichen Dokumenten auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  Bürgerdossier mit Blockchain-basiertem Logbuch zur Stärkung der Rechtssicherheit  Inventarkontrolle auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  Öffentliche Ausschreibungen auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  



<p></p>



<p>Der Reifegrad dieser Beispiele ist unterschiedlich, ebenso wie die Schwierigkeiten bei einer allfälligen Umsetzung. Allen ist jedoch gemeinsam, dass sie sich die unmittelbare und nicht mehr verfälschbare Transparenz von Blockchains zunutze machen. Zentrale Datenbanken sind nicht dafür ausgelegt, einem grossen Kreis in dynamischer Weise Transparenz zu bieten. Eine solche Funktion kann zwar auch in zentralen Architekturen nachgebaut werden, Blockchains lösen das Problem jedoch eleganter. Hinzu kommt, dass dezentrale Architekturen, wie sie Blockchains aufweisen, tendenziell einen Vertrauensvorsprung bieten, der von zentral konzipierten Lösungen nicht eingeholt werden kann.</p>

  <p>Forty-two percent of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-10-trends-in-data-and-analytics-for-2020/">data and analytics</a>&nbsp;leaders do not assess, measure or monitor their data and analytics governance, according to a recent Gartner survey. Those who said they measured their <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-best-ways-to-organize-your-data-structures/">governance activity</a> mainly focused on achieving compliance-oriented goals.</p>
<p>Good data and analytics governance enables faster, smarter decisions. Organizations that want to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-create-a-business-case-for-data-quality-improvement/">improve the quality of their data</a> often begin with data and analytics governance projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies start data and analytics governance initiatives to drive better information behaviors through their policies. These policies help maximize the investment that organizations have not just in data and analytics, but also content (pictures, voice recordings, emails, etc.) coming from <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">AI </a>and IoT, for example. However, governance practices continue to be data-oriented rather than business-oriented.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz04YWQ0ZjliY2VlMmQxMWVhYTYxNTBlZjNjMjdlNmI2Yg=="></a></p>
<p>CDOs and data and analytics leaders must ensure that their governance initiatives have concrete, measurable metrics that link data and analytics assets and initiatives to business and stakeholder value. For example, tie customer contact data quality to the percentage of customer retention in a specific market segment or percentage of revenue achieved via ecosystem partners.&nbsp;</p>
 Involve the broader organization in data governance 
<p>Data quality is not solely the job of the IT organization. Data governance work must rally stakeholders to the cause, and IT and the business must be clear on the roles they play. The business decides expectations for data quality, but the business also needs to understand that IT does not own data governance and is not responsible for data quality.</p>
<p>The key to resolving this challenge is for data and analytics leaders and CDOs to connect all governance activity specifically and directly with business outcomes and priorities.</p>

This high degree of dependency on one service can become a problem when this service faces an outage. Also, respective of the requirements companies have, all services have certain limitations which are sometimes necessary to overcome. Many cyberattacks are perpetrated via staff endpoint devices (computers, smartphones or even printers). This necessitates a fine-mesh risk management approach with a centralized solution, called Identity Fabric at KuppingerCole.

					 <p>“Identifiers” are how you are identified as a unique person and recognized as that same unique person over time. With other people, your primary identifier is your face. With organizations, it might be a student ID, social security number, or driver’s license number. Online, it might be a username, phone number, or email address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using identifiers properly helps to avoid confusing two people with one another. But identifiers can also be harmful—if a hacker gets ahold of your social security number, it could mean trouble!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most identifiers are given to us by centralized registration authorities like governments, telephone companies, and email providers. But that puts an organization in between us and our ability to access basic services, compromising privacy and putting individuals in a position of powerlessness. The answer to this problem is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standard</a> called Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p>

					 <p>DIDs are “a new type of globally unique identifier”¹ that is used in <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). It looks like this:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>You’ll notice it has three parts:<br><br></p>  Scheme: DIDs all start with <code>did:</code> just like how all website addresses start with <code>http://</code> . This is so that computers can tell what they’re looking at.  Method: After DIDs are generated, they have to be stored somewhere. They’re often stored in a blockchain or a digital wallet, but they can be stored anywhere. The method, which is the <code>example:</code> part of the DID in the example above, tells computers where to go to find the DID. For example, issuers of verifiable credentials in the Trinsic platform get a DID that has a <code>did:sov:</code> method, because the DID goes on the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>.  Identifier: This is the unique identifier of the DID.  <p>According to the W3C, a DID has the following four characteristics²:<br><br></p>  Decentralized: There should be no central issuing agency. That means you should be able to create your own DIDs independently of anyone else.  Persistent: The identifier should be inherently persistent, not requiring the continued operation of an underling organization. This is in contrast to your email, for example; if Gmail shuts down, you’d lose access to your Gmail messages.  Crytopgraphically verifiable: It should be possible to prove control of the identifier cryptographically.  Resolvable: It should be possible to discover metadata about the identifier.

					 <p>As identifiers in the Trinsic system, DIDs serve two primary functions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Publicly identifying credential issuers  Privately identifying relationships (connections)  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Credential issuers need to be publicly identifiable if they want the credentials they issue to be verifiable. We use a blockchain to post the issuers’ DID, which acts as a public key. The issuer signs the credential attributes with the corresponding private key.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each relationship in the Trinsic system is called a connection. When you make a connection, you create a DID just for that relationship and share it with the counterparty. When you want to send messages, you encrypt them so that only the counterparty can decrypt the message using the DID you shared with them. This creates a super secure, peer-to-peer channel to interact. The identifiers for these connections are kept privately in your (and the counterparty’s) wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about DIDs, feel free to <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">contact us</a> or read the W3C’s DID specification at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/</a>.</p>

<p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1315944646">https://bihu.com/article/1315944646</a></p><p>Original publish time: September 1,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   Last week, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $601 million to $16,556&nbsp;million.  Tether additionally issued 450 million USDT on Tron&nbsp;twice.  On August 29, China Construction Bank briefly opened its digital currency wallet business to the&nbsp;public.  The digital currency wallet of CCB supports features such as digital RMB bank card recharge, transfer, QR code receipt and payment, NFC one-touch payment, and cancellation.  MakerDAO stated that there had been applications from companies in the fields of treasury bonds, real estate, gold and commodity indexes, and supply chain finance to use assets as collateral for&nbsp;DAI.  Aave applied for an Electronic Money Institution license from the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom in 2018, which was approved in July this year. Aave will continue to apply for other licenses.  Tether additionally issued 10 million USDT on EOS on August 29 due to the increased DeFi activity on&nbsp;EOS.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(August 22, 2020 ~ August 28, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market circulation of major stablecoins has increased by $601 million to $16,556&nbsp;million.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past week, Tether additionally issued 450 million USDT on Tron twice. The circulation of USDC, PAX, TUSD, HUSD, DAI, and GUSD increased by 86.48 million, 17.97 million, 3.01 million, 1.24 million, 15.06 million, and 1.28 million, and the circulation of BUSD decreased by&nbsp;980,000.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all decreased by&nbsp;10,1991.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of TUSD and DAI increased by 645, and 3,860. The number of holding addresses of USDT, USDC and PAX decreased by 88,075, 18,249 and&nbsp;172.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week increased by an average of 4.75% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;3.13%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week decreased by an average of 6.85% from the previous&nbsp;week.</p> 2. The connection between stablecoins and real&nbsp;assets <p>On August 29, China Construction Bank briefly opened its digital currency wallet business to the public. Through the ‘digital currency’ feature in the China Construction Bank App, you can use the digital RMB, which is China’s CBDC. The wallet of CCB supports features such as digital RMB bank card recharge, transfer, QR code receipt and payment, NFC one-touch payment, and cancellation. Since CBDC is equivalent to legal currency and cannot be rejected, and Alipay and WeChat may also access digital RMB in the future. CBDC is also a kind of stablecoin. It is foreseeable that CBDC will be used by many people as a supplementary payment method. In this report, we will introduce the connection between stablecoins and real&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Since this year, MakerDAO has added USDC, WBTC, etc. as collateral. Last week MakerDAO stated that in the next 1–3 years, the focus of Maker will be on introducing physical assets as collateral for DAI. There have been applications from companies in the fields of treasury bonds, real estate, gold and commodity indexes, and supply chain finance to use assets as collateral for DAI. Companies and assets being applied for&nbsp;include:</p>  Real estate mortgage company New Silver implements asset tokenization using Centrifuge protocol (NS-DROP).  The trust company Paxos issued the ERC20 gold token PAX GOLD on Ethereum&nbsp;(PAXG).  Arca issued digital securities on Ethereum in the form of ARCoin (corresponding to 1-year, 2–10 year, and 10-year US government bonds).  Supply chain finance company Harbor uses the Centrifuge protocol to initiate asset tokenization (HTC-DROP).  WiV Technology launched Tokenized Wine Commodity Index Fund on Ethereum&nbsp;(WiV).  <p>The above is only being applied for as part of the collateral for DAI. Without the introduction of real assets, now DAI has 443 million in circulation, and the market capitalization of MKR has reached $676&nbsp;million.</p><p>Aave is a decentralized lending protocol, managed by AaveDAO. As early as 2018, Aave applied for an Electronic Money Institution license from the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom, and it was finally approved recently. This allows Aave to get the same as Coinbase and Revolut in Europe, which can issue electronic currency substitutes and provide payment services. Aave users can buy stablecoins and other assets in the Aave ecosystem through legal currency. Stani Kulechov, the founder of Aave, stated that Aave entities will continue to apply for other licenses to facilitate new users to join the Aave ecosystem.</p><p>Telos is a smart contract platform running on EOSIO, supporting the creation of decentralized applications and decentralized autonomous organizations. At the end of August, Telos announced a partnership with Katalyo to tokenize $35 million worth of Croatian real estate. Katalyo will issue two tokens for each real estate. One token represents the ownership of the real estate, and the other is a stablecoin anchored in legal currency generated by rental&nbsp;income.</p><p>As a global payment company, VISA is committed to providing the greatest value to individuals, businesses, and economies. Digital currency provides an opportunity for VISA to continue to expand its service range. Nowadays, the digital currency (stablecoin) backed by legal currency combines the stability of digital currency with currencies such as the U.S. dollar to become a promising new payment method. The concept of stablecoins has gradually attracted attention outside the financial technology field, including financial institutions and central banks. Consumers and businesses are also using digital currencies, leading to rapid growth in the circulation of digital currencies. VISA cooperates with the regulated and approved digital currency platforms Coinbase and Fold, etc., to provide services to the blockchain for the existing 61 million merchants. More than 25 digital currency wallets have been connected to VISA, which provides users with an easy way to use VISA debit or prepaid cards to spend from their digital currency balances wherever VISA is accepted. VISA has been committed to cooperating with global policymakers and organizations to help everyone better understand digital currencies.</p><p>According to the twitter tweeted by Sygnum on August 27, Galaxus, the largest online retailer in Switzerland, started using Sygnum Bank’s stablecoin Digital Swiss Franc (DCHF) to complete e-commerce payments. DCHF was launched in March 2020 and is anchored to the Swiss franc. Sygnum claims to be the first licensed bank in Switzerland to issue stablecoins. The bank holds a digital asset banking license from the Swiss&nbsp;FINMA.</p><p>The use of stablecoins outside the cryptocurrency market is a trend. Not only companies in the blockchain industry are actively attracting external capital to join, but also traditional financial institutions. It is foreseeable that stablecoins will enter our daily lives in the&nbsp;future.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>Earlier this year, ForgeRock published our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/2020-consumer-identity-breach-report">2020 Consumer Identity Breach Report</a> detailing insights and data on breaches impacting consumers in 2019 and Q1 2020. As highlighted in the report, healthcare was, once again, the most frequently targeted industry (43% of all breaches), personal identifiable information (PII) accounted for the most sought after data type at 98%, and unauthorized access was by far the most common attack vector, responsible for 40% of breaches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As overburdened healthcare IT professionals work tirelessly to meet the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercriminals are using the global health crisis to take advantage of institutions by exploiting unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This reality means the healthcare industry must protect against two threats at once. Neither is simple. IT professionals need to ask themselves whether they can identify high risk anomalous access. And just as importantly, explore how AI can help by automating access requests, performing certifications, and predicting what access should be provisioned to users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions fall short in their ability to address the healthcare industry’s risk landscape and cannot meet its demanding and ever-changing requirements. Why? Simply put, IGA solutions don’t provide organization-wide visibility or identity context especially as identities continue to increase in multiple applications and locations (on-premise, cloud, etc.). This leaves your risk and security teams struggling to keep up as they manually provision access privileges and rubber stamp access requests and certifications. Additionally, the resulting operational inefficiencies can leave your teams blind as to who has access to what and, more importantly, why they have access in the first place. So, what’s the cure?&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">ForgeRock Autonomous Identity</a> is an AI-driven identity analytics solution that can be layered on top of, and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/autonomous-identity-maximize-your-identity-investments-ai-driven-identity-analytics">integrated with, your existing IGA solutions</a> to provide real-time and continuous organization-wide user access visibility, control, and remediation. Autonomous Identity analyzes all identity data to give you a deeper understanding into the risk associated with user access across the entire organization. The solution ingests vast amounts of workforce, partner, and consumer (patients/members) identity data from existing identity management and governance solutions, identity stores, and user activity repositories to provide wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access.</p>

<p>For example, one of the largest healthcare retailers in the United States used ForgeRock Autonomous Identity to bring visibility and contextual insight to their employee records, applications, entitlements, and entitlement assignments. The result was 550,000 entitlement assignments identified for AI-driven automation and clean-up; an accomplishment that would have taken a lot of resources and months, if not years, for IT teams to do manually.</p>

<p>As the customer story above exemplifies, Autonomous Identity enables your risk and security teams to accomplish the seemingly impossible — reducing risk, manual processes, and costs with one solution across your disparate identity enterprise.</p>

  <p>The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst for digitization in many companies and led to an increase in remote work and adoption of the bring your own device (BYOD) policy. Every device and digital service that employees use is a potential gateway into company networks and thus poses a security risk. The risks are magnified even more when privileged accounts enter the equation because they enable access to critical data. Given the immediacy and speed with which companies had to shift from office to remote work, security concerns were often neglected leading to an increase in successful cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Facing this situation of increased risks and attack vectors, companies need to have foolproof security in place to keep their data safe and secure. IT teams should start with the very basics such as giving the company staff cybersecurity awareness trainings and monitoring remote access. While it has become a well-known fact that Privileged Access Management (PAM)&nbsp; is an integral part of cybersecurity in modern companies, Secure Compliance Management (SCM) and&nbsp;User Behaviour Analytics (UBA) perhaps have not been given proper attention in the security world yet.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/remote_workforce_security"></a>

<p>As organizations have accelerated their investments in digital initiatives, business and app teams have embraced the DevOps model, a process that speeds up software delivery. DevOps enables businesses to be agile enough to quickly adapt or be the first to market, which can have a tremendous impact on the bottom line.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time for identity to join the DevOps party. For far too long, identity initiatives have been stretched to their limits while struggling to keep pace with application growth. DevOps is starting to gain traction in the identity space—and for good reason, since identity is a key part of application onboarding. Without collaboration between identity teams and DevOps teams, many of the intended benefits of DevOps can quickly unravel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is DevOps? 
<p>The DevOps methodology for software development breaks down traditional silos by eliminating manual tasks and replacing them with automation via code so that releases and updates can be pushed out faster and more frequently. At its core, DevOps improves the efficiencies between app development and IT operations or infrastructure teams. Previously, developers would make manual requests to identity teams or IT ops and lose valuable time. In DevOps, the identity teams enable the software to be consumable via APIs or infrastructure-as-code, the preferred methods for developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the DevOps model has specific tools for implementation. The most common include Docker, which enables software in images or “containers,” and Kubernetes, the orchestration engine that manages containers. These tools allow developers to easily spin up infrastructure and perform updates with minimal interruption.</p>

 The GiD Report #125 — Everyone v. Apple, Discord’s Groups&nbsp;vision <p>If you haven’t had a chance to check it out ye, check out our first employee profile interview featuring Erik! This was a fun&nbsp;one:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team — Erik Westra, head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>  <p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Quick updates on the war against Apple’s App&nbsp;Store  Facebook’s multi-pronged fight with&nbsp;Apple  Discord’s long term vision (it sounds a little like&nbsp;Groups)  The shifting challenges of platform moderation  Symbolic: ExxonMobile booted from&nbsp;Dow  Stuff happens   1. We’ve been covering the battle between Tim Sweeney’s Epic Games and Apple’s App Store so a couple of quick updates for&nbsp;you. <p>First, the initial judge ruling, via The Information:</p><blockquote>A federal judge denied a request by Epic Games for a temporary restraining order that would have forced Apple to allow Fortnite, a popular Epic videogame, back into the App Store. But that same judge granted another request by Epic to stop Apple from kicking it out of a developer program.</blockquote><p>….</p><blockquote>In a court filing, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Epic had not shown that it was at risk of irreparable harm from Apple, which removed Fortnite from the App Store last week after Epic began violating its policies. Epic modified Fortnite to bypass an Apple payment mechanism, which in turn enabled Epic to avoid paying Apple the standard 30% commission it collects on in-app transactions.</blockquote>Photo: Mike Deerkoski<blockquote>But the judge ruled that Epic was more persuasive about the harm that could have resulted from another matter — a threat by Apple to deny Epic access to developer tools for its iOS and Mac operating systems. Epic depends on those tools for the development of Unreal Engine, an Epic product used by many outside companies to build&nbsp;games.</blockquote><blockquote>The judge said that Apple had “chosen to act severely” and that denying Epic access to the developer could have hurt games made by independent companies. The judge ordered Epic to file a motion for a longer-term injunction by Sept. 4 and a hearing it on the matter is scheduled for Sept.&nbsp;28.</blockquote><p>Apple has also made peace with Wordpress creator Automattic:</p><blockquote>Apple says it has come to an agreement with Automattic, which operates the WordPress content management system application, after Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg announced on Friday that Apple had blocked updates for the iOS version of WordPress until he agreed to add in-app purchases.</blockquote><p>The first couple of skirmishes but the war is far from&nbsp;over.</p><p>In any case, Ben Thompson thinks <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/">Apple’s App Store policy is bad for innovation, bad for customers, and ultimately bad for&nbsp;Apple</a>.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/from-kingmaker-to-autocrat-how-game-makers-went-to-war-with-apple">From Kingmaker to ‘Autocrat’: How Game Makers Went to War With&nbsp;Apple</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402547/fortnite-epic-games-apple-ios-macos-two-different-games">Fortnite is splitting into two different games because of Epic and Apple’s&nbsp;fight</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnite-makers-apple-fight-leaves-some-developers-wary-11598274027?mod=djem10point">‘Fortnite’ Maker’s Apple Fight Leaves Some Developers Wary</a>  Ben Thompson — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/">Rethinking the App&nbsp;Store</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3htFFcoo6Lc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Linus weighs in on Apple vs Epic&nbsp;Games</a>   2. In part because Facebook has joined the chat. That’s because Apple’s policies are a threat to Mark Zuckerberg’s long term vision of making Facebook more of a super app in the vein of&nbsp;WeChat. <p>He made that pretty clear in a company wide town hall last week, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly">reported by Buzzfeed</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a swing at Apple on Thursday, calling the iPhone maker’s app store monopolistic and harmful to customers during a companywide meeting.</blockquote><blockquote>“[Apple has] this unique stranglehold as a gatekeeper on what gets on phones,” Zuckerberg said to more than 50,000 employees via webcast. He added that the Cupertino, California–based company’s app store “blocks innovation, blocks competition” and “allows Apple to charge monopoly&nbsp;rents.”</blockquote><p>Mark has a point and it’s one reason why China has superapps while the rest of us don’t. Apple has set it up so that the iOS itself is the superapp — further entrenched by its deep integration of features such as payments and now identity.</p><p>It’s not Facebook’s only tiff w/Apple,&nbsp;BTW:</p><blockquote>A new fight between Facebook and Apple over the mechanics of ad tech is surfacing an industry divide over user privacy and spotlighting longstanding dilemmas about the tracking and use of personal information online, Axios’ Kyle Daly&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Privacy advocates have been sounding alarms for years about tech firms’ expansive, sometimes inescapable data harvesting without making much headway in the U.S. But the game could change if major industry players start taking opposite&nbsp;sides.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Facebook warned advertisers Wednesday that a coming change to Apple’s iOS could devastate revenue for ads that sends users straight to the App Store to install an app — an approach that’s used widely by developers including mobile game&nbsp;makers.</blockquote><p>Like I said, a lot is at stake and both sides are in it for the long&nbsp;haul.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/f20e9b">Briefing: Facebook Says Apple Changes Could Kill Part of its Ads&nbsp;Business</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-warns-advertisers-on-apple-privacy-changes-5018b903-c2af-43cb-afef-4f53ce7b0f2a.html">Facebook warns advertisers on Apple privacy&nbsp;changes</a>  <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly">Mark Zuckerberg Said Apple Has A “Stranglehold” On Your&nbsp;iPhone</a>  <p>3. Because the battle between Facebook and Apple is just starting to heat&nbsp;up.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-00909c64-4f0d-4233-bb83-e8a4f90ef61a.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook and Apple are fighting an increasingly high stakes battle over user privacy and access to the iOS App Store, deepening a rift between two of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley, Axios’ Scott Rosenberg and I&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: By trading accusations, Facebook and Apple could just be handing more ammo to critics and regulators — but at the same time, conflict between these giants could be read as a sign of competitive life and a rebuttal to antitrust charges.</blockquote><p>A sign of the&nbsp;times:</p><blockquote>Our thought bubble: Historically, the big tech companies have maintained power by dominating a key market while competing with one another at the edges. The Apple-Facebook fight shows that they’re now willing to take swings at each other’s core businesses.</blockquote> 3. The thing is, Apple’s approach also bucks the macro trend. More apps want to do&nbsp;more. <p>Consider Discord, <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-d2587314-f65c-4cf0-b20f-50ab02564d47.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Discord began in 2015 as a way for gamers to talk to one another before, during, and after play. Now, the chat company is pursuing a far broader vision: to be the Slack for your non-work&nbsp;life.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: In the age of COVID-19, more than ever before, people need the online equivalent of social spaces like bars, restaurants and&nbsp;stages.</blockquote><blockquote>How it&nbsp;works:</blockquote>  Discord allows people to create their own online community space, to set and enforce rules and decide whether to remain invite-only or open it to the&nbsp;public.  Users can share messages in various channels, chat privately and have group discussions. More recently, the company has added group video&nbsp;chat.  Discord calls each community’s space a “server,” but it’s not a server in the sense of a separate computer controlled by the user. Users can run servers without needing system-administrator knowhow.  This arrangement has pros and cons. It means Discord controls the data and is responsible for complying with law enforcement. But it also means the service can enforce its own code of conduct, handling trust, safety and security.  <p>One way to think about it: all of these various products are really just various combinations of a few core building blocks: identity, messaging, and payments (and groups!).</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/line-launches-digital-asset-wallet-and-blockchain-development-platform">LINE Launches Digital Asset Wallet and Blockchain Development Platform — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-confirms-acquisition-of-vr-startup-spaces-87449f9f-d2b3-4294-a33c-c7377ba90b48.html">Apple confirms acquisition of VR startup&nbsp;Spaces</a>   4. The thing about bringing people together on a platform (through identity, messaging, and payments) is that humans have a tendency to do really amazing things but also some really nasty things. And one of the big takeaways from this latest tech cycle is how we optimize the former and mitigate the&nbsp;latter. <p>A recent battleground has been Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits platform liability from user behavior.</p><p>But the days of that laissez-faire approach could be coming to the&nbsp;end.</p><p>AT&amp;T is firing the latest salvo in that movement:</p><blockquote>AT&amp;T will tell the Federal Communications Commission that the agency should craft rules to shrink tech’s longstanding legal shield, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: AT&amp;T is a telecom giant and, since buying Time Warner, a major force in media and entertainment — both industries that have butted heads with Silicon Valley.

  The evolution of cybersecurity protection demands a more nuanced response to providing access to a company’s sensitive resources. Policy-based access control (PBAC) combines identity attributes and context variables to enable sophisticated granting of access to corporate systems and protected resources based on centrally managed policies that ensure consistent access control decisions across the enterprise. Advancement in both business requirements and technology (such as growing use of micro-services), require a better way to control access. In a way that is consistent across all silos, dynamic enough to react to change in risk, and provides better control for the application business owners.

					 <p>When the outbreak of COVID-19 started, Michael Corning, the Cryptocosm Architect at <a href="https://www.secours.io/">Secours.io</a>, wanted to build a self-sovereign identity (SSI) based app that would help reopen his local economy in Sisters, Oregon without reopening the pandemic. As we all know, how easy it is to adopt a new technology or software plays a key role in its ultimate success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first version of his app proved to be too complicated and idealistic for businesses and organizations to adopt. He quickly reevaluated his strategy and built a more simplified app, called Safe in Sisters, which was built with adoption in mind. The Q&amp;A below is our interview with him to learn more about the changes he made to create an SSI-based app that was “adoptable”.&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What is the Safe in Sisters project? What is its purpose? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic hit the state of Oregon and we shuttered shops and public places, here in my little piece of heaven—the city of Sisters—I went to some of my friends at <a href="https://edcoinfo.com/covid-19-central-oregon-business-resources/">Economic Development for Central Oregon</a> and told them how I wanted to reopen the Sisters economy without reopening the pandemic. They both loved the idea. Two of my physicians heard me explain how I was planning to accomplish this mission (I wanted to know how medical providers would react). One doctor was enthusiastic, and the other had an arguable HIPAA-allergic reaction. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Armed with this mix of reactions, I set out to build a set of tools that would provide users with local contact tracing, a COVID symptoms scoring sheet (based on data published by Oregon Health Authority), and verifiable presentations. The verifiable presentations would do something as simple as check a zip code (Sisters had zero COVID cases at the time, but counties nearby glowed purple with the afflicted) or as complicated as checking for a positive COVID test result and two subsequent negative results within a two-week window.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Early on, I realized that writing the code was the easy part. Socializing the protocol and getting people to understand, value, and use the technology would be the hard part.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Turns out, I was correct.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Working with my <a href="https://enduringnet.org/">Enduring Net</a> COVID comrades across the pond, we took the prototypes to a large care center in Manchester, England. We showed them all the fancy stuff, and their first response was, “We have six entrances to our facility and handle over 600 people per day. We can’t spend time exchanging QR codes with visitors.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I learned two valuable lessons (actually, I knew the lessons but had never seen their consequences in action quite so starkly): &nbsp;<br><br></p>  My passion for complex solutions usually does not meet with equal user enthusiasm. &nbsp;<br><br>  The second lesson was best taught by Professor Edwin Jaynes in his Probability Theory: The Language of Science. He notes, “The simplest solutions aren’t best because they’re simple. They’re best because simple solutions are more likely to succeed.”&nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, I set aside the techno bling, and I started over. I was bound and determined to provide the world with a solution simple enough to succeed. &nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What makes this project unique from some of the other SSI &amp; verifiable credentials projects that are designed to combat the threat of COVID-19?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The first difference is that we focus on local ground conditions. &nbsp;People in Sisters don’t care about COVID prevalence in Manchester. They care about the prevalence at the Sisters High School or the Five Pine Lodge. They don’t care about the prevalence at Heathland Care Center in Manchester, but they care about The Lodge in Sisters care center across the street from the Fika Coffeehouse. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A second difference follows from the first: Local contact tracing is just the first line of defense.&nbsp;If a COVID carrier gets into a room and exposes other healthy people, at least those now at risk know about their invisible condition in time to do something to stop further spread.&nbsp;Once a room has carried a carrier, the room needs to bring out the big guns. The room and its visitors need other tools to access the risk of exposure. This is where symptom tracking and verifiable credentials come into play. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The third difference is that we focus on measuring risk. &nbsp;This may turn out to be the most important difference. We understand that a measurement is a set of observations that reduce uncertainty. We don’t guarantee safety; we don’t reduce risk by 100%. But we do use all available data as a set of observations that reduce the uncertainty that plagues us about the virus. Our tools provide users with consistent metrics they can use to make informed decisions about who is safe enough to interact with. No more controversy. No more excuses. No more virus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our job as technologists is not to show how cool our technology is. It’s to save lives. It’s to stop the virus in its tracks. My job is to make Sisters the COVID Hotel California—the virus can check-in, but it will never check-out.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Why have you focused on a local contact tracing solution? What is the difference between contact tracing and local contact tracing?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>All politics are local. All battles with the virus are local. Most of those affected by the virus are local. Local contact tracing is far simpler and more reliable than conventional contact tracing. We can control the virus in our town without help from the government or from Apple and Google. We don’t need GPS. We don’t need Bluetooth. But we do need common sense, privacy, and secure messaging.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since local contact tracing is local and not centralized at scale, and since the code and infrastructure is neither complex nor expensive, we expect rapid replication across the planet, not of the virus, but of the tools to kill it.&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Can you go into detail of how the Safe in Sisters app works? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Since local contact tracing is a free service, I moved development to my nonprofit counterpart of Secours.io, <a href="http://soteria.id/">the Soteria Institute</a>. The <a href="https://soterialct.z22.web.core.windows.net/">Soteria Local Contact Tracing</a> tool is a Progressive Web App (built with VueJS on the front end and socket.io on the backend). Once you’re on <a href="https://soterialct.z22.web.core.windows.net/">https://soterialct.z22.web.core.windows.net/</a>, you can add the app to your phone’s home screen and it looks and acts like a native mobile app. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The app has two views: Room and Visitor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People responsible for a public space manage a Room. Visitors choose that room and check-in when they enter and check-out when they leave. Rooms and Visitors store each of these decisions (to enter a Room or to be allowed to enter a Room) in local storage (IndexedDB) on their phone. Visitors send check-in socket messages to the server, and the server forwards those messages to the Room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a person sends a COVID exposure alert to all the Rooms stored on their phone, the Rooms can pick up the message from the server, list all the Visitors who occupied the room at the same time in the past two weeks, and can send alerts to the server that forwards them on to each of the other Visitors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the simplest scenario, Rooms don’t have to do anything (the alert protocol can be fully automated), and all a Visitor has to do is click a button on the app to log Rooms and another button if they go into quarantine. No QR codes. No room staff overhead. No cost of service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If that’s still too complicated for people, I’m going into another line of work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Below is a short demo video that shows how the process works:&nbsp;</p>

					 <p>To summarize the evolution of my work:&nbsp;<br><br></p>  The Secours app started as a full-blown application based on Trinsic.&nbsp;  I separated out the simplest capabilities of that original design to focus on local contact tracing using Aries messaging.&nbsp;  I stopped using Aries messaging and refactored LCT with Socket.io (this is the base Service Level Agreement, SLA-0), and I assigned that development to Soteria.&nbsp;  I refactored the Trinsic capabilities into two additional Secours SLAs:  SLA-1 adds personal credentialing and additional risk management tools.  SLA-2 adds COVID test credentials and rich Verifiable Presentations.&nbsp;    I plan to augment Socket.io with more powerful assets like Redis, so I can develop artificial intelligence asserts that will transform my Soteria/Secours-based digital twins into intelligent and helpful digital partners.&nbsp;   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How has Trinsic helped you along in the process?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic was mission-critical for three reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, making something simple that’s complicated is difficult. Trinsic has met that challenge. Back in the Spring, I was able to get up and running in a few minutes. Trinsic assets are generally well-documented now, and development tools are even simpler than a few months ago. This meant I was able to build my verifiable credential exchange&nbsp;(VCX) prototype in record time. And while I was disappointed that the world wasn’t quite ready for all these new capabilities, it was a forcing function that changed my marketing strategy from push (see how cool this tech is, don’t you want some?) to pull (see how easy it is to do&nbsp;something you couldn’t do before?).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And because I built so much in so little time, I was able to set these powerful Trinsic solutions aside and spent one more month getting a simple and stable web socket messaging platform ready for our fist offering: local contact tracing. Having all the rest of the heavy iron waiting in the back room means I can respond immediately to early adopters who quickly needed more power than messaging provides. At each stage of the VCX adoption process, we stay as simple as possible and no simpler. We give our users all the power they need now and no more (until they need it).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, local contact tracing goes global only if thousands of people like me can get their hands on technology that is simple and easy to implement and extend. Trinsic was built on the lowest barrier to entry. All our Trinsic API code is in a public GitHub repo, and we will provide later local contact tracing adopters with training material that will ensure many other communities around the world can stay safe from the virus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I realized something else during this early development phase: As cool as connectionless credentials are, they are not the most important part of the Trinsic platform. Credentials keep your data safe. Verifiable presentations make your data valuable. Trinsic’s implementation of verification policies took all the mystery out of this critical step in VCX; so, again, our users can tell us what they need for verification, and we can respond on the spot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next time you ask me this question, I may have a third&nbsp;reason to love Trinsic: I suspect verification policies will enable me to implement decentralized semantics with relative ease.&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What stage of development are you in? How big do you see your solution getting, and how do you see it scaling?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>I am nearly ready to take the tool back to the UK and see if it is simple enough to be effective. If the app passes acceptance testing, I will recommend a British colleague to fork the GitHub repos (<a href="https://github.com/mcorning/prototyping.git">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mcorning/socket.io.server.git">server</a>), setup the necessary server assets (static Web App, Ubuntu VM), and take it from there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, I will make it available to my friends and family here in Sisters. And if that works, I will recruit others in Oregon to replicate our success in Sisters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once my users build muscle memory on Service Level 0, I will continue field testing at SLA-1 and SLA-2. Someday, soon—I hope—I will have the resources to focus on SLA-3: a personal artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If I do my job and our local approach scales effortlessly, then I expect there will be 7 million localities each serving 1,000 users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Munich / Leipzig – September 1st, 2020, IDnow, a leading provider of Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions and Wirecard Communication Services GmbH announce the signing of an agreement for the acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services by IDnow. IDnow will retain the Leipzig location preserving the majority of the 150 employees.</p>
<p>With Wirecard Communication Services, IDnow will focus on providing identity services and continue to build additional capacity for the strong growth of IDnow identification processes. In light of organic growth in digital services as well as the added needs related to restrictons imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, IDnow is experiencing a sharp increase in demand for its digital verification procedures. The acquisition is intended to enhance the service quality of IDnow products and thus further increase the responsiveness for customers and cut waiting times.</p>
<p>Wirecard Communication Services GmbH was established on April 29, 2003, and is part of the Wirecard Group. In a structured investor process, Wirecard Communication Services GmbH was offered for sale by way of an asset deal. IDnow and Wirecard Communication Services have already been working together successfully for more than five years.</p>
<p>At a staff meeting on Monday afternoon, the insolvency administrator, attorney Dr. Nils Freudenberg from Tiefenbacher Insolvency Administration, announced the takeover to the staff of Wirecard Communications Services. The first step will be to provide the employees with appropriate qualifications and to adapt the technical infrastructure. Following this realignment, the Leipzig location will be expanded in a targeted way and integrated into the IDnow processes in order to enable even faster implementation of projects as well as further technical development of the Ident services.</p>
<p>“With the integration of Wirecard Communication Services into the IDnow Group, we are seizing the opportunity to further improve our range and service quality for our customers. We have worked in close collaboration with this division of the company for several years and greatly appreciate the qualifications and experience of its employees. We are on a strong growth path and will maintain and further develop the Leipzig location,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to have found in IDnow a buyer who appreciates and knows our company and has such a friendly culture. Personally, I am very pleased to stay on board and work in the team at IDnow,” says Amra Blume, Managing Director Wirecard Communications Services.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

  <p>Even before COVID-19 entered our lexicon, <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/endpoint-security">privileged access management (PAM)</a> was widely recognized as a foundational <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/cyber-security">cybersecurity technology</a>. In recent years, almost every cyberattack has involved compromised or misused privileges/privileged credentials. Most malware needs privileges to execute and install payload. Once a threat actor has infiltrated an IT network, privileges are typically needed to access resources or compromise additional identities. With privileged credentials and access obtained, a threat actor or piece of malware essentially becomes a malicious “insider”. Outside of PAM, there are few defenses against a rogue insider.</p>
<p>In 2020, the largescale shift to working from home (WFH) imposed by the coronavirus has increased the urgency for maturation of PAM security capabilities. The subsequent increase in BYOD and shadow IT, compound by significantly more reliance on insecure WiFi networks and remote access pathways, has exacerbated many of the thorniest privileged access challenges. It’s also a proven recipe for breaches.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this blog, I will cover the 10 phases, or use cases, of PAM that comprise a complete, holistic privileged access management program. At BeyondTrust, we refer to this as the <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/solutions/universal-privilege-management">Universal Privilege Management model</a>. This approach entails securing every privileged user (human or machine), session, and asset across your IT environment—leaving no privilege undiscovered, unmanaged, or unaudited. The 10 phases can be implemented via the three solutions that comprise a complete PAM platform—privileged password management, endpoint privilege management, and secure remote access.</p>
<p>While organizations most frequently begin with <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/privileged-password-management">securing privileged credentials</a> (privileged password management), you can start anywhere, so long as your PAM platform is flexible. With each PAM layer implemented, your organization eliminates and mitigates additional <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/new-privileged-attack-vectors-book-q-a-with-author-morey-haber">privileged attack vectors</a>, while realizing new security and operational synergies.</p>
 1. Secure &amp; Audit Privileged Account Credentials 
<p>Gaining control and accountability over privileged accounts—both human and machine—is often the first step organizations take on their PAM journey. <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/password-management">Privileged password management solutions</a> can automate the discovery, onboarding, management, and monitoring of the ever-expanding types of human and machine privileged accounts/credential types (privileged user passwords, application passwords, DevOps secrets, SSH keys, certificates, etc.), and bring those accounts/credentials under management within a centralized password safe. This is an important step for preventing or mitigating password re-use attacks and other backdoors (orphaned accounts, etc.) into the IT environment.</p>
 2. Enforce Least Privilege on Desktops (Windows and MacOS) 
<p><a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/what-is-least-privilege">Enforcing least privilege</a> on desktop devices is one of the most powerful ways to reduce <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/endpoint-security">endpoint security risk</a> across the enterprise. <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/privilege-management/active-directory-bridge">Endpoint privilege management solutions</a> can remove local administrative rights and default every user as a standard user. Rather than being enabled, persistent, and always-on, the privileges are only elevated on an as-needed basis and only for the targeted application or process. Limiting both the amount and duration of access condenses both the attack surface and threat window for malicious applications and activity that can abuse privileges.</p>
 3. Apply Least Privilege Across Your Server Environment (Windows, Unix, Linux) 
<p>IT admins often require elevated rights to perform their jobs. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, high levels of privilege can be abused to inflict considerable damage to an IT environment and exfiltrate data. While sudo can help organizations “get by” in simple environments, it’s not an enterprise-class tool. Sudo suffers from significant security and administration drawbacks. Enterprise-class PAM solutions can enable organizations to efficiently and effectively delegate server privileges without disclosing the passwords for root, local, Active Directory domain, or bridged administrative accounts. Least-privileged, <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/just-in-time-privileged-access-management-jit-pam-the-missing-piece-to-achieving-true-least-privilege-maximum-risk-reduction">just-in-time access</a> should always be enforced, and every privileged session should be closely audited and monitored.</p>
 4. Implement Application Reputation 
<p>PAM solutions should be able to enforce a number of application reputation strategies as part of endpoint privilege management. Some of these include:</p>
 
 Application control capabilities, including allow listing,&nbsp; block listing, and reputation-based listing to restrict applications to only those approved to execute, with the correct privileges, within the appropriate context 
 Applying real-time risk intelligence to inform privilege delegation and elevation decisions 
 Command filtering (on Unix and Linux systems) and PowerShell script management (on Windows systems) 
 <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/how-trusted-application-protection-builds-on-application-control-endpoint-privilege-management">Trusted application protection</a> to add context to the IT process tree to prevent fileless attacks and attacks leveraging trusted applications to perform malicious activities 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Control Remote Access 
<p>Rarely does a cyber attacker operate directly on a resource (such as a stolen laptop). Most attacks start externally via a remote access connection. Typically, these threats initially compromise a remote vendor or employee, then piggyback into an organization’s network. VPNs and other widely used remote access tools lack connection isolation, granular privilege and access controls, and application-based audit capabilities. With the recent, largescale shift to remote work, tools like VPNs and RDP are being stretched way beyond their legitimate use cases, contributing to a surge in targeted attacks and breaches. PAM platforms with <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/solutions#secure-remote-access">privileged remote access capabilities</a> can enforce least-privilege access and session auditing for remote access sessions—for both vendors and employees better than traditional VPN solutions alone.</p>
 6. Extend PAM Best Practices to Network Devices and IoT/IIoT 
<p>Some non-traditional endpoints and edge devices, like IoT, have minimal computing power, which means they may not be candidates for traditional <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/endpoint-security">endpoint security tools</a>, like AV. Additionally, IoT and network devices may have embedded or easy-to-guess credentials, among other design flaws. That’s why it’s critical to extend credential management, least privilege, and other PAM controls to these devices and keep them properly segmented across your environment.</p>
 7. Extend PAM Best Practices to the Cloud and Virtualized Environments 
<p>In addition to suffering from many of the same privileged access weaknesses as on-premise environments, the cloud presents unique use cases, such as hypervisors, cloud management consoles, and APIs. In the cloud, ephemeral privileged accounts and credentials are rapidly instantiated and disposed of when new cloud and virtual instances are spun up and, just as easily, spun down. When managing any privileged account, discovery is the critical first step to gaining control over these assets and the many planes of privileges across cloud environments. Once cloud and virtualized instances and their assets are found, they must be managed to limit exposure, and all session access should be monitored and audited. Simply put, PAM has a substantive role to play when it comes to both <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/cloud-security-best-practices">cloud security</a> and <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/api-security-privileged-access-management">API security</a>, regardless of the access and implementation of privileged accounts.</p>
 8. Extend PAM to DevOps and DevSecOps 
<p>DevOps seems to magnify many of the worst PAM challenges due to the heavy emphasis on automation and speed. Common DevOps risks include:</p>
 
 Insecure code and <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/hardcoded-and-embedded-credentials-are-an-it-security-hazard-heres-what-you-need-to-know">hardcoded passwords</a> 
 Scripts or vulnerabilities in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools, that could deploy malware or sabotage code 
 Over-provisioning of privileges 
 Sharing of <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/secrets-management">DevOps secrets</a> 
 
<p>While DevOps presents some special use cases, PAM’s role in <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/devops-security-best-practices">DevOps security</a> is comparable to any other environment—managing privileged accounts/credentials (including for CI/for CI/CD tools, service accounts, etc.), enforcing least privilege, etc. It also essential that the PAM solution does not disrupt or delay workflows, but rather enables peak DevOps agility. Securing the accounts, keys, and certificates required for automation is a fundamental part of extending PAM into your development and automation practices.</p>
 9. Integrate PAM and Identity Access Management 
<p><a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/what-is-identity-and-access-management-and-why-is-it-a-vital-it-security-layer">Identity and access management (IAM) solutions</a> help IT teams answer, “Who has access to what?” PAM solutions answer the questions of “Is that access appropriate?” and “Is that access being used appropriately?” Complete visibility and accountability over identities requires bi-directional integration of privilege management and IAM solutions. Some PAM solutions also include <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/privilege-management/active-directory-bridge">AD Bridging capabilities</a>, which help further centralize identity management and authentication by providing single sign on across Windows, Unix, Linux, and macOS environments using the same account for simplified access, monitoring, and reporting.</p>
 10. Integrate PAM with Other IT Tools 
<p>PAM + IAM integration is imperative, but your privileged access security workflows and data should also integrate with the rest of your IT and security ecosystem. Gaps in this ecosystem translate into security vulnerabilities and lost productivity. The better your PAM platform integrates (such as with SIEM, ITSM, etc.), the more effective your ability to orchestrate pinpoint responses to problems—or opportunities.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, any security technology that solves a problem, but that does not integrate into the rest of your ecosystem, is a point solution with a finite lifespan. It could be argued that siloed solutions are also a waste of money and resources. Therefore, make sure your PAM investment works with, and integrates with, your overall IT and security ecosystem to best serve your environment.</p>

<p>Last month<a href="https://authenteq.com/short-sweet-and-fully-automated-july-product-update/"> </a>at Authenteq: besides striving to be trustworthy and secure we also strive to be fully automated. As automation is the key to the success last month our product updated focused on automated flagging – since last month instead of your compliance team having to flag suspicious users, our technology does that for you. What is more, you can take a glimpse at the verification data with our dashboard quick-view and not waste your precious time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This month our product update is one of the biggest product releases we ever had! Here’s what’s new:</p>



 Let your customers pick up where they left 



<p>At Authenteq we know that the conversion rate is the key metric that you use to calculate your business success and that even small friction can have a high impact on your user satisfaction. To make sure that your customers are always pleased with the onboarding process we’ve added a feature that allows your customer to exit the flow at any point or move the app to the background and not cancel the onboarding flow. This will allow your users to pick up where they left the flow and will provide for a truly frictionless mobile onboarding experience.</p>



 Enhanced security – always&nbsp; 



<p>Our customer dashboard has never been as secure. Now you can facilitate data collection in three different ways and never have to touch the images of the identification documents again. Here are the ways you can facilitate the data collection: mobile SDK, mobile end-point, or a webhook. Read more about it on our API documentation. <br><br>What is more, our team added a small but no less important <a href="https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) for additional security to the customer dashboard. You can enable it by going to the settings section of your company dashboard. Interesting in learning more about how to protect your data and increase your business security?&nbsp; Check out <a href="https://authenteq.com/anti-spoofing-tips-and-tools-to-keep-you-and-your-company-safe-and-secure/">our latest blog</a> on anti-spoofing where we share useful tips.</p>



 Features that will help you onboard customers with international documents 



<p>As part of our continued efforts to provide document support worldwide, we’ve introduced some API changes that will benefit your user onboarding process. We know that personal identification document formats differ across the globe, for example, those with the US or Australian drivers licenses or passports that are being issued by certain Asian countries might have difficulty with verifying their identity.</p>



<p>The main issue was that these documents do not distinguish between the surname and given names field. In order to solve this issue, Authenteq will now pass you the entire field as SurnameandGivenNames. By introducing this change we empower you to cater to a truly secure, frictionless experience to your users.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Want to unleash the power of frictionless verification. Fetch your API keys by starting a <a href="https://customer-dashboard.app.authenteq.com/registration/">30-day-trial</a> with us, or <a href="https://cal.services/multi/Authenteq-Demo/-1jva2cQw">have a chat</a> with one of our identity verification and KYC experts. </p>

 Taming the Beast — Refactoring to Empower&nbsp;Teams <p>One day I stumbled onto a ticket from the website team that was open for several days. The ticket was for a simple change, to enable file compression.</p><p>The comments went back and forth. First we would try something, then we would ask someone else to test. Then they would come back and say it didn’t work. This repeated 3 or 4 times until everyone gave&nbsp;up.</p><p>I was confused, the request seemed easy to do. I decided to investigate, and that’s when I found The&nbsp;Beast.</p> Unraveling The&nbsp;Beast <p>To understand The Beast, you need to understand what would happen at the time when you opened onfido.com on your&nbsp;phone.</p><p>A request would first go to Kubernetes, then an nginx server, then a Cloudfront distribution, and finally to an S3&nbsp;bucket!</p>Here was the&nbsp;beast<p>Each step on this chain had a different owner, was in a different project, and had a different release process. Each team had to verify that changes to the website didn’t break their main service. It took time to make&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Not only that, it was also slow. US users had to wait twice as long as European users to see the&nbsp;page.</p> How did it get to&nbsp;this <p>To understand how we got to this beast, we need to go back to when it was just a tiny&nbsp;puppy.</p><p>Many years ago, the website was done in Rails, and its code was part of our platform. And all of this was behind an Nginx instance.</p>Life was simple for the young&nbsp;puppy<p>The developers managed the website, the Rails app handled routing, the Nginx proxy handled requests and caching, and the user saw a&nbsp;website.</p><p>Eventually one Rails app became many Rails apps. Nginx started serving the static assets from a folder. The puppy’s fur grew and nobody was there to trim&nbsp;it.</p><p>A couple more years and the website became separate, so the marketing team could own it. But because all the paths were intrinsically linked, it continued to be served by&nbsp;Nginx.</p><p>A bit more time and Kubernetes was added to the mix, and all of this was moved inside&nbsp;it.</p><p>The puppy’s fur grew and grew, and nobody gave it a trim. The puppy grew to become The&nbsp;Beast.</p> Taming The&nbsp;Beast <p>So how do you go towards taming The&nbsp;Beast?</p><p>We had to understand how that devilish Nginx configuration came to be. We had to understand what we had to keep, what we could rearrange and what we could throw away. We wanted to understand what the user workflows were.</p><p>So we talked with teams to see what they knew about this beast and evaluated the access logs for the website. With that precious information in mind, we were able to propose a new architecture that removed the website out of the way of other&nbsp;teams.</p><p>In this new architecture, we start with a Cloudfront distribution, this distribution has one single goal, to see what goes towards the website and what goes towards Kubernetes.</p>Proposed taming of The&nbsp;Beast<p>With this new architecture designed and the approval of all the teams, we prepared our new test environment. We made it match the behaviour of the real website as much as possible.</p><p>With a few days of trials, we got confidence that we could proceed. We did a dark launch of production only in our office network. Teams did their final end-to-end tests. Minor hiccups were fixed and we got ready for the big&nbsp;switch.</p> Launch Day <p>It was early morning, the release scheduled to happen in just a few hours. There was some tension. This could have a large impact, both on our image as well as for our&nbsp;clients.</p><p>All internal stakeholders were gathered, rollout procedures were ready and rollback procedures were prepared in case of a disaster. Eyes all on the various graphs and monitors. The pull request had one single change, onfido.com stopped pointing to the Load Balancer and would instead point to CloudFront.</p><p>The commit was merged, the CI ran and the changes were&nbsp;applied.</p><p>We waited.</p><p>No alarms were sounded. All services were normal. The website looked exactly the same. Nobody had noticed the&nbsp;change.</p><p>Exactly as intended.</p> Results <p>So, visually it looked the same. What&nbsp;changed?</p><p>First, we finally could fix that ticket from the start. And not having to go all the way to Europe on every request made the average page loads in the United States go from 5.59 seconds to 2.01&nbsp;seconds.</p>Page load times from the weeks before and after the switch, even depending on the internet connection of the person the load times fell by over a second worldwide<p>But even if all of these metrics continued the same, the changes would have been worth it. They enabled our website team to act independently.</p><p>With the smaller and self-contained code base, the team was able to own it. They went from opening tickets to change something to opening pull requests themselves. The devops team has less load and the website team can change things fearlessly.</p> Key Takeaways <p>When faced with a large scary beast, the first instinct is to run! But that beast will not go away! It will terrify everyone who passes by and any change will take an eternity to&nbsp;do.</p><p>The proper action is to be fearless and tame the beast! When it is no more than a harmless puppy, teams will be more confident to make changes and will act&nbsp;quicker.</p><p>It’s a win-win for everyone, and all it needs is that initial push for&nbsp;change!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/taming-the-beast-refactoring-to-empower-teams-8957a7df969b">Taming The Beast — Refactoring to empower teams</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Privileged accounts have traditionally been given to administrators to access critical data and applications.

Erik Westra, Technical Architect<p>We have a fun one for you—the inaugural interview of our new Meet the Team series of employee profiles.</p><p>Meet the Team is an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>As a remote company with employees around the world—from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand—it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little better (especially with current travel restrictions).</p><p>Today, we’re introducing Erik Westra, technical architect at GlobaliD, head of GlobaliD Labs, and avid&nbsp;cyclist.</p><p>Not only is Erik working on a ton of super cool projects here at GlobaliD, he also has a unique perspective given his decades-long relationship with our co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd, which, as you’d expect, involves plenty of crazy adventures.</p><p>During our chat, Erik covered a range of&nbsp;topics:</p>  How GlobaliD Labs came to&nbsp;be  Some of the cool projects Labs is working on right&nbsp;now  How Erik met Greg back in the ’80s (spoiler alert: payments data, an insane bike ride, and hypothermia)  Their first company together (which went public on the NASDAQ and had over 6000 employees)  How a young Jack Dorsey hacked into their&nbsp;systems  The time Erik saved both their lives (and the essence of their relationship)  Standing up for their values and being sued for $13&nbsp;trillion  Coming full circle and the birth of GlobaliD (and&nbsp;Groups!)   1. Who are you and what do you do at GlobaliD? <p>My name’s Erik! I’m head of GlobaliD Labs, which is responsible for the experimental aspects of what we’re trying to build. My job involves designing systems, writing proof of concepts, and managing the Labs team. We’re always trying to push the envelope.</p><p>GlobaliD Labs exists because the current way we build our system has to be relatively structured to ensure quality code and security — everything needs to work and run smoothly. Like other startups, we employ agile frameworks for development, but we need to balance that with long term planning.</p><p>That has huge benefits for the quality of our core product, but sometimes this structured approach can crowd out more experimental ideas.</p><p>I like to call myself the unofficial champion of GlobaliD Groups. It’s a feature that’s been central to our long term vision from day one, but for one reason or another, we weren’t able to get it into a production environment. Something else always required higher priority when it came to the core business.</p><blockquote>“I like to call myself the unofficial champion of GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups.”</blockquote><p>Even though Groups had a long term upside for us — especially when it came to our vision and our mission — we never had time to develop&nbsp;it.</p><p>That’s when we decided to spin it off and create GlobaliD Labs, which helps bring balance between our short term development needs with our long term aspirations. Now, we have a separate team dedicated to Groups that’s also exploring other cool&nbsp;ideas.</p> 2. What kind of cool&nbsp;ideas? <p>We believe that Groups should be able to issue credentials to people. You might get a license to ride a particular mountain bike trail — one of Greg’s favorite things, being a mountain biker. You might get a ticket to a Zoom concert. Or you might get a credential for receiving a&nbsp;vaccine.</p><p>It’s an open platform so people can come up with their own ideas on how to use it. You could even set up a group and run your business through it — connecting directly with employees and customers, matching up seekers and providers of goods and services, managing bookings, sending and receiving payments, and of course marketing and promotions — all done through the GlobaliD platform.</p><blockquote>“It’s an open platform so people can come up with their own ideas on how to use it. You could even set up a group and run your business through it — all done through the GlobaliD platform.”</blockquote><p>Another project we’ve been investing time into is email — what I call the email anonymizer, an idea I find quite&nbsp;cool.</p><p>One of the problems today is that whenever you sign up for anything online, you need to provide your email. Do this enough times and your inbox is now full of spam. You’ve essentially lost control of your email address. With the email anonymizer, you can set up a one-time address. That way, you never reveal your private email. You stay in control of your&nbsp;email.</p><p>Let’s say you want to sign up for Amazon and they ask for your email. Now, you can create an anonymous address just for Amazon. If you choose to receive those messages, emails sent by Amazon will go to your private address. If you decide that you don’t want to deal with Amazon anymore, you can simply disable the address. Privacy is a fundamental tenet of our company, and this is another way of keeping your identity&nbsp;private.</p><p>It’s little things like this that I find quite cool. If both sides are using the anonymizer, you can actually have both parties communicate back and forth without either party knowing the other’s real&nbsp;address.</p><p>That’s just one of the things we’re working on right now. At Labs, we go in a lot of odd directions; there’s a lot of exploration. For every idea that does work out, there will be plenty that fall flat. Maybe they don’t work technically or there’s no business need for it. We’ll learn from those lessons. We’re the mad scientists at GlobaliD.</p><blockquote>“At Labs, we go in a lot of odd directions; there’s a lot of exploration. For every idea that does work out, there will be plenty that fall flat. Maybe they don’t work technically or there’s no business need for it. We’ll learn from those lessons. We’re the mad scientists at GlobaliD.”</blockquote> 3. How did you end up in this&nbsp;role? <p>I met Greg [GlobaliD co-founder and CEO] around 1980 when I was still a young man — a very, very long time ago. I was studying computer science and psychology at university in New Zealand. I was really into human-computer interaction.</p><p>Greg came to New Zealand to restructure the banking industry. I was taking a part-time course in the evenings at the polytechnic at the time and word came around that people were looking for students to help with data analysis as a part-time job. I put my hand&nbsp;up.</p><p>It was a company called Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton — where Greg was working at the time. They were management consultants working with Data Bank of New Zealand, a centralized check processing company, to help make their operations more efficient. My job was to analyze data using Excel macros, and the results would be displayed in various charts. Excel charts didn’t look professional enough for the presentations they wanted, so we had to draw them by hand in&nbsp;MacDraw.</p><p>One day, I was at my desk, busily drawing one of these charts when Greg walks by and notices my bike pump sticking out of my&nbsp;bag.</p><p>“Oh, you ride a bike?” he asked. It was more of a statement, really. “We’ll go for a ride this weekend. I’ll pick you&nbsp;up.”</p><p>“Okay, cool!”</p><p>Or so I thought. I figured it would probably be a three or four hour ride. After all, all we had were our road bikes — real, old-school technology. No&nbsp;problem.</p><p>But then Greg got this idea. “Oh, look. There’s this route — it goes over this hill and goes all the way out to the coast. This looks pretty cool. We’ll go that&nbsp;way.”</p><p>And so off we&nbsp;go.</p><p>That hill ended up being a rather large mountain — mostly rock with severe slopes. You can imagine us going up and down, up and down on these narrow-tired road bikes with our big clunky shoes with cleats on the bottom. I suffered something like six flats going over that mountain&nbsp;range.</p><p>Oh yeah, it was mid&nbsp;winter.</p><p>By the time we got to the other side of the coastline, it was dusk, and we still had another 70 kilometers to ride back to the car — the only silver lining being that it was on the road&nbsp;again.</p><p>But it was dark, and I was getting really cold. At one point, I became hypothermic and I had to lie in a ditch by the side of the road while Greg rode back himself to get the&nbsp;car.</p><p>In all, it was a 13-hour bike ride. It was absolutely insane.</p><p>That’s how we met each other for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>We’ve been doing crazy things together ever&nbsp;since.</p><blockquote>“At one point, I became hypothermic and I had to lie in a ditch by the side of the road while Greg rode back himself to get the car. In all, it was a 13-hour bike ride. It was absolutely insane. That’s how we met each other for the first time. We’ve been doing crazy things together ever&nbsp;since.”</blockquote> 4. On the beginning of a lifelong partnership <p>Around 1986, Greg called me. “Hey, can you come meet me? I want you to see something.”</p><p>I met him at this really old, dingy building in downtown Wellington, New Zealand. People are running in and out with their bicycles. What are these guys doing, I’m wondering to&nbsp;myself.</p><p>Apparently, it was an urgent messenger delivery company. The guys running around with bikes were delivering parcels.</p><p>“Come look at this,” Greg said. We went up the stairs. “Open this door — that’s where we’re going. But be careful. If the wind blows, we’re in real trouble.”</p><p>We sneak in and shut the door behind us. On two wooden supports is this door covered with hundreds of bits of&nbsp;paper.</p><p>That’s how they kept track of all the&nbsp;parcels.</p><p>Their service could guarantee delivery within 15 minutes from the time of your call — super efficient. For a while, we just stood there and watched it&nbsp;work.</p><p>Then Greg looked over at me. “Can you build a computer program that does&nbsp;that?”</p><p>That was our first business together. It took us about eight years to build it. But it was very successful. Eventually, it made it to the U.S., and we actually wound up being listed on the NASDAQ. We had about 6,000 employees at one stage. The company was called DMS corporation — Dispatch Management Services.</p><blockquote>“That was our first business together.

We had about 6,000 employees at one stage. The company was called DMS corporation — Dispatch Management Services.”</blockquote><p>We were really lucky. It was our first try at building something together and it succeeded.</p> 5. On Jack Dorsey hacking into their&nbsp;system <p>We ultimately left DMS and explored various other ventures together. I want to tell you about one because it’s kind of interesting.</p><p>We were building a system for last-mile ecommerce delivery. You could order online, and someone would pick it up from the depot and bring it to you within an hour. We needed an admin interface that had to be access-controlled. “Let’s do something quick! Just hardwire it into the code,” Greg said — which was typical for him at the time. Everything was about speed and minimum viable products. So that’s what we&nbsp;did.</p><p>Of course, someone broke in and sent Greg a message: “Your security&nbsp;sucks.”</p><p>That someone was Jack&nbsp;Dorsey.</p><blockquote>“Of course, someone broke [into our system] and sent Greg a message: ‘Your security sucks.’ That someone was Jack&nbsp;Dorsey.”</blockquote><p>Greg decided to hire him and we worked together for a while before he went off and founded&nbsp;Twitter.</p><p>It was my fault that Jack broke in. In my defense, it’s what Greg told me to do. We’ve taken our security a bit more seriously since then&nbsp;:)</p> 6. I certainly hope so! What’s it like working with&nbsp;Greg? <p>That’s been the essence of our relationship.</p><p>Greg lived in New Zealand for about six years — if I remember correctly.</p><p>“We should go for a hike in the mountains,” he said one&nbsp;day.</p><p>So off we&nbsp;went.</p><p>Along the way, we reached the Broken Axe Pinnacles. The name speaks for itself — it’s pretty insane, this narrow little ledge with maybe a thousand-foot drop on either side plus strong winds. We were creeping along this sliver of a ledge when suddenly it started sloping downhill, steeper and&nbsp;steeper.</p><p>“Come on, we gotta get down there!” Greg&nbsp;said.</p><p>“Hang on a minute, Greg. Let’s just wait and&nbsp;check.”</p><p>We stopped for a moment to check the compass and the map. Sure enough, that path dropped off into a cliff. Had we kept going, we wouldn’t have been able to get back up. We could have died up&nbsp;there.</p><blockquote>“We stopped for a moment to check the compass and the map. Sure enough, that path dropped off into a cliff. Had we kept going, we wouldn’t have been able to get back up. We could have died up&nbsp;there.”</blockquote><p>That’s one way to view our working relationship — we’ve been working as a team for many years. There’s always a lot of back and forth. Greg would come up with all these mad ideas, and I’d figure out how to make them&nbsp;work.</p><p>It’s been like that ever since we&nbsp;met.</p> 7. Public information should be&nbsp;free <p>We’ve had a number of crazy adventures together. Another one of the companies we worked on, 3Taps, was sued by Craigslist for the nice sum of $13 trillion — an insane, arbitrary number.</p><p>[3Taps was an exchange company dedicated to keeping public facts publicly accessible — which included Craigslist listings.]</p><p>Greg was steadfast — he believed that public information should be free. If the information is freely available, it should be available to everybody. You can’t make it available to some people and not to&nbsp;others.</p><blockquote>“Greg was steadfast — he believed that public information should be free. If the information is freely available, it should be available to everybody. You can’t make it available to some people and not to&nbsp;others.”</blockquote><p>[Greg was an executive producer of and contributor to the Aaron Schwartz documentary — <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3268458/">The Internet’s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron&nbsp;Swartz</a>.]</p><p>He fought the case, which went on for several years. It got pretty ugly and I wondered if we’d lose everything. Eventually, they reached a settlement, which Greg saw as a victory. He agreed to pay out $1 million — except to the charity of his choice, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>After that saga, we were in a little bit of a&nbsp;lull.</p><p>Then out of the blue, Greg invited me to join him in Ljubljana, Slovenia. You can guess where this is&nbsp;going.</p> 8. “The early days of GlobaliD” <p>This was the early days of GlobaliD — the company had only been up and running for a couple of&nbsp;months.</p><p>We were there for two weeks, discussing the possibilities of a self-sovereign identity platform complemented with messaging and a&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>We came up with this notion of Groups. Having your digital identity is great. Here’s my phone, my wallet — my identity. I’m an individual. I can do what I need to do. But it’s when you have collections of people working together — there’s an emergent quality that’s greater than the sum of our&nbsp;parts.</p><blockquote>“We came up with this notion of Groups.

But it’s when you have collections of people working together — there’s an emergent quality that’s greater than the sum of our&nbsp;parts.”</blockquote><p>That’s where Groups comes into play. It’s this notion that you can do a lot more with people together than with people individually.</p><p>I wrote a bunch of white papers outlining how Groups should work, but it took another three years to get the foundation in place. This is where GlobaliD Labs came&nbsp;in.</p><p>I’m going to paraphrase Greg here, but once you put together the three different pieces, identity, messaging, and money — and now with Groups — magic&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Most people in our company are relatively young. Greg and I — we’re not spring chickens anymore. We’ve worked on a number of projects over the years. With GlobaliD, we just thought, “Let’s do this.” It’s our last big chance to do something amazing.</p><p>This isn’t a job. This is a mission. We are absolutely one thousand percent dedicated to making this&nbsp;succeed.</p><p>You might also&nbsp;like:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-groups-multi-person-chat-and-vouches-6f391ce3ea50">GlobaliD App — Introducing Groups, Vouches, and multi-person chat</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-messaging-is-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default-9c5d5e7d199d">GlobaliD messaging is end-to-end encrypted by&nbsp;default</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-the-wallet-87870843dc1b">GlobaliD App — Introducing the&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-sepa-and-crypto-transfers-to-your-wallet-6147deb5f6cd">GlobaliD App: Introducing SEPA and crypto transfers to your&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <p>Join a growing trusted community and experience how digital identity works for&nbsp;you.</p><a href="http://link.global.id/invite"></a> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team—Erik Westra, head of GlobaliD Labs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   When organizations modernize their Identity and Access Management (IAM), they have three fundamental requirements: an understanding of current capabilities, a migration strategy to transform the IAM infrastructure and finally, the staff with the expertise to execute the plan. The challenges on the way from legacy IAM to a modern IAM infrastructure are manifold and should be considered beforehand.

 The GiD Report#124 — Fortnite’s philosophical crusade for a more open, interoperable future <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-123-balkanization-and-what-that-means-for-the-future-of-the-internet-4fb493177e38">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Epic and all the other huge companies fighting Apple (now a $2 trillion&nbsp;company)  This isn’t Epic’s first rodeo — like the time they took on Valve (and everyone won — including Valve)  Epic’s founder Tim Sweeney has been criticizing tech monopolies for years. Why he believes the future will be less centralized/closed and more distributed/open/interoperable.  Tim Sweeney’s also a fan of blockchain.  Greg on Occulus: “The Oculus move (under the direction of Facebook) towards a single, unified, and somewhat portable identity, bespeaks the future to&nbsp;come.”  This week on TikTok/WeChat (spoiler: this is what Facebook has been lobbying&nbsp;for)  A new era of the Federal&nbsp;Reserve  Race for central bank digital currencies heats&nbsp;up  Stuff happens   1. What’s really remarkable about the moment we’re in is just how suddenly the tides can shift — economically, culturally, and technologically. It speaks to where we are in the cycle. I’m, of course, talking about Apple, and what began as a trickle, the backlash against the App Store now feels like a&nbsp;tsunami. <p>Axios:</p><blockquote>A steady drip of criticism over Apple’s App Store policies has become a torrent, as even other tech giants feel emboldened to pile on — but Apple’s path to satisfying its critics is uncertain.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Apple’s policies aren’t that different from those governing other digital marketplaces, but its size and inflexibility could fuel regulatory action from antitrust authorities in the U.S. and&nbsp;beyond.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: The criticisms of the App Store are many and varied, but most revolve around the 30% cut that Apple takes on sales of apps and other digital goods, with very limited workarounds.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: Microsoft Sunday became the latest company to take aim at Apple, warning in a court filing that a move to restrict Epic Games’ access to developer tools could impact lots of games from other developers that rely on Epic’s Unreal game&nbsp;engine.</blockquote><p>Hey, a new email app from the creators of Basecamp, should get some credit for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch">sparking the latest wave of&nbsp;protest</a>.</p><p>The thing is, we’ve seen that story before — some small fry developer complaining about big ‘ol Apple and their tyrannical policies. But Apple always seemed untouchable. They would ignore the criticism and continue on their merry way, never conceding any&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Moreover, Apple had some fair arguments in their defense. After all, in building the App Store from scratch, Apple created a new paradigm, unleashing immense value to the ecosystem. It made sense that Apple took a cut — they deserved credit for their work. It also made sense that they’d moderate the App Store — in itself a way to create more value in a safe, curated environment.</p><p>And as it created value for the ecosystem, it also created tremendous value for Apple, <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-markets-50f38776-84cb-42f5-bcf9-9bffaa476b2c.html">which just hit a market cap of $2 trillion</a>:</p><p>Apple made Wall Street history when its 2020 stock surge pushed its market value over $2 trillion, a first for a U.S. company, Bloomberg reports.</p><p>“While it took Apple 38 years to reach its first $1 trillion in value, the next trillion only took two&nbsp;years.”</p><p>Apple shares have more than doubled since&nbsp;March.</p><p>Crazy stat: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, account for 23% of the S&amp;P 500’s entire&nbsp;value.</p><p>Saudi Aramco in December became the world’s first company worth $2 trillion, but now trails Apple at $1.8 trillion.</p><p>As Apple has grown, so has the App Store and the nature of our relationship with our apps. Apps do a lot more now. Our expectations for what we want them to do has also grown. You could argue that Apple’s model for how it manages and charges for the App Store hasn’t evolved with the&nbsp;times.</p><p>Instead, most of their decisions seem to leverage their position, expanding power over the ecosystem across more touchpoints, demanding control of essential features and services such as identity and payments.</p><p>So it was only a matter of time before companies got tired of paying these exorbitant companies to the most valuable company on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Because small fries, these are&nbsp;not:</p><blockquote>Epic itself, locked in a battle over the 30% commission, which wants a court to restore Fortnite to the App Store and stop Apple from cutting off its developer access. (Apple defended itself Friday, likening Epic to a shoplifter and insisting Epic’s issues were a crisis of its own&nbsp;making.)</blockquote><blockquote>Automattic, blocked from updating its WordPress app for not letting users buy&nbsp;.com domains through Apple’s in-app purchase system, despite not letting users buy such domains directly in the WordPress app at all. (Apple clarified its position and apologized for any confusion over the weekend.)</blockquote><blockquote>Plus, a group of news publishers asking for better App Store terms; Facebook, which suggests Apple’s terms will hurt small businesses; and Airbnb, which reportedly talked with House antitrust enforcers after Apple asked for a commission on Airbnb’s recently launched online experiences.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Spotify, for instance, says Apple gives itself a competitive edge by keeping all Apple Music subscription revenue while eating into that generated by other streaming services. EU antitrust regulators are now probing the App Store, in part due to Spotify’s complaints.</blockquote><blockquote>Match Group says Apple puts paid services at a disadvantage against ad-funded rivals that don’t have to give Apple a cut of their&nbsp;revenue.</blockquote><p>For what it’s worth, here’s Apple’s take on the situation, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/epic-games-kicks-off-the-civil-war">via Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>During the Congressional hearings over the market power of large technology firms, Apple CEO Tim Cook insisted that Apple had little market power over mobile apps, because developers and consumers could always switch over to different types of phones or platforms on which to create software. Epic’s attempt to restructure terms with Apple is a great test case for Cook’s argument. One would expect, based on Cook’s views, that developers of popular apps have leverage against Apple, if Apple had little market power over app stores. Certainly, Epic’s Fortnite is popular, a massive multi-billion dollar game, as close to a must-have app as possible.</blockquote><p>The problem, of course, is that I don’t want to give up my iPhone, and Apple knows this. Moreover, Google’s Play Store has more or less copied Apple’s model regarding commission and payment&nbsp;options.</p><p>So it’s a sticky situation for developers and users alike. They don’t really have much in the way of options. (Epic has a parallel suit with&nbsp;Google):</p><blockquote>Yes, but: Apple’s rules are slightly stricter, but not all that different from those on other digital marketplaces, including those run by Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</blockquote><p>The primary difference between iOS and Android, however, is that Epic is still able to provide their app directly to its users, bypassing the Play&nbsp;Store.</p><p>Still, this will likely be one for the regulators:</p><blockquote>The bottom line: Expect these arguments to come from more companies in more settings, with courts and regulators likely having to decide if there’s an antitrust problem at&nbsp;play.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/21258214.130991/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9lZjU1OWI3ZTEyMjhiNjViNzM0YTRmNWFiNzg3NzU5ZT91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2FtJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcBe05717eb">Apple reaches $2 trillion market value as tech fortunes&nbsp;soar</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-china-loopholes-are-starting-to-close">Apple’s China Loopholes Are Starting to&nbsp;Close</a>  <a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/z8sG5UERte1Rmyb1myHo1w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhH5XqP0TgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8wOC8xOS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2JpZy10ZWNoLWJ1c2luZXNzLWRvbWluYXRpb24uaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD00JmVtYz1lZGl0X2RrXzIwMjAwODE5Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTIxNDEwJm5sPWRlYWxib29rJnJlZ2lfaWQ9NjI5NjUzNTUmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0zNjUwMSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9NzZlMDdlNjBiNDkyZTNjOTY4MGUwYzM1OTcwZGM5ZWZXA255dEIKABzqED1f10sDB1ISYWxlY3hsaXVAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAA">Big Tech’s Domination of Business Reaches New&nbsp;Heights</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-political-censorship-poll-6bd4fbaf-43a9-49ac-8e20-48b07f5af38c.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Most Americans think social media platforms censor political viewpoints</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">@FortniteGame</a> 2. We can’t talk about the App Store controversy without talking about Epic Games, which is a super cool story in and of itself. First off, it’s not their first rodeo. They also took on Valve, which owns the Steam gaming platform. <p>For those who aren’t familiar with the gaming space, Steam is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487735/a-year-in-the-epic-games-stores-fight-against-steam-has-made-all-pc-gaming-better.html">essentially the Apple App Store of&nbsp;games</a>:</p><blockquote>Countless challengers had tried and failed to overcome Valve’s primacy. Many carved niches for themselves, like GOG with DRM-free and classic games. But for the biggest PC releases? Why buy elsewhere if you already owned a few dozen (or few hundred) games through Steam? You wouldn’t.</blockquote><p>Did Epic care? Not much so. They went after Valve with the same kind of swagger that they’re swinging around to take on&nbsp;Apple.</p><p>One interesting takeaway — without getting too much into the landscape of gaming — is that many believed that this was actually beneficial to Steam over the last two years. Funny how healthy competition works,&nbsp;huh?</p><blockquote>A year ago, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3326060/epic-games-store-steam-rival-valve.html">I wrote these words</a>: “Epic Games is creating a Steam rival and Valve should be scared.” And for good reason: The Epic Games Store debuted December 6, 2018 and upended the PC gaming market. Valve, once unassailable, suddenly seemed very vulnerable. Flush with Fortnite money, Epic provided the first real competition to Steam since its inception 15 years prior. What company wouldn’t&nbsp;worry?</blockquote><blockquote>If I could amend that headline now though, I’d instead write “Epic Games is creating a Steam rival and Valve should be grateful.”</blockquote><p>We can talk about the results a little bit, though — and you’ll soon see why. Here’s <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/epic-games-kicks-off-the-civil-war">Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>I suspect that a legal approach was not what Epic wanted to do. Epic has experience using the marketplace to address monopoly power; a few years ago, Epic took on Valve, which owned a monopoly game store, Steam, by launching its rival Epic Games Store. And Epic has used Fortnite’s draw to force interoperability among PC, Mac, Xbox One, PS4 and mobile platforms.</blockquote><p>It’s easy to get why this would be huge for users (gamers). Why was it great for Valve? Well, it forced them to up their game — literally. No longer able to rely on their platform dominance, they decided to improve their actual products. And they did exactly that. Steam, despite aggressive competition from Epic, is now better than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Talk about a win-win-win situation. Goliath won, but so did David. And then users reaped the benefits.</p><p>But Epic’s battle with Apple will be fundamentally different in nature simply because of Apple’s complete dominance in their arena. It’s why Epic has taken the legal route — a strategy Greg has discussed and taken&nbsp;himself:</p><blockquote>But because Apple’s monopoly power over the iPhone is so total, Epic chose to use the legal and political system to make an aggressive set of claims that, if accepted by a judge, would essentially destroy Apple’s control over the app ecosystem on the&nbsp;iPhone.</blockquote><p>And according to Matt, Epic has a strong case (as well as a legendary attack&nbsp;dog):</p><blockquote>These claims include the argument that Apple has tied its payments system to its app store, which is a fairly strong legal argument that judges have often (though not always) upheld. It also included an argument that the app store is what is called an ‘essential facility,’ and that Apple as a monopolist in control of such a facility has to share it with competitors or customers on reasonable terms. Judges have generally not upheld this kind of claim. So Epic is not only trying to take its dispute with Apple to the courts, it is also seeking to overturn court precedent, and encourage Congress to write statute overturning judge-made law.</blockquote><blockquote>As its head lawyer, Epic hired antitrust royalty, Christine Varney, who served as the Assistant Antitrust Attorney General under Obama, and before that worked for Netscape during the Microsoft battle in the 1990s. The suit draws heavily from the House Antitrust Subcommittee investigation and hearing, with multiple footnotes citing information unearthed by investigators, as well as a quote from Rep. Hank&nbsp;Johnson.</blockquote><p>Let’s be clear, Epic is certainly on the attack. And as Matt notes, these are indeed peculiar&nbsp;times:</p><blockquote>Typically large businesses reserve their political capital to limit government enforcers or regulators, but something strange started happening a few years ago, and it’s continuing today with this suit. Businesses began battling each other, and some started asking for an expansion of public power to structure markets. This suit is the latest on that score, the escalation of an ideological civil war within the business world, an attempt to undo deep changes in our society implemented forty years&nbsp;ago.</blockquote><p>Hard to take your eyes off this one.

We also can’t talk about Epic without talking about its founder, Tim Sweeney. Because for Tim, this isn’t simply a battle for money — although it clearly is. But Tim is waging a philosophical crusade in order to create a digital world that’s less closed and centralized and more distributed and open and interoperable. (Sound familiar?) <p>Here are some highlights from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/30/game-boss-interview-epics-tim-sweeney-on-blockchain-digital-humans-and-fortnite/">a fantastic VentureBeat interview</a>:</p><blockquote>We talked about his vision for the Metaverse, the virtual world envisioned by Neal Stephenson in his 1997 novel Snow Crash. Sweeney thinks it’s possible to build such a world and the digital economy that goes with it, but he believes it shouldn’t be owned by a single company. He has been outspoken about ensuring openness in gaming in the past couple of&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p>For one, he’s an outspoken critic of tech monopolists (which incidentally, came after a deep chat about blockchain and&nbsp;crypto):</p><blockquote>GamesBeat: It’s a tool to pull power away from centralized authority, which is something you’ve worried about. Platform owners have proprietary technology.</blockquote><blockquote>Sweeney: And they use it to exert arbitrary control. They tilt the market in their favor. They censor people whose political views they disagree with. It’s a big and growing problem, the amount of power possessed by Google and Facebook. President Eisenhower said it about the military-industrial complex. They pose a grave threat to our democracy.</blockquote><p>He talks about games and virtual worlds like we talk about GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups:</p><blockquote>Sweeney: There’s real value in that. If you look at why people are paid to do things, it’s because they’re creating a good or delivering a service that’s valuable to somebody. There’s just as much potential for that in these virtual environments as there is in the real world. If, by playing a game or doing something in a virtual world, you’re making someone else’s life better, then you can be paid for&nbsp;that.</blockquote><blockquote>We need to start rethinking the way we structure these large-scale game economies, especially as they get bigger and more complex. They should not simply be a means for the developer to suck money out of the users. It should be a bi-directional thing where users participate. Some pay, some sell, some buy, and there’s a real&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>If you look at what Valve has done with CS: GO and other games, they have a vibrant economy. Lots of people earn a living in those games. When you buy something, you’re not just buying it from Valve. You’re often buying it on an open marketplace from some other seller. It’s a very complex economy. There’s a lot of potential in that. We need to move toward a model like that in order to scale up to something like the metaverse. As long as it’s just the machination of a single company, there’s not going to be this bidirectional exchange of value. We need to keep that circulating.</blockquote><p>He believes we’re on the cusp of a new chapter for our digital world — one that’s less centralized closed and increasingly distributed and&nbsp;open:</p><blockquote>Sweeney: It’s really popular. That’s not even a closed economy. You’re not actually getting any incremental value for these tips. Imagine if you actually got additional benefits for doing that — recognition or power or something like that. I think that could go much further than it’s gone&nbsp;before.</blockquote><blockquote>These technology revolutions come in waves. The social network could have developed 10 years earlier than it did. You just needed a generation of people that were okay with putting all their personal information into these services. The limiting factor wasn’t technology. It was social expectations.</blockquote><blockquote>Now we’re approaching 10 years of the blockchain. As these technologies become more widely accepted, we’ll see a whole new generation of distributed systems, which really changes the game — away from closed to open. Instead of building a business that extracts money from a service, you build an economy in which everybody can be rewarded for participating in many different ways.</blockquote><p>Tim’s been talking about this stuff for years. He’s been in the industries for decades — started programming BASIC on an IBM PC at the age of&nbsp;11.</p><p>What’s super cool, though, is that he’s putting his money where his mouth is. He’s on the frontlines, battling for a digital world that he truly believes&nbsp;in.</p> 4. BONUS: What Tim Sweeney thinks about blockchain stuff. <p>Let’s just say, he’s a&nbsp;fan:</p><blockquote>Sweeney: There are some incredibly powerful ideas there. I feel like they’ve only begun to be developed. There’s Bitcoin, but the more interesting one is Ethereum, which runs general programs in the blockchain. Instead of mining coins by verifying transactions, miners are running programs specified in the blockchain and computing the results of those. They can be anything from programs to effect a single transaction, exchanging money for a good, or they can be entire distributed autonomous organizations that execute governance rules designed by shareholders and can be extended over time by majority vote. You can implement these arbitrarily complex&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>You come to the realization that the blockchain is really a general mechanism for running programs, storing data, and verifiably carrying out transactions. It’s a superset of everything that exists in computing. We’ll eventually come to look at it as a computer that’s distributed and runs a billion times faster than the computer we have on our desktops, because it’s the combination of everyone’s computer.</blockquote><p>5.

Facebook is merging Oculus identity with Facebook’s.</p><p><a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>:</p><blockquote>The Oculus move (under the direction of Facebook) towards a single, unified, and somewhat portable identity, bespeaks the future to&nbsp;come.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">A Single Way to Log Into Oculus and Unlock Social&nbsp;Features</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21372322/instagram-qr-code-launch-global-nametag">Instagram launches QR codes globally, letting people open a profile from any camera&nbsp;app</a>   6. Some quickies on TikTok and WeChat: Mark Zuckerberg lobbied hard for TikTok ban, and Trump is privately telling businesses they can still use&nbsp;WeChat. <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-stoked-washingtons-fears-about-tiktok-11598223133">WSJ on&nbsp;Mark</a>:</p><blockquote>When Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delivered a speech about freedom of expression in Washington, D.C., last fall, there was also another agenda: to raise the alarm about the threat from Chinese tech companies and, more specifically, the popular video-sharing app&nbsp;TikTok.</blockquote><blockquote>Tucked into the speech was a line pointing to Facebook’s rising rival: Mr. Zuckerberg told Georgetown students that TikTok doesn’t share Facebook’s commitment to freedom of expression, and represents a risk to American values and technological supremacy.</blockquote><blockquote>That was a message Mr. Zuckerberg hammered behind the scenes in meetings with officials and lawmakers during the October trip and a separate visit to Washington weeks earlier, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>In a private dinner at the White House in late October, Mr. Zuckerberg made the case to President Trump that the rise of Chinese internet companies threatens American business, and should be a bigger concern than reining in Facebook, some of the people&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Zuckerberg discussed TikTok specifically in meetings with several senators, according to people familiar with the meetings. In late October, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) — who met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September — and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) wrote a letter to intelligence officials demanding an inquiry into TikTok. The government began a national-security review of the company soon after, and by the spring, Mr. Trump began threatening to ban the app entirely. This month he signed an executive order demanding that TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., divest itself of its U.S. operations.</blockquote><blockquote>Few tech companies have as much to gain as Facebook from TikTok’s travails, and the social-media giant has taken an active role in raising concerns about the popular app and its Chinese&nbsp;owners.</blockquote><p>A touch of irony here given the influence Facebook had in making TikTok a raving success, <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-122-what-will-replace-wechat-and-how-facebook-fueled-tiktoks-rise-ce34d1dc9ef0">as we discussed a couple weeks&nbsp;ago</a>.</p><p>On the WeChat front, there’s now a lawsuit.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-u-s-wechat-ban-is-unconstitutional-11598059765">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, claims the executive order is unconstitutional. It was filed by U.S. WeChat Users Alliance, a nonprofit organization, as well as other plaintiffs including a small business and several individuals.</blockquote><blockquote>The plaintiffs aren’t connected with the popular app or its Chinese-based parent, Tencent Holdings Ltd., representatives said. They said the user alliance was formed by people who depend on WeChat in their business and personal&nbsp;lives.</blockquote><p>(TikTok is also filing a lawsuit.)</p><p>In classic Trump fashion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-21/trump-administration-signals-u-s-firms-can-use-wechat-in-china">the president is playing both&nbsp;sides</a>:</p><blockquote>The Trump administration is privately seeking to reassure U.S. companies including Apple Inc. that they can still do business with the WeChat messaging app in China, according to several people familiar with the matter, two weeks after President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. ban on the Chinese-owned service.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent days, senior administration officials have been reaching out to some companies, realizing that the impact of an all-out ban on the popular app, owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., could be devastating for U.S. technology, retail, gaming, telecommunications and other industries, people familiar with the discussions said.</blockquote><p>Just another day, I&nbsp;guess.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-faces-hate-speech-grilling-by-indian-lawmakers-after-journal-article-11597747734">Facebook Faces Hate-Speech Questioning by Indian Lawmakers After Journal&nbsp;Article</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-ftc-questioned.html">Mark Zuckerberg Questioned Under Oath in F.T.C.

<p>Those that work in the digital privacy space may feel that they aren’t at risk like other companies or individuals. We here at Authenteq are not those people. We know that protecting one’s privacy online extends far beyond just safeguarding the identity of our customers, we take the security of our own digital identities, and our shared systems, seriously. As the saying goes, sometimes you have to eat your own dog food. So, in the spirit of transparency, we thought we’d share how we handle things here to help anyone that may be looking for ways to better protect themselves.</p>



 The Cost of Spoofs 



<p>No one who uses the internet – and really, is there anyone who doesn’t? – is immune to cyberattacks. A simple check on sites like<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"> Pwned</a>&nbsp;can show you all the compromised sites where your email address has been used. Last year, a hacker gained access to CapitalOne’s system affecting 100 million Americans and 6 million Canadians, costing the company upwards of<a href="https://www.virtualarmour.com/the-capital-one-hack-the-latest-in-a-series-of-high-profile-breaches/"> $100 million</a>. Phishing and spoofing attacks have risen steadily every year and according to Agari’s<a href="https://www.agari.com/insights/ebooks/2h-2020-trends-report/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=prnewswire&amp;utm_campaign=h2trendsreport"> H2 2020 Email Fraud &amp; Identity Deception Trends Report</a>, 80 percent of FTSE 100 companies are vulnerable to brand impersonation online. TL; DR anti-spoofing efforts should matter to everyone.</p>



 Email and Phone 



<p>Ensuring that you request some pretty basic information may seem obvious, but there are easy steps to implement to protect your employees and customers that can go a long way.</p>



<p>At Authenteq, we’ve changed fields on our website so that only someone with a professional, or corporate, an email address can schedule a demo. That means no Hotmail, no Gmail, no personal emails at all. It’s a good first step in preventing either bad actors from entering your system as a worst-case scenario, but it’s also a way to prevent low quality leads from taking up time from your workforce by flooding support with questions, booking demos of products they don’t intend to purchase or license, and generally wasting time and resources. If an email address does make its way into your system, flag it as spam and block it immediately.<br></p>



 Regular Training&nbsp; 



<p>Keep your staff up to date by offering regular training around anti-spoofing measures. Just like any facet of life, trends come and go, and so it’s important to know the latest. When new scams emerge, ensure that you have measures in place to protect yourselves. Your employees should also be aware of any new scams in case customers get targeted and turn to their sales or account representative looking for guidance or assurance.</p>



<p>COVID, for example, brought a<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2020/08/03/which-covid-scams-are-hot-now/#46c0369e1577"> new wave of scams</a>, particularly around robocalls, as a flood of new financial assistance funds were released. People were stuck at home, either by their own choice or by their government’s insistence, which meant companies or government agencies suddenly reaching out by phone didn’t feel at all out of place.</p>



<p>Furthermore, your employees themselves need to make sure they are verifying their own emails for suspicious emails, know not to share passwords or private information via email, and to always back up their work. All it takes is one employee that opens a phishing email and your entire operation could be compromised. If an employee gets an email from their CEO that seems off, they should know and feel empowered to be able to question it instead of opening it and clicking suspicious links.</p>



 Two-Factor Authentication 



<p>As companies grow, the security measures that worked for a team of say 10 employees will not work for a team of 100. One thing companies often fail to implement is increased security as this growth happens. Having to go back and adjust things retroactively is much harder than putting in what may feel like an overly vigorous system in place before the need is felt. Two-factor authentication on emails, sites where internal documents are kept like Jira or<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa"> GitHub</a>, or even shared social media sites is a great best practice to set up. At Authenteq, we require employees to set up two-factor authentication for our internal emails, and they must reverify their authentication every time a new device is used or if they’re in a new location.</p>



<p>In addition to 2FA, we use<a href="https://1password.com/"> 1Password</a>, a password manager, for our shared accounts. We also have three different VPNs. All employees’ pay slips are encrypted. And for physical onsite security, the<a href="https://nuki.io/en/"> Nuki</a> smart lock and app is the only way to gain access inside the office, and we keep employee records, confidential documents, and any expensive hardware in a safe.</p>



 Planning 



<p>Having a plan in place to respond to any worst-case scenario is a good idea for some and crucial for others. Even if it’s not on your “need to have”, we can’t think of any situation in which this wouldn’t be a “nice to have.” If a hacker breached your internal IT system, consider what that would mean, what and who would be affected and most at risk, and the people on your team who could respond.</p>



 Liveness Checks&nbsp; 



<p>Integrating a fully automated KYC solution into your onboarding process is the ultimate tactic to prevent spoofers from sneaking in. But identity verification tools with an accompanying liveness check leaves almost no room for them.</p>



<p>Liveness checks can also prevent deepfakes from entering your system, the latest in spoofing threats. Using neural network-powered artificial intelligence and machine learning, images and video footage can be fed into algorithms to create a “mask”, replacing or manipulating the original faces with lookalike data. Deepfakes do pose a threat to identity theft online, but can also be<a href="https://authenteq.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-deepfakes-the-importance-of-kyc/"> prevented</a> with sophisticated KYC tools and liveness checks.</p>

<p>Ontology Launches New Decentralized Identity For the Automotive Industry</p><p>Ontology is focused on building trust in the automotive industry through the development of a blockchain-based decentralized digital identity solution that allows for driving data to be recorded, stored, and verified in a safe and secure way, offering a range of benefits to drivers and the wider automotive industry.</p><p>How does it work? Meet Daphne, and see how her driving experience is made easier with&nbsp;Ontology</p><p>Ontology Records Daphne’s Driving Data Making Her Driving Experience Better</p><p>Daphne is a florist and vlogger. She begins her day driving to the flower shop, activating ONT ID, Ontology’s mobile digital ID application and decentralized framework that allows users to securely manage their digital identity by storing their data locally on a phone or on trusted cloud storage with a private key that grants access only to the verified user. When Daphne opens her smart lock enabled car, her driving data has been recorded and stored in a safe and secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>Ontology Allows Daphne To Book Concert Tickets Quickly Using Ontology&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>While making her way to the flower shop, Daphne uses her built-in ONTO self-sovereign data wallet, a one-stop mobile application for the management of digital identity, data, and assets, to book concert tickets with her friends. She pays using ONT, Ontology’s utility token. Daphne books the tickets using built-in voice recognition, meaning she can safely use the application while driving. Daphne is then able to send the tickets directly to her friend through the Ontology network, which transfers the cinema ticket in the form of a Ontology Non-Fungible Token&nbsp;(NFT).</p><p>Ontology Allows Daphne To Earn ONT By Renting Her Car To Other Verified Safe&nbsp;Drivers</p><p>Later in the day, Daphne goes online to an Ontology-powered marketplace where she can earn ONT by renting her car to other verified, safe drivers. Daphne is able to easily verify that the driver she rents her car to is a licensed driver with a good driver history according to their ONT Score, Ontology’s decentralized reputation scoring&nbsp;system.</p><p>Following A Minor Car Accident, Daphne Settles Her Insurance Payment Immediately Through An Ontology-powered Insurance Application</p><p>After work, Daphne is back in her car on the way to the cinema, when she gets into a minor road traffic accident. By using an Ontology-powered insurance platform, Daphne can settle her insurance payment immediately. Because the information is recorded on the Ontology blockchain, the process is fully verified, fast, and efficient. Now needing to fix her car, Daphne is able to easily order replacement car parts. Details of Daphne’s car model is recorded in a decentralized way, making the process simple and ensuring Daphne can purchase the right&nbsp;parts.</p><p>Throughout Daphne’s day, Ontology has helped make her driving experience better. By integrating Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, Ontology is bringing much-needed trust to the driving industry, not only for Daphne, but for insurers, car renters, and other drivers,&nbsp;too.</p> Want to find out more about Ontology Automotive Solution? <p>Visit <a href="https://ont.io/automotive">https://ont.io/automotive</a> or get your customized solution by emailing us at <a href="http://business@ont.io">business@ont.io</a>.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/in-the-fast-lane-ontology-accelerates-decentralized-identity-for-the-automotive-industry-2e829ecb7f23">In The Fast Lane: Ontology Accelerates Decentralized Identity for the Automotive Industry</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The symbol for the denarius, the reference coin in the Roman Empire</p>



<p>This is the fourth in the series on the paradigm shift to a digital state, this time focusing on new digital forms of government-issued money.</p>



<p>Technology
is changing the building blocks of government. In <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/04/30/the-digital-state-part-1/">Part 1</a> we
saw that the trend to e-government is leaving no pillar untouched. <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/08/the-digital-state-part-2/">Part 2</a>
showed how the technology by which people make their political choices is
changing, and <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/30/the-digital-state-part-3/">Part 3</a>
looked at how law-making is being shaped by new digital tools.</p>



<p>The
rush to digital government is now evident everywhere. Recently, for example, we
learnt about the chaos caused in the UK by a government algorithm that decided
which students passed their university entry exams. [1] The point of this negative
example is not to be negative, but merely to show that the state is now
embracing digital tools big time.</p>



<p>And
what can be a bigger than government-issued digital currencies?</p>



<p>E-government
and its money</p>



<p>The
latest technology has always shaped the physical characteristics of money. We
know that there was a time without coins – a pre-metallic monetary period. One
form of money then was cowrie shells, which could not be counterfeited. Its
monetary area encompassed the Indian ocean coastal regions of Africa, Asia and Oceania.
We know that when the shift to metallic money happened, coins started out as little
blobs. As the technology got more sophisticated, the coins became rounder and
flatter, with symbols stamped on them. We know that the metallic composition of
coins was impacted by mining discoveries – also linked to new technology. We
know that Marco Polo was hugely impressed when he discovered that the Chinese were
using a new technology for money: paper. And we know that Australia introduced
the first banknotes made from a rubber-like substance (polymer). So, we know
that the composition of money reflected the technology and resources of the
era.</p>



<p>Should
we now be terribly surprised, therefore, that in our era the state is
experimenting with new technology for the issuance, distribution, safe-keeping
and exchange of money? No. And should we be surprised that the essence of this
new money is something we cannot see or touch: digital stuff? No. And wouldn’t Marco
Polo have been impressed? Yes!</p>



<p>So,
what’s new about CBDCs?</p>



<p>While
computers are not new and electronic payments are not new and central bank
digital book entries are not new, there is something new about central bank
digital currencies (CBDCs). The new feature is that technology is changing how
and where they can be distributed and stored. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A
new digital highway, interspersed with cool digital gadgets, is creating a new
monetary transmission mechanism directly from the central bank to those
devices. The technology is not holding up its introduction, the missing legal
framework is. Where is the law that governs the new digital wallets at the
central bank? Where are the laws that govern the settlement of cross-border
payments linked to these new wallets? </p>



<p>What
we know from history is that where technology leads, society and the law inevitably
follow. The new laws will also follow from the local driving forces. One such
case is currently happening in Switzerland. The country’s stock exchange is
building a trading platform for “digital assets”. The central bank needs to
understand what that might mean for the payments system, counterparty risk and
systemic stability. One potential outcome could be a “digital Swiss franc”, which
would be used to settle payments between wholesale participants on that
platform. Nothing has been decided yet. But if that were decided, it could
happen as early as 2021.</p>



<p>Central
banks all over the world are taking a closer look at what this new digital
infrastructure might mean for their mandates. While the motivations and urgency
differ from country to country, it appears at this point that the introductions
of the first central bank digital currencies will not replace “cash” – they
will merely be an additional pool of digital units for a newly defined purpose,
distributed and stored via a new infrastructure. It also appears clear at this
stage that central banks are not keen on the idea that retail clients should
have digital wallets at the central bank.</p>



<p>Blockchain
agnostic</p>



<p>Central
bank digital currencies do not need blockchain. Recall that bitcoin was born as
the anti-central bank fiat currency. Central banks want control over the amount
of money they issue; they are not going to give up that control to a public
blockchain. Central bank digital money is anti-bitcoin money; it has a central
counterparty: the central bank. Some central banks are indeed experimenting
with blockchain, and it is not inconceivable that some could even issue a
currency on a private or permissioned blockchain, but that means they will
still exercise control.</p>



<p>Concluding
thoughts: What we can learn from the big Ӿ</p>



<p>The
era of central bank digital currencies is dawning just as governments all over
the world have issued war-time levels of debt and central banks have increased
their balance sheets to previously unimaginable sizes. It is not unreasonable
to ask if central bank digital currencies stored on new digital wallets would
not make it easier to push more digital units through the system or even remove
units via new negative interest rates? The answer to both questions is probably
yes.</p>



<p>The
algorithm problem in the UK cited above is also meant to illustrate the point
that e-government also needs a superior governance framework. This is not just
about downloading new software; e-government should also be smart government
that serves the people more efficiently.</p>



<p>Similarly,
the introduction of central bank digital currencies will need a superior
governance framework to prevent bad outcomes. Here we perhaps need to be
reminded about bad monetary outcomes in history. It is difficult to separate
the role of the issuer of money, be it a mint in ancient Greece or a modern
central bank, from the fiscal obligations of its owner, the sovereign.&nbsp; These are two sides of the coin. Several
writers who focused on the finances of the ancient world conclude that the
unsustainable public finances of ancient Greece and Rome were ultimately the
real cause of the collapse of those empires. [2]</p>



<p>In
one of the largest recorded increases in the money supply of the Roman Empire&nbsp;– a tenfold
rise in the circulation of mainly silver coinage between 157BC and 50BC – smart
administration and structural changes initially held back inflation. The measures included more cash reserves held by the
banks and the Roman treasury.
But these supportive factors eventually reversed. The Roman coin
the denarius (which had its own symbol Ӿ), was gradually debased from a practically pure
silver coin to one just washed in silver. Its value plummeted (figure 1). </p>



<p>Figure 1: The price of one pound of gold in denarii,
log scale, 50 BC to 350 AD</p>



Source [3]



<p>The
wealthy were initially able to protect themselves from inflation with a
diversified portfolio that included gold, silver and real estate. But when Rome
eventually fell to the invaders, and the new capital moved to Ravenna, the rich
could not take their land with them. </p>



<p>Rome was not built in a day and its money was not destroyed in a day either. We will need a smart new governance framework for the era of central bank digital currencies. </p>

					 <p>The easiest way to explain <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is to pull out an item that people carry on a daily basis—a wallet.¹ It’s strange to use a leather pouch to explain such a complex, nascent technology as SSI, but it works! And it works because most of the magic of SSI happens within and between digital wallets.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Going from leather to digital 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Apart from money, the leather wallet you carry in your pocket or purse stores important identifying cards (i.e., your driver’s license, health insurance card, employee badge, etc.). We show these cards to people and organizations on a daily basis to receive access to services by proving we are who we say we are. A wallet makes it easy to access these cards when we need them, and it keeps the cards from being lost or stolen.²</p><p><br>Just like a leather wallet stores a variety of important physical cards, an SSI digital wallet stores your <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, making it easy for you to show those credentials to others in a secure, private way. As the name implies, a digital wallet is digital and can exist locally (ie., on your mobile device or desktop) or in the cloud. A more formal definition of digital wallets is below:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				A digital wallet, in the context of self-sovereign identity, is a software application and encrypted database that stores credentials, keys, and other secrets necessary for self-sovereign identity.³			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Each participant in the SSI ecosystem (the issuer, the holder, and the verifier) needs a digital wallet in order to issue, hold, and verify verifiable credentials.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What can you do with an SSI digital wallet? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Collect credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Just like the leather pouch in your pocket stores important documents, your digital wallet stores your verifiable credentials. When you are issued a credential, it will be stored in your wallet. The wallet makes it so that the credentials are:<br><br></p>  Easily accessible: With a click of a button, you have access to all of your credentials which you can seamlessly share with others.  Secure: Your credentials are stored only on your device. No one else has access to them—not even the wallet provider (e.g., Trinsic).  Private: You are in full control of who you send the credential to and what pieces of information on the credential you show them.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Share verifiable information 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Here’s where the rubber meets the road. When you have a digital wallet, anybody can request information from you. The information is entirely under your control, so you can choose to share the information or reject their request. If you decide to respond, the wallet finds credentials with the relevant data and shares just what they need to know, without sharing everything. For example, you might share your address from your driver’s license credential without sharing your name or birthdate. This is possible through <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a> (ZKPs).</p><p><br>Best of all, the information you share is instantly verifiable, so you can receive access to services seamlessly, just like you do in the real world when you use your physical wallet.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Connect with others 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Finally, if there are parties you want to interact with frequently over time, you can establish a super-private, securely-encrypted connection between you and the other party. You can share information, messages, or any other interaction through this channel with a high degree of trust. While connections are powerful, they’re not always needed; <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">connectionless credential exchange</a> is sometimes a faster, more convenient way to interact, especially when the relationship isn’t long-term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Making a connection is as easy as scanning a QR code with your wallet, after which your connection will show up under your “Connections” tab in your wallet. You can also create your own QR code so others can connect with you.</p>

					 <p>The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> is the world’s first SSI digital wallet to have proven <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">interoperability</a> and has become one of the most-used SSI wallets globally. As a cross-platform mobile application with a locally-stored wallet, the Trinsic Wallet is built to be ideal for developers while being accessible and simple enough for the average user. Also, when you use the Trinsic Wallet, you don’t need to worry about vendor lock-in because you can easily export your verifiable credentials and import them into another Aries-based digital wallet that supports <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">import/export functionality</a>. Download the Trinsic Wallet for free today or build your own wallet with Trinsic’s tools.</p>

					 <p>If you’re seeking to implement an SSI solution, you have two options:<br><br></p>  Use an existing mobile wallet, like the popular&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.me/">Connect.Me</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi</a>.  Develop your own wallet, custom-made for your use case.  <p>To determine which option is best for you, read our blog “<a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-wallets-3-decisions/">Building SSI Digital Wallets: The 3 Major Decisions</a>“.

 	 Drummond Reed, an SSI expert, is famous for pulling out his wallet during presentations on SSI. Timothy Ruff, wrote about this tactic in his blog “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">When Explaining SSI, Start with the Wallet</a>“. 
 	 Of course wallets are not foolproof. They can be stolen or lost, but overall, they do a pretty good job of keeping all of our cards in one place that we can keep on us most times throughout the day. SSI digital wallets have their own security protections that are not listed out in detail here as this is an intro post. 
 	 For simplicity’s sake, at Trinsic, we call it all a “wallet” although in more technical circles, you’ll find the term “agent” used for the application that routes messages and decrypts the wallet, and “wallet” used for the storage layer of the agent.

 The GiD Report #123 — Balkanization and what that means for the future of the&nbsp;internet <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-122-what-will-replace-wechat-and-how-facebook-fueled-tiktoks-rise-ce34d1dc9ef0">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Hello, hello!</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Why a more balkanized internet is a sign that we’re entering a new chapter of decentralization (according to Peter&nbsp;Thiel)  Real demand for new solutions from mega corporations and individuals alike  It’s full circle for Apple circa 1984–2020  The EU version of a balkanized internet and the unintended consequences  An open question about moderation  Closing remarks from Peter Thiel on the state of innovation and progress in the&nbsp;U.S.   1. The biggest fear of a balkanized internet is that it means we’ll be more closed off and less connected. But the fear itself doesn’t mean it will become a&nbsp;reality. Image: University of&nbsp;Chicago<p>Because one reason we have this fear is because we’re looking at today’s events through the lens of today’s frameworks — which are grounded in a centralized approach.</p><p>China wants control so it won’t let in centralized Big Tech. The U.S. doesn’t trust China so ditto state-connected enterprises like ByteDance and&nbsp;Tencent.</p><p>But hey, email still&nbsp;works.</p><p>What that means is that a balkanized internet will only accelerate the transition toward new approaches so that we can continue to connect even as the rules of the game&nbsp;shift.</p><p>Anyway, that’s what Peter Thiel is betting on. (Always the contrarian and often controversial, but never disappoints with his insights.)</p><p>Here’s Peter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufm85wHJk5A">speaking at the Discovery Institute’s technology summit in&nbsp;July</a>:</p><blockquote>If we’d been assembled in 1969, the future of computers was going to be massive centralization. It was giant databases, giant AI-like computer intelligences that would run everything. IBM was HAL transposed in the movie The Space Odyssey, one letter off. It was one of the early Star Trek episodes. They come to the planet Beta, where thousands of years earlier, somebody had unified the planet and left a computer program that ran the whole planet and all the people were peaceful, but very docile — nothing ever happened. But the future of the computer age circa 1969 was centralization — a few large companies, a few large governments, a few large computers that controlled everything.</blockquote><blockquote>Fast forward to 1999, the future of the computer age was going to be massive decentralization. It was sort of libertarian and anarchist. It was the corollary to the end of the Soviet Union, that information had this decentralizing tendency, and the internet was going to fragment things and it was going to be this anarchic libertarian place.</blockquote><blockquote>If we fast forward to 2019, the consensus view of the future today, I would submit, is that the pendulum has somehow swung back all the way to 1969. And the consensus view again is that it is about large centralization — Google like governments that control all of the world’s information in this super centralized way.</blockquote><blockquote>The Life After Google thesis that I agree with and endorse is that if we look at this past — and people got it terribly wrong in ‘69 — and things were going to go to decentralization in ’99, it actually started going back the other way from the point of view of 2019. Even if I’m hesitant to talk about the absolute future and where this all ends, ultimately, perhaps the contrarian thing is to say maybe the pendulum can swing back towards more decentralization, more privacy, and things like that. This is what seems to be at least contrarian and at least something we should always take more seriously.</blockquote><blockquote>If you want to frame it in terms of the buzzwords of the day, if it were in terms of crypto and AI, it is easily understood by people. It’s always understood that crypto is somehow vaguely libertarian, but we never are willing to say the opposite, which is that AI is communist. It’s because it’s centralized. The computer knows more about you than you know about yourself. It’s totalitarian.</blockquote><blockquote>Communist China loves AI and dislikes crypto. We should at least consider the possibility that Silicon Valley is probably way too enamored of AI, not just for technological reasons, but also because it expresses this sort of left wing centralized zeitgeist.</blockquote><blockquote>The first sort of contrarian idea I have is that perhaps it’s time for the pendulum to swing back and Life After Google, at its core, means that we are going to go back from this very centralized world today towards a more decentralized one. That seems to me to be the correct thing to bet&nbsp;on.</blockquote><p>Going by Peter’s timeline, 1999 might have felt like the height of the decentralization movement but it was also the beginning of the cycle for the rise of Google, Amazon, Apple (again), and later Facebook.</p><p>Those companies are now among the most valuable on&nbsp;earth.</p><p>So even if today feels like peak centralization, it’s reasonable — particularly if you’re feeling contrarian — that this only means that the pendulum is about the swing the other way. The forces are already in&nbsp;motion.</p>  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/13/1006631/wechat-ban-severs-a-hundred-million-ties/">The human cost of a WeChat ban: severing a hundred million&nbsp;ties</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/internet-freedom-nationalism-authoritarianism-767da13b-b6bf-4aac-8f05-78f0a6353f08.html">Nationalism and authoritarianism threaten the internet’s universality</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogBjqQbuiHw">Who wields the power online? | DW Documentary</a>  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/competition-bureau/news/2020/08/competition-bureau-seeks-input-from-market-participants-to-inform-an-ongoing-investigation-of-amazon.html">Competition Bureau seeks input from market participants to inform an ongoing investigation of Amazon — Canada.ca</a>  <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-alibaba/trump-says-looking-at-pressuring-other-chinese-companies-after-bytedance-idUKKCN25B11B">Trump says looking at pressuring other Chinese companies after Bytedance</a>  <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-clean-network/">The Clean Network — United States Department of&nbsp;State</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wechat-ban-decentralized">A WeChat Ban Should Be the Moment for Decentralized Tech. But It’s Not. — CoinDesk</a>   2. It’s unclear that things will play out as cleanly as Peter Thiel’s proposed logic. What’s clear is that there’s suddenly ample demand for new solutions. <p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-america-worries-wechat-ban-could-be-bad-for-business-11597311003">WSJ&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>More than a dozen major U.S. multinational companies raised concerns in a call with White House officials Tuesday about the potentially broad scope and impact of Mr. Trump’s executive order targeting WeChat, set to take effect late next&nbsp;month.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple Inc., Ford Motor Co., Walmart Inc. and Walt Disney Co. were among those participating in the call, according to people familiar with the situation.</blockquote><blockquote>“For those who don’t live in China, they don’t understand how vast the implications are if American companies aren’t allowed to use it,” said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “They are going to be held at a severe disadvantage to every competitor,” he&nbsp;added.</blockquote><blockquote>Other participants in the call Tuesday included Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Intel Corp., MetLife Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, United Parcel Service Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and Cargill Inc., according to the&nbsp;people.</blockquote><p>That’s the long&nbsp;game.</p><p>There’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-98146fea-684f-411e-b873-40fd00171f93.html">ample demand from individuals, too,&nbsp;BTW</a>:</p><blockquote>Americans using digital services would gladly switch to companies that are more committed to data privacy, according to survey results shared exclusively with Axios’ Kyle&nbsp;Daly.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: It’s the latest sign people are frustrated with the digital status quo, even as companies make efforts to give users more control over how their data gets collected, stored and&nbsp;used.</blockquote><blockquote>Details: The survey of 1,018 Americans, conducted in June, found people want more control over what happens with their personal information and think existing tools seem outdated and should be easier to&nbsp;use.</blockquote><blockquote>93% of Americans would switch to a company that prioritizes their data&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>91% would prefer to buy from companies that always guarantee them access to their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>88% are frustrated that they don’t have more control over their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>73% reported finding the process of downloading their data from a company “outdated”; 32%, “hard”; 32%, “confusing.”</blockquote><blockquote>About two-thirds said they want to be able to choose what data companies can and can’t&nbsp;collect.</blockquote><p>They’re also just waiting for an alternative.</p> 3. And just to point out the swings of the pendulum — there’s Apple, complaining about the WeChat ban. Back in 1984, Apple released that iconic Super Bowl ad about IBM referencing George&nbsp;Orwell. <p>Now they’re getting a taste of their own medicine <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">with Riot’s Fortnite&nbsp;spoof</a>.</p><p>Of course, Facebook <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-apple-app-store-22774656-4221-40e7-b6b6-307a1a2de4d5.html">sees an opportunity</a>:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: Facebook is trying to position itself as friendlier to small businesses than Apple, which also faces a lawsuit from Fortnite maker Epic Games over its commission and in-app payment restrictions.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Facebook said Friday that it will launch “Paid Online Events” for small businesses in 20 countries around the world to charge Facebook users to attend their classes, instructions and other&nbsp;events.</blockquote><blockquote>The feature could be useful for any small business or individual offering a service, such a preacher, musician, yoga teacher or cooking instructor.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook asked Apple to either waive its 30% cut or let Facebook go around it and process event payments via Facebook Pay, in either case letting event hosts keep all the revenue they generate.

The other thing about technological balkanization is that it’s not always going to be black and white. A lot of the time it’s gray. That’s a good way to describe what’s been happening in Europe in terms of how they’ve dealt with the influence of American Big Tech. Rather than ban anything outright, they just force companies to play by their&nbsp;rules. <p>That’s well and good in theory. In practice, it’s really messy with a lot of unintended consequences.</p><p>For instance:</p><blockquote>Some businesses fear growing liability while others worry that small and mid-sized firms will get hurt as the U.S. and Europe begin work to replace Privacy Shield, the pact that let thousands of firms transfer data across the Atlantic without breaking EU privacy rules, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Without a replacement in place after the EU’s high court struck Privacy Shield down last month, thousands of businesses will be stuck complying with an agreement that no longer applies in the EU while scrambling to figure out how to get data over from Europe without exposing themselves to legal&nbsp;risks.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s new: This week, the Department of Commerce and European Commission announced they have started discussions to come up with a new framework to govern data transfers between the EU and the&nbsp;U.S.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/21182755.18680/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29tbWVyY2UuZ292L25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC8wOC9qb2ludC1wcmVzcy1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtdXMtc2VjcmV0YXJ5LWNvbW1lcmNlLXdpbGJ1ci1yb3NzLWFuZC1ldXJvcGVhbj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2xvZ2luJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcB191b30f7">Joint Press Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and European Commissioner for Justice Didier&nbsp;Reynders</a>  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/889kyv/a-princess-is-making-google-to-forget-her-drunken-rant-about-killing-muslims">A Princess Is Making Google Forget Her Drunken Rant About Killing&nbsp;Muslims</a>  <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/08/165131-strong-customer-authentication-a-requirement-to-combat-payments-fraud-might-lead-to-many-customers-abandoning-purchases-at-checkout/">Strong Customer Authentication, a Requirement to Combat Payments Fraud, Might Lead to Many Customers Abandoning Purchases at&nbsp;Checkout</a>   5. We’ve talked about balkanization. We’ve touched on regulation. One of the missing pieces that’s become a pivotal question of the day is moderation, which is understandably a controversial topic of the day. If you listened at all to the recent antitrust hearings, then you know that Republicans have their collective pitchforks out about platform censorship. <p>And it’s easy to think about moderation negatively particularly with what’s going on in&nbsp;China.</p><p>But just as not every habit needs to be labeled an addiction — there are good habits, after all — not all moderation should be labeled censorship.</p><p>Good moderation is helpful in creating the right incentives that align with a community’s core values — whether that’s a small group of friends or an entire&nbsp;country.</p><p>And good moderation will mean different things for different people.</p><p>A big part of why there’s such a negative slant to the idea of moderation with today’s status quo isn’t moderation itself, it’s the issue of centralized power and the lack of transparency and accountability.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/trump-twitter-facebook-and-the-future-of-online-speech">the New Yorker</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>In a 2018 article published in the Harvard Law Review, “The New Governors: The People, Rules, and Processes Governing Online Speech,” Kate Klonick, who is now a professor at St. John’s University Law School, tallies the sometimes conflicting factors that have shaped the moderation policies at Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. The companies, she writes, have been influenced by a fundamental belief in American “free speech norms,” a sense of corporate responsibility, and user expectations. They’ve also reacted to government requests, media scrutiny, pressure from users or public figures, and the demands of third-party civil-society groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League. They have sometimes instituted new rules in response to individual incidents. There are downsides to this kind of improvisational responsiveness: a lack of transparency and accountability creates conditions ripe for preferential treatment and double standards.</blockquote><p>It’s also the type of problem inherent to huge centralized organizations and platforms. The more decentralized, transparent, and flexible moderation is, the less oppressive moderation feels.</p><p>I mean I get it. Why should Mark Zuckerberg decide the rules for billions of people? Who made him king? (And I get Mark’s side — when you have your own employees protesting because you won’t take stuff down because they don’t like&nbsp;it.)</p><p>It’s like that thing that Aristotle said: That dude that has a lotta friends basically has no&nbsp;friends.</p><p>Mark gets it, too. That’s why he created an independent (supposedly) subcommittee to decide that&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>As a solution, though, it’s still kind of a bandaid. When you’re as big and as powerful as Facebook, any solution to the problem will be a bit cumbersome.</p><p>When you don’t have a system built on real trust and real identities, it’s impossible to delegate that responsibility to your users or your communities. If you never trusted them in the first place, how can you provide them&nbsp;agency.</p><p>It’s a point that we touched upon a couple weeks&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Vitalik Buterin:</p><blockquote>If you don’t have any notion of persistent identity, then you can’t have positive incentives because there’s no persistent thing for those incentives to hook onto. There’re a lot of ways you can have persistent identity, persistent reputation — even in ways that are very strongly privacy preserving.</blockquote><p>Anyway, this was more of an open question. Something to think&nbsp;about.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/08/07/google-documents-show-taboo-words-antitrust">To Head Off Regulators, Google Makes Certain Words Taboo — The&nbsp;Markup</a>   6. OK. I’ll leave you with a little more Peter Thiel on the state of innovation and progress in the U.S. from that same talk. (Sorry, Chamath is pushed back&nbsp;again.) <blockquote>If we look at the rate of progress in Silicon Valley, it was charismatic because it was the one place where things were still happening relative to the rest of the U.S., and it’s become a lot less charismatic in the last five&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>We think about the vibe in 2014, it was this place where the future was being built. In 2019, the big tech companies are probably as self hating in some ways as the big banks were in&nbsp;2009.</blockquote><blockquote>There’s a sense of, “uh, it’s not quite working.”</blockquote><blockquote>If you pick on Google a little bit here, the Google propaganda of the future was that it was all going to be more automation. The story in 2014 were things like Google Glass so you could identify anybody you looked at at any time. It was the self-driving car. I would say these aren’t that big of a set of innovations — a self-driving car is a step from a car but not as big a step as a far from a&nbsp;horse.</blockquote><blockquote>So we can debate quite how big these things are and how to quantify them. But that was still the narrative that was very intact in&nbsp;2014.</blockquote><blockquote>When you fast forward to 2019, it’s striking how there’s absolutely no narrative of the future left. Google doesn’t even talk about the self-driving car very much. There’s a sense that it may still happen, but it’s further in the future. The expected time seems to be getting further&nbsp;away.</blockquote><blockquote>So there’s sort of the sense that perhaps there’s this danger that we have slowed progress even in tech, even in the world of information technology.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>Somehow Silicon Valley has consolidated into larger companies. It’s gotten harder for new companies to break through, and it’s gotten harder because new companies or small companies are good at doing new things and people are doing fewer new things. Then the big companies are more dominant.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>The stagnation idea is that at the end of the day, technology is about people. It’s not about inanimate forces. It’s not some kind of Marxist historicism about the way things are inevitably going to happen. The stress is always on individuals, small teams that start companies, new projects that do new&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a question of human agency. It’s not deterministic. We have every possibility to do these things, but at the end of the day, it is up to us to make it happen. And it’s not set in stone that it’s going to happen one way or&nbsp;another.</blockquote><blockquote>In conclusion, I think one other gloss in Life After Google is that perhaps you should have the title with “life” being italicized or stressed or put in&nbsp;bold.</blockquote><blockquote>The critical thing is there is life, life goes on and in particular, human life, humanity goes on. Even though the dominant narrative in tech is about inanimate forces or Marxist historicism — it really is, at its core, about human beings and we should always bet on the indomitability of the human&nbsp;spirit.</blockquote> 7.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Informatica has <a href="https://www.informatica.com/about-us/news/news-releases/2020/08/20200818-informatica-acquires-greenbay-technologies-to-advance-ai-and-machine-learning-capabilities.html">just announced</a> that they have made another acquisition this summer: GreenBay Technologies, a startup focused on AI and machine learning. Read about their July 2020 acquisition <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/big-data-informatica-announces-acquisition-of-compact-solutions">here</a>.</p>
<p>GreenBay Technologies brings CloudMatcher to Informatica’s Intelligent Data Platform (IDP). CloudMatcher uses machine learning to automate entity matching and schema matching tasks with high accuracy. This impacts several key data management capabilities such as master data management, data cataloging, data quality, governance, and data integration.</p>
<p>This acquisition adds to the core capabilities of Informatica’s CLAIRE® engine. Informatica has previously collaborated with and invested in GreenBay Technologies, with some elements of CloudMatcher technology already embedded in Informatica products. Founders and team members of GreenBay Technologies will join Informatica as full-time employees. The collaboration, investment, and mutual aim to provide a more complete view and understanding of enterprise data foreshadows a successful acquisition.</p>
<p>Empowering the Business User with AI-Powered Data Management Tools</p>
<p>CloudMatcher further strengthens Informatica’s approach to no-code data management. It brings innovations to both schema matching and entity matching. While schema matching determines that two columns in two tables, such as “ename” and “emp name”, are semantically the same, entity matching determines that two records, such as (David Smith, Acme Company) and (Dave M. Smith, Acme), are the same real-world entity.</p>
<p>Historically, entity matching has remained a complex problem because the solutions are rule-based that require skilled developers and a significant amount of time. GreenBay Technologies has created a blend of “declarative rules” and “AI rules” for match classification. Many existing solutions to schema and entity matching use hand-crafted rules. With this acquisition, Informatica adds a powerful machine learning model that can capture complex and powerful matching rules, the kind of rules that users cannot create manually. The supervised learning used in this approach requires relatively little effort from the user to train the system. The active learning stage presents the business user with interactive labeling exercises for tuple pairs from two separate tables. Simultaneously, the system learns from more user feedback and curation to continuously improve over time. This workflow goes through multiple iterations and yields a high degree of accuracy. CloudMatcher is also highly amenable to distributed and parallel processing, allowing the solution to scale to very large data sets and dramatically reduce manual data stewardship required.</p>
<p>This opens the door for many data management services to be “hands-off”, meaning easily usable by business users without the need for coding or a developer background. As data sets are getting larger and larger, the improved match rate offered by CloudMatcher will help reduce the false positives. By applying a crowdsourcing approach with business users labeling training data, Informatica can configure a sophisticated data matching system that adapts to an organization’s data landscape in a few hours as opposed to days or weeks. This technology also helps in extending matching beyond identity data by matching product, supplier, location, and other types of data domains with even higher accuracy.</p>
<p>AI on Demand: A Continuation of the Platform Economy</p>
<p>We see the trend of harnessing AI to make complex tasks more accessible to non-technical users rising in many different fields. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80384/conversational-ai-building-platforms/#article-slice-14228">Conversational AI Building Platforms</a> is one such area with many vendors providing the general technology and language capabilities, with support to train the chatbot on a customer’s specific industry and corporate knowledge. Other areas include <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb70278/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a>, with AI capabilities already integrated into the cybersecurity solution and able to be trained in a context-specific environment rather than a “build it yourself” approach. This may shift in the future though, as methodologies for presenting the AI development process (data preparation, model selection, training, validating, implementation, maintenance, and retirement) to non-AI experts improve. Some tech companies (read about some examples <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80232/ibm-watson/">here</a> and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80233/microsoft-azure-ai-platform/">here</a>) are offering AI capabilities irrespective of industry; they aim to provide the infrastructure, data pipeline management, automated support to determine appropriate learning models, and governance for the AI lifecycle.</p>
<p>The data management use cases that we see Informatica addressing have the potential to unlock more data-based insights at a lower cost – be it through reducing time-to-value or by enabling subject matter experts to work with their data as a data scientist or developer would. Enabling more data-driven business will shape the processes, internal decisions, production goals, and much more. But this is only possible with strong data management practice, including the correct labeling of entities. User-friendly AI to manage this step is key to seeing more value from data management products.</p>

   “Portable” is one of the 10 principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI). In order to achieve portability or self-sovereignty, an individual must be able to control where their identity information and credentials are stored.

					 <p>“Portable” is one of the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 principles</a> of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). In order to achieve portability or self-sovereignty, an individual must be able to control where their identity information and credentials are stored. They must be able to leave their current provider and move to a new provider and never be trapped in vendor lock-in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wallet portability for individuals has always been an aspiration of wallet providers, but until today, has never been successful. We’re proud to announce that Trinsic has achieved interoperable wallet portability with two other SSI wallet vendors—<a href="https://lissi.id">Lissi</a> and <a href="https://esatus.com">esatus AG</a>. For the first time, an individual can “fire their wallet”¹ and use a new one.</p>

					 <p>When we talk about wallet portability with other vendors, we mean you can seamlessly transfer your SSI wallet between these different applications by exporting from one wallet and importing into another (“import/export”). With import/export functionality, you are no longer tied to or reliant on a single technology provider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Portability between Aries wallets is a long time coming. It’s a huge win for the vision of SSI,” said Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes. “Import/export should be standard in any SSI wallet—because if a wallet doesn’t support portability, it’s not really self-sovereign.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This first implementation amongst 3 vendors is a first step in what we hope will be a larger community effort to converge on best practices for interoperability of SSI wallets.</p>

					 <p>Our approach to wallet portability shouldn’t be viewed as the end-all be-all. Further iterations and evolution will happen over time as the SSI community continues to converge on standards and protocols relating to wallet portability. We do commit, however, to being involved in that effort. If you’d like to get involved, here are some things we’d love your contributions on:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Currently connections are lost through the import/export process. Connections are a persistent 1:1 relationship between two parties and rely on endpoints provided by mediator agents to ensure messages are routed to the correct wallet. Because the approach to mediator agents aren’t completely standardized between vendors, connections do not transfer seamlessly across different vendors.  The export function creates an encrypted, duplicate wallet which you can use as a backup. This is extremely useful if you lose your device and want to restore your wallet. But it also enables you to upload your wallet to multiple devices. This is useful if you want a tablet &amp; mobile wallet to be in sync, but can be problematic if you duplicated your wallet onto other people’s devices, allowing them to present your credentials. Ensuring the integrity of credentials across the import/export process is the subject of future work.  All the mobile wallets that support portability are based on the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>. Further testing will be required to determine whether the exported wallet can be opened seamlessly in other Aries frameworks or whether additional limitations will arise.  The import/export implementation is specifically geared toward local wallets and applications (ie., mobile wallets). Enterprise wallets and cloud wallets are out of scope.

<p>As far as tech industry standards go, it has been a slow burn <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">finding out exactly how</a> 130 Verified Twitter Accounts, and thousands of unverified accounts, came to suddenly begin promoting fake charities or Bitcoin giveaways last month. Piece by piece security experts have gleaned information directly from hackers, found tidbits on the dark web, and learned more from Twitter - the company has been updating their <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">blog post</a> about the incident almost every day since it was first posted on July 18, 2020.</p><p>However, this type of hack can happen to any company that has an administration panel or dashboard for their app that’s protected by a username and password. Even taking the time and effort to fully integrate back end systems, enable two-factor authentication, and take other precautionary measures can still lead to a similar breach thanks to clever social engineering tricks and hacks that have become increasingly common. </p><p>One way to really lock down your administration panel, possibly the best method as of today, is to use a decentralized identity platform for authentication. For example, faking a BloomID is almost impossible -- only one BloomID can be created using an email address, it’s secured by a private key that cannot be duplicated or spoofed, and accessing the accompanying Bloom app requires physical access to someone’s iOS or Android device, or taking full control of their Apple ID or Google account and restoring everything to a new device, which would cause multiple emails and alarms to go off for the affected party. Your Apple ID has been used to sign in to a new device! Your Google account has a new device associated with it! It’s kind of hard to ignore, and the most security conscious of us have locked down our wireless carrier and Apple/Google accounts, leaving only the usernames and passwords we use left to secure, or rather abandon passwords entirely, which is a movement already <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">supported</a> across all the most popular platforms but not implemented widely. </p><p>So how do you lock down your administration panel, ensuring your God Mode or Super Admin mode is only accessed by those who are truly authorized to have it? Let’s dive in.</p> Server Side <p>We’re not going to use anything like Verify Kit this time, there’s no need. All we want to do is ensure that the person trying to access the administration panel has the appropriate rights, and that can be correlated by the email address they share via Bloom’s mobile app to an existing database that contains role-based access control permissions and rights. </p><p>We will assume you have a back end that can handle some JavaScript in the form of an Express-based app, or that can be passed a payload from an Express library. This is largely true for many administration apps since JavaScript is so flexible.</p> Let’s Use Bloom Starter for Auth <p>There are two parts to the Bloom Starter app; the server-side (Express) and client-side (React).</p><p>Getting Started</p><p>First we’re going to start the Express server, start ngrok to proxy the Express server so that the mobile app can POST share-kit data to the url, and then start the React app. </p><p>Follow these steps to make it happen:</p>  Run <code>git clone https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter.git</code>  And then <code>cd bloom-starter/bloom-starter-auth</code>  Then run <code>npm run deps</code> (this installs any dependencies for both the server and client)  Before starting up the dev server, you will need a .env file with these variables set:     <code>PORT</code>  <code>NODE_ENV</code>, and   <code>SESSION_SECRET</code>   <p>Please see the .env.sample file in the repository for an example of where your .env should be located, and what it should look like. There’s no need to go in blind. </p><p>And finally run <code>npm run dev</code>.</p><p>If all went well, and the <code>REACT_APP_SERVER_URL</code> env var is set to the ngrok url, then we can move on to the client.</p> Time for the Client Setup <p>Share Kit is the front end library needed to generate a data sharing request. </p><p>Since the administration app is a web app, we can continue leveraging the same Bloom Starter repository. </p><p>For this demonstration, we don’t need much. The only Verifiable Credential we’re going to use is <code>email</code>, which we can tie back to our existing database to ensure it’s someone that should have access to the admin panel.</p><p>You can use the <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/demo">Share Kit demo</a> to generate the code needed to place the QR code on the login page. For the DatingApp administration panel login, we end up with:</p> <code>import React from 'react'
import {RequestElement, Action} from '@bloomprotocol/share-kit-react'

const requestData = {
  action: Action.attestation,
  token: 'e1b865a6-7eb6-4347-9a03-e1e6342ef85e',
  org_name: 'DatingApp Admin',
  url: 'https://receive-kit.datingapp.co/api/receive',
  org_logo_url: 'https://datingapp.co/images/DatingApp-Logo.png',
  org_usage_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/terms',
  org_privacy_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/privacy',
  types: ['email']
}

const MyComponent: React.SFC = props =&gt; (
  &lt;RequestElement
    requestData={requestData}
    buttonCallbackUrl="https://datingapp.co/admin?token=e1b865a6-7eb6-4347-9a03-e1e6342ef85e"
    qrOptions={{
      size: 256,
      hideLogo: false,
      fgColor: '#16325b'
    }}
  /&gt;
)
</code> 
<p>That token above is unique to your app. It is not a token provided by Bloom. You choose your own token as a unique identifier for your app, allowing you to distinguish data sharing requests from multiple sources. This also ensures you are receiving data from your app, and not someone else’s.</p><p>Also note that the <code>Action</code> in this request, unlike others, is <code>Action.authentication</code>. This ensures that Verify Kit knows that... </p><p>Once we have placed that on the login view, it should render like this:</p>DatingApp Admin Portal Login Page with Bloom QR Code Embedded<p>After scanning the QR code using Bloom's mobile app, this is what you would see:</p>The Data Sharing Request someone trying to log in to the adminstration panel will see.<p>Completing the ‘Slide to Share’ action will share the data with your Verify Kit instance, allowing you to ingest the data and verify it against your database. Assuming it’s successful, you can let the user in to the admin panel!</p><p>Your employees can use Bloom’s mobile app to log in to your administration panel instead of using a username and password. </p><p>To really beef up the security here, and ensure it is the same person with the same device (or a new device where they have restored a backup) each time, you could also ask for the following Verifiable Credentials:</p>  <code>phone</code>  <code>email</code>  <code>linkedin</code>  <code>full-name</code>  <code>birth-date</code>  <code>sanction-screen</code>  <code>pep-screen</code>  <p>Of course we don’t want to recommend you intrude into your staff’s personal lives, but you must consider the sensitivity of the data and the power the administration app they are accessing grants them. This is also all data you likely know about your employees already, and therefore you can verify the data received via Bloom.</p><p>This is just one of the many use cases where you can use Bloom’s open source technology to enhance trust and security within your own internal platforms while maintaining data security. Verify the data provided, delete it from your Verify Kit service, and allow your compliance and security teams to rest assured they have taken a concrete step towards better internal controls.</p> More Resources:   <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter">Bloom Starter GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/overview">Share Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit#TAttestationTypeNames">Share Kit Attestation Types</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/verify-kit">Verify Kit GitHub Repository</a>    Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all in one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p>Nothing felt strange when former president Barack Obama began his speech about the importance of taking a critical look at what we see on the internet. That is until he started making some, shall we say, uncharacteristic statements. The now-famous deepfake was one of the first of its kind to go viral, showing both how easy it is to be fooled and the dangers of not looking more closely.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“This is a dangerous time, moving forward we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet. It’s a time we need to rely on trusted news sources,” </p>– Peele through Obama</blockquote>



 

 



<p>The word <a href="https://medium.com/@songda/a-short-history-of-deepfakes-604ac7be6016">deepfake was coined by a Reddit user back in 2017</a> and is a portmanteau of the words deep learning and fake. Today, it is a blanket term for artificial intelligence (AI) powered face swapping, i.e. when one person is replaced by another in a photo or video footage. On Reddit it began as a way to make fake adult videos of famous celebrities, and while that “trend” continues, deepfakes have become a way to create and disseminate misinformation and fake news. Peele’s decision to use Obama illustrates just how easy it is to manipulate politicians’ words, which is particularly worrisome as the 2020 election approaches. And while some can be fun to watch, like Bill Hader transforming into<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWrhRBb-1Ig"> Tom Cruise</a> or<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhUhypV27w"> Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, they all come with a warning bell.&nbsp;</p>



 How’d They Do That? 



<p>Deep learning is an AI technique that uses huge data sets to create standard models and formats. Inspired by artificial neural networks, a function of the biological brain, it is considered to be the breakthrough within the field of AI. By leveraging neural network powered AI and machine learning, images and video footage can be fed into an algorithm that creates a “mask” which can be used to replace or manipulate original faces or and voices by using lookalike data. The algorithms train themselves to improve over time. If Peele hadn’t appeared in the video next to Obama, the manipulation would have been difficult for many humans to even detect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of the software involved in creating deepfakes is open-sourced like Google’s TensorFlow or uses widely available tools like Adobe’s After Effects. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, however. Peele’s skilled production team spent 56 hours to create the one-minute Obama video.</p>



 What Does This Mean for KYC?&nbsp; 



<p>The rise and advancement of deepfakes does pose a threat in that many organizations have found themselves wondering if these techniques could be used to create false identities not easily detectable within their onboarding processes. For sophisticated KYC and verification tools like <a href="https://authenteq.com/">Authenteq’s</a>, however, deepfakes can be thwarted at several entry points.</p>



<p>Authenticating one’s identity within a fully automated, robust KYC solution means that a person has to scan and upload a copy of their government-issued ID. The next step is to take a selfie and using facial recognition technology, the customer’s identity can only be verified once the biometrics of the selfie match those of the photo ID. The liveness check done with the real-time selfie also determines whether the customer is a real person, and so anything pre-recorded or played through a screen wouldn’t pass. Biometric authentication that doesn’t include a liveness check is only doing half the job as far as KYC efforts go.</p>



<p>Once verified within Authenteq’s system, spot ID checks can also be implemented if suspicious behavior is detected. If the identity does match the ID used in the onboarding process, the account could be flagged or even deactivated.</p>



<p>There has also been a series of legislation introduced to help tackle this problem. In 2019, the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230"> DEEPFAKES Accountability Act</a> was introduced in the House of Representatives, and California passed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902884/california-deepfake-political-ban-election-2020"> legislation</a> making it illegal to produce deepfakes of politicians. In the United Kingdom, producers of deepfakes can be<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-deep-fake-pornography-and-is-it-illegal-in-the-uk_uk_5bf4197ce4b0376c9e68f8c5?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANO465UhdTIOSqTKHRjw0X8c-MSstQyicQRLFRn2icdH1SuNC7u3R-zoqNfcARCzR-WeClmyXYgxvjChZ3zayJqECu8v_8LA3r5rdDhaz_-c5a3Sz2Y5oZkxi43chLqjGphrH5i9EUIiBHhEE13RXZkNQXCRBa01XfrK4OZomQWJ"> prosecuted</a> for harassment.</p>



 Looking Ahead 



<p>Much of the very warranted concern over deepfakes revolves around prominent public figures like politicians and celebrities, but what about the average consumer or businesses? Identity theft and fraud are a growing concern for people in every country and business in every sector. Like all technology, we can’t predict with any certainty what will be possible with deepfakes in the coming years but when it comes to identity verification, one thing is certain. As deepfake technology gets more sophisticated, so too will our KYC and identity verification tools.<br></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>NIST, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology, recently released <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf" title="Zero Trust Architecture">SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture</a>. The NIST special publication examines the principles of and motivations for ZTA, as well as implementation considerations, security concerns, and suggestions for improvements to architecture. NIST SPs are authored primarily for consumption by other US government agencies. In practice, however, their documents often become de facto standards and guidelines used more broadly in industry. In this post I’ll review the strengths of the SP and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p>The NIST document serves as a good introduction for ZTA. The authors correctly describe the fundamental principles of ZTA, which are a combination of traditional security tenets of Least Privilege and Defense-in-Depth. In practice, Least Privilege means only granting sufficient permissions to accomplish specific actions and not more than that; Defense-in-Depth means inserting layers and gates of security at all relevant control points in a use case. Wide open networks behind firewalls are easy targets. These ideas have become more commonly accepted in modern security architectures, as organizations realize that firewalls and other perimeter-based designs are porous and not sufficient for protecting against proliferating threats.</p>
 Zero Trust Architecture is more than networks – it is also about data and applications 
<p>We have often heard about “Zero Trust Networking” at trade shows and conferences. SP 800-207 does a good job of explaining that ZTA is not limited to networks. In fact, ZTA must transcend network-layer thinking in order to be successful. ZTA requires proper authentication and authorization for each session involving users, applications, networks (including clouds), and data. Other key components of ZTA are continuous risk-adaptive authentication and dynamic policy evaluation.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 references OASIS XACML 2.0 architecture, including Policy Administration Points (PAPs), Policy Decision Points (PDPs), and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). The document should have referenced the updated <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html" title="XACML 3.0">XACML 3.0</a>, which contains the elements of Obligations and Advice that can be used in ZTA scenarios where risk-adaptive authentication and authorization may be required by policies. There are also rule and policy combining algorithm optimizations in v. 3 that fit better with the description of Trust Algorithms in the NIST SP (p. 17).</p>
 Does the new NIST standard meet all requirements? 
<p>SP 800-207 defines conceptual components that go beyond the standard XACML PAP/PDP/PEP reference architecture. In my view, the breakdown of PDP into Policy Engine and Policy Administrator doesn’t add value and can create confusion. The XACML 3.0 reference architecture is still valid today, and is used in authorization and access control solutions even where explicit support for the XACML language is missing.</p>
<p>The illustration and definition of contributing components in Figure 2 (p. 9), namely CDM System, Industry Compliance, Activity Logs, SIEM System, etc. adhere to other US federal program definitions, but do not exactly match common usage. For example, Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations (CDM) roughly translate to asset, vulnerability, and configuration management. Industry Compliance is not a set of functions localized to one product or platform. Activity logs are consumed by SIEM, SOAR, and forensics tools. Some extrapolation and normalization of terminology and illustration may make this section applicable outside the US government.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 claims that threat intelligence “is the only component that will most likely be under the control of a service rather than the enterprise” (p. 19). Such a view discounts the prevalence and use of Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and other kinds of 3rd-party services, including discrete authentication services, and fraud risk services. At KuppingerCole, expect to see more usage and development of additional modular functional services that can enhance the ZTA authentication and authorization experiences for enterprises, covering all permutations of user-device-app-data interactions.</p>
<p>Section 4 of the new doc addresses use cases and deployment scenarios:</p>
 
 Enterprises with satellite offices (includes teleworkers) 
 Multi-cloud/cloud-to-cloud enterprises 
 Contractors and non-employee access 
 Cross domain collaboration 
 Public and/or consumer facing organizations 
 
<p>There are some variations to these use cases that could use additional detail, such as more about remote workforces and cloud-native enterprises. Section 4 is good starting point for planning how to migrate to ZTA.</p>
 What are the threats when looking into a Zero Trust Architecture? 
<p>Most discussions of ZTA tend to highlight the security advantages, of which there are several. Section 5 of SP 800-207 provides a list of possible threats specific to ZTA that industry needs to consider and begin mitigating against. Of special note here are DoS attacks on PDPs, the need for full enterprise monitoring (not just endpoint or network), and potential weaknesses in proprietary/non-standard APIs.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 also lists the use of non-person entities in ZTA administration as a possible threat. It is true that innovative IAM and IGA solutions increasingly employ non-person agents/processes to reduce the workload on human admins. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to:</p>
 
 assign roles and permissions to users at on-boarding based on attributes and entitlements that their peers have 
 perform User Behavioral Analysis (UBA) and provide confidence scores per session 
 analyze device intelligence to determine if the sources of access requests are originating from authorized locations, properly patched, free of malware, etc. 
 process the output of UBA, device intel, and other types of threat intelligence to generate risk scores per session. 
 
<p>It is possible that ML detection models can be manipulated (or gamed) to produce both false positives and negatives, and these outcomes can then be exploited by malicious actors. Even though these types of attacks require sophistication, such attacks have migrated from the theoretical to the real world. Vendors and implementers must take knowledge of these scenarios into consideration when performing threat modeling.</p>
 There is a need for standardization in Zero Trust Architectures 
<p>NIST correctly surmises the need for standardization in ZTA, especially in the areas of APIs. Most identity and security products expose APIs for other applications to use, therefore securing these APIs must be a top priority. The proprietary nature of APIs is itself a source of security concern.</p>
<p>In summary, NIST SP 800-207 is a good primer on ZTA which includes some high-level, practical design advice. The authors clearly state that there is no single ZTA solution, and that the road to fully instrumented ZTA is a long one.</p>

					 <p>The project is called <a href="https://hpec.io">HPEC</a>. HPEC stands for humanitarian, physicians, empowerment, community. For those of you who’ve been involved in the identity discussion, you understand that it’s all about community, and it’s about connecting with others. Your identity is used to interact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We as physicians have to constantly interact with each other in order to coordinate care for patients. But right now, there’s no way for us to do that in a streamlined way. As with every other form of digital communication, the process is centralized. So if you’re working in a hospital, you only are able to communicate with doctors in that hospital. If you work for an insurance network, you’re only able to send patients to other doctors in that insurance network if you want the patient’s care to be covered. HPEC decentralizes all of that and allows everyone to interact with each other regardless of policy, practice, location, or specialty, so doctors can get their patients the best care.</p>

					 <p>When we document things as physicians, we’re really recording what happened in the patient encounter, so we can call upon the information in the future when needed. If the patient comes back in six months, we can look at the records and answer questions such as: Why did we give that medication, or what surgery did they have and when? But documenting the interaction is also important when communicating with other medical professionals. If I’m sending my private practice patient to an orthopedic surgeon, I want to be able to send the surgeon the patient’s relevant medical history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, physicians record their documentation on electronic health records (EHRs). And similar to any digital documentation, especially over the internet, we have the same problem where physicians have to choose one EHR, and then the information is all trapped there. The EHRs don’t talk to each other, and there’s no standards for interoperability. So there’s a lot of friction with being able to share that information among physicians and with patients being able to access that information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of that we are building a self-sovereign identity solution for the practicing physician, so they can log in, document, and share this information in a streamlined and standardized way.</p>

					 <p>Something happened to me that made me really wake up to this problem and then this potential solution—a hospital that I was previously working for stole my identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were using my professional brand, NPI numbers, and license numbers to bill under my name when I wasn’t even in that hospital anymore. That kind of turned on a light bulb. I had learned about identity (self-sovereign identity was very, very early in that stage), but I had read about identity solutions around voting and around resource allocation, especially in emerging economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I realized that SSI would have not only prevented what happened to me but could be used to alleviate a lot of the friction in our current healthcare system.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 In the healthcare industry, what are the COVID-19 related use cases where SSI and verifiable credentials would be most helpful? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Self-sovereign identity brings privacy, security, and trust to the individual, without the individual having to reveal all of their identifying information. When it comes to COVID-19 and safety in businesses (especially in healthcare facilities like nursing homes), there might be some rules that employers create or that governments start mandating where you might need to have a recent negative COVID-19 test in order to go to work or enter the facility. But do you really need to show a piece of paper that contains a lot of personal information such as your name, phone number, and other lab tests you did that day? No. SSI makes it so you don’t have to.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What do you think it will take for the healthcare industry to begin adopting SSI as a viable solution to combat the risks of COVID-19 in the use cases you mentioned above? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Well, unfortunately as with everything else, show me the money. It has to demonstrate that it’s going to save money somewhere. If I am not allowed to go to work unless I prove that I’ve had a recent COVID-19 test, and I don’t have a solution for that, then that hits me in my wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if there’s an app that I can easily download, store my negative COVID-19 test result in it as a verifiable credential, and be able to show that to my employer, then we have a solution. So it’s going to have to be public, private partnerships and individuals who demand to use it. Those individuals may be CEOs of companies who want to get people back to work or they may be the individuals who want to be able to go back to work, board an airplane, go on a cruise, go to the movies, or send their children back to school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a bit of a leap when it comes to understanding how SSI is a solution, which I think is also somewhat of a barrier, but I think these kinds of conversations are going to help open that up.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What advice would you give to physicians and other healthcare professionals who would like to learn about SSI but don't know where to start? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>What people really need are developers who can build these platforms and make them user friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if people want to just learn about SSI in general and understand what it means, <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/">SSI Meetup</a> has a lot of really good webinars on SSI. The people who’ve been doing this for a long time—Drummond Reed, Kaliyah Young, Christopher Allen, Kim Hamilton Duffy—these individuals have written a lot on the topic. The information and leadership is out there. It just takes a little time to understand it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Is there anything else that you would like to add to this interview?

  <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) software comes in many forms. Some are heavy with software components (the thick client model) while others are leaner (the thin client model). Since we at SSH.COM are firm believers in the thin client model, I wanted to present five solid reasons why this is the case.</p>
<p></p>
 1. No constant cycle of installing, patching and configuring agents 
<p>Thick clients require that you have to install agents on the client - and usually on the server as well. Moreover, you need to ensure that those agents are always up-to-date, patched and compatible with the operating system, and installed on every client necessary.</p>
<p>That’s not only a lot of steps but it’s a process that often requires the help of specialist staff which increases costs. On top of that, when access is no longer valid, you should ensure that the agent is actually removed from the client.</p>
<p>With a thin client, there is no need to install, remove or patch any agents at any point. We prefer a model where access is granted, managed and revoked using a standard browser - the only ‘software agent’ you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Less complexity means easier endpoint security management 
<p>Every piece of software component added to the environment adds complexity to the mix. The installation and configuration needs easily add up when people join the company, switch roles and leave. This is particularly true for 3rd parties whose access needs are often temporary.</p>
<p>Moreover, PAM solutions grant primarily admin-level access. Installing a required PAM agent requires (local) admin rights which in turn are often under the control of other solutions since they are privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Client installations might also require application black or whitelisting – which adds yet another management layer to the equation. In some cases, you might need to give local admin rights to 3rd parties to get them onboarded which might not always be a good idea or even against corporate policies.</p>
<p>All in all, having privileged software agents on clients adds up to surprisingly complex endpoint security management.</p>
<p>With a thin client model, you simply skip the PAM agent installation phase which saves a lot of time, effort and money and makes access management leaner. It also means that you can have an identical installation image for all clients intended for privileged users, and you can manage software and hardware upgrades, security policies, application changes virtually and remotely using that same image.</p>
<p>You can also ensure that the clients have only the bare minimum setup for the required tasks, so there is nothing to steal if the client is compromised.</p>
<p>Last but not least, this model reduces the number of misconfigurations. Since privileged users or 3rd parties don’t need to – and can’t - install anything to use the client, unauthorized software installations or installing viruses becomes unlikely.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="https://blog.ssh.com/make_remote_work_secure_for_admins">making secure remote work fast &amp; secure for admins, devs and IT subcontractors here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Standard, plugin-free browser for minimized management 
<p>There are access management tools that work using browsers but require plugins for privileged user access to work. This is just points 1 and 2 wrapped inside a browser: are all the plugins up-to-date, who maintains them, who has the rights to install them, are they always compatible with the latest browser versions, is the browser set up correctly per client…</p>
<p>We believe in an approach where your standard browser is your only access management tool that you need to update. The official browser releases are always rigorously tested, and patches are fast and automatic which is not often the case with plugins or other software components. Once again, this model is straightforward and minimizes the number of configurations and reduces complexity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Thin in bloat, rich in features and usability 
<p>This point is almost ideological: many widely used applications – IT or otherwise - exist in the cloud and are based on thin clients, like Citrix Virtual Apps, Office 365 or Netflix just to name a few. With thin client PAM software, your developers get the same, consistent and secure experience across clients and your admins manage all access through a single pane of glass. Thin can be very rich in features: the features simply exist behind a clean looking UI.</p>
<p>This model is also very fast for onboarding: the developer just logs in to the centralized authority through a UI without anyone having to configure anything on the client. Switching clients becomes effortless. The number of access ticket requests is significantly smaller and training needs are radically reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Respect your environment, minimize all changes 
<p>If you are not familiar with the concept of immutable infrastructure, here’s a small breakdown of the idea. Once you have a particular environment set up and servers deployed, you don’t make any run-time changes to it. If you change something, you decommission the entire environment and spin up an entirely new instance instead. The benefit is more consistency, predictability and reliability in your infrastructure.</p>
<p>Again, thin is key. Don’t install anything on the client or the server for that matter. When granting privileged access, you don’t even need to create any one-time passwords or temporary accounts on the server side either. All these processes require constant run-time changes and add unwanted complexity and unnecessary processes. We are suggesting that privileged access can be granted without permanent credentials with what we call <a href="https://www.ssh.com/iam/ephemeral_access/">ephemeral certificates</a>, in a <a href="https://blog.ssh.com/zoom-and-who-data-breaches-prove-need-passwordless-it-solution">passwordless</a> fashion and without making any kind of changes to your environment.</p>
<p>This might sound radical and we are fine with that reaction. Not all PAMs need to be the same: we built ours with a strong focus in the future which is mostly multi-cloud and hybrid driven. The fact that our solution, PrivX, is based on just-in-time authentication without a need for any type of permanent credentials for privileged users was just one of the reasons KuppingerCole credited us with one of the Overall Product Leaders in their <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80088/privileged-access-management/">Leadership Compass 2020: Privileged Access Management</a>, as evidenced by the following quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s an innovative approach but one that does bring functional and security advantages – access is faster, onboarding and offboarding of privileged users is quick and there are no passwords to issue or lose, since there are no permanent leave-behind credentials”</p>
</blockquote>

 The merits of Rust for SSI and IAM software 



<p>Security is a top priority for network infrastructure, software solutions, and end-user applications that support interactions involving sensitive user data or personal information about real people and organizations.</p>



<p>Decentralized or not, any system which handles, transports, stores, or serves high value (digital) assets —&nbsp;especially solutions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and Identity and Access Management (IAM) — warrants rigorous scrutiny toward any vulnerability or oversight that may infringe on a user’s rights as a data subject.</p>



<p>That’s where <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> really shines: the programming language is distinctive for its comprehensive focus on safety, security, correctness, and efficiency. All of these areas resonate extremely well with the dimensions and properties most important when developing digital identity solutions.</p>



<p>What’s more, the design of the language itself offers crucial advantages for security by effectively addressing a wide range of common, long-standing vulnerabilities affecting code written in other popular languages. To top it off, Rust provides markedly high performance, and opens up possibilities for embedded use cases.</p>



<p>It’s a promising sign, then, to see folks familiar with blockchain and other DLT technologies are showing embrace of Rust in their development work. Already at this early stage of adoption there is a sizeable array of tools and applications written in Rust that could well be implemented in IAM solutions based on SSI. This toolset nicely complements the core set of design-driven advantages for development previously mentioned.</p>



<p>Rust’s security guarantees are proving to be particularly desirable for the implementation of highly secure systems, like those used to manage user identities, access rights, and digital assets. Since SSI infrastructure must be capable of handling complex flows of value, the underlying technical infrastructure must be designed to sustain and secure that value. The distinctive features of Rust are particularly advantageous for these reasons.</p>



 Developing for SSI in Rust 



<p>As the SSI ecosystem is still maturing, only a limited number of production-ready solutions enjoy active deployment in real use cases, and even fewer are implemented in Rust.</p>



<p>That said, here are a couple ways we use Rust at Jolocom:</p>



  Certain core components of <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/wallet-rs">our open source library for SSI-based digital identity management</a> are implemented in Rust (available on GitHub). In particular, we migrated all plaintext private-key operations (e.g. signing, decryption) into Rust code in order to minimize risk posed by malicious dependency attacks in JS runtimes, as well as to provide a safe, portable, consistent, and well-understood set of crypto tools with an easy-to-use API.  



  A Rust implementation of the “KERI” Core Library — KERIOX — is well underway. <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI (“Key Event Receipt Infrastructure”)</a> is an event-based Distributed Key Management Infrastructure which provides the same security and verifiability properties for transactions as a blockchain or distributed ledger, without the overhead of requiring an absolute global ordering of transactions. The system is designed to provide a secure identifier-based “trust spanning layer” for any stack. The open source project is under active development in collaboration with <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF — the Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, where we’ve been a member-organization <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/self-sovereign-identity-the-next-generation-of-digital-life/">since early 2018</a>.   



<p>With such tremendous potential in cross-industry collaboration, we want to help catalyze and coordinate any opportunities for mutual enrichment and growth by building up the common ground shared by Rust and SSI communities.</p>



<p>In fact, we are actively seeking an experienced software engineer with knowledge in Rust —&nbsp;here’s <a href="https://jolocom.io/hiring-rust-software-engineer/">more on the open position</a> in case you or someone you know may be interested in joining the Jolocom team!</p>



  



<p>As a 12-person, purpose-driven organization stewarding an open source project to create a common infrastructure for digital identity and rehash our society’s relationship to personal data — we at Jolocom definitely place an emphasis on community engagement as a core value. For that reason we are always looking for ways to contribute back to the people and communities which help make a positive impact on and off the Web.</p>



 That is why for this year’s <a href="https://rustconf.com">RustConf</a>, Jolocom is supporting the conference as an official sponsor! 



<p>We can’t wait to meet more of the community and explore the intersection of Rust and SSI alongside dedicated stakeholders, veterans, and enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Hope to see you on Thursday (Aug. 20) for the virtual conference.</p>



<p>Want to connect, but unable to attend next week? We’re always available to chat on <a href="https://gitter.im/jolocom/home">Gitter</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity security is driving exceptional customer experiences 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day when you enter your username and password into your favorite website, you’re generating data. The average customer generates an eye-watering volume of data over the course of their digital day. When someone registers for a new website or app and creates a user profile, they’re creating a new dataset that can be analyzed by a new firm. When that phenomenon multiplies across cities, countries, and continents, the amount of information being created by customers across the globe is downright staggering. But managing that data properly and adhering to regional, national, and international guidelines can be a difficult task for even the most seasoned executive. It’s an organizational risk that more companies are coming to terms with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all that data is also an opportunity, one that allows companies to personalize their products and services and give their customers and clients incredible, engaging experiences—such as the ability to login without using a password. Personalization is key to success, but it has to happen in a way that makes data security simultaneously integral and invisible.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>In their race towards digital transformation, organizations are using cloud services to accelerate the development of new apps and improve efficiency. They allow new applications to be rapidly developed, existing applications to be modernized and deployed without additional capital spend. This provides important business benefits but also increases the challenges for the cloud customer to ensure cyber-security and regulatory compliance. It is in this light that the recent announcements from GCP (Google Cloud Platform) need to be understood.</p>
 
 Trust but Verify 
 
<p>Initially, cloud service users were concerned that they had no control over the way in which the services themselves were managed and secured. The major CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) now go to great lengths to secure the infrastructure of their environments and it has become clear that many of the cloud security challenges lie with the customers’ own use of these services. For example, security and compliance are often outside the skills of DevOps teams or are overlooked and this can lead to the existence of critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber adversaries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An additional concern is the risk of government interference in the operation of the service or demands for access to the data it holds. This concern was recently rekindled with the EU <a href="https://noyb.eu/files/CJEU/judgment.pdf">Court of Justice Ruling</a> on the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>The onus is on the CSP to gain customers' trust in all of these areas.</p>
<p>GCP publish an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-clouds-semi-annual-transparency-report-now-available">Enterprise Data Transparency Report</a> that identifies the number of government requests received for Google Cloud Platform and G Suite Enterprise Cloud customer. This report claims that a very small percentage of requests were for enterprise data and that Google did not produce any GCP Enterprise Cloud customer data in response to government requests.</p>
<p>The customer always needs to verify the claims of the CSP. SLAs provide some reassurance but usually with limited recourse if they are missed. Contracts are usually written by the CSP and are not negotiable. Independent certification of compliance is useful to provide a snapshot in time. The best verification is proof that the service was designed, implemented, and is run with security and compliance built-in.</p>
 
 Securing Data and Access 
 
<p>When an organization uses a cloud service the responsibility for security and compliance is shared (see graphic). It is always up to the customer to classify the data that they hold in the service and to control access to this data according to the risks and their compliance obligations. The CSP must secure the infrastructure and should provide the capabilities for the customer to assess and control their use of the service.</p>
<p>One critical control for this is data encryption – however, customers need to consider which form of encryption is appropriate for their risks. For example, while data may be encrypted during transit on the network and at rest in the database and - this will protect against interception and media loss, but it does not protect against application-level attacks such as SQL Injection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GCP already provides the customer with the capabilities to encrypt their data and to manage their own encryption keys. This includes a cloud-hosted key management service that lets the customer manage their cryptographic keys for their cloud services the same way as on-premises. It also provides HSM as a service to provide hardware protection of the keys. Additionally, in beta is Key Access Justifications a capability that gives the customer visibility into every request for an encryption key, a justification for that request, and a mechanism to approve or deny decryption in the context of that request.</p>
 
 Confidential Computing 
 
<p>While data is being processed in the customer’s applications it needs to be decrypted. This creates a small but important risk to confidentiality through RAM scraping attacks for example. Intel SGX technology already enables applications to be written to process data within protected enclaves.&nbsp; However, this typically requires development changes to the application. GCP&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing">Confidential Computing</a>&nbsp;(in beta) is a technology that encrypts data in-use while it is being processed. Confidential Computing environments keep data encrypted in memory and elsewhere outside the central processing unit (CPU). Google claims that this can be implemented at a VM level without any need for code changes at the click of a button.</p>
 
 Assured Workloads for Government 
 
<p>Normally CSPs offer cloud services tailored to the specific compliance requirements of governments. Often, these are hosted in dedicated data centres and managed by government accredited staff to ensure compliance. However, this slows the deployment of new features and does not scale to support other highly regulated industries such as finance. In response to this GCP has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/assured-workloads-for-government-compliance-without-compromise">Assured Workloads for Government</a>. Google claim that this will allow them to support US Government workloads to IL4 within their normal infrastructure by:</p>
 
 Automatic enforcement of data location: to meet U.S. government compliance requirements by choosing to store data at rest in U.S. regions. 
 Personnel access: to limit Google support personnel access based on predefined attributes such as citizenship, a particular geographical access location, and background checks. 
 Built-in security controls: to reduce the risk of accidental misconfigurations by choosing from available platform security configurations. 
 Automatic enforcement of product deployment location based on organizational policy. 
 
 
 Certificate Authority Service 
 
<p>Digital certificates underpin identity and authentication for many networked devices and services. This is not new technology but is becoming more important as a mechanism to securely identify IoT devices. However, it is difficult to set up a CA (Certificate Authority) and manage digital certificates at the scale required where there may be many millions of devices. Google has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-cas-a-cloud-based-managed-ca-for-the-devops-and-iot-world">Certificate Authority Service</a>. This is in beta and will provide a scalable and available service that simplifies and automates the management and deployment of private CAs.</p>
 
 My Opinion 
 
<p>These announcements from GCP underpin the view that organizations are increasingly using cloud services for their business-critical applications as part of their digital transformation journey. This is leading to more scrutiny of the ways in which these services can help the organization to support their own specific security and compliance obligations. The customer still needs to map these controls back to their obligations and to ensure that the controls are effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While none of the announcements from GCP are for offerings that are completely unique they do provide useful differentiation that may sway some customers to choose GCP. However, most organizations will have a hybrid IT deployment model involving multiple CSPs as well as on services delivered on-premises and this will remain a significant challenge for the foreseeable future.</p>

But in fighting China’s fight, the U.S. is creating an internet that more and more resembles that of its primary geopolitical rival.</p><p>All of this had the vibe of inevitability. With all the tension building up from the status quo, it was only a matter of time before something had to&nbsp;give.</p><p>These are the ongoing battles that will rejigger the world as we know&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so this week, the economy feels a little less free. And the internet feels a little less&nbsp;open.</p><p>Here’s what we have for you&nbsp;today:</p>  What will fill the WeChat&nbsp;vacuum?  How Facebook fueled TikTok’s&nbsp;rise  The New Brandeis Movement of antitrust thinking  NYTimes contemplates the challenge of antitrust regulations  Chamath Palihapitiya on the economy and Bitcoin (next&nbsp;week)  Stuff happens   1. Everyone is talking about TikTok. Microsoft has 45 days to complete a deal. Twitter apparently threw its hat into the ring over the weekend, according to the WSJ (they’re calling it “Twik Twok”). But let’s talk about&nbsp;WeChat. <p>Where TikTok is about ephemeral fun and also significant long term cultural (and in turn political) influence — soft power, basically — WeChat is as hard as it&nbsp;comes.</p>Photo: Sean&nbsp;Foley<p>Sure, WeChat hasn’t had the same kind of international impact outside of China that TikTok has enjoyed (which, BTW, isn’t even available in China — they use an alternative called Douyin). But if I want to chat with my cousin in Shanghai about the new guy she’s dating, I open up WeChat. If my sister wants to order some obscure product that only a niche Chinese manufacturer makes, she logs onto&nbsp;WeChat.</p><p>If you wanted to connect with people in China, you opened up China’s #1&nbsp;app.</p><p>So even though pretty much no regular American uses WeChat for their normal day-to-day stuff, it remains the central vector for connecting with mainland China both socially and economically. By banning WeChat, Trump is burning a key&nbsp;bridge.</p><p>And because China banned U.S. platforms long ago, there’s really no real alternatives from either&nbsp;side.</p><p>That’s a huge vacuum that’s going to need to be filled. Tensions are high between the two governments, but people are still people. They are going to want to chat and they are going to want to do business with the outside&nbsp;world.</p><p>So the real question is what fills that&nbsp;gap.</p><p>It’s hard to see something from the old guard rising to the task. They want too much control. They need too much of your data. And they lack the structural flexibility to appease both sides. It will be a nonstarter for either government.</p><p>New bridges will need to be built with new approaches.</p><p>That’s the new&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Anyway, this is a big deal. It’s not just about me or my sister. It’s also about Apple. Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-29d4148e-e21a-4b81-82c8-8e23fb4995d8.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Yes, but: WeChat is not only huge inside China but serves to connect users there with friends and family abroad, and shutting it down in the U.S. would be a major disruption to the Chinese diaspora. Beijing’s internet surveillance and censorship means most Chinese communication platforms stay domestic, and American tech platforms don’t extend into the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><blockquote>Unlike TikTok, which doesn’t operate in China, WeChat can’t be cleanly severed from China, so there’s no path to a domestic acquisition, and the executive order likely amounts to a&nbsp;ban.</blockquote><blockquote>And if American companies can’t do any commerce involving WeChat, which is widely used for a vast range of functions within China, that could demolish the Chinese business of companies like Apple, observers <a href="https://twitter.com/guan/status/1291698934155489281">note</a>.</blockquote> 2. OK! With that out of the way, now we can talk about TikTok (the success of which Facebook is apparently responsible for). <p>If you watched the antitrust hearings the other week — and even if you only watched parts as I did, it was clear that Mark Zuckerberg was positioning Facebook as a democratic foil to TikTok (and parent owner ByteDance).</p><p>In other words, Mark believes we need companies like Facebook to be as big as possible in order to compete on the global stage with an emergent China — Tech Cold War and all that&nbsp;jazz.</p><p>It’s a compelling argument with some (emphasis some) undeniable merit. Companies, tech or other, benefit from scale and network effects, improving reach and efficiency. And having global corporate behemoths expands American hegemony.</p><p>And we all want to expand American hegemony don’t we? (Apologies to all the non-American readers, I’m just trying to make a&nbsp;point.)</p><p>With billions of users, Facebook helps better connect people everywhere, expanding American soft power, and for a time, even helping to spark democratic movements (arguably). The Arab Spring comes to&nbsp;mind.</p><p>But what if Facebook (sheer size and monopolistic behavior in tow) is also one of the main drivers of TikTok’s&nbsp;success?</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://promarket.org/2020/08/07/tech-monopolies-are-the-reason-the-us-now-has-a-tiktok-problem/">Lucas Kunce</a> (via Matt Stoller’s newsletter BIG) for the University of Chicago’s Stigler Center ProMarket magazine:</p><blockquote>If you’re amused by the irony of Big Tech protecting us from an app that could be used for election meddling, given Facebook’s role in the 2016 election, the irony doesn’t stop there. Because TikTok, the app getting all the attention right now, owes its existence in large part to Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>Once upon a time, America had a popular video-sharing app similar to TikTok. It was called Vine and, like TikTok, all the kids used to share silly videos on it. Facebook didn’t like the competition and flexed its monopoly power to strangle it. As revealed in leaked e-mails, Mark Zuckerberg pulled the trigger himself, denying Vine access to Facebook and eliminating its ability to access&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>Curiously, Facebook didn’t do that with TikTok. In fact, it did the opposite. During the spring and summer of 2018, when Facebook was still pushing to access China and trying to open a subsidiary office in Hangzhou, Facebook allowed the Chinese app to blitzkrieg its site with advertising. The ad buys were so overwhelming — more than a billion dollars — that between 15 percent and 22 percent of all ads shown through Facebook on IOS during this time were TikTok&nbsp;ads.</blockquote><blockquote>In 2019, however, things changed, and it had nothing to do with patriotism or protecting the West from a Chinese app. Zuckerberg appeared to finally realize that he would never get into China, political scrutiny on Facebook’s outsized power intensified on both sides of the aisle, and TikTok stopped pouring $3 million a day into big ad buys on Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>In short, Facebook claims its size should be preserved in order to serve as a line of defense against adversarial companies and that it needs to be big to innovate. Yet the evidence indicates that the latest adversarial app owes its existence, in part, to Facebook’s pursuit of corporate goals like expanding into China and increasing ad revenue. The Vine story clearly illustrates how the large tech platforms are structurally unable to defend American interests and should never be trusted with that&nbsp;task.</blockquote><p>That’s the other side of the coin. Just because Big Tech is powerful doesn’t mean it’s good for America. Because ultimately, Big Tech is self interested. (Which in and of itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but you know what I mean.) How many potential American Tik Toks has Facebook squashed along the way by pushing its sheer weight around? (Like it did with SnapChat as well when Evan Spiegel refused to&nbsp;sell.)</p><p>In crushing American competition, Facebook created space (and even supported) the rise of Chinese competition.</p><p>The consequences only become fully clear in hindsight. It’s the type of negative externality that’s sometimes hard to quantify — diminishing competition and innovation (although the numbers are now starting to back it&nbsp;up).</p><p>Related:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34qpwtU9uoI">The TikTok&nbsp;Ban</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/">Ben Thompson: Antitrust Politics</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-hearing-cicilline-facebook-apple-google-amazon-230cca9a-eadc-4293-ad73-fc9c41696d20.html">Podcast: Big Tech hearing chair on which companies should be broken&nbsp;up</a>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/banning-tiktok-are-we-reproducing?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzEzNiwicG9zdF9pZCI6ODI0MDM4LCJfIjoiOUd5RkYiLCJpYXQiOjE1OTY4MjMwOTcsImV4cCI6MTU5NjgyNjY5NywiaXNzIjoicHViLTExNTI0Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.RzCACSxUpx6CzohuN2uoIdIw-pVdbB6Fw-T0D7camuY">Banning TikTok: Are We Reproducing the Chinese Internet in&nbsp;America?</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-tiktok-have-held-preliminary-talks-about-possible-combination-11596925449">WSJ News Exclusive | Twitter, TikTok Have Held Preliminary Talks About Possible Combination</a>  <a href="https://promarket.org/2020/08/07/tech-monopolies-are-the-reason-the-us-now-has-a-tiktok-problem/">Tech Monopolies Are the Reason the US Now Has a TikTok Problem — Pro&nbsp;Market</a>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2020/08/09/trumps-ban-on-tiktok-and-wechat-strengthens-cryptocurrencies/">Trump’s Ban On TikTok And WeChat Strengthens Cryptocurrencies</a>   3. So we’ve talked about Lina Khan here before, who wrote the seminal paper on antitrust (Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox), which helped spawn the New Brandeis Movement (Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis is heavily cited in Lina’s paper). The ethos of that movement got a nod by Chairman David Cicilline during the antitrust hearings (via Ben Thompson’s Stratechery): <blockquote>Because concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power, this investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies. American democracy has always been at war against monopoly power. Throughout our history, we’ve recognized that concentrated markets and concentrated political control are incompatible with democratic ideals. When the American people confronted monopolies in the past, be it the railroads or the oil tycoons or AT&amp;T and Microsoft, we took action to ensure no private corporation controls our economy or our democracy.</blockquote><p>Which touches upon our point about Facebook and the rise of TikTok. This isn’t just about keeping prices low, making platforms more useful, or optimizing for efficiency. It’s about upholding social, cultural, and political values and not allowing economic power undermine them.</p><p>In other words, we can’t lose sight of the big&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Those were Chairman Cicilline’s closing remarks to his opening statement. Ben has <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/">a more in depth take on the hearings as a whole</a>, which is worth your time. (Incidentally, he didn’t feel like the rest of the show lived up to the spirit of those initial remarks.)</p> 4. The issue is that it’s easy to spot the problem. Figuring out a solution is less straightforward—especially from a regulatory perspective. <p>Here’s <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20200804&amp;instance_id=20964&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=35187&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fd75f7c23-4919-5b0f-99e6-c340a549cde8&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Shira: What’s been Europe’s approach to the American tech superpowers?</blockquote><blockquote>Adam: Europe started doing antitrust investigations several years ago. But the resulting lawsuits and regulation haven’t done&nbsp;much.</blockquote><blockquote>Google is the best example. Investigations into allegations of anti-competitive tactics took years. The European Union then fined Google several billion dollars for breaking the law. But critics say that Google wasn’t forced to change much, so this did little to restore competition.</blockquote><blockquote>What can American lawmakers and regulators learn from Europe’s mistakes?</blockquote><blockquote>Speed is crucial, otherwise regulators are fighting yesterday’s battles.</blockquote><blockquote>There was also a problem with enforcement. Europe passed a highly-touted privacy law called General Data Protection Regulation, but it’s been a flop at limiting data collection by the biggest tech companies. Much of the policing of the law was left to Ireland, which simply doesn’t have the resources to keep&nbsp;up.</blockquote><blockquote>It sounds as if the lesson is that you can believe there’s a problem with tech companies’ power, but it’s hard to craft an appropriate response.</blockquote><blockquote>Without a doubt. The authorities in Europe are changing their tactics now. They’re looking at rewriting laws to directly target the way big tech companies do business: How they use data or box out rivals, and ways they give their products preferential treatment.</blockquote><blockquote>But after a few years covering this in Europe, I have become much more suspect about these efforts at regulation. There’s a lot of potential for unintended consequences.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Does this mean we should be skeptical about any U.S. government action against Big&nbsp;Tech?</blockquote><blockquote>Maybe. But it’s still been interesting to watch this growing realization among the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic about the size of these companies and the influence they hold over their democratic societies and how they operate, including their communication systems, information flow and commerce.</blockquote><blockquote>You can sense this feeling that lawmakers think they must do something, but aren’t quite sure what that is yet. The next 12 to 18 months are going to be extraordinary.</blockquote><p>And because these are extraordinary times, things are moving faster than usual.&nbsp;Axios:</p><blockquote>After grilling the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple last week, members of Congress are grappling with whether to accuse any of the firms of illegal anticompetitive behavior, to propose updating federal antitrust laws, or both, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: Congress is just one arm of government making the case against these <br>companies. Google is expected to be the first of the firms to face possible antitrust litigation from the Justice Department before summer’s end, but all four face a full-court press of investigations by DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s next: Following on from last week’s hearing, the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is preparing a report of its probe’s findings, drawn from some 1.3 million documents and hours of calls and interviews. Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline told “Axios Re:Cap” he hopes to issue the report and recommendations by late August or September.</blockquote> 5. I was going to get to the economy next, referencing the interview with Chamath Palihapitiya I shared on Friday, but today’s newsletter has already gotten pretty long so I’ll save it for next&nbsp;week. <p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/goldman-sachs-eyes-token-bank-appoints-head-digital-assets">Goldman Sachs Eyes Own Token as Bank Appoints New Head of Digital Assets — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20200806a.htm?utm_campaign=20200806_FS_PR_FN_FRN%203%20Release_Broad&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Eloqua">Federal Reserve announces details of new 24x7x365 interbank settlement service with clearing functionality to support instant payments in the United&nbsp;States</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-history-present-and-future-of-central-banks-feat-george-selgin">The History, Present and Future of Central Banks, Feat.

					 <p>There is a single question that can go a very long way in helping determine whether you should build a solution in-house or buy a product to solve your need:</p>

					 <p>If you were developing a web app, you wouldn’t consider building your own RDBMS, front-end framework, or hosting service. Likewise, to add payments functionality, you would probably use a service from experts like Stripe in order to reliably process payments and ensure PCI compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a bank, on the other hand, payments is probably your bread and butter. You’ll either partner with someone like Stripe for their expertise in API/cloud development or hire a team and build it all yourself.</p>

					 <p>At face value, the decision to build or buy seems like a relatively straightforward one; how much will it cost you to build and maintain an in-house system, and what’s the sticker price for the ready-built solution? But there are non-obvious and often hard-to-quantify considerations that you need to make sure to fully consider.</p>

					 <p>A ready-made product should work off the shelf. Some products work better than others…but in principle, this is true.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Support</a>
					 
					 <p>If you’re building something in-house and you run into a roadblock, where will you turn? Consultants? Expensive. Forums? Unreliable, slow. Figure it out? Expensive (because it’s slow). The support that comes with a product, especially in an industry as nascent as self-sovereign identity, is extremely valuable.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Premium product</a>
					 
					 <p>When a vendor makes an update to a product you’re using, you inherit those features effortlessly. The product improves itself over time because there is a dedicated team working on it. Because of the nature of economies of scale, this always results in a premium product.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Scaling</a>
					 
					 <p>Open source reference implementations are meant to be a reference but are not ultimately meant to be a scalable solution. If you use a vendor, you’ll likely need to pay them more money as you scale; so they’re incentivized to ensure their product is scalable!</p>

					 <p>It’ll always be lower-cost to buy than to build because the development costs of the product can be amortized across all their customers. If you build it in-house, you bear the brunt of 100% of the costs.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>  Control</a>
					 
					 <p>When you build the technology yourself, you have total ownership and control over the software. You’re not restricted by other software licenses, and you have full ability to change the codebase to accommodate your needs. You control where the data is hosted and don’t need to rely on legal agreements to control how it’s handled.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> In-house expertise</a>
					 
					 <p>Although it will be much more expensive and time consuming to build in-house, your team will build up an expertise. If this expertise is strategically important for your organization, this is an important consideration. You’ll need to make sure to retain the knowledgeable employees, however; I’ve seen key employees leave and wipe out their company’s SSI knowledge base.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Long-tail use case</a>
					 
					 <p>If your use case is uncommon or extraordinarily unique, you may be forced to build in-house. Ready-built platforms like Trinsic are built to accommodate all of the most common use cases, but there is a “long tail” of cases that aren’t economical for a vendor to cover. For these, you will likely need to go deep into the low level SDKs and build something custom.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Costs at scale</a>
					 
					 <p>Depending on the pricing model of the vendor you’re working with, it’s possible that it will be costlier at scale to use a vendor. For example, if a vendor charges per-issuance and your use case requires issuing millions of credentials, then you’ll either need to negotiate special pricing with the vendor or build your own solution to make it economical. This is rare, so it is a companion point to the “long-tail use case” point.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Avoid vendor lock-in</a>
					 
					 <p>Traditionally, enterprises would build in-house to avoid being locked in to a specific software vendor. Luckily, SSI protocols are open source and based on standards which means that Trinsic can’t lock you in even if we wanted to! So the value of this point is reduced in the context of self-sovereign identity.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Self-sovereign identity is unique 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>In addition to the common considerations above, SSI has some unique properties that you should be aware of.<br><br></p>  Rapidly-moving space: The open source and standards work in the SSI community are moving at the speed of light. If you opt to build yourself, you’ll need at least two full-time engineers working solely on SSI just for your system to tread water; one to stay abreast of the evolving work going on at DIF, ToIP, Hyperledger, Sovrin, W3C, etc. and one to implement and maintain your software in response to those changes. You’ll bear 100% of the cost of these engineers. And the interoperability devil is in the details—with a vengeance.  Identity is high-stakes: Many verifiable credentials use cases involve high-value, highly-regulated data. Identity breaches are <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ponemon-institutes-2015-global-cost-of-data-breach-study-reveals-average-cost-of-data-breach-reaches-record-levels-300089057.html">costly</a>, making key storage, wallet management (especially in the cloud), and other architectural considerations crucially important. Are you a world-class expert in securing these components? Even if you have the know-how, do you have the engineering capacity for the build-out and maintenance? Once it’s secured, how will it scale?  <p><br>Self-sovereign identity is who we are. It’s what we eat, breathe, and sleep, so you don’t have to. Our expert engineering team ensures the most recent standards and protocols are implemented in our platform, so you never have to worry about interoperability or standards compliance.

<p>It’s a commonplace nowadays that we live in an information age where society and the economy is increasingly driven by data. All you need for evidence of this is to look at the likes of Google and Facebook, companies that have embedded themselves into billions of peoples’ everyday lives. Or take a look at the increasingly fractious debate about who should be allowed to collect what data, how, for what purposes and whose&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>But actually we’re just at the beginning. At the very earliest stage. Why? Because the way that data is currently collected and used suffocates its true potential.</p><p>The unique and special thing about data is that it doesn’t get ‘used up’ when it is used. It can be used again and again. And it can be used by different people for different purposes. Your health data may be used by a doctor to help treat an illness for example, and by an insurance company to calculate your insurance premiums. You may use the data in your driving licence to prove that you are entitled to drive. A separate organisation may use it to help verify your identity.</p><p>Currently our entire data economy is organised around the assumptions of ‘OUOU’: that there is only One User of any piece of data that has been collected (the first ‘OU”) and there is only One Use for this data — the purpose they collected the data for (the second ‘OU’ of ‘one use’). This data system is almost 100% organisation-centric. It is organisations that collect and use data and they only use this data for their own purposes, jealousy guarding the data they collect, partly because for legal reasons if it is personal data, but also because they see this data as keys to their competitive edge and ability to make&nbsp;money.</p> From ‘OUOU’ to&nbsp;‘MUMU’ <p>Increasingly however, a new realisation is dawning: that data that was originally collected and used by a specific data controller for a specific purpose could be used by many other parties for many other purposes. As long as we live in an OUOU world the full potential of data can never be unleashed, because most users, and uses, of this data can never&nbsp;happen.</p><p>To unleash this potential, we need to move from OUOU to MUMU — many users, many&nbsp;uses.</p><p>Like the chick in the egg at a certain point the OUOU structures and assumptions that originally protected and nurtured data collection and use begin to constrain and suffocate it. For the data chick’s potential to be unleashed it has to break out of the OUOU shell to embrace MUMU&nbsp;instead.</p><p>You can see the MUMU trend everywhere we look, in issues relating to both personal and non-personal data. For example, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-european-strategy-data-19feb2020_en.pdf">new European Strategy for Data</a> has provisions to improve and increase data sharing between the public sector and business (government-to-business or G2B data sharing), between companies (business-to-business or B2B data-sharing), between businesses and government authorities (business-to-government or B2G data sharing), and between public authorities. It is developing strategies for increased data sharing in targeted industries such as automotive, financial services, health and Internet of&nbsp;Things.</p><p>Of course, citizen’s right to data portability is now enshrined in law via GDPR. Data sharing in one form or another is also an essential element of multiple initiatives including those to promote availability of Open Data, attempts to promote Open Banking and hot topics including so-called ‘Big Data’, AI, internet of things, smart cities and smart&nbsp;homes.</p><p>This shift from OUOU to MUMU represents a tectonic shift in the data economy. Its unfolding may be slow but it is also fundamental, structural, remorseless, relentless and unstoppable. the potential uses of data. And the more the idea ‘clicks’ in peoples’ minds (e.g. policy makers, regulators, innovators, entrepreneurs, opinion-formers as well as people like ourselves) the more unstoppable the pressure for MUMU&nbsp;becomes.</p><p>Looking back, once MUMU ways of collecting and using data have become the new normal, what we currently call ‘the ‘information age’ will seem extremely restricted, distorted and partial indeed, just as the age of steam seems extremely limited once viewed from the vantage point of an electrified society.</p><p>In their time, steam engines were dazzling and awe-inspiring in their operation, scale and impact; widely seen as harbingers, symbols and catalysts of dramatic and far-reaching change. But ultimately, steam was a dead-end. When it was replaced by electricity — a far richer, more flexible, versatile, efficient, distributed way of accessing and using energy, economic growth really took&nbsp;off.</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook are the steam engines of the information age. They, too, are dazzling and awe-inspiring in their operation, scale and impact. But their OUOU nature means they don’t represent the MUMU&nbsp;future.</p> Multiple effects <p>MUMU will (is already having) multiple effects. Here are some of&nbsp;them.</p>  A growing increasing realisation that data storage needs to be separated from data use, with specialist organisations and institutions enabling the gathering, aggregation and storing data and helping specialist service providers access and use it for specific purposes. A central plank of the EU’s new data strategy for example is to “increase its pools of quality data available for use and re- use.” This is part of what it calls “a new data paradigm where less data will be stored in data centres, and more data will be spread in a pervasive way closer to the user ‘at the edge’ ”. Mydex is one of these specialist organisations.  The increasing importance of new mechanisms and enablers of safe, efficient data sharing. Well-formed APIs are an obvious example. They can help to turn a system of isolated data castles into a vibrant, pulsating nervous system driven by data sharing. But the development of new standards for the creation and use of metadata is also critically important along with data directories that act as signposts to where the data is held, and data inventories explaining what data is held by each&nbsp;party.  New forms of value and business model to go with these new approaches.  The collapse current notions of ‘private property’ which are of absolutist, binary, where something is either mine or yours. In its place: increased recognition of the importance of shared and divided rights and responsibilities with negotiated boundaries and&nbsp;limits.  Changes in value equations. Currently, in consumer/citizen facing services, the only value that matters relates to the content and quality of the service offered by a service provider. With the rise of MUMU, organisations will be increasingly expected to offer an added dimension of value: data. Citizens/customers will increasingly ask “what data has the service provider collected, generated or minted that I could use for other purposes elsewhere, outside of this relationship, with other parties?”   New dangers <p>The shift to MUMU won’t automatically usher in a new golden age of data sharing and use. Far from it. Predatory, parasitic and profiteering motives and strategies are likely to be inflamed even further, triggering new data land grabs that are even bigger, more vicious and more cynical than those we have yet seen. Sharks and opportunists will adopt ‘caring, sharing’ words to cover the real intentions. One example: Look at how new health data sets are being collated supposedly for the purpose of helping society tackle Covid-19, but actually represent power grabs and data monetisation. Beware also the new fashion for ‘data trusts’ which are already being eyed by some as a data land grab opportunity.</p> But also new opportunities <p>The existence of such threats makes Mydex’s work work even more important. We saw MUMU coming when we first launched 13 years ago. Everything we have done since has been designed to enable data sharing — to help MUMU happen in the realms of personal data — but only if it is safe and ethical, empowers citizens and ensures they realise the value of their own data. (That was our original slogan on formation: “helping individuals realise the value of their own&nbsp;data”.)</p><p>We’re getting closer to making it happen. With the work we have done for the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/03/06/what-are-smart-entitlements/">Scottish Government on its ‘Smart Entitlement’ strategy</a> we believe we have found a practical, doable way forward that achieves the goals of safety, efficiency and equity, and that helps unleash the full value of personal data for both individuals and the broader society and&nbsp;economy.</p><p>More on that&nbsp;soon.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">From OUOU to MUMU: why the real information age hasn’t even started yet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarzyna-mrowinska/">Katarzyna Kazimierczak-Mrowińska</a>, or Kasia to her friends and colleagues, is the COO of Authenteq. Not only does she oversee the day to day operations and operational functions of the business, but she’s also a new mom to two beautiful twins. We spoke to Kasia about juggling work and motherhood, what’s changed, and what she learned so far.<br></p>



<p></p>



 What led you to Authenteq and made you want to work in the KYC and identity verification space? 



<p>I worked indirectly with Authenteq through the company I worked with beforehand. I have a law degree but I never actively pursued any academic knowledge in the tech sector. I had been working in the tech industry for a few years, so when the GDPR passed in Europe and made <a href="https://authenteq.com/10-reasons-you-should-verify-identities/">privacy a much bigger topic to everyone</a>, I was able to get involved hands-on combing my skills.</p>



<p>The identity verification space has a lot to do with the law, new regulation and compliance, so for me, it was a way to build on the skills I already had and use my expertise, while continuing to learn. I’ve been able to watch as the law catches up, or tries to, to technology.</p>



 What do you like most about working at Authenteq? 



<p>It’s such an interesting industry and being a part of it as it evolves has been great. I have a lot of responsibilities, that are paired with a great level of autonomy to plan my own days and my schedule. Plus, the people at Authenteq are really incredible.&nbsp;</p>



 How would you describe the work culture at Authenteq? 



<p>I was always a fan of Scandinavian work culture and their seemingly perfect work-life balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authenteq was established in Iceland, which is arguably one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Iceland#:~:text=Iceland%20is%20arguably%20one%20of%20the%20world's%20most%20gender%2Dequal,pay%20gap%20index%20since%202009.">world’s most gender-equal countries</a> in the world. It was listed as the number one best place to work by The Economist’s women index in 2016, has been named the most feminist country in the world, and has been listed number one on the World Economic Forum gender pay gap index since 2009.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So having Scandinavian culture and women equality was the core of the culture, and we tried to translate that in the Berlin office as well. We are honest, transparent, and most importantly, we respect each other. Those are the most important principles within the team. Of course, a company is like a living body, it evolves and changes, people leave while new people join, so sometimes we struggle to keep that same level of culture, but I can say for sure that this is the best company I’ve ever worked with.&nbsp;</p>



 You are the mother of two beautiful twins. How did you manage your work while pregnant and what does your schedule look like today?&nbsp; 



<p>I was super supported when I was pregnant. My colleagues, many of whom I consider friends, brought me food, helped solve computer and software-related issues as I tried to work more from home. I left the office in August but continued working remotely, a few hours a day. I took September off and the twins were born in October.</p>



<p>The team has been as supportive of me coming back – that’s why I can efficiently juggle work and motherhood. Currently, I have set hours that align with my nanny’s schedule. It’s never an issue if I have to come in late or leave early, and meetings are scheduled around me, which is why I wanted fixed hours so that expectations could be set in both ways. It’s helpful for my teammates to know when I’ll be in and available and that it doesn’t change from week to week. The kids will be in Kita (Kindertagesstätte, or a nursery school for pre-school children) as of January so I’ll be back part-time as of February.&nbsp;</p>



 How do you balance motherhood and acting as the COO of a thriving startup in a fast-paced city?&nbsp; 



<p>A friend told me that if you work part-time, it will require the same amount of effort and energy as working full time, and I have found that to be helpful and true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have to be super focused at work because I know once I’m back at home with the kids, I can’t do any work until the babies are asleep. I also make sure I take time for myself. Every day I do some sort of sports or pilates. I took an online business course with <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/courses/core/">Harvard Business School</a> back in May so I would go from checking in at the office, back home to take care of the kids, put them to bed, exercise, and then study or do homework until midnight. It was crazy!</p>



 Has your leadership style changed since becoming a mother? 



<p>Now that I’m juggling more, I’m definitely more careful with my time. I plan better, attend fewer meetings, and I’m more organized in terms of my own agenda.&nbsp;</p>



 What’s been the most surprising thing about motherhood so far?&nbsp; 



<p>How patient I can be, and how little sleep I need to operate!</p>



 What are some tips or advice that you’d share with new moms going back to work after maternity leave?&nbsp; 



<p>Don’t try to be the best right away, just take your time and take time for yourself. No one is going to expect you to be operating at 100 percent as soon as you’re back, so don’t stress yourself out. Stress can have such negative impacts on your productivity and your mood, which is only going to make things harder at work, and harder at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would recommend taking fewer responsibilities at the beginning, starting with just one or two projects that you can manage on your own, with realistic deadlines. You’ll find your own rhythm as you ease back into your routine. It was really hard for me to focus the first four weeks after I had the twins, my mind was somewhere else, but slowly it got better and better. Never forget that work-life balance is key – that’s what makes juggling work and motherhood possible. Once you start building a family, your priorities will shift, and I promise you that you won’t regret a single day spent outside of the office to focus on them.&nbsp;<br></p>

					 <p>Trinsic makes verifiable credentials and <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) easy for developers to implement, so it is only fair we make it easy to conceptualize as well! The term “verifiable credentials” can seem a bit technical and overwhelming at first glance. But in reality, verifiable credentials are simpler than you think.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Start with what you know 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Let’s begin with the word “credential.” When we use the word credential, we are talking about any document, card, certificate, etc. that contains information about something. We use credentials every day, including driver’s licenses, passports, diplomas, insurance cards, medical test results, employee badges, and more.<br><br>All of these examples are physical, paper, or plastic credentials that you can hold in your hand. However, a credential becomes a verifiable credential once it is in a standard, digital format which you keep in your phone or the cloud. And that leads to our simple definition of verifiable credentials:</p> 
				 
				 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				Verifiable credentials are standardized, digital certificates that make it easy to share information online in a private and secure way.			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
				 
				 
					 <p>We say “standardized” because the way verifiable credentials should be built&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">has been standardized</a>&nbsp;by the internet’s leading standards body. That means there is a correct way to create a verifiable credential, and at Trinsic, we make it easy for you to do so.<br></p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The verifiable credential model 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>When it comes to using verifiable credentials, it important to know these three roles:<br><br></p>  Issuer: The issuer is the person or organization that creates the verifiable credential and gives (“issues”) it to a person, organization, or thing. (e.g., a DMV)  Holder: The holder is the person or organization that holds the verifiable credential in their digital wallet. (e.g., a person who receives a digital driver’s license from the DMV)  Verifier: The verifier is the person or organization that gets information shared with them. They can authenticate the information they receive instantaneously. (e.g., a security agent at the airport checking your license)  <p><br>Often called the “Trust Triangle,” the image below is a classic diagram used to help conceptualize the verifiable credential model.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>An important thing to note is that while the integrity of the information can be verified, the truthfulness of it cannot. So although the verifier needs to trust the source of the credential (ie., the issuer) it doesn’t need to contact the issuer directly in order to verify the information.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 The unique properties 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Verifiable credentials are unique from other kinds of digital documents because they are:<br><br></p>  Portable: With just a few clicks, you can send the credential online to anyone you please. You can also move wallets between different providers if you’d like.  Verifiable: The reason why they are called verifiable credentials is because they allow you to verify the following things: 1) who issued the credential, 2) who the credential was issued to, 3) if the information within the credential has been tampered with, and 4) whether the credential has been revoked.  Private: Through <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, you can pick and choose what information you want to share on a credential (you don’t have to share all of it).  Tamperproof: Verifiable credentials can’t be altered or forged.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Trinsic's role in all of this

<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has supported Self-Sovereign Identity technologies such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials for several years. Now, a number of companies have been selected to work with DHS on implementing digital versions of identity documents such as the Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). In this use case, the issuer of Verifiable Credentials is USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services), and the verifier is TSA (Transportation Security Administration).</p>
 
 
<p>The overall objective is to make use of SSI technologies in order to increase security and efficiency as well as user control and transparency. Another key parameter of the project is that all technical components must be interoperable and based on standardized interfaces.</p>

And it solves blockchain scalability, compliance and speed limitations – offering data compliance for both organizations and their stakeholders. A million graph vaults for a million customers – not one database or ledger block holding a million customer records.</p>
<p>We'll explain why intelligence-driven identity verification, sovereign identity ownership and compliant identity security built from the bottom up can offer enterprise the value-add they seek.</p>

 The GiD Report#121 — What we learned from the Big Tech antitrust hearing <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-120-how-persistent-identity-can-shape-better-online-communities-7ed6daaad889">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  What we learned from the antitrust hearing  Tiktok  Stuff happens   1. As everyone already knows by now, the big news of the week was the antitrust hearing in DC, attended by the Big 4 tech CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple. As is typical, these hearings are hardly conclusive. YouTube: House Judiciary<p>What’s atypical especially in our current political environment is to have something both sides can actually get together on and while they often came from different angles, there’s a general consensus that this conversation is super necessary.</p><p>And it’s the type of conversation that will help define competition, innovation, and even consumer preferences in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Let’s be clear. None of these companies are going anywhere. That was made readily apparent by <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-624bc8f7-fb1f-4c4e-9d39-5cf041af45a1.html">their earnings report the day after</a> (Google’s lackluster showing notwithstanding).</p><p>And frankly, they shouldn’t.</p><p>But this is certainly the beginning of a long term reorganization of a technological landscape. It might happen because of regulators taking bold action. It might happen because of consumers shifting their expectations and preferences. It might happen because of innovation emerging elsewhere. Whatever the case, it’s happening. It’s also necessary. We’ve learned plenty from this last cycle of Big Tech. We’ve gotten a lot out of it. And we’ve also learned some important lessons about the double edged sword that is progress.</p><p>So we also know we can do a little bit&nbsp;better.</p><p>Anyway, here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-e24f4690-028f-4f39-9ba3-af1019b33b54.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>House lawmakers aired an enormous array of grievances with the CEOs of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple Wednesday, throwing everything in their arsenal at four of the most powerful men in the world for six hours, Axios’ Kyle Daly&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Quick take: The antitrust hearing, which wandered far afield at times, didn’t nail a case that these companies are harmful monopolies. But the representatives succeeded in wringing some surprising admissions from the executives about how they wield their market power, providing ammunition for regulators now conducting investigations — and possibly a spur for Congress to strengthen antitrust law for the digital&nbsp;era.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook: Panel Democrats said the social network’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were plainly anticompetitive — that the company made the deals to stop Instagram from becoming a competitor to its main platform and WhatsApp from becoming a competitor to its messaging service. (CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook had no idea the two would become such juggernauts when it bought&nbsp;them.)</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>All the companies, subcommittee chair David Cicilline said, have become bottlenecks for distribution, using their chokehold over data to surveil potential competitors and their control over technologies to extend their&nbsp;power.</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/scoring-the-tech-ceos-the-informations-tech-briefing">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Perhaps the most damning episodes of the hearing involved disclosure of internal company emails that appeared to support the politicians’ contention that the big tech companies used their size to squash competitors. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who represents the Seattle area, said Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom confided in an investor that he was worried Facebook would go into “destroy mode” if Instagram didn’t sell. — Martin&nbsp;Peers</blockquote><p>Cool NYU guy Scott Galloway provided <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/fire-fawning">a preview of events that outlined the sheer size of the entities that we’re dealing with</a> while also providing (much better) hypothetical questions to grill our favorite tech&nbsp;bosses.</p><p>Check out these&nbsp;charts:</p><p>Likewise, new efforts to take on the titans has&nbsp;waned:</p><p>Of course, on the surface, it’s pretty clear that Tech has gotten monstrously Big, while crowding out new entrants with their sheer scale — sometimes underhandedly.</p><p>But maybe the positive slant is also just how much tech has transformed our economy and our lives in the last few decades — that seismic shift from the physical to the digital, data now overtaking Oil as the greatest modern value proposition.</p><p>To put it plainly, this is well and truly the tech&nbsp;era.</p><p>The difference here though — say, compared to a time when the biggest companies were sucking petroleum out of the ground is that tech is malleable. There are constraints in the physical world that govern how things are played. In the digital one, there’s a lot more room to define the rules of the&nbsp;game.</p><p>That’s what this next chapter will be all about. How do we rewrite those rules in a way that optimizes incentives and balances power for individuals and communities — from both a regulatory and platform perspective. And consumers will have choices to make as certain core values come to the&nbsp;fore.</p><p>The thing is, we’ve watched this movie&nbsp;before.</p><p>There were a lot of kings back in the day. Today, there are still some kings. But there’s also a lot more democracy.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/scoring-the-tech-ceos-the-informations-tech-briefing">Scoring the Tech CEOs: The Information’s Tech&nbsp;Briefing</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-marshals-a-right-leaning-army-of-allies-for-antitrust-fight-155d5760-86d4-4ce0-9cda-734dbc95e252.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Big Tech marshals a right-leaning army of allies for antitrust fight</a>  <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/fire-fawning">Fire &amp; Fawning | No Mercy / No&nbsp;Malice</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-boycotters-lobby-lawmakers-on-antitrust-4816702f-e9bc-41ae-a2c4-1201e65873cd.html">Scoop: Facebook boycotters lobby lawmakers on antitrust</a>  <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=3113&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 6: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and&nbsp;Google</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/house-antitrust-investigation-documents/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Secret documents from US antitrust probe reveal big tech’s plot to control or crush the competition — TechCrunch</a>   2.

			 What is Yoma? What is its purpose? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Globally, one out of five young people between the ages of 15-24 live in Africa and are largely underemployed or at worst, are unemployed. According to the African Development Bank, youth unemployment occurs at a rate that is more than twice of that for adults in most African countries. Many of these individuals are unable to secure jobs due to a lack of education, experience, and financial means. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of decent job opportunities that could use employees to their full potential in most African countries. Skills needed in Sub-Saharan Africa are shifting, and the region’s educational system is underprepared, resulting in a skills mismatch between the skills being acquired and those required by companies.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Our aim is to unlock the youth’s potential across the African continent and beyond by integrating privacy-preserving personalized learning pathways across the <a href="https://www.yoma.africa/">Yoma platform</a>. Yoma, a youthagency marketplace, aims to use AI to match youth with individualized learning pathways, impact tasks to positively contribute to their community, and jobs based on their aspirations and psychometric profile. Youth are incentivized to participate via a digital token that can be redeemed in a physical or intellectual marketplace. Each individual youth has a digital identity wallet that contains their engagement and certificates, thus building a digital CV that is verifiable through blockchain technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The Yoma marketplace brings together youth, NGOs/grassroots organizations, governmental youth agencies, social impact investors, corporate, SMEs, educational providers, and more. Yoma is supported by a strong group of collaborators such as <a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a>, <a href="https://www.didx.co.za/">DIDx</a>, <a href="https://rlabs.org/">Rlabs</a> and <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/">Cartedo</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A brief explainer video of Yoma can be found below.</p>

					 <p>The Yoma concept was relevant prior to the COVID-19 crisis but given the disproportionate impact on young people’s learning and employment, there is an even greater need for a solution like Yoma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the pathways into the Yoma platform was via a COVID-19 <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/project/8/covid-19-challenge">UNICEF innovation challenge</a> implemented by <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/sign_in">Cartedo</a>, an online design thinking platform. Users who completed the challenge were redirected to the Yoma platform to acquire their certificate of completion. This UNICEF innovation challenge aimed to support youth agency during the COVID-19 pandemic through critical soft-skill development and by identifying high potential individuals whose ideas could be supported and developed further. The core goals for the challenge were to: 1) Give youth a voice, 2) Provide access to credible information, 3) Drive awareness around COVID-19, 4) Develop critical soft skills and future-readiness, and 5) Enhance employability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge was well received with 85,000 youth showing interest, 35,000 starting the challenge, and 9,500 who completed the challenge. For all youth that completed the challenge, Yoma issued a verifiable credential as a proof of completion and as the first verifiable credential added to their verifiable, digital CV.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An explainer video of the UNICEF COVID-19 challenge can be found below.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What caused you to decide to use Trinsic's APIs in the backend of the platform? And what caused you to build on the Sovrin blockchain? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic provides a full-stack self-sovereign identity platform leveraged by Yoma. Yoma currently makes use of the cloud wallet and credentialing APIs to provide youth with digital identity wallets into which Yoma issues verifiable credentials to develop their verifiable, digital CVs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The speed of implementation required by Yoma made Trinsic a preferred choice as most of the hard work is already done and ready for consumption. Future iterations of the Yoma ToIP stack implementation will be focused on a blended approach where Trinsic and open-source SSI components will be made available to Yoma ecosystem partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We decided to develop on the Sovrin Network as it was purpose-built to solve the pressing problem of SSI. DIDx has a long history of working with Sovrin, and it was the obvious and preferred choice of technology for us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Yoma might spin up its own Indy network in the future, and ongoing analysis will contribute to our long-term strategy and decision-making. For the foreseeable future, Trinsic and the Sovrin Network are a part of our technology stack.</p>

					 <p>In addition to our success with the UNICEF COVID-19 challenge, Yoma recently won the joint <a href="https://toolkit-digitalisierung.de/en/smartdevelopmenthack/winners/">EU/BMZ #SmartDevelopmentHack</a> to accelerate the development and adoption of Yoma with <a href="https://www.atingi.org/">atingi</a> as an ecosystem partner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Future challenges are already planned and will soon launch on Yoma, spanning multiple countries with increased access to opportunities for youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Given the COVID-19 crisis, the concept and value of the Yoma platform is more relevant than ever, and implementation must be accelerated. Therefore, as part of the #SmartDevelopmentHack, the Yoma initiative has committed to reaching 1.5M youth within 24 months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(End of interview)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are an African youth interested in building your digital CV through the Yoma platform, <a href="https://app.yoma.africa/auth/create-account">get started</a> by creating a Yoma account.

<p>When e-cigarettes first hit the market, they were touted as a less nicotine intensive alternative to cigarettes and as a way to help those struggling to quit to make the leap. As with any new popular innovation, opportunist players entered the field, bringing along with them counterfeit products and youth-targeted marketing tactics. <br><br>According to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44295336">BBC and Euromonitor</a>, the number of vapers increased from seven million in 2011 to 41 million by 2018. They project that this number will grow to 55 million globally by next year. As the world leader in the tobacco sector, every major tobacco company utilizes <a href="https://www.hauni.com/de/home/">Hauni</a> equipment, and as they watched the market’s exponential growth materialize before their eyes, they chose to use their position within the industry to push for stricter guidelines and safer products to protect minors.</p>



 Hauni for consumer safety 



<p>The Hauni Vaping Technologies team saw a few key issues happening in the space, including the refilling of pods with illegal liquids, the use of flavors that appealed to younger people, and the teen vaping epidemic in the US. Dangerous open tank systems and faulty devices were the cause of over 2,000 hospitalizations last year, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>



<p>“The industry’s big players are serious about consumer safety but because it’s a regulated product, it’s difficult to solve the problem,” says Dr. Joseph Capone, the Digital Program Manager. “We said ‘Look, if we’re going to do e-cigarettes then we’re going to do right.’ That’s when we reached out to Authenteq about integrating into the app, to give users the ability to not only control their vaping experience but also to give us the ability to secure the whole experience.”</p>



 Nicotine industry, innovation, and age verification 



<p>Nicotine is classified as a tobacco substance meaning that e-cigarette manufacturers have to go through the whole battery of tests, both lengthy and expensive, that pharmaceutical companies do because nicotine is technically a pharmaceutical product.</p>



<blockquote><p>“That’s one reason why there’s been little innovation in the sector since 2014. The products on the market today are pretty much all the same because they base themselves on an approved product. It’s very difficult to get approval for a new product and it’s very expensive bringing this kind of product to market because you need approval in every country.” </p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>In addition to building an automatable, fully digital, and less harmful product, the Vaping Technologies team has been leveraging data to create in-depth profiles. They analyze 40 different data points per puff. Some of these data points, including preheat time, energy time, and total voltage are designed to enhance the user’s vaping experience. Other data points like pressure and puff duration are crucial to restricting minors from using the products. A female, or younger user, inhales less deeply than a heavy smoker or a healthy man, according to their data. By comparing and analyzing these different interdependent data points, unique user profiles are created as are generational unique profiles.</p>



<p>“Teenagers are really smoking because they think it’s cool, not because they need a nicotine hit,” says Capone. “Teenagers vape much differently than somebody who was a smoker and has switched to vaping. They are doing what is called grazing. Their puff count or frequency is very high, and the puff volume is very small.”</p>



<p>“A smoker who has switched and is an adult will puff five to seven seconds, take a 30-second break, and then take another five to seven second inhale,” he continues. “This puff topography is very unique to each person but also unique for different segments. Of course, it’s all statistical but if we’re 92 percent accurate, it’s better to turn off a device when we suspect it’s a teenager then to allow a teenager to vape.”</p>



 Leading the change to protect minors 



<p>The legislation that has been enacted thus far focuses solely on the purchasing of e-cigarettes, but Capone and his team think that usage must be monitored and legislated in order to truly protect minors. As more consumers look to purchase these devices online, imbuing age, and identity at the very beginning of the process is the only way to ensure this. <a href="https://authenteq.com/authenteq-identity-verification/">Authenteq’s age and identity verification</a> are integrated into their app for precisely this reason, meaning that a user must verify themselves before a device can even be activated. Once verified, if the device usage deviates from the user’s profile, a spot ID check is mandated. If the identity does not match the ID used to activate the device, it is disabled.</p>



<p>Authenteq and Hauni’s Vaping Technologies team are also looking at further protection measures, including the possibility of incorporating lip imprints into the user profile.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“A lip print is just like a fingerprint. It’s unique to every person and it never changes throughout your entire life. If we could manage to map a groove pattern, a lip signature could be created so that only that person who activates it can ever use it.” </p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>Capone sees the progress they’ve made as applicable to other industries as well. The technology they’ve built is not exclusive to vaping liquids and could be implemented for asthma inhalers and CBD or THC devices used for therapeutic purposes. Identity verification can validate users, but also match users to the proper prescriptions. In addition to protecting minors and preventing misuse, there is also general risk mitigation in these methods.</p>



<blockquote><p>“A lot of organizations have no idea what is possible today in the areas of identity and age verification, they don’t realize what is possible with data now to identify early indicators of substance abuse or addiction. The whole vice sector needs more information about technologies that are available.”</p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>MITRE recently published the detailed results of their second round of tests. This test pitted APT29 malware and methods against <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/evaluations.html?round=APT29" title="Cybersecurity Vendors">21 cybersecurity vendors</a>. The MITRE testing is an excellent benchmark for comprehensively exercising Endpoint Protection (EPP) and Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) tools in real-world scenarios where organizations find themselves under attack by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). MITRE describes the environments, methodology, and operation flow of their testing regime in great detail <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/APT29/" title="Mitre testing regime">here</a>. The raw results are available for review, and they have created a <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/data_analysis_tool.html" title="data analysis">tool to help with data analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the participating vendors have analyzed and posted their interpretations of this latest round of testing. In general, each vendor’s internal analysis tends to focus on their areas in which they do well. In this article, we will call out the most serious of the commonly missed detections of specific procedures in the framework.</p>
<p>There was a wide range in the success rates experienced by vendors, with higher success rates equating to low values for missed detections. As expected, there is a fairly strong correlation between a vendor’s product having specific techniques for detection of procedures and steps in the ATT&amp;CK framework and catching a would-be malicious actor utilizing those actions.</p>
<p>The ATT&amp;CK framework features a matrix of 11 tactics and 171 techniques that adversaries use to conduct a cyber-attack. MITRE has just released an <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/" title="MITRE update">updated version</a> of the ATT&amp;CK framework which contains sub-techniques. The techniques and sub-techniques depicted generally relate to application or system level API and/or procedure calls. Legitimate software including operating systems use these API and system calls to accomplish tasks on behalf of users. This is what makes the job of anti-malware and other security tools difficult: they must distinguish the “intent” of the calling code. For example, encrypting files is most often a legitimate operation to protect data. However, ransomware also attempts to encrypt files. How does anti-malware decide to allow some operations to proceed and stop others?</p>
 What is the code’s intent? 
<p>Intent can be discerned by context. Context can be probabilistically inferred by looking at the calling process: which user account launched it, how long has it been running, have other processes injected it, what other calls precede or follow it in the queue, etc. Security vendors build detection models using analysis of code and memory enhanced by Machine Learning (ML) to make these kinds of determinations. Security tools are also informed by collections of threat intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).</p>
<p>The following list of techniques are those which many vendor products were not able to detect in the latest round of MITRE testing, and those which we consider the most consequential if exploited.</p>
 Missed detections 
 
 Sandbox evasion techniques such as checking BIOS, manufacturer, model, version 
 Attempts to use PowerShell to get system, domain, logged-on username, running processes, anti-malware presence, and endpoint firewall status 
 Reconnaissance of lateral assets using PowerShell 
 Manipulation of access token for PowerShell 
 Enumerating files in directories commonly used for user data; enumerating media files 
 Enumerating registry keys 
 Capturing screenshots and clipboard contents (lesser instances of keylogging) 
 Decryption of Chrome browser username and password databases 
 Creation of pre-exfiltration staging directories 
 Simple attempts to encrypt C2 traffic using standard crypto techniques 
 Reading user files, while connected to C2 
 Encryption of user data files 
 Exfiltration over non-standard TCP ports 
 Exfiltration over HTTPS 
 Establishment of persistence via javavmtsup 
 
 Recommendations for vendors 
<p>Threat actors are constantly improving and adapting to innovations in security products. Thus, security products with deficiencies in detecting items on the preceding list should focus on:</p>
 
 Anti-evasion: malware detonation sandboxes are standard features in EPP and NDR products, but they can’t help if malware is designed to lay dormant if it can figure out that it’s in a sandbox. Sandbox evasion used to be limited to the most sophisticated malware, but it has become more of a commodity feature. 
 PowerShell scrutiny: PowerShell is a powerful and useful tool, as its name implies. However, given the massive proliferation of file-less malware that uses PowerShell (as a means to avoid detection by signature-based and static file scanners), security solutions must scrutinize every invocation by pulling more context for deeper examination. 
 Recon and lateral movement: APT actors learned to go low and slow to avoid setting off SIEM alerts. Extending data retention periods can make it easier to group what may seem to be outliers into suspicious incidents. For example, seemingly random enumeration requests over long periods may point to a concerted effort to map resources. 
 Secure the browser username/password database. Users often rely on browsers for generating, storing, and protecting credentials. Besides data exfiltration by APTs, insecure browser password databases can lead to Account Takeovers (ATOs) for users’ personal information. 
 Stop staging: Users don’t often move and rename data files, then package it all up to be sent elsewhere. 
 Lock down comms: Applications sending traffic on non-standard ports and/or to suspicious IPs should send up red flags, even if the traffic volume is very low. Continuously updated high quality threat intelligence can mitigate this risk. 
 Encryption scrutiny: Ransomware is still rampant. While many garden varieties can be interdicted by most security tools, ransomware authors are also evolving their tools to defeat ransomware protection. For example, some ransomware groups use APT tactics of making an initial silent compromise, surveying enterprise assets, staging the malicious payloads in various places around the target environment, then simultaneously detonating them to limit the effectiveness of anti-ransomware prevention and detection techniques. Some security tools need to view ransomware in the same way as APTs and combine detection and prevention methods to help at-risk clients. 
 
<p>The good news is that several endpoint and network security vendors did very well in this run of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluation. We have noted this in our latest research: <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response/" title="Market Compass Endpoint Protection">Market Compass Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response</a>. While the MITRE test is significant in that it covers EPP and EDR, it is only a single test. There are other independent test regimes that should be considered when evaluating endpoint security solutions. If your organization is considering upgrading or replacing EPP or EDR, or adding Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), KuppingerCole can assist with reviewing your requirements and crafting an RFP based on our up-to-date research. Also, for cybersecurity vendors that need help in prioritizing their product or service roadmaps, we can provide tailored advisory services as well.
