<p>Q3 was another exciting and busy quarter with updates on our technology, new features, and partnerships. In case you missed the news, we’ll go over the Q3 highlights and plans for Q4.</p> Q3 Highlights  1. Web3 ID: Launch and Auth0 Integration <p></p><p>Web3 ID Launch</p><p>We launched Web3 ID, a blockchain-based authentication and authorization system that puts user privacy first. Web3 ID allows organizations to request user data in a privacy-preserving way that users can trust while leveraging the security of cryptography. Developers can build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and authenticate people securely with Web3 ID. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/web3-identity/">Learn more here</a>.</p><p>Web3 ID Available on the Auth0 Marketplace</p><p>We established a partnership with Auth0, a big player in the Web2 OAuth and authentication space. The Auth0 Marketplace is a catalog of trusted technology integrations to extend the functionality of Auth0’s customer identity management platform. This collaboration allows us to expand our reach, get us in front of more developers, and integrate privacy into authentication and login use cases.</p><p>“It has been really exciting to work with Dock on a newly-built partner integration for Auth0 Marketplace. This best-in-class solution adds an integral layer to our platform that provides our customers with greater choice and flexibility,” said Cassio Sampaio, SVP of product at Auth0. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-web3-id-now-available-on-auth0-marketplace/">Learn more here</a>.</p> 2. SEVENmile in Australia Issues Fraud-Proof Verifiable Certificates Using Dock <p></p><p>SEVENmile is an experiential learning program in Australia that helps high-school students learn real-world skills. They are using Dock to issue fraud-proof certificates which allow students to prove their skills throughout their lives and ensure immediate trust with employers.</p><p>Check out:</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3Gk2AR8ga64">Why SEVENmile chose to use Dock</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZAd2F2aos20">Identi3 podcast with Greg Twemlow, SEVENmile's CEO</a>  <a href="https://blog.dock.io/sevenmile-press-release/">Details of the collaboration</a>   3. Dock Wallet: Multikey Support for DIDs, DID Management From the Wallet, &nbsp;and Verification Flow <p></p><p>Dock DIDs Support Multiple Key Pairs</p><p>Before, users could only have one set of key pairs (public and private key) with their DID (decentralized identifier). This meant that they had to use the same key for all purposes whether they wanted to present a credential to prove their age, log in to a website, or show one of their certifications, which is very limiting. By enabling multiple key pairs associated with a DID, people can use different keys for a variety of relationships and purposes. Having multiple key pairs also increases security by helping prevent data correlation. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dids-multikey-support/">Learn more here</a>. </p><p>DID Management From the Dock Wallet</p><p>People can manage their DIDs within the Dock Wallet where they can import, export, edit, and delete DIDs. We support two different DID standards: did:dock and did:key. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-wallet-did-management/">Learn more here</a>. </p><p>Verification Flow</p><p>We’re creating a process that allows people to choose which credential they want to show a verifier. We’ll send an update when you can try this out yourself.</p> 4. ETH Bridge Testnet <p>We launched the Proof of Work testnet but because Ethereum has transitioned to a Proof of Stake blockchain with their merge in September, we’re currently working on the security audit and getting the updated testnet out. Our goal is to launch the mainnet in Q1 2023.</p> 5. Circom Language Integration <p>Before this language integration, verifiers would only be able to request limited types of information like age, income, employee status, certification, and so on. They would not be able to make more detailed data requests like if criteria has to be more or less than a certain amount. But the Circom Language Integration enables verifiers to be able to make more complex requests like:</p>  To be eligible for this bank loan, the person’s total income from their monthly payslips is more than $50,000 a year  Looking for blood donations for all types except AB- and O-  <p>The actual data details wouldn’t be shared with the verifier and all the verifier would see is that the claim is valid because of the cryptographic proof. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/circom-language-integration/">Learn more here</a>.</p> 6. Dock Joins the Decentralized Identity Foundation <p>Dock is an Associate Member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation. As a company that complies with internationally-recognized technology standards, we are always keeping up to date with key discussions and updates in the industry which is why we joined the Decentralized Identity Foundation. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/decentralized-identity-foundation/">Learn more here</a>.</p> 7. New Look For the Roadmap Page <p>We’ve updated our <a href="https://www.dock.io/roadmap">Roadmap format</a> to make it easier for you to track our progress and learn more about the specific milestones.</p> 8. Community Highlights   We’ve reached over 5,000 followers on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/docknetwork">CoinMarketCap</a>  We reached over 7000 followers on Discord  We added 6000 more followers on our Twitter  $3000 worth of $DOCK was distributed to the winners of Dock’s contests and giveaways   Q4 Plans  1. Partnership With BurstIQ <p>BurstIQ has implemented Dock’s technology in order to turn any health data into a Verifiable Credential that is portable and secure while enabling their customers to respect users’ data privacy and data ownership rights.</p><p>“We’ve looked at a lot of the systems that allow you to issue DIDs and VCs and generally what we’ve found is that Dock is far easier to use than many of the existing tools out there. It can deploy very quickly and it will be very easy for our developers to use the tool,” said Amber Hartley, BurstIQ’s Chief Strategy Officer.</p><p>Check out:</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Hh9kq29bPSA">Why BurstIQ chose Dock</a>  The <a href="https://youtu.be/jyjmrS1gQCw">podcast with Dr. Wendy Charles</a>, BurstIQ’s Chief Scientific Officer about blockchain in healthcare  <a href="https://blog.dock.io/burstiq-implements-verifiable-credential-technology/">Details of the partnership</a>   2. Credential Builder In Dock Certs <p>This tool allows issuers to customize what their credentials look like by adding their own logo, pictures, colors, and other elements they prefer.</p> 3. Wallet: White Label <p>Many customers don’t want to build their own wallets and would rather have their own brand while simply using the functionality of the Dock Wallet. That’s why we’re offering a white labeling solution for organizations to be able to offer their own branded wallet to their customers.</p> 4. Wallet to Wallet Verification Through the Relay Service <p>This update will allow verifiers and holders to securely request and present data from their phones. Let’s say a bouncer has a wallet app on his phone to verify that anyone entering the club is at least 18 years old. This is how the verification process would work in a matter of seconds:</p>  The bouncer pulls up a QR code that requests age verification  The customer uses their Dock Wallet to scan the QR code and is prompted with a message request to choose a credential that proves that she is at least 18 years old  The customer chooses a credential like her driver’s license and the proof is sent to the bouncer through our Relay Service (like a messaging service)  The bouncer’s app shows that the credential is authentic   5. EVM to Blockchain Communication <p>While we’ve had EVM support for a long time, the smart contracts didn’t have direct access to the data that was on the Dock blockchain. Now we’ve added the ability for the smart contracts to access the actual data on the blockchain which makes the utility of our smart contracts much more powerful.</p> 6. Dock Certs and Wallet: Anonymous Credentials and Delegatable Credentials <p></p><p>Anonymous Credentials</p><p>Anonymous credentials allow people to prove something about themselves without revealing the details. For example, anonymous credentials allow you to prove that you live in a particular city in order to be eligible to access a government service without revealing specific details like your address. Bringing this functionality to the Dock Wallet and Dock Certs will improve functionality and make them much more powerful.</p><p>Delegatable Credentials</p><p>Delegatable credentials allow credential issuers to give other parties the authority (delegate) to issue Verifiable Credentials. We are working on bringing this functionality to Dock Certs and the Dock Wallet. </p><p>For example, if there is a law that says workers need to have a specific certification to operate heavy machinery, the government will not issue the certification themselves. Instead, they will outsource private testing and credential issuance to people who need the certification. In this case, the government would issue a delegatable credential to each testing center to give them the authority to issue licenses to operate heavy machinery on behalf of the government.</p> Connect With Us <p>We’d love to hear from you if you have any questions, feedback, or would like a demo of our tech.

So, let’s dive straight into it without further&nbsp;ado.</p> FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried Proposes Crypto Regulations <p>Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX published a document highlighting the importance of regulatory oversight and customer protection.</p><p>He proposed crypto regulation using blacklists or blocklists, where individuals may freely trade unless sanctioned, instead of whitelists or allowlists.</p><p>“We need fast, reliable lists of addresses associated with illicit finance,” he said. “But peer-to-peer transfers should generally be free as long as they’re not going to sanctioned actors.”</p><p>According to him, allowlists would be a massive burden on commerce and innovation, whereas greenlighting all transfers would be like inviting financial criminals on an all-you-can-do-crime buffet.</p><p>Surprisingly, Bankman-Fried’s proposal was criticized heavily on Crypto Twitter (CT), which saw his call for governing decentralized protocols under the Bank Secrecy Act as the most concerning aspect of the proposal.</p><p>Sensing the growing unease among the crypto fraternity, the crypto billionaire took to Twitter to calm the waters, saying, “I’ve revised my post some already and will continue to do&nbsp;so.”</p> South Africa Regulating Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>South Africa’s financial watchdog, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), has classified cryptocurrency assets as financial products, enabling them to be regulated.</p><p>In a brief notice posted in the government gazette, the watchdog said crypto assets must be regulated in South Africa from the publication date.</p><p>These planning regulations include applying foreign exchange controls and a licensing regime for crypto trading companies. As such, to operate legally in the country, crypto financial companies must apply for a license between June 1 and November 20,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>The declaration will help enable authorities to tackle scams and protect customers, as well as help South Africa, avoid being greylisted by global watchdog the FATF, said the regulator’s head Unathi&nbsp;Kamlana.</p> Portugal to Start Taxing Crypto&nbsp;Gains <p>Portugal plans to tax crypto gains on purchases held for less than a year. Long considered a crypto tax haven, this is a significant policy shift for Europe’s crypto-friendly nation.</p><p>Currently, crypto gains are not taxed in Portugal unless they come from business activities. But the country is proposing a new provision to its 2023 budget that would tax gains on crypto holdings held for less than 365 days at a rate of 28%. This also means cryptos held for longer than a year will continue to be exempt from&nbsp;taxes.</p><p>Moreover, the State Budget also proposes a 4% taxation fee on free crypto transfers in cases of inheritance, as well as stamp duties on commissions charged by intermediaries.</p><p>Now, the ball is in the Portuguese parliament’s court. It will decide whether the proposed crypto tax changes are enforced or&nbsp;not.</p> Cointelegraph Research Shows Growing Interest Among Professional Investors Towards&nbsp;Crypto <p>Contrary to popular belief that institutional interest in crypto assets is waning, the ground reality seems to show an altogether different picture, per the latest research report that Cointelegraph Research prepared in partnership with Shyft Network and&nbsp;others.</p><p>The report notes that with companies like Microstrategy and Tesla heavily invested in cryptocurrencies, the interest of institutional investors to join the Blockchain Ecosystem remains&nbsp;robust.</p><p>Moreover, the who’s who of the global banking industry, like JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Blackrock, Goldman Sachs, Bridgewater Associates, and DBS Bank, are acutely keen to carve a niche for themselves in the attractive Digital Assets&nbsp;market.</p><p>For instance, Blackrock, the largest global asset manager with assets worth $10 trillion, has announced its second blockchain exchange-traded fund amid skyrocketing demand for institutional-grade infrastructure in the blockchain world.</p><p>Statistically speaking, the percentage of institutional investors buying cryptocurrencies has grown by 22% from 2019 to&nbsp;2021.</p><p>The Institutional Demand for Cryptocurrencies: Global Survey 2022 report also notes that 43% of professional investors have already invested in crypto assets, and 19% plan to invest in them in the&nbsp;future.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! <p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope.

<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/prevent-vacation-rental-scam/">Holiday rental scams</a> are on the rise, isn’t it time the hospitality industry took some KYC lessons from financial services?</p>



<p>Renting apartments in the city, cottages in the country and boutique properties off the beaten track has never been easier, thanks to the increasing popularity of online marketplaces for holiday home rentals like VRBO or Airbnb.</p>



<p>Platforms like Airbnb offer a great way to discover communities and live among the locals, while enjoying the comfort and utilities of a house or apartment. With millions of properties available at the click of a button, booking a holiday home is simple, straightforward and incredibly convenient. The COVID-19 pandemic boosted the popularity of the holiday home rental market, as travelers opted for the privacy of vacation homes over heavily populated hotels.</p>



<p>For property owners, holiday rentals offer a high reward for a relatively low effort.</p>



<p>Little wonder then that the holiday home rental industry is projected <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/travel-tourism/vacation-rentals/worldwide">to be worth US$82.78 billion by the end of 2022</a>.</p>



<p>However, as is often the case, popularity comes with a price, and fraudsters have now turned to holiday rental companies as a new illicit business opportunity.</p>



<p><a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/consumer-alert-attorney-general-james-warns-new-yorkers-summer-rental-scams">“Scammers don’t take the summer off”</a> said New York Attorney General Letitia James earlier this year in a warning to property owners who rent out their holiday homes.</p>



 Scams continue to rise, due to lack of preventive measures. 



<p>The surge of holiday rental scams is not a surprise. In fact, the number of articles on how to avoid scams on Airbnb (among other platforms) have increased lately, indicating just how common those scams have become. Since this type of fraud can take many forms – from fake accommodation listings to fake websites – it is difficult to implement a completely foolproof set of actions to tackle holiday rental scams. However, a comprehensive KYC framework and user identification system is a great place to start. In fact, one of the simplest and most effective measures in tackling holiday rental scams are KYC checks.</p>



<p>While the larger online marketplaces may go that extra mile to try and guarantee the safety of its users, smaller platforms that focus on specific regions, or niche target markets, tend to have fewer screening and KYC mechanisms in place, which makes them prime targets for holiday rental scams. Other more general marketplaces and social media platforms that also feature home rental adverts and the ability to connect property owners with prospective holidaymakers rarely have adequate security measures, thereby putting the guests at risk.</p>



<p>On most platforms, it is currently quite easy to register under a false identity and pretend to be someone else. Also, as no document is required to verify ownership of a property, scammers will often take the details and images from legitimate adverts on one platform and replicate it on another.</p>



 Identify rental scams on the spot. 



<p>Holiday rental scams can be difficult to spot, and some travelers have learned this the hard way. In fact, scammers are only getting better and now know how to fly under the radar. From fake ads to dubious listings that give an inaccurate portrayal of the property and features, fraudsters now excel in crafting ingenious and elaborate scams. Nonetheless, property owners and consumers can protect themselves by following three warning signs to detect holiday rental scammers:</p>



  Wiring money outside of the listing platform transaction process: To remain undetected, fake property owners will often encourage you to wire money outside official channels, under false pretenses. You should always stick to the platforms’ dedicated payment solutions, as they guarantee secure payments and sometimes money-back guarantees. Paying with credit cards is often the best approach, because they allow the user to dispute unauthorized charges. No customer should ever pay in cash or make a wire transfer. For platforms, being able to deter these attacks by monitoring conversations and flagging specific keywords between realtors and customers may offer a certain form of protection. In addition, acting quickly whenever there’s a report of suspicious activity could benefit the customer, and avoid uncomfortable situations like being left stranded in a foreign country without accommodation, or even robbed.<br>  Verifying the listed property exists: In some cases, the listing is well crafted and difficult to pinpoint as a fake. When in doubt, the user should always conduct his own due diligence. Conducting a reverse search on property images or cross-checking against available information (name of the listing, name of the realtor, location, pictures, description, price compared to market price) to confirm the authenticity of the advert can save the prospective holidaymaker from having their holiday ruined by discovering their dream rental is not what they expected, or losing money to a fake listing, or even getting their personal data stolen.<br>Property listing platforms can conduct various property and identity checks to confirm the rental home is indeed owned by the person posting the advertisement.<br>  Reading reviews: It might seem silly, but customers do not always read reviews. In addition to them being an important source of information regarding the quality of a property and its hosts, reviews can also help to determine whether a listing is genuine or not. Properties with no reviews, or reviews that repeat similar phrases with poor grammatical syntax, are warning signs that should be taken into account. Vetting property owners through robust KYC checks can be instrumental in the fight against fake listings, as creating several accounts (once an account or listing is revealed to be fake) takes considerable time, effort and expenditure, thus making holiday rental scams less desirable and profitable.  



 Deterrence is key. 



<p>Identifying fraudsters in a reactive fashion is one thing but being able to deter them from conducting fraudulent activity in the first place is another. If common fraud patterns could be automatically flagged by listing platforms, this could actually help prevent holiday rental scams.</p>



<p>As an example, most banks now automatically alert their clients when a connection from an unknown IP address occurs in order to prevent fraud and theft. Although this could also prevent account takeovers and subsequent fraud in the holiday home rental industry, most platforms have not implemented this safeguard. Other technical indicators that could identify fraudulent activity include the use of a non-domestic phone number to register an account. A better screening and vetting process for both customers and realtors is much needed to efficiently combat fraudulent activities on rental services platforms.</p>



<p>Digital identity verification has been widely adopted by the regulated markets of banking and financial services, but it can also be used by online marketplaces for holiday home rentals.</p>







<p>This makes the onboarding process for online rental portals quick and easy almost anywhere your clients go. The user captures his ID document with the camera of his mobile phone and then performs a short video selfie. The AutoIdent solution automatically proofs the document genuineness and compares the user’s biometrics from the selfie taken with the picture from the ID document. AutoIdent then automatically processes the data and confirms its authenticity, completely streamlining the onboarding process.</p>



<p>Transparent, efficient and painless for the user, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> is an ID verification solution that can be integrated easily into a mobile app through SDK, a web flow or directly through the IDnow AutoIdent application. As AutoIdent is highly customizable, it allows property listing platforms to define the rules and patterns for alerts. Using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, IDnow guarantees users’ identities are thoroughly screened before using a service. Document verification of government-issued ID documents, biometric verification and liveness detection all ensure that holidaymakers and property owners can transact in confidence.</p>



<p>IDnow’s identity proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversions or the consumer experience. KYC has already tackled numerous issues in the banking industry, so why not in the accommodation and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">travel industry</a>?</p>

It rewards OCEAN for stakers who allocate liquidity to curate data asset with high data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).</p><p>In order to participate,<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0"> users must lock up their OCEAN to receive veOCEAN</a> and then allocate veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs) via our<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/data"> Data Farming&nbsp;portal</a>.</p><p>DF Round 7 (DF7) is DF/VE Alpha week 3. DF7 counting started 12:01am Thu Oct 13, 2022, and ended 12:01am Oct 20, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were available. Stakers can now claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>DF8 is DF/VE Alpha week 4. Counting started 12:01am Oct 20,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, and details on DF8 parameters.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As a staker, here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  Rewards are distributed on Ethereum mainnet. Click “Claim”, sign the tx, and collect your&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF8 Parameters <p>For DF8, there are no changes to the DF Rewards Formula or otherwise. Here are some key parameters.</p><p>DF8 is part of DF/VE Alpha. DF/VE Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>DF8 parameters are the same as DF1. The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included these parameters.</p><p>10K OCEAN is available. 50% is for passive rewards, and 50% for active. Passive rewards go to users who hold veOCEAN (locked OCEAN) during DF6. Additional active rewards go to users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p> 4. Conclusion <p>DF7 has completed. To claim rewards, go to<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF8 begins Oct 20. It ends Oct 27 at&nbsp;12:01am.</p><p>DF Beta starts on Oct 27, with up to 100K OCEAN weekly&nbsp;rewards.</p> Further Reading <p>The post<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Ocean Data Farming Series</a> collects together key articles, and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>, or<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> for project announcements.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Digital Trust Infrastructure is quickly becoming essential from an economic, political and security standpoint.</p>
<p>Much of the infrastructure today is controlled and owned by device OS providers such as Apple and Google.</p>
<p>It’s crucial that digital trust infrastructure providers can compete with the device OS providers.</p>
<p>To produce a level playing field, we must have open standards and open access to the infrastructure. This applies to both to Governments and Private Sector digital trust providers.</p>
<p>Some of the key topics covered during this episode with Drummond are:</p>
 
 Wallets vs Agents – their differences, their relationship and how agents will use more and more contextual intelligence to help you make decisions according to your preferences. 
 Can non-OS digital trust infrastructure providers compete with the device OS providers? (e.g., Apple owns the OS for mobile/desktops/tablets/smart watches) 
 Comparing DIDComm to NFC – if NFC really facilitates security and trust for close distance, do the combinations of digital wallets, digital agents and protocols (like DIDComm) do the same for trust at distance? 
 Trust Spanning Protocol –&nbsp;establishing authentic connections where both parties can authenticate each other (using the same hourglass model as TCP/IP). What are the architectural requirements for this protocol? And how can various protocols (e.g., DIDComm, KERI) converge into a trust spanning protocol? 
 What does DIDComm do better/different than other data exchange protocols? (such as OAuth2 and OpenID Connect) 
 Can the Trust over IP stack be used outside of Identity use cases? (e.g., payments, data sharing, social media) 
 Comparing SSI to Email – similarities in protocol design, asynchronous or synchronous UX, simplicity and generality.

 New IDnow whitepaper, ‘Identity crisis: The future of digital IDs in the UK’ explores how a historical hesitancy to adopt identity cards has informed the UK government’s unique approach to digital IDs. 



 



<p>The British public’s relationship with identity cards is complicated, to say the least… (read more about it in the ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/whitepaper-digital-ids-uk/">Identity crisis? The future of digital IDs in the UK</a>’ whitepaper)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although there are no plans to launch a digital ID card system per se, the UK government has released a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-alpha-version-2">Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> – a set of rules and standards designed to establish trust in digital identity products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If, as it is hoped, the Framework can go some way to encourage UK businesses to implement digital ID solutions, and more consumers to use them, it will boost the country’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-new-plans-to-help-build-trust-in-use-of-digital-identities">£149 billion digital economy</a> by enabling smoother, cheaper and more secure online transactions, and save businesses considerable time and money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But will the British public change the habits of a lifetime, and embrace digital identities and digital identity verification? The government and the Financial Conduct Authority are banking on it. Indeed, the very future of the UK economy depends on it.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The UK decided to go down a different route than much of Europe when it came to identity verification. An unfortunate consequence of this was that the means of identity verification, such as a driving license document, was simply not as secure or robust as national ID cards, especially biometric ‘smart cards’ that feature secure, contactless chips.</p> Lovro Persen, Director of Document Management and Fraud at IDnow </blockquote>



<p>“The Trust Framework will go some way to resolve some of the online fraud issues in the UK, but not totally. With more digital identity verification, the focus will then naturally shift to who exactly are the identity verification solution providers, and can they be trusted,” Persen added.</p>



 Changing of the guard: What’s in a name?&nbsp; 



<p>The pandemic, and especially the NHS COVID-19 app, which made it easier to verify a user’s vaccination status and identity, has appeared to have radically changed the British public’s opinion on digital identities and digital verification solutions. They are now more receptive, more familiar, and more curious about how such technology could work in other arenas. It has also made them more discerning. Indeed, as the British public increased their digital footprint and reliance on online services, so too did their expectation for quick, safe and secure onboarding processes. What was acceptable before the pandemic is now no longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that has remained unchanged in recent years – a lack of trust in how users’ data is being used, and a lack of trust in the privacy and security of the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By including “Trust” in the name of the Framework, it appears the UK government has finally recognized that trust (or rather a lack of it) has been a major and constant obstacle in the adoption of identity systems in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The obvious question, therefore, is how does the UK government plan on gaining it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/whitepaper-digital-ids-uk/">Identity crisis? The future of digital IDs in the UK</a>’ whitepaper, available to download now, answers this alongside other questions on the future of digital IDs and digital identity verification in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also explains how digital identity verification solutions can unlock valuable economic and societal opportunities, and help organizations meet strict security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversions or the consumer experience.&nbsp;</p>

   As companies pursue digital transformation to remain competitive, they become more dependent on IT services. This increases the potential business impact of mistakes, natural disasters, and cyber incidents. Business continuity planning, therefore, is a key element of digital transformation, and must cover business-critical data and applications.

 OIDC vs. SAML: What’s the Difference? 
<p>Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) vs. OpenID Connect (OIDC): It can be challenging to choose between the two and decide which is best for business.</p>
<p>Which is better: SAML or OIDC? Choosing between SAML or OIDC will depend on the use case. OIDC is better for more simple verification needs, whereas SAML is better for government or business uses because of the difference in security between the two protocols.</p>
 What Is an Authentication Protocol? 
<p>Security professionals discuss authentication broadly, addressing different approaches like biometrics and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA). However, some nitty-gritty technical details support authentication, including the protocols that support authentication.</p>
<p>With the growth of the world wide web and integrated applications, the necessity of strong <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a> protocols has become even more evident. Rather than expecting users to remember dozens, even hundreds, of passwords or PINs, new advances in authentication have sought to centralize identity verification without reducing overall security.</p>
<p>To support such an endeavor, new approaches and technologies have emerged, including the following:</p>
 
 Managed Identity Provider: Traditionally, identities are managed within the platform used–a Google ID for Google, Amazon for Amazon, etc. Security and UX specialists have quickly noticed that by leveraging more popular IDs, they can connect different platforms or applications under a single ID. 
 
<p>Thus, like many other services, the industry of Identity Management was born. Identity management providers (IdP) take over critical functions related to managing identities, including maintaining the uniqueness and security of a digital identity.</p>
 
 Federated Identity: Federated identity uses the concept of an <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-provider/">identity provider</a> to expand authentication across multiple applications. By signing into one provider (serving as the IdP), you can gain access to another application. If you’ve ever logged into Google to access another application, you’re familiar with federated identity. 
 Single Sign-On (SSO): SSO is a form of federated identity focused on a smaller context. While federated identity usually refers to authentication across multiple platforms or enterprises, SSO will apply to authentication within an enterprise (across all its internal applications and services). 
 
 How Does Federated Identity Work? 
<p>The user logs into the identity provider, who authenticates the user with whatever measures they employ (passwords, biometrics, MFA, etc.).</p>
<p>Once authenticated, the IdP securely sends authentication information. This might mean direct interaction with an SSO server for local SSO systems. For broader, federated public identity usually means passing information to the user’s browser that can be shared with a site or application.</p>
<p>The user’s browser passes the authentication material to the application, confirming that the user is authorized to access the system.</p>
 Tokens 
<p>Federated authentication doesn’t involve passing the actual credentials used to authenticate a user–this would provide too significant a security risk. Instead, these measures use “tokens,” or packets of data, that pass information between the authenticator (the IdP) and the application or platform.</p>
<p>Any discussion of SAML, OIDC, or other federated protocols, involves an understanding of the different forms of metadata that go into these tokens. “Metadata” is, as the name suggests, data about data. More precisely, metadata provides definitions and notations about a data object exchanged between different applications. The information can be parsed and transformed between apps, programming languages, or platforms.</p>
<p>Two languages discussed here include:</p>
 
 Extensible Markup Language (XML): As a markup language, XML contains rules for encoding and decoding parts of data so that they can be rendered readable by humans and machines. 
 
<p>Like HTML, XML wraps information in “tags” that define what that information is so that other applications can parse it. XML is relatively simple to implement and serves numerous purposes in web applications representing data structures, but it requires a dedicated parser.</p>
 
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON): JSON, similar to XML, seeks to render data objects into a format that can translate across applications. However, JSON is more lightweight than XML and bases its structure and syntax on JavaScript rather than HTML. The purpose of JSON is to provide data interchange that is language-independent. 
 
<p>All things being equal between the two, JSON is the more robust and flexible way to represent complex data objects. At the same time, XML is the more secure and comprehensive way to represent complex data structures.</p>
 What Is Security Access Markup Language (SAML)? 
<p>SAML is one of the older forms of federated identity and authentication. Released in 2005, SAML uses XML to pass information from an IdP to an application via the user’s browser.</p>
<p>Taking the authentication flow from above, we can modify it to reflect a SAML workflow:</p>
 
 A user attempts to access a webpage or app that requires authentication. Either the platform or the user decides to send a SAML request to an identity provider. 
 The user enters their authentication credentials to the IdP. The IdP verifies their identity. 
 Upon authentication, the IdP sends an encoded SAML assertion containing information about the user back to the app provider. This assertion is an XML document that will contain some basic parameters like the authentication issuer, the user ID, the time of authentication, and the provider. 
 The user is allowed into the provider’s application. 
 
<p>SAML assertions can carry a variety of data types and are often used for authentication and resource authorization.</p>
 What Is OpenID Connect (OIDC)? 
<p>Open ID Connect provides the same workflow as SAML, with some minor changes. Published in 2014, OIDC is the third generation of the OpenID technology built on the OAuth protocol–a system primarily used for authorization but one that’s been expanded to include authentication services under OICOIDCD.</p>
<p>Some of the primary differences between SAML and OICD are the tokens. OIDC uses JSON tokens for assertions rather than XML. JSON tokens are smaller and easier to process while less feature-rich than their XML counterparts.</p>
 What Are the Differences Between SAML and OIDC? 
<p>These technologies are remarkably similar for the end user in that they accomplish the same task. And while there are differences between JSON and XML tokens, those differences are becoming less pronounced (leaning in favor of JSON due to its lightweight and interoperability).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, these two protocols will be leveraged in distinct use cases:</p>
 
 SAML: SAML is typically used in cases where a user begins an authentication request (for example, when you select Google login to access another application). 
 
<p>Additionally, SAML is often used for authentication across different enterprise apps within an organization when a user logs into a central portal. Finally, as of this writing, more organizations in regulated industries will use SAML due to the security provided through XML.</p>
 
 OIDC: Providing cross-authentication across mobile applications usually rely on the flexibility of OIDC and JSON. Furthermore, communications between programs through APIs (where object information may move through several different languages and frameworks) will often use OIDC. 
 
 Support SAML and OIDC with 1Kosmos BlockID 
<p>Federated identities and SSO are a new and sometimes critical part of modern authentication. These technologies help reduce attack surfaces and streamline the user experience to reduce threats related to poor cyber hygiene and phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is still crucial that the core identity management and authentication provider is secure and supportive of an enterprise’s users and infrastructure. 1Kosmos is such a provider, deploying identity and authentication tools to tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow.

 hREA at a glance <p>Description: hREA, and ValueFlows, are fundamentally a system for capturing structured information, particularly about real world economic events (think transfers, production, etc.) and relationships. </p><p>It is about allowing a community, business, or network to see all the ways in which it is connected to itself and the larger world. It is about accounting for so many forms of unrecognized wealth, the “triple-bottom-line” and more. Instead of only the basic kind of financial accounting we’re used to, from hREA data you can produce those reports from the viewpoint of any agent in the network, do tracking and tracing through a supply chain, and more.</p>  GitHub link: https://github.com/h-REA/hREA  Demo: <a href="https://youtu.be/teiGQtQdThM">https://youtu.be/teiGQtQdThM</a>  Ecosystem Sessions: <a href="https://youtu.be/WsIut-gtCvQ">https://youtu.be/WsIut-gtCvQ</a>  Website: <a href="https://hrea.io">https://hrea.io</a> and <a href="https://docs.hrea.io">https://docs.hrea.io</a>  <p>We're excited to share our interview with the hREA development team. Enjoy the reading!</p> Why is hREA being built? <p>Existing frameworks of accounting are too narrow in scope, limited to purely financial values. This in turn reinforces negative environmental and economic consequences, due to all non-financial aspects being left out of the equation and over time this erodes the ‘resources-in-common’ that no one is tracking. In addition to these reasons there are simply better opportunities for businesses who use REA accounting to assist people across the whole business to have better and more intuitive access to detailed as well as high-level business information.</p> Why did they choose Holochain? <p>Without its own "native" token, Holochain networks are free to decide which forms of information and value they will recognise. REA provides one possible solution to the problem of interpreting and transmitting value between separate (yet interconnected) networks of people, by providing a common language to describe different types of resources that can be understood and acted upon by those further afield. Having the ‘realtime’ (signaling) affordances of Holochain, but also the offline-friendly affordances of eventual consistency, are both crucial to forming resilient economic networks. The always-on availability of data during network growth thanks to the self-healing / dynamic DHT is another important affordance.</p> How are they using Holochain? <p>Holochain is the backbone of hREA, as it facilitates all of the network processes, data storage, and data validation. Instead of providing just a barebones set of APIs as “Zome calls” (the native Holochain hApp API layer over websockets) hREA implements an abstraction over that layer and wraps it in a client-side GraphQL Client, that matches the ValueFlows GraphQL specification. This means that developers familiar (or not!) with GraphQL can use their skills or the excellent GraphQL documentation resources to access Holochain without yet knowing all the ins and outs of Holochain. Basically, hREA implements a really generic hApp that many different developers can download and plug in, and start developing their own custom user interface with. This prevents developers from having to learn the Rust language to work with Holochain, for many use cases, so the doors are open to a much wider audience!</p>hREA demo with Connor Turland - Major Milestone Release Can you tell a little about your experience developing on Holochain? <p>In hREA, there are a lot of different data structures, but each of them have similar needs in terms of their API methods, so for hREA there was a lot of effort to make generic utilities that could help ease other development. hREA is said by some to be one of the most complex known projects built on Holochain. The hREA team is pleased with the improvement of separation between the so-called ‘integrity’ and ‘coordination’ zomes, as it makes for a better user experience for the hREA end users, who will not need to face complex data migrations as regularly, during software updates. hREA has a large set of integration tests built with the Tryorama test suite provided by Holochain, where it has over 600 assertions! The suite offers a clear and confident perspective on the proper functioning of hREA’s execution on Holochain. hREA also benefits from the holochain provided nix-shell environments for developer environments, and for continuous integration testing and automated release flows.</p> How can I get involved? <p>hREA could really benefit from having some engaged community catalysts, who could bring together the growing community of developers, business and project leaders, investors, and freelancers who are all interested in hREA and ValueFlows. </p><p>There are lots of ways to get involved. As a developer, you can explore the technical documentation <a href="https://docs.hrea.io">https://docs.hrea.io</a>. As anyone else, check out <a href="https://hrea.io">https://hrea.io</a>. There is a link there to join our community Discord online chat and forum space, which is where you can introduce yourself, get to know folks, and ask any questions! You can also just email <a href="mailto:hello@hrea.io">hello@hrea.io</a> to find out more or get involved</p>

<p>How does learning work? A guide for employee training</p>
<p>From surveys on students <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/is-online-learning-worse-than-being-in-school-majority-of-teens-say-yes/2020/09">changing the way they were able to attend schools</a> in the pandemic to seeing if <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01810/full">handwriting is better than typing</a> for retaining information, there is much research on the best methods to impart and retain knowledge. For employers looking to stay competitive, continuous employee education is essential—but how best to deploy time and resources? We look at several of the most important factors.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is engagement and interaction. People need to feel engaged with the content to learn effectively, and this is why small games, quizzes, and question segments are often used in presentations or demonstrations: More participation leads to more investment in the topic and more learning.</p>
<p>Another hurdle is that our brains are wired to filter out and forget information that we are not using. Psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus shared his research for what he called <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120644">the forgetting curve</a> in 1880, which is that information not reinforced, used, or connected to some prior knowledge is quickly forgotten. Approximately 56 percent is lost after an hour, 66 percent after a day, and 75 percent after six days.</p>
<p>Learning as an adult</p>
<p>The way we learn also changes as we age. It’s not simply that the focus of life changes from absorbing knowledge at school to needing to work for a living; the way we interact with the information changes as well, and it is important to keep that in mind when looking at educational opportunities for your team. The term <a href="https://www.learnupon.com/blog/adult-learning-theory/">Adult Learning Theory</a> was coined in 1968 by Malcolm Knowles and is composed of&nbsp; four key principles:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The information needs to be usable now. Adults are busy, and new information that is not relevant to their lives or work in the short term is more likely to be forgotten.</p>
<p>2. Your team wants to be involved in the process of what they learn. It is important to make sure it is on their terms, at a time that works best in their schedule, and uses the most effective delivery method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Reasoning and solving problems is significantly better than memorization. Information that you work for and have some connection to will be easier to remember and use rather than one fact among many you’ve simply been told.</p>
<p>4. Adults likely already have experience – let them draw on that when learning. Associations are a great way to become accustomed to new information, saying one tool works well or is similar to something they already know about will create correlations that will stick in their brains easier than brand new tools they have no context for.</p>
<p>Individual research vs group training sessions</p>
<p>New information learned that helps your team achieve success is beneficial, but how that information is obtained can impact the organization more than you might think. Individual research and group training sessions both have pros and cons to consider when looking at the best way to bring your team up to speed.</p>
<p>Individual research is personally driven and relies on the motivation and skills of the employee conducting it. This can be good if the person has time and interest to dedicate to learning more about the subject or less than ideal if the person already has a full plate of projects and deadlines coming up. While this type of learning can be personally rewarding, usually free or inexpensive, and beneficial to both the individual and organization, it also is generally tied to that individual, making them the de facto “expert” in the area, and should they leave or be unavailable that knowledge is essentially lost.</p>
<p>Group training sessions tend to be led by an instructor that is an expert in the field they are presenting on, leading to tailored information and, most importantly, the ability to ask specific questions that your team cares about. An instructor is more costly, but your team is more likely to retain the knowledge imparted by the instructor’s expertise, as it will be calibrated to be relevant, and imparted in a group, thereby turning each team member into a resource for the others should one forget some of the details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio’s Workshops focus on providing the best education for your team</p>
<p>Indicio knows you have options when it comes to training your team, which is why every workshop we offer is customizable, focused on customer success, and allocates the time to focus on topics your team deems important. Every instructor we have is a professional in the field that works with this technology daily, so it is likely that any problem or question you might have will have been encountered before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interaction and engagement is the cornerstone of any training Indicio offers: We are not here to just present information and hope it sticks. The goal is to put the technology in your hands, have you play with it, find some new questions about it in the session, and leave you with not only a better understanding, but some ideas you’re excited about getting to try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While every workshop is customized to the needs of the individual team we do have a few that we see helping many people just starting out.</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/product/comprehensive-introduction-to-decentralized-identity-workshop/">Comprehensive Introduction to Decentralized Identity Workshop</a> – Designed to give your business or organization an in-depth, understanding of how decentralized identity works. You’ll create, issue, and verify a credential. Then we’ll show you how to design a proof of concept.</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/product/business-use-case-and-ecosystem-design-workshop/">Business Use Case and Ecosystem Design workshop</a> – This is ideal for those that have decided to implement verifiable credentials and want to get into the weeds of value proposition, use cases, and potential target customer demographics.</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/product/executive-education-ssi-workshop/">Executive Education SSI Workshop</a> – Written with a business audience in mind, this training focuses on understanding how SSI (decentralized identity) works, the pain points it solves for, the risks it mitigates, the use cases currently in deployment, and the opportunities that are created by being able to build Trusted Data Ecosystems (TDEs).</p>

<p>This article was contributed by Eden Yang, HRM at Ontology.</p><p>In the past year, Web3 has gradually entered the public vision and become familiar with everyone. When people mention Web3, the first reaction tends to be about sudden wealth, while the second reaction is about disruptive development. Indeed, the daily value fluctuation of this industry is far more than that of traditional industries, and the amount of money stolen by hackers from time to time is often among the top internet searches. The exciting and magnificent vision attracts many legends to join, among which one of the most famous is Elon Musk; Not only that, some of China’s big enterprises are also actively laying out a Web3 investment track or internal incubation. Many enterprises are excited to get a taste of the prospects yet to come. Web3 recruitment demand is also witnessing a massive surge, compared with the increasingly reduced positions and continually “graduated” Web2 industry, more young people are lapping it&nbsp;up.</p><p>Web3 is definitely one of the big trends for the future and worth betting on. When browsing major recruitment software, you will find that the industry’s high-paying positions are also particularly attractive, but relevant courses are rarely set up. There are few relevant learning opportunities that are available to interested parties. Then a question emerges, what are the talent requirements in the Web3 industry?</p><p>First, let’s talk about my understanding of Web3. Web3 is an era in which data ownership is attributed to individuals. Its underlying layer is blockchain technology and its constituent elements are NFTs. The economic system is established through DeFi and then paid by cryptocurrency, and autonomous organizations are formed through DAOs. Each of these is a niche, a disruption to the Web2 industry, and these are the paths that believers in Web3 have been building for&nbsp;years.</p><p>So, what type of candidates will be favored by a Web3 team? Take an example from one of the most common questions candidates will ask during an interview: Is the industry willing to hire someone with no industry experience?</p><p>The answer is yes, but only if the candidates are willing and able to learn. What is their will and&nbsp;ability?</p><p>For Web3, as a subversive concept, one of the biggest challenges is to digest and understand a large amount of information in a short period of time, so the willingness to learn quickly is particularly important. In addition, interest in language is inferior to actual use and participation, such as starting to use the MetaMask wallet, reading white papers, participating in an airdrop, finding and joining DAO organizations, listening to an AMA or Twitter Space, and paying attention to the industry KOLs, etc. Although this may seem like relatively entry-level behavior, it is far more reliable than just talking about going “all in&nbsp;Web3”;</p><p>Besides, in terms of capability, one of the major features of Web3 is openness. Many teams allow distributed office work, and under the characteristics of open source co-construction, everyone can be a contributor to the project. However, asynchronous working, the need to remain online for long hours, the communication with overseas teams, the technical understanding required by some non-technical positions and even understanding of contracts, and the intensity of continuous learning of new projects, often make some people flinch. Different from the process-oriented and standardized Web2 industry, Web3 insists on long periods of self discovery. After joining Web3, you may find that you know nothing and fall into self-doubt. But in fact, everyone is in the learning stage, so keep an optimistic and open mind, and communicate with industry members even&nbsp;more.</p><p>Capabilities like keeping an open and optimistic attitude towards this industry, and keeping a strong willingness to learn industry knowledge, as well as some ability in languages, should be sufficient to become a candidate to join the Web3 industry. This industry is in urgent need of talents who work with curiosity. I believe that in the near future, during the industry boom cycle, there will be more new technologies and opportunities in the public’s vision. Do not miss the opportunity to experience this boom and participate in the future construction of this industry.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more. Individuals can also seamlessly and quickly access Web3 through products such as ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-new-era-of-web3-requires-talents-how-to-stake-your-claim-8c620f4c889a">The New Era of Web3 Requires Talents, How to Stake Your Claim</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/">Orbit Enterprise Platform</a> is a set of No Code Self Sovereign Identity solutions that facilitates the storage, issuance and verification of verifiable credentials that are held and owned by end users in digital wallets.</p>
<p>Northern Block is currently focused on building use cases which are privacy-preserving, thus best suited for AnonCreds. For those interested, we wrote recently about our learnings from Aries, Indy and AnonCreds (<a href="https://northernblock.io/learnings-from-aries-indy-and-various-verifiable-credential-implementations/">here</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">AnonCreds specification</a> is being developed to address a privacy-preserving specific use case with participation from the community.</p>
<p>It allows us to use Zero-knowledge Proof (ZKP). In cryptography, the ZKP is a method by which an entity can prove that they know a certain value without disclosing the value itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AnonCred ZKP verifiable credentials provide capabilities that many see as important for digital identity use cases in particular, and verifiable data in general.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have implemented some of these capabilities into Orbit Enterprise. They include:</p>
 
 Restrictions – the ability for verifiers to restrict proofs to specific Schemas of CreDefs 
 Data Minimization – the ability to disclose only necessary claims to a verifier, while creating a Proposal or Proof Request 
 Compounding Proofs – the ability to combine multiple credentials into a single proof to present to a verifier without revealing any correlatable identifier 
 Predicate Proofs – the ability to reduce the sharing of PII by enclosing logical expressions, and potentially correlating data, especially dates (birth, credential issuance/expiry, etc.) 
 
<p>See a demonstration of these four privacy preserving proof methods in the video below.</p>

Unlike other biometric modalities such as fingerprints and voice, face recognition has the advantage that it requires very little user interaction. State-of-the-art face recognition can also detect and recognize faces at a distance with more than 99% accuracy and is getting progressively more advanced with&nbsp;time.</p><p>However, state-of-the-art face recognition is not yet perfect and is still subject to a variety of spoofing techniques such as wearing realistic face masks to impersonate others. These spoofing techniques are sometimes called presentation attacks (PAs). Such attacks are implemented to accomplish identity theft with detrimental impacts on individuals and societies.</p><p>To make matter worse, our faces are nowadays circulated publicly on the internet due to the use of social media. It is consequently very easy for hackers to find our faces and spoof face recognition system.</p><p>Hence, it is essential for face recognition systems to build the confidence that faces are not used by people other than their real owners. The technique for preventing spoofing is known as liveness detection. Here, we discuss different types of presentation attacks to face recognition and the countermeasure that is known as liveness detection — especially passive liveness detection — as well as its quality measurement and certification.</p> What is Liveness Detection? <p>For the use cases where customers are required to be present on-site, it is hard for a fraudster to fool face recognition systems since the systems are often accompanied by human operators. For example, it is extremely unlikely that someone wearing a face mask can go undetected through airport passenger screening. On the contrary, for use cases that are fully online such as online onboarding for e-commerce platforms, face recognition systems must determine whether presented faces come from ‘live’ persons, i.e., detecting the faces’ liveness.</p><p>In general, liveness detection is the mechanism to tell if the presented biometrics is real or fake by detecting signs of life. For faces, liveness detection techniques may require users to actively blink or perform specific sets of head movements whereas other techniques may passively detect liveness from users’ blood perfusion or light reflection. However, some attacks such as video playbacks can still show signs of life. Therefore, liveness detection must also identify if presented signs of life come from live persons at the point of&nbsp;capture.</p> Presentation Attack Techniques <p>Identity theft is now on the rise. For example, in the United States of America, 47% of Americans have reported experiencing financial identity theft in 2020 [3]. Cybercriminals are also getting more and more sophisticated at fooling face recognition systems, e.g., using deepfake techniques to impersonate other people. Sometimes, however, we do not even need advanced technology to fool a typical face recognition system with weak liveness detection, as demonstrated in the link&nbsp;below.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Sfhar1sGi7c">USAA Bank Spoofed!</a></p><p>A simple presentation attack demonstrated by BiometricsDebunked<br>(Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Sfhar1sGi7c">https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Sfhar1sGi7c</a>)</p><p>A technique for spoofing a biometric recognition system is called a presentation attack (PA). As mentioned above, a PA can be performed easily, e.g., by using paper with a face image printed by an inkjet printer or a video replay displayed on an iPad. PAs could also involve more sophisticated techniques such as using silicone or resin to produce realistic face&nbsp;masks.</p>2D masks from CASIA-FASD dataset&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/ZhangYuanhan-AI/CelebA-Spoof">GitHub</a>)<p>PAs can be classified into two types, namely 2D and 3D attacks. For example, 2D video replays on computer tablets are currently one of the most common attacks. Deepfake videos — which are becoming increasingly popular — can also be categorized as 2D&nbsp;attacks.</p>3D mask from <a href="https://real-f.jp">Real-f&nbsp;Co.</a><p>3D attacks are often more expensive and more difficult to perform. Face masks and sculptures made from silicone or resin are 3D methods that use depth or/and texture to fool face recognition systems.</p><p>PAs can also be further classified as static and dynamic. For example, print paper is a static PA that can be made dynamic by creating holes for the eyes and mouth of an attacker to artificially introduce signs of life by, e.g., blinking or showing micro-movements.</p> Types of Liveness Detection <p>Liveness detection, also known as presentation attack detection (PAD), can be categorized into 2 types, namely active and passive liveness detection.</p><p>Active Liveness Detection</p><p>Active liveness detection instructs a user to perform a specific set of facial movements in front of a camera, a screen and/or a sensor. These movements include:<br>Blinking,<br>— Smiling,<br>— Turning or tilting the head sideways or from side to side, and<br>— Looking and following a moving dot on the&nbsp;screen</p><p>In some active liveness detection algorithms, a set of movements are chosen at random from a larger pool to make a successful PA less&nbsp;likely.</p><p>Active liveness detection is often easier and cheaper to implement than passive liveness detection. However, requiring users to follow movement instructions degrades the user experience. The instructions also give clues to attackers about which facial movements need to be&nbsp;spoofed.</p><p>Passive Liveness Detection</p><p>Passive liveness detection does not require a user to perform any action while the program collects relevant facial data. It only relies on algorithms to identify facial artifacts as input, which can be either still images or short videos. This technique can be carried out by various methods, ranging from analyzing light reflection to analyzing skin texture or depth information of faces. This type of liveness detection is usually more expensive and more complex to implement than active liveness detection.</p><p>Moreover, passive liveness detection also gives a better user experience and takes a shorter time to perform. It also has the advantage of not giving any clue to attackers, making it potentially harder to&nbsp;spoof.</p> Passive Liveness Detection Techniques <p>In recent years, the fields of machine learning and deep learning have progressed considerably due to the development of high-performance computing, GPUs, and the increasing availability of high-quality data. This development has enabled precise and robust implementation of passive liveness detection, which sometimes has provided even better performance than the active counterparts. Below, we outline some of the state-of-the-art passive liveness techniques, which use different indicators and feature different advantages and disadvantages.</p> Light Reflection Technique <p>Using light reflection to analyze unique textual features on faces.<br>Pros: <br>— A user is not required to perform any specific movement.<br>Cons: <br>— The accuracy may decrease in environments with bright sunlight.<br>— The data-collection device must be held steadily.<br>— The technique may provide some clues to attackers.</p> Short Video Technique <p>Using short videos to sequentially analyze spatial information on faces. Temporal relationships between collected frames are taken into consideration.<br>Pros:<br> — A user is not required to perform any specific movement.<br>— Sequential information can enhance accuracy.<br>Cons:<br> — The technique is often computationally expensive.<br>— The process may take a considerable amount of time to capture videos.<br>— Low-light or noisy environments may degrade accuracy.</p> Still Image Technique <p>Using a collection of still images, where each image is analyzed independently. Temporal relationships are neglected.<br>Pros — · Low bandwidth requirement on the server.<br>· Good performance.<br>· Simple data collection and implementation.<br>· The technique does not require specialized client-side software or hardware.<br>Cons — · The technique often requires multiple still images to obtain sufficient accuracy.</p> 3D Scan Technique <p>Using specialized hardware to collect depth information on faces.<br>Pros:<br> — The dept information can enhance accuracy.<br>— Good performance.<br>— Low bandwidth requirement on the server.<br>Cons:<br> — The technique often requires client-side hardware such as an infrared&nbsp;camera.</p><p>As of 2022, there is no consensus on which technique is the best for implementing passive liveness detection in all use cases. In practice, the technique of choice depends on many factors, including the tradeoff between user experience and accuracy, available budget, and the environment where data collection takes&nbsp;place.</p> Evaluation and Certification of Liveness Detection <p>The performance of a biometric recognition system is usually expressed by its false acceptance rate and false rejection rate. Following the metrics that are standardized by ISO, these are known as Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER) and Bona fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER), respectively.</p><p>Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER) — i.e., a false negative rate — describes a proportion of presentation attacks that are incorrectly classified as bona fide presentations.</p>Error type: false negative.<p>Bona fide Presentation Classification Error Rate (BPCER) — i.e., a false positive rate — describes a proportion of bona fide presentations incorrectly classified as presentation attacks.</p>Error type: false positive.<p>Currently, the most widely accepted certification on liveness detection is provided by iBeta. iBeta is an independent laboratory that is accredited by National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) to test and certify PAD algorithms, following ISO/IEC 30107–3. Currently, there are two levels of iBeta certification:</p>  Level 1 requires BPCER of less than 15% and APCER of 0%. PAs for level 1 conformance testing includes high-quality photos and&nbsp;videos.  Level 2 requires APCER less than 1%. PAs for level 2 conformance testing includes latex masks, resin masks, inexpensive silicone masks, 3D animation software, and handmade masks from 2D&nbsp;photos.  <p>Although liveness detection is now an essential component for online identity verification, its cost is currently an order of magnitude higher than simple face recognition without liveness. More importantly, the rapid development of deepfake technology presents a looming threat to online transactions. Hence, enabling trust in the digital world requires research and development of novel liveness detection techniques that drive its cost down while keeping up with the deepfake.</p> References   D. E.

Modern applications use them to keep track of state between requests. Backend services use them to propagate authorization information in a microservice architecture.<br>
<br>
In spite of the popularity of JWTs, their security properties are often unknown or misunderstood. How do you choose the signature scheme for a JWT? What other properties should you verify before trusting a JWT? How do you handle key rotation and key management?<br>
<br>
The answers to these questions are crucial to ensure the security of the application's architecture. In this article, we go beyond the typical narrative of using JWTs. We look at the hard parts nobody ever talks about, including:<br>
&nbsp;</p>
 
 Symmetric JWT signatures 
 Asymmetric JWT signatures 
 JWT validation beyond signatures 
 Cryptographic key management

  <p>In 2013, GitHub released a search feature that allows users to scan code in all public repositories. A day after the release, however, they had to partially shut it down. It was speculated that the shutdown was because the feature allowed any user to search for all kinds of secrets stored in GitHub repositories. Later, in 2014, data on 50,000 Uber drivers was stolen. It seems someone got access to the company’s database using login credentials found in a GitHub public repository. Hashicorp Vault, a tool for managing secrets and encrypting data in transit, was first announced in 2015 and Spring Vault, the integration of Spring with Vault, was first released in 2017.</p>

<p>It seems like a long time ago, right? Secrets leakage seems to remain pervasive and constant, happening to all kinds of developers—as explained by <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/how-bad-can-it-git-characterizing-secret-leakage-in-public-github-repositories/">this study from NC State University</a>. Exposed secrets leads to cyber-attacks, data loss or corruption, sensitive data breaches, and crypto-jacking (cryptocurrency mining using a victim’s cloud computer power). With tools like Hashicorp’s Vault and Spring Cloud Vault, the risk can be reduced.</p>

<p>Nowadays it is widely recommended to never store secret values in code. Therefore, this tutorial will demonstrate the following alternatives:</p>

 
   Using environment variables for Spring Boot secrets 
   Secrets encryption with Spring Cloud Config 
   Secrets management with HashiCorp’s Vault

 Use environment variables for secrets; a precursor to Spring Vault 

<p>Spring Boot applications can bind property values from environment variables. To demonstrate, create a <code>vault-demo-app</code> with OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication, using the Spring Initializr. Then add <code>web</code>, <code>okta</code>, and <code>cloud-config-client</code> dependencies, some of which will be required later in the tutorial:</p>

   <code>https start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  bootVersion==2.7.4 \
  dependencies==web,okta,cloud-config-client \
  groupId==com.okta.developer \
  artifactId==vault-demo-app  \
  name=="Spring Boot Application" \
  description=="Demo project of a Spring Boot application with Vault protected secrets" \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.vault &gt; vault-demo-app.zip
</code>   

<p>Unzip the file and open the project. Modify its <code>src/main/java/.../Application.java</code> class to add the <code>/</code> HTTP endpoint:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.vault;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    String hello(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user) {
        return String.format("Welcome, %s", user.getFullName());
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Disable the cloud configuration for the first run. Edit <code>application.properties</code> and add the following value:</p>

   <code>spring.cloud.config.enabled=false
</code>   

 OpenID Connect authentication with Okta 

<p>In a command line session, go to the <code>vault-demo-app</code> root folder.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Instead of storing Okta credentials in <code>application.properties</code> as part of the project code, Spring Boot allows you to bind properties from environment variables. You can see this in action by starting your application with the Maven command below:</p>

   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuerURI} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientId} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={yourOktaClientSecret} \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>NOTE: Copy the values of <code>yourOktaIssuerURI</code>, <code>yourOktaClientId</code> and <code>yourOktaClientSecret</code> as you will need them for configuration in the next sections. You can also just keep at hand <code>yourOktaClientId</code> and retrieve the configuration with <code>okta apps config --app {yourOktaClientId}</code>.</p>

<p>In an incognito window, go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. Here, you should see the Okta login page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the application logs, you’ll see the security filter chain initializes an OAuth 2.0 authentication flow on startup:</p>

 <code>
2022-09-07 08:50:09.460  INFO 20676 --- [           main] o.s.s.web.DefaultSecurityFilterChain     : Will secure any request with<br> [org.springframework.security.web.session.DisableEncodeUrlFilter@6b4a4e40,<br> org.springframework.security.web.context.request.async.WebAsyncManagerIntegrationFilter@46a8c2b4,<br> org.springframework.security.web.context.SecurityContextPersistenceFilter@640d604,<br> org.springframework.security.web.header.HeaderWriterFilter@7b96de8d,<br> org.springframework.security.web.csrf.CsrfFilter@2a0b901c,<br> org.springframework.security.web.authentication.logout.LogoutFilter@38ac8968,<br> org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.OAuth2AuthorizationRequestRedirectFilter@7739aac4,<br> org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.OAuth2AuthorizationRequestRedirectFilter@36c07c75,<br> org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.OAuth2LoginAuthenticationFilter@353c6da1,<br> org.springframework.security.web.authentication.ui.DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter@7e61e25c,<br> org.springframework.security.web.authentication.ui.DefaultLogoutPageGeneratingFilter@4f664bee,<br> org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.web.BearerTokenAuthenticationFilter@21b51e59,<br> org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.RequestCacheAwareFilter@5438fa43,<br> org.springframework.security.web.servletapi.SecurityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter@512abf25,<br> org.springframework.security.web.authentication.AnonymousAuthenticationFilter@76563ae7,<br> org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.OAuth2AuthorizationCodeGrantFilter@3e14d390,<br> org.springframework.security.web.session.SessionManagementFilter@4dc52559,<br> org.springframework.security.web.access.ExceptionTranslationFilter@51ac12ac,<br> org.springframework.security.web.access.intercept.FilterSecurityInterceptor@2407a36c]
</code> 

<p>Using environment variables for passing secrets to containerized applications is now considered bad practice because the environment can be inspected or logged in a number of cases. So, let’s move on to using Spring Cloud Config server for secrets storage.</p>

 Use Auth0 for OpenID Connect 

<p>To use Auth0 as an OIDC provider, you need to add the <code>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</code> dependency, as the Okta Spring Boot Starter <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/issues/358">does not support Auth0</a> yet.</p>

<p>You can create a demo application with Spring Initializr too:</p>

   <code>https start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  bootVersion==2.7.4 \
  dependencies==web,oauth2-client,cloud-config-client \
  groupId==com.okta.developer \
  artifactId==vault-demo-app-auth0  \
  name=="Spring Boot Application" \
  description=="Demo project of a Spring Boot application with Vault protected secrets" \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.vault &gt; vault-demo-app-auth0.zip
</code>   

<p>Modify the <code>Application</code> class the same way as described in the previous section. Also set <code>spring.cloud.config.enabled=false</code> in <code>application.properties</code>.</p>

<p>Sign up at <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">Auth0</a> and install the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli">Auth0 CLI</a>. Then run:</p>

   <code>auth0 login
</code>   

<p>The terminal will display a device confirmation code and open a browser session to activate the device.</p>

<p>NOTE: My browser was not displaying anything, so I had to manually activate the device by opening the URL <code>https://auth0.auth0.com/activate?user_code={deviceCode}</code>.</p>

<p>On successful login, you will see the tenant, which you will use as issuer later:</p>

   <code>✪ Welcome to the Auth0 CLI 🎊

If you don't have an account, please create one here: https://auth0.com/signup.

Your device confirmation code is: KGFL-LNVB

 ▸    Press Enter to open the browser to log in or ^C to quit...

Waiting for the login to complete in the browser... ⣻Opening in existing browser session.
Waiting for the login to complete in the browser... done

 ▸    Successfully logged in.
 ▸    Tenant: dev-avup2laz.us.auth0.com
</code>   

<p>The next step is to create a client app:</p>

   <code>auth0 apps create
</code>   

<p>When prompted, choose the following options:</p>

 
   Name: <code>vault-demo-app-auth0</code>

<p>NOTE: The client secret is <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/issues/488">not displayed</a> in the CLI output for regular applications. You can run <code>auth0 apps open</code> to open a browser in the application configuration. Then copy the secret from the Settings tab. In the example above, the tenant is <code>dev-avup2laz.us.auth0.com</code>.</p>

<p>You can now run the demo app passing the oidc configuration through environment variables:</p>

   <code>SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_AUTH0_ISSUER_URI=https://{auth0Tenant}/ \
SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={auth0clientId} \

./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: You must leave the trailing slash <code>/</code> in the issuer URL.</p>

<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and you should be redirected to Auth0 to log in:</p>

 Spring Cloud Config with secrets encryption 

<p>In microservice architectures, managing configuration with a centralized config server is essential. Secret encryption is desirable at rest and when in transit. Spring Cloud Config Server is a popular implementation. Let’s configure the server to store encrypted secrets.</p>

<p>NOTE: To use encryption and decryption features in Java, you need the full-strength JCE installed in your JVM, which is included by default since JDK 9.</p>

<p>Using the Spring Initializr API, create a Vault + Config Server application:</p>

   <code>https start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  bootVersion==2.7.4 \
  dependencies==cloud-config-server \
  groupId==com.okta.developer \
  artifactId==vault-config-server  \
  name=="Spring Boot Configuration Server" \
  description=="Demo project of a Spring Boot application with Vault protected secrets" \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.vault &gt; vault-config-server.zip
</code>   

<p>Unzip the downloaded file. Rename <code>src/main/resource/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code>, edit the file to specify the port, add a <code>native</code> profile, and specify config search locations:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8888

spring:
  profiles:
    active: native
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>src/main/java/.../SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication.java</code> and add a <code>@EnableConfigServer</code> annotation:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.vault;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.config.server.EnableConfigServer;

@EnableConfigServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication.class, args);
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Start the server, as you are going to encrypt your Okta secrets using the <code>/encrypt</code> endpoint. For this example, you are using a symmetric (shared) encryption key, passed through the environment variable ENCRYPT_KEY. Before running the command below, you should replace <code>{encryptKey}</code> with a random string of characters. You can use JShell to generate a UUID to use for your encrypt key.</p>

   <code>jshell

UUID.randomUUID()
</code>   

   <code>ENCRYPT_KEY={encryptKey} ./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Then, in another terminal, encrypt your client ID and secret.</p>

   <code>http :8888/encrypt --raw {yourOktaClientId}
http :8888/encrypt --raw {yourOktaClientSecret}
</code>   

<p>In the <code>vault-config-server</code> project folder, create a <code>src/main/resources/config/vault-demo-app-dev.yml</code> file to store the secrets for the <code>dev</code> profile, with the following contents:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: {yourIssuerURI}
    clientId: '{cipher}encryptedClientId'
    clientSecret: '{cipher}encryptedClientSecret'
</code>   

<p>The <code>client-id</code> and <code>client-secret</code> encrypted values must be prefixed with <code>{cipher}</code>. Restart the config server.</p>

<p>To consume the config server properties, the client application must set the server address in the application configuration. In the <code>vault-demo-app</code> project, rename <code>application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and replace its contents with the following configuration:</p>

   <code>spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888
  config:
    import: "configserver:"
  application:
    name: vault-demo-app
  profiles:
    active: dev
</code>   

<p>Start <code>vault-demo-app</code> without passing the environment variables:</p>

   <code>./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>When requesting <code>http://localhost:8080</code> it should again redirect to the Okta login.</p>

<p>In a real environment, the config server should be secured. Spring Cloud Config Server supports asymmetric key encryption as well, with the server encrypting with the public key, and the clients decrypting with the private key. However, the documentation warns about spreading the key management process around clients.</p>

 Vault as a configuration backend with Spring Cloud Vault 

<p></p>

<p>In the cloud, secrets management has become much more difficult. Vault is a secrets management and data protection tool from HashiCorp that provides secure storage, dynamic secret generation, data encryption, and secret revocation.</p>

<p>Vault encrypts the secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage. The encryption key is also stored in Vault, but encrypted with a master key not stored anywhere. The master key is split into shards using <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/seal#shamir-seals">Shamir’s Secret Sharing algorithm</a>, and distributed among a number of operators. The Vault unseal process allows you to reconstruct the master key by adding shards one at a time in any order until enough shards are present, then Vault becomes operative. Operations on secrets can be audited by enabling audit devices, which will send audit logs to a file, syslog or socket.</p>

<p>As Spring Cloud Config Server supports Vault as a configuration backend, the next step is to better protect the application secrets by storing them in Vault. This configuration will be demonstrated with Okta as the OIDC provider. A similar approach can be used for Auth0 secrets.</p>

<p>Pull the Vault Docker image and start a container using the command below. Make sure to replace <code>{hostPath}</code> with a local directory path, such as <code>/tmp/vault</code>.</p>

   <code>docker pull vault
</code>   

   <code>docker run --cap-add=IPC_LOCK \
-e 'VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' \
-p 8200:8200 \
-v {hostPath}:/vault/logs \
--name my-vault vault
</code>   

<p>NOTE:  The <code>docker run</code> command above will start a vault instance with the name <code>my-vault</code>. You can stop the container with <code>docker stop my-vault</code> and restart it with <code>docker start my-vault</code>. Note that all the secrets and data will be lost between restarts, as explained in the next paragraphs.</p>

<p>The <code>IPC_LOCK</code> capability is required for Vault to be able to lock memory and not be swapped to disk, as this behavior is enabled by default. As the instance is run for development, the ID of the initially generated root token is set to the given value. You are mounting <code>/vault/logs</code>, as you are going to enable the <code>file</code> audit device to inspect the interactions.</p>

<p>Once it starts, you should notice the following logs:</p>

   <code>WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variable:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://0.0.0.0:8200'

The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: +xTAEzkjb3kurSBa7TxAQUjoyBpaprlXwn+ZnSpEkuw=
Root Token: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!
</code>   

<p>It is clear Vault is running in dev mode, meaning it short-circuits a lot of setup to insecure defaults, which helps for the experimentation. Data is stored encrypted in-memory and lost on every restart. Copy the Unseal Key, as you are going to use it to test Vault sealing.
Connect to the container and explore some <code>vault</code> commands:</p>

   <code>docker exec -it my-vault /bin/sh
</code>   

<p>The command above will start a shell session with the container. After the prompt shows, run the following three commands:</p>

   <code>export VAULT_TOKEN="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
export VAULT_ADDR="http://127.0.0.1:8200"
vault status
</code>   

<p>The <code>status</code> command output shows if the vault instance is sealed:</p>

   <code>Key             Value
---             -----
Seal Type       shamir
Initialized     true
Sealed          false
Total Shares    1
Threshold       1
Version         1.12.0
Build Date      2022-10-10T18:14:33Z
Storage Type    inmem
Cluster Name    vault-cluster-389dcb61
Cluster ID      cc063fcf-e1f2-2e75-6059-cd9117559f0d
HA Enabled      false
</code>   

<p>As you can see, in development mode Vault starts unsealed, meaning stored data can be decrypted/accessed.</p>

<p>Enable a file audit device to watch the interactions with Vault:</p>

   <code>vault audit enable file file_path=/vault/logs/vault_audit.log
</code>   

<p>You should see a success message. Now store the Okta secrets for the <code>vault-demo-app</code>:</p>

   <code>vault kv put secret/vault-demo-app,dev \
okta.oauth2.clientId="{yourOktaClientId}" \
okta.oauth2.clientSecret="{yourOktaClientSecret}" \
okta.oauth2.issuer="{yourOktaIssuerURI}"
</code>   
   <code>vault kv get secret/vault-demo-app,dev
</code>   

<p>As illustrated above, key-value pairs are stored with <code>kv put</code> command, and you can check the values with the <code>kv get</code> vault command.</p>

<p>Check <code>vault_audit.log</code> in your specified <code>{hostPath}</code> directory. Operations are logged in JSON format by default, with sensitive information hashed:</p>

      "remote_port":58914
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s assume you don’t want to configure the root token in the <code>vault-demo-app</code>. You can instead create a policy granting read permissions on the path where the secrets were stored. Go to the Vault Web UI at <code>http://localhost:8200</code> and log in with the root token (<code>00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000</code>).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, go to Policies and Create ACL policy. Create a <code>vault-demo-app-policy</code> with the following capabilities:</p>

   <code>path "secret/data/vault-demo-app" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}

path "secret/data/vault-demo-app,dev" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}

path "secret/data/application" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}

path "secret/data/application,dev" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}
</code>   

<p>All the paths above will be requested by the config server to provide configuration for the <code>vault-demo-app</code> when it starts with the <code>dev</code> profile active.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, go back to the container command line, and create a token with the <code>vault-demo-app-policy</code>.</p>

   <code>vault token create -policy=vault-demo-app-policy
</code>   

   <code>Key                  Value
---                  -----
token                hvs.CAESIKd9pYyc9xesiqmwvepdGiHlPEB53By...
token_accessor       2pzRXmGhxChobbMtqeM5zZzM
token_duration       768h
token_renewable      true
token_policies       ["default" "vault-demo-app-policy"]
identity_policies    []
policies             ["default" "vault-demo-app-policy"]
</code>   

<p>You are now ready to update the config server. In the <code>vault-config-server</code> project, edit <code>src/main/resource/application.yml</code> to add Vault as the config backend:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8888

spring:
  profiles:
    active: vault
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        vault:
          host: 127.0.0.1
          port: 8200
          kvVersion: 2
logging:
  level:
    org.springframework.web.client: TRACE
</code>   

<p>Note that the logging level is set to TRACE for the web client, to see the interaction between the server and Vault. Restart the <code>vault-config-server</code>.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>You should see the logs below if the server was configured correctly:</p>

   <code>2022-09-23 01:19:10.105  INFO 14072 --- [main] SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication:
 Started SpringBootConfigurationServerApplication in 4.525 seconds (JVM running for 4.859)
</code>   

<p>You will not see the config server trying to connect to Vault in the logs. That will happen when a config client requests the properties. Start the <code>vault-demo-app</code>, passing the token just created in the environment variable <code>SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_TOKEN</code>. For example:</p>

   <code>SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_TOKEN=hvs.CAESIKd9pYyc9xesiqmwvep... \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>When the <code>vault-demo-app</code> starts, it will request the configuration to the config server, which in turn will make REST requests to Vault. In the config server logs, with an increased logging level, you will be able to see those requests:</p>

   <code>2022-10-12 21:21:25.096 ...  : HTTP GET http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/secret/data/vault-demo-app,dev
2022-10-12 21:21:25.142 ...  : Accept=[application/json, application/*+json]
2022-10-12 21:21:25.183 ...  : Response 200 OK
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and verify that authentication with Okta works.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s seal Vault. Sealing allows you to lock Vault data to minimize damage when an intrusion is detected.  In the container command line, enter:</p>

   <code>vault operator seal
</code>   

<p>Restart <code>vault-demo-app</code> and verify the configuration will not be retrieved as Vault is sealed. The <code>vault-config-server</code> logs should read:</p>

   <code>503 Service Unavailable: "{"errors":["Vault is sealed"]}&lt;EOL&gt;"]
</code>   

<p>To unseal Vault, run:</p>

   <code>vault operator unseal {unsealKey}
</code>

 Shyft Network Partners With Cointelegraph to Throw Light on Growing Institutional Demand for Cryptocurrencies <blockquote>The Institutional Demand for Cryptocurrencies: Global Survey 2022 report puts rumors about falling institutional demand for cryptocurrencies to&nbsp;rest.</blockquote><blockquote>Microstrategy ($2.8 billion), Tesla ($500 million), and Stone Ridge Asset Management ($188.17 million) are the three largest institutional holders of cryptocurrencies.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin (94%) and Ether (75%) are two of the most preferred crypto assets among institutional investors.</blockquote><p>A question cropping up again and again amid this so-called bear market is whether the interest towards cryptocurrencies is taking a back seat among institutional investors. To answer this question and put the rumors about falling institutional interest in cryptocurrencies to rest, Shyft Network joined hands with Cointelegraph Research on its latest report, titled “<a href="https://research.cointelegraph.com/reports/detail/institutional-demand-for-cryptocurrencies-global-survey-2022">Institutional Demand for Cryptocurrencies: Global Survey&nbsp;2022</a>.”</p><p>Interestingly, instead of a fall in interest among professional investors, the report points towards significant interest among institutions to join the blockchain ecosystem. The tendency is evident in a surge in demand for institutional-grade infrastructure. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Institutions Hold 1.39 Million+BTC; Account for Nearly 80% of Coinbase’s Trading&nbsp;Volume. <p>At a company level, the Cointelegraph report focused on traditional companies that have disclosed their cryptocurrency holdings. The list of ten largest institutional cryptocurrency investors has Microstrategy on top, with a total investment of US$2.8 billion, followed by Tesla (US$500 million) and Stone Ridge Asset Management (US$188.17 million).</p><p>For many institutional investors, like Thomas Zeltner, CEO of Zeltner &amp; Co, Cryptocurrencies are a unique diversification opportunity. Going a step further, Zeltner believes that investment in cryptocurrencies is every family’s opportunity to invest a part of its assets in future technologies.</p> 94% of Professional Investors With Crypto Holdings Have Invested in&nbsp;Bitcoin <p>Keeping it in line with the asset distribution pattern in the market, professional investors are primarily holding Bitcoin (94%) and Ether (75%). Among other assets, investors are interested in Stablecoins (31%), Security Tokens (31%), Polkadot (25%), Litecoin (13%), Solana (13%), and XRP&nbsp;(6%).</p><p>When it comes to tokenized securities, not necessarily all institutional investors are bullish on NFTs. Yet, the report could identify two prominent reasons for institutional investors to have faith in the future of&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>The first category of investors believed in acquiring “blue-chip” NFT projects, similar to Visa’s purchase of CryptoPunk. The other segment of investors viewed NFTs as certificates of ownership of underlying assets.</p><p>Several globally-revered brands have also started realizing significant revenue from NFTs, compounding the industry’s faith in tokenized securities. Nike, the iconic footwear &amp; apparel brand, topped the charts with earnings of over US$185 million from NFTs&nbsp;alone.</p> Institutions are Buying the&nbsp;Dip <p>Blackrock, a global asset manager with US$10 trillion in assets, has announced its second blockchain ETF, while Goldman Sachs took on principal risk in a crypto OTC trade for the first time with Galaxy Digital. On the other hand, Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, announced their decision to back a Bitcoin fund, while Fidelity was weighing a plan to allow its brokerage customers to trade in&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Such developments underline that the interest of professional investors towards cryptocurrencies remains intact, with 43% of professional investors surveyed in the report already holding digital assets and 19% planning to buy them in the&nbsp;future.</p><blockquote>Speaking of factors discouraging professional investors from investing in crypto assets, one of every four professional investors has said that regulatory limitations are holding them back from buying Bitcoin. That said, this will likely change with increasing regulatory clarity, with players like Shyft Network coming into the&nbsp;picture.</blockquote><p>With Shyft Network’s Veriscope, which is the only Travel Rule Solution that can address the Sunrise Issue, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) can easily comply with the FATF’s globally-focused Travel Rule. By doing so, Veriscope addresses a significant concern among regulators that malicious actors are turning to digital assets for money laundering and terrorism financing due to the anonymous nature of crypto transactions.</p><p>So what is it that Veriscope does? Simply put, it enables VASPs to share Travel Rule data among themselves easily and, in the process, get authorities to trust the crypto ecosystem by preventing malicious parties from abusing virtual assets for illicit activities. As such, in time, the crypto industry will achieve regulatory parity with the traditional financial sector, and thus, professional investors will no longer be discouraged from investing in cryptocurrencies.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule. So, have you zeroed in on it yet? We have the best solution to suggest: Veriscope! Veriscope is the only frictionless Crypto Travel Rule compliance solution.</p><p>Visit our website to read more: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">https://www.veriscope.network/</a> and contact our BizDev team for a discussion: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/contact.">https://www.veriscope.network/contact.</a></p><p>Also, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://bb.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> for up-to-date news from the world of crypto regulations.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/shyft-network-partners-with-cointelegraph-to-throw-light-on-growing-institutional-demand-for-e7b2e1bf5811">Shyft Network Partners With Cointelegraph to Throw Light on Growing Institutional Demand for…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The world of decentralized identity can be deeply technical and complex. However, at its core, the mission is simple:</p>  💡  To build a world where users control their identity and data  <p></p><p>The average person has 100 passwords they need to maintain, according to a 2021 study released by NordPass, and, in the case of social-logins like Sign In with Google, users are relying more heavily on third-parties to manage and protect their data for critical, personally meaningful services. </p><p>In an ideal world, individuals (or entities) should be able to control their own data and provision access to applications if and when required. When you explain it this way, the case for decentralized identity makes sense to pretty much everyone - even my 80-year-old grandparents understood the high level concept in discussions at a family dinner. </p><p>As you start to dig into how it actually works, however, the jargon gets a bit more complicated. </p><p>In order to make this particular domain more accessible, we’ve put together a quick-start guide to the different acronyms that are commonly used in the blog posts, articles, and other resources you may be reading focusing on the future of decentralized identity. </p><p>In future blog posts, we’ll break down the basic concepts here, but we’ll start first by defining the ABC's of decentralized identity:</p><p></p>  💭SSI - Self-sovereign identity<br>Also known as decentralized identity, SSI gives individuals control over their own identity and data, and how they present themselves to applications and services across the web. <br>  <p></p>  💭DID - Decentralized Identifiers<br>A DID is a globally unique identifier that is generated or registered cryptographically. It serves as a reference linking to a DID document, similar to how a URL would be linked to a specific web resource. The structure is did:&lt;method&gt;:&lt;method-specific-id&gt; (for example, 	did:ens:spruce.eth or did:web:spruceid.com).<br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;  💭URI - Uniform Resource Identifier<br>A URI is a string of characters that is the standard identifier format for all resources on the web. A DID is a type of URI scheme, as shown above. The most commonly known URI is the URL, a standard web address (like https://twitter.com).   <p></p>  💭VC - Verifiable Credential<br>No, not a venture capitalist. This VC is a tamper-proof, cryptographically secure form of a machine-readable credential. For example, it might be a digital version of your SSN, a German passport, or even a concert ticket.   <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  💭LOA - Levels of assurance<br>LOA is the degree of certainty that an entity is who or who they claim to be. Higher levels are required where risk of fraud is more serious, such as buying a plane ticket (high risk), compared to buying a t-shirt (low risk).   <p></p>  💭KYC - Know Your Customer<br>KYC are standards used in the financial industry to verify the identity of customers and assess their risk levels. These standards were designed to protect against fraud, corruption, money laundering, and sanctions noncompliance.   <p></p>  💭PII - Personal Identifiable Information<br>PII is any piece of information that either directly or indirectly identifies a specific individual. For example, this might be a credit card number. It could also simply be “Board of Directors at company ABC, female” if only one person fits that criteria.   <p></p>  💭SSO - Single Sign-On<br>SSO is when one login can be used across multiple applications and services. For example, your same Google login can be used to create an account on an eCommerce website, like Zara, but also on a work messaging service, like Slack. <br>  <p></p>  💭OIDC - OpenID Connect<br>An open authentication protocol that allows a user’s identity to be verified when trying to access a protected HTTPs endpoint. It sits on top of OAuth 2.0 with login and profile information on the user, enabling single sign-on. If you're interested in learning more, the <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">spec for OAuth 2.0</a> is a good place to start.   <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  💭SIOP - Self-issued OpenID Provider<br>SIOP is an extension of OIDC for the SSI use case (yes, more acronyms - both OIDC and SSI defined above). SIOP enables users to interact directly with verifiers themselves to prove identity, without needing to rely on a third-party provider (like Google). It is “self-issued” because users serve as their own Identity Provider (IdP, defined next) in this extension.  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  💭IdP - Identity Provider<br>An IdP is a trusted, centralized party that creates, stores, and manages digital identities for users and also provides authentication services. An IdP lets you use single-sign on to create accounts across multiple services, reducing the need to remember unique usernames and passwords for each service. &nbsp; &nbsp;  <p></p>  💭IAM - Identity and Access Management<br>IAM is the set of tools and policies for managing the roles and permissions for users to a variety of applications. For example, the goal for an enterprise is to give people and devices the appropriate access rights, while keeping the ability to cut off access to sensitive information if needed, like if a laptop is stolen.   <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>  💭SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language<br>SAML is an open standard for authentication that enables you to use one set of login credentials to access multiple web applications. Web applications use SAML to transfer authentication information in a specific format between the identity provider and a service provider. &nbsp; &nbsp;  <p></p>  💭IDaaS - Identity as a Service<br>IDaaS is a cloud-based identity management service operated by a third-party provider. It enables IT teams to consolidate workflows like VPN remote access, multi-factor authentication, single sign-on, and other identity services to be managed by one provider, rather than building solutions themselves.  <p></p>  💭ZKP - Zero-Knowledge Proof<br>A cryptographic protocol where a claim is proven true without revealing any additional information beyond that the claim is true. For example, the bouncer at your favorite happy hour bar would know you're over 21, but doesn't see your exact birthday.  <p></p>  💭IPFS - InterPlanetary File System<br>IPFS is a peer-to-peer file storage system. Each device on a network is connected to the same file system and each file within the system has a unique hash of its contents. The artwork for NFT projects is stored on IPFS in most cases.   <p></p>  💭SIWE - Sign-In with Ethereum<br>Last, but certainly not least, SIWE is a standard that describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain services using a standardized message format. This is an important step to improve interoperability across off-chain services that use Ethereum-based authentication. Yes, we’re a bit biased about this one, as we helped to develop it, alongside the Ethereum Foundation and ENS.  <p></p><p> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Yes, that was a lot of acronyms. We hope this helped to make the world of decentralized identity a bit more clear. In future blog posts, we’ll break down these concepts to help you further understand how they fit together in workflows and what different use cases they might have in our daily lives. <br></p><p> </p><p>About Spruce: Spruce lets users control their data across the web.

Launched in September 2022, the phase was designed to incentivise data analysis and the building of algorithms to harness the power of agricultural data for global&nbsp;change.</p><p>Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/press/2022-07-13-ocean-protocol-dimitra-data-bounty">Ocean and Dimitra Data Challenge</a> builds on our collective vision to maximize yields and mitigate operational losses for farmers across the globe with relevant, valuable data-driven insights and algorithms. As part of phase 2, participants were presented with a dataset containing the crop yield data for soybeans in the 46 districts of Madhya Pradesh state, India and the MODIS satellite data on normalized difference vegetation, leaf area, evapotranspiration, land surface temperature and rainfall.</p><p>The challenge was to study the target soybean yields satellite data, rank the factors that affect yields and accordingly build a simple model to predict yields based on the features. The participants were also required to identify any trends in the yield data over a 10-year period. The goal? To gain insights into the nature and impact of recent climatic events that may have influenced crop performance.</p><p>A panel of evaluators from Ocean and Dimitra independently reviewed all the submissions and offered the award for 1st place ($4,000) to <a href="https://bit.ly/3Crlb6l">Andrey Bessalov</a>. Bessalov’s submission showcased models designed to ascertain future feature values that were in turn used to predict future yield values. He developed a simple linear formula to achieve this. In addition, he looked for methods to predict future yield values based on their history and found that using moving averages is the best&nbsp;method.</p><p>The second prize ($3,000) was awarded to <a href="https://bit.ly/3Mt9UHd">Nicolas Landry</a> for building a machine-learning model predicting yield with Rainfall (RF) and Temperature (LST) as inputs. The model can be further simplified to allow farmers to enter simple data and get insights on how to plant and maintain their&nbsp;crops.</p><p>The third prize ($2000) and Community Award ($1000) was conferred upon <a href="https://bit.ly/3CQi5tZ">Tom Pollet</a> who built a K-nearest neighbours machine learning model predicting yield quality based on soil temperature, evapotranspiration, rainfalls and yields of the previous year. The model showed encouraging results with an accuracy of 78% on the predictions made.</p><p>Congratulations to all the winners and kudos to all the participants for the entries — we appreciate your submissions! Your insights will help many farmers and countries to increase their productivity and well-being!</p><p>Want to know more about the Ocean and Dimitra Data Challenge?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>It looks like we are halfway through the <a href="https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/">Cybersecurity Awareness Month</a> of October already, and I thought it might be the appropriate time to talk about VPNs. Again. Haven’t we talked about them enough, you might ask? Every time KuppingerCole analysts bring up the topic of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a>,&nbsp; we feel obliged to mention how VPNs have long outlived their purpose, and how organizations have to finally get rid of them and move to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80474/zero-trust-network-access">more modern solutions</a>. I’m fairly certain, there will even be a bunch of sessions at the upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit</a> talking about them.</p>
<p>So, in the enterprise world, VPN is already on the way out, there is no doubt about that. However, today, I’d like to focus more on the applications and implications of using a VPN service as a private individual. Judging by the number of ads on YouTube and elsewhere, it looks like VPNs are being aggressively pushed towards consumers as a universal solution for all security and privacy problems. Let’s have a look at some of those claims and find out whether you really need a VPN in 2022…</p>
 What is a VPN anyway? 
<p>VPN stands for “Virtual Private Network”. Originally, this technology was developed to allow connecting remote users or entire offices to a main corporate network via a point-to-point tunnel over the public Internet. The first VPN protocol, PPTP, was developed back in 1996, and it was, to put it mildly, not very secure; even encryption was just an optional feature. Modern, much more robust and performant protocols include OpenVPN, IPsec, and WireGuard.</p>
<p>It is worth stressing that VPNs were never designed with privacy, anonymity, or security in mind – their primary goal was to enable remote workers to do their job without commuting to their offices. The idea of repackaging VPN services and selling them to consumers for protection against online threats came much later, just as businesses started replacing VPNs with modern alternatives. Unfortunately, like every other industry with such a low barrier to entry, this market is overcrowded and highly competitive, with companies often making outrageous claims about their services and sometimes even engaging in shady activities behind their customers’ backs.&nbsp;</p>
 Myth #1: VPN will protect me from hackers 
<p>The Internet is indeed full of hackers lurking around and trying to steal your credit card information, perform identity theft, leak your personal photos, or plant a virus on your device. Unfortunately, a VPN service will be entirely useless against almost every kind of cyberthreat. Even when you’re connected to an unprotected public Wi-Fi, your browser will still establish a secure encrypted connection to almost every website (including your online bank, favorite retail store, or online service). As long as the address starts with HTTPS, your data is safe from snooping even without VPN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, VPN alone will never protect you from other risks: not from a phishing mail, not from a malicious download, and definitely not from a fraudulent online service. Only a combination of a reliable antivirus (nowadays, they are called <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80491/endpoint-protection-detection-response">Endpoint Protection, Detection and Response</a> tools, by the way) and your own common sense will prevent you from falling victim to threats of that kind.</p>
 Myth #2: VPN is a privacy-enhancing measure 
<p>One of the most common claims you hear from VPN service providers is that your online activities can be monitored by government agencies or commercial organizations like your Internet provider. In some countries, like Germany, telcos are even required by law to keep logs of their customers’ connection data. Supposedly, using a VPN will hide your activities from them, thus improving your privacy.</p>
<p>In reality, this claim is wrong on multiple levels. First, even though many VPN providers claim that they do not keep logs of your activities, they might in fact still collect quite a lot of data about you, even more than your internet provider does. Why would they do it? Because they can, and you have no way to verify their claims. And also because your browsing data can be sold to third parties like advertisers. In the end, it is up to you to decide, whom you would rather trust: a telecommunication company operating under your local law, or a potentially shady business based in an offshore country way out of your reach.</p>
<p>However, even when you are using a reputable and truly logless VPN service, there are still many possibilities to leak your true identity. Sometimes, your VPN connection can drop, and you would continue surfing while exposing your real location; to protect against this, some VPN clients come with a kill switch, which will detect such situations and block your entire internet activity until you reconnect.</p>
<p>You should also keep in mind that VPN does not protect you from snooping via other methods: cookies, active sessions on third-party sites like Facebook, or just you absent-mindedly typing your real name in a chat. In fact, not even a multi-hop connection through servers in multiple countries (a favorite plot device in movies about hackers) can ensure your complete anonymity online. If you absolutely must protect your identity from an oppressive government or malicious hackers, you must rely on more sophisticated methods: from end-to-end encrypted messaging clients to burner phones…</p>
 Myth #3: VPN is useful for circumventing regional restrictions 
<p>This is perhaps the single most popular use case for VPN if you’re not a criminal or a dissident. Regional restrictions are often found on movie streaming and gaming platforms, online shops, or just sites that don’t like your country’s government. Using a VPN and spoofing your IP address to appear connecting from a different country is an easy way to get past those restrictions and in most cases, it’s not even illegal (still, please check your local laws first!).</p>
<p>However, one has to keep in mind that popular VPN services are well-known to all intelligence agencies and large organizations that do their business with digital content. Just because Netflix does not block you from watching your favorite show today does not mean they don’t know you’re cheating. In fact, those companies are planning to tighten their restrictions to compensate for lost revenue, and blocking VPN services would be their first step towards that goal.</p>
<p>And when it comes to intelligence agencies, just the fact that you’re using a VPN service might attract their attention as surely as if you were walking around the town wearing a balaclava.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>So, does all this mean that consumer VPN services are completely useless? Not really, they still have their applications, but you have to be fully aware of their potential disadvantages as well, especially when choosing a specific provider. Do not trust every online review of VPN services – in reality, many are fakes paid by less reputable vendors. Avoid relying on free services - the only free cheese is usually found in the mousetrap. Finally, always try to find a more modern or reliable alternative for your use case, especially when it involves your online privacy and safety. And do not hesitate to reach out to experts for advice – including us at KuppingerCole!</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining to this episode. The DNS is something you might have heard or seen and is an important component of internet. And today, we are going to hear what DNS can bring us about identity.</p>
<p>And for that we have a special guest who is Michael Palage. He is an intellectual property attorney and an information technology consultant. He has been actively involved in ICANN which is the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers for operational and policy matters since its formation, and that includes a three-year term on the ICANN Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Palage is President and CEO of Pharos Global, a company that provides consulting and management services to domain name registration authorities and other technology-related companies. Also, he is co-founder of <a href="https://infonetworks.global/">InfoNetworks</a>, which is an information technology company focused on solutions for building online trusted ecosystems incorporating the federation verified data. Hello, Michael.</p>
<p>Michael Palage: Thank you, Oscar. Long-time listener of your podcast, and I really welcome the opportunity to speak with you today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, thank you. It’s great having you. And Michael, let’s talk about digital identity. And as usual, I want to hear a bit about our guest, so please tell us a bit about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Michael: Sure. My journey to identity actually started from the world of identifiers, or as you alluded to, more specifically, the world of internet domain name identifiers. In that journey, I still remember that rather specifically occurred in October of 1994. I had already finished up my engineering degree and I was pursuing my law degree at night at Temple University in Philadelphia while I worked during the day at an intellectual property firm as a law clerk.</p>
<p>And in 1994, I read this article by Joshua Quittner in WIRED magazine entitled Billions Registered. And in this article, Joshua detailed how individuals were registering domain names of famous brands and how he had registered McDonalds.com. And interestingly enough, I wrote to him, Joshua’s middle name was Ronald so of course, he used the email Ronald@McDonalds.com.</p>
<p>And in this article, I would encourage people to go back and read it, he talks about how corporations just were clueless about the main names and online identity. He ended up putting me in contact with the legal, outside legal counsel for Network Solutions, a man by the name of Phil Scarborough, and he basically explained to me the rules of the road or perhaps more appropriately, the lack of any rules of the road.</p>
<p>Just a funny story about McDonalds.com. McDonald’s actually ended up settling that dispute after donating some computer equipment to some inner-city New York schools. And the attorney who handled that matter on behalf of McDonald’s man by the name of David Maher actually ended up becoming a lifelong friend and colleague from the ICANN space.</p>
<p>So, moving on to ICANN, as you alluded to, ICANN is the global coordinator for the unique identifiers. So, this would be domain names and IP addresses. It was created in 1998. And over the last two decades, I have really worked with a large number of multinational companies, non-profits, governments, intergovernmental organisations in helping from both a technical as well as a legal policy and governance standpoint.</p>
<p>Now, my pivot to what your listeners would consider a more traditional digital identity background began about seven years ago. I was doing some work with the Universal Postal Union, the UPU, and this is the UN agency in charge of the postal treaties. They also were the operator of the .POST top-level domain. The UPU at this time was also doing some identity work standards. It was the S68 within the UPU.</p>
<p>And in 2017, UNOPS which is also within the UN structure, they issued an RFI for blockchain and digital identity. And my partner, Frank Cona and I submitted a submission on behalf of InfoNetworks in response to that call. The other thing that was happening that was kind of irrelevant this time with some of the work that I was doing with CUNA, and they were the registry operator for the credit union top-level domain.</p>
<p>And it was through my involvement with that TLD and CULedger that I got to meet Drummond Reed and Scott Perry, who, if you will, kind of introduced me into the world of the self-sovereign and their viewpoint on identity. So that is kind of my, if you will, identity identifier journey to where I find myself today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so very interesting. Michael, you have worked with DNS a great part of your career with ICANN found in that organisation. And DNS is super important component, we use it every single day we do something with internet, whatever we do. Please refresh us what is DNS, and if this system, this protocol was initially designed to solve some identity problems.</p>
<p>Michael: Sure. So as many of your listeners to this podcast may be familiar with the work of Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn as the co-inventors of the TCP/IP protocol suite. And this enables computers on the internet to seamlessly communicate with one another. Most internet users however, like my family and friends, could not tell the difference about the TCP/IP suite, or the difference between an IPv4 and IPv6 address space. What they do understand our domain names and how they need to type them into their browser, either on a computer or a mobile device and get to where they want to go to on the internet, whether that’s to Facebook.com, TikTok.com, or Google.com.</p>
<p>So, the original internet had no domain name system. And when a user wanted to access another computer on the internet, they had to rely on a text file called the host file, which basically contained the list of every computer connected to the internet and its associated IP address space. This was sort of like an old telephone book that some of your listeners may recall using back of the day. Obviously, this system did not scale well as the internet began to grow in size.</p>
<p>And in the mid ’80s, Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel conceived of the DNS, which is a hierarchical naming system, which maps a user-friendly name to an IP address. So, to give you an example, the IP address currently associated with the Ubisecure.com website is the IP address 141.193.213.20. As you could understand, that probably would not look good on a business card. And if you think an IPv4 address space is nonuser friendly, the alternative is 126 hexadecimal IPv6 address space, which is even more painful.</p>
<p>So, what the DNS allows the user to do is to insert a user-friendly domain name and allow the DNS system to do its magic in the background and instantaneously get a user to where they need to be. One of the things that is truly unique, and I think special about the DNS is that it handles trillions, that’s with a T, trillions of queries per day. In fact, Comcast, a large ISP recently announced that their networks alone handle 1.4 trillion queries per day.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons that the DNS can handle this high volume is its highly distributed network. And the apex of the DNS is the root zone, which is jointly maintained by ICANN and Verisign. And this authoritative list of IP addresses and authoritative name servers for each TLD is disseminated across 13 root servers, A through M. Although there’s the use of mirror root servers, which actually provides a much more geographical footprint of several 100.</p>
<p>So that is kind of, again, a very high-level overview of the DNS and how it basically works to connect people. So, I guess getting back to your original question, as originally conceived, the DNS had nothing to do with identity. It was merely a mapping tool to link human friendly domain names to an IP address.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. So yeah, good analogy. Also, you also did it like it’s a fun books, for instance, having a long lists of numbers and translating today a way to dynamically know who is like mom and you have the number you’re dialling directly. And yeah, so many domains. And it’s actually a lot of work, it’s interesting just how many domain names every person can remember, right? And you use, you go to the browser, and you put Ubisecure.com, or you put a NewYorkTimes.com, et cetera. So, you remember those and that would be impossible than the numbers IP addresses. Yeah.</p>
<p>Michael: Correct. And what’s interesting is domain name has scaled. So originally, there was only a small handful of generic top-level domains. The first top-level domain was actually .arpa. Then there was gov, mil and com, net and org. There were then the TLDs that most people are probably familiar with are a couple of 100 cc TLD, country code top-level domains, .fr, .uk, .de.</p>
<p>But then about a decade ago, ICANN substantially expanded the name space. They did a proof of concept in 2000, 2004, and then in 2012. And currently, there are over about a thousand top-level domains, generic top-level domains for users to choose from. And what has really proved incredibly resilient is that the size of the zone, of the root zone has expanded and there has been basically no interruption or quality deterioration in what people do. So again, it’s really a tribute to a work of Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel in designing that original system.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. Yes, and as you said, DNS was not designed for solving identity problems but today apparently, we can do something about. So today, what are problems that – identity problems in which DNS can help?</p>
<p>Michael: So, the beauty of the DNS is first and foremost, it’s global ubiquity. It is everywhere. Not only is it everywhere, but it has the ability to continue to scale. As I said, right now, the system is literally handling trillions of queries per day.</p>
<p>Now, another interesting feature of the DNS is its ability to store additional information through the use of resource records. So, some of the common resource records that your listeners may be familiar with is the A or Address record, which is used to store the IP address associated with a domain name. Or the MX record for the mail exchange associated with a domain name.</p>
<p>However, there are other types of records that your listener may not be familiar with. For example, the TLSA record can store information about an X.509 certificate. The Naphtha record can be used to store internet telephony information. But perhaps the most dynamic or the Swiss Army knife of DNS records might be the TXT record. The TXT record allows text informations for information outside of your domain name. People that have used TXT records, for example, Google uses the DNS TXT record to verify domain name ownership and for enhanced email security.</p>
<p>Early on in our discussion, I mentioned the UNOPS white paper that I co-authored with my partner, Frank Cona. That original white paper focused on the potential of using digital identity frameworks that would leverage blockchain and distributed ledger technology. However, the more we dug into blockchain and DLT, as well as the work of the WC3, the more we kept coming back to the question of why not just use the DNS, or more specifically, DNSSEC?</p>
<p>So, in my original discussion about the DNS, one of the things that I had left out was that the original DNS was not very secure. More specifically, because of the distributed nature of the global DNS infrastructure, it was possible for bad actors to perpetrate man in the middle attacks and hijack DNS traffic. However, through the use of DNSSEC, it is now possible for a domain name owner to cryptographically sign the DNS data associated with their domain name, thus enhancing overall security. A few years ago, I worked with the Ethereum naming service and the .luxe top-level domain to enable registrants have a .luxe domain to actually map that to an Ethereum wallet address.</p>
<p>So that was kind of when the light bulb went off for me personally about just the overall resourcefulness and utility of the DNS. Now, I’m sure you’re aware in connection with your professional experience, there are a lot of people in the identity space that are rather passionate about their particular technology stacks to implement their digital identity solutions.</p>
<p>One of the things in my opinion that has made the internet so great has been the ability to keep the internet’s core neutral and to allow innovation to occur at the edge. I see the DNS being in an optimal infrastructure to facilitate identity discovery and look up, and one that can seamlessly integrate with the various identity technology stacks that are in the market today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see. And what are the solutions that today have been done and in progress and being cooked, let’s say?</p>
<p>Michael: Yeah, sure. So, there are actually a number of initiatives out there that are looking to incorporate the DNS as part of an overall digital identity infrastructure. I think one of the earliest examples and one that you’re probably familiar with is LIGHTest. LIGHTest was a multiyear pilot funded by the European Union. It sought to leverage the internet’s DNS to create a global cross domain infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ubisecure, actually, in fact, was one of the pilot’s original participants. And in preparing for this interview, I actually recalled that one of your earliest podcasts, I think it was <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/lightest-project/" title="number 11">number 11</a> actually talked about the LIGHTest pilot. So, after LIGHTest concluded, Fraunhofer, which was one of the other participants, those in a group of other individuals have continued that work and that now has evolved into the TRAIN.</p>
<p>Another example of the use of the DNS is some of the work that InfoNetworks has been doing in the domain name space. We’ve actually worked on a solution with Microsoft and DigiCert to solve ICANN’s problem regarding differentiated access to domain name registration services. After the GDPR went into effect, the majority of the whois data that third parties relied upon went dark.</p>
<p>Now, what was interesting in about part of this initiative is not only do we build and implement a full technology reference implementation. We actually submitted a very detailed data privacy impact assessment to a European data commissioner to vet the legal and governance approach to the model.</p>
<p>Over the years InfoNetworks has been active in DRIP. DRIP is an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/114/materials/slides-114-dance-leveraging-dnssec-for-digital-identity-trust-registries-02">IETF</a> working group that is looking to leverage the DNS to implement a session ID solution for unmanned aircraft or drones. In fact, the InfoNetworks team myself, Frank and Tim, we actually participated in the recent IETF 114 Hackathon.</p>
<p>Another IETF initiative that your listeners may be interested in learning or looking into is work at the IETF in the DANCE Working Group. Jacques Latour from CIRA. This is the Canadian cc TLD operator. He has been doing some work in trust registries. In fact, he actually presented at the recent ICANN 75 Regional Meeting in Kuala Lumpur last month. Jacques, in fact, actually just convinced me to join the Trust Over IP Foundation to help work with him on their trust registry working group. Jacques is very active with Joni Brennan and the rest of the folks in DIACC up in Canada.</p>
<p>And I guess the final example, is some of the work that I have been doing with GAIN, I was one of the original 150 co-authors of the GAIN white paper. Following the white paper GAIN has continued its work through a proof of concept. And David Chadwick from True Trust in UK and Isaac Henderson from Fraunhofer have been active, they’ve actually, in fact, presented a solution on how TRAIN may be able to help in the Federation, in an overall GAIN solution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with my crazy travel schedule over the past couple of months, I have not been able to join those GAIN weekly calls. So, this is a good reminder for me to reach out to Daniel Torsten, Mark and Elizabeth to catch up on things. So, as you can see lots of interesting projects in the identity space that are using or leveraging the DNS as part of that overall solution.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see there are several, including, as you mentioned, with TRAIN that is a continuation of LIGHTest. So, for instance, in TRAIN, who runs this infrastructure, so is it, I don’t know, decentralised or it depends on one main actor?</p>
<p>Michael: So that depends, right? So, when you look at some of the stuff that I think Trust Over IP and TRAIN as well as GAIN are doing is I see them often trying to replicate ICANN as a single source of truth or a single source of trust for the identity space, much like ICANN is for the root zone. I think, however, that that is an incredibly ambitious goal. And I believe the better approach is more of a distributed approach much like the DNS.</p>
<p>One of the things I often comment, and I analogise some of the work that we have done here within InfoNetworks is we look at our system much like a credit card payment network moves tokenised and synonymised data. So instead of sitting there saying there needs to be one ring to rule them all in the identity space, I actually think the standards that are being developed and the DNS can actually be used to create a competitive marketplace of credit card process networks, Visa, MasterCard, American Express.</p>
<p>And the beauty of the infrastructure of TRAIN and the others, DANCE as well, is it allows people to choose how they want to interconnect their networks. And what is the internet? A network of networks. And what this can be done here, I think is allowing those networks to interconnect.</p>
<p>And I think over time, as people become more comfortable, there will be a consolidation. But I do not ever see a situation where there will just be a single source of truth, such as the root zone that exists on the internet today. I could be wrong, but I think that there are just a lot of geopolitical challenges on coming up with a single source of truth on something that is so sensitive to so many national governments.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think is most likely that’s the way it’s more decentralised.</p>
<p>Michael: Yeah. And I said, you know, before anyone as far as who can provide this infrastructure, what I think is really interesting here, Oscar, is I think this creates a tremendous opportunity for those companies that have expertise in DNS infrastructure to, if you will, take their business models to a whole another level.</p>
<p>You know, one of the discussions I had with a number of registries and registrars at the recent ICANN meeting was I said, “Globally, there are about 370 million domain names registered.” That’s it. You know, across g TLDs and cc TLD, you add them all together 370 million. But when you look at the identity market, you have 8 billion people, 20 billion IoT devices, you know, billions of legal entities, I think it would be incredibly fortuitous for the DNS infrastructure community to look at the market of tens of billions instead of focusing on one’s of a market of hundreds of millions. So that is kind of my effort to get people to think outside of their 1999 business model.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, completely different scale. Yes, absolutely. And you mentioned, one of the ways you enter into the really your last years of your career when you really enter to the identity itself, it was related also to self-sovereign identity. Correct? So, what is the role of self-sovereign identity into this topic?</p>
<p>Michael: So, I tend to take a more agnostic view. I tend to look at the DNS as being agnostic infrastructure. As I said, it can handle X.509 certificates. The InfoNetworks reference implementation has relied heavily upon OpenID Connect. With regard to the long-term viability of the SSI model, there, I think things are potentially a little more complex.</p>
<p>And let me begin by stating I fully support individuals being able to grant and revoke consent to how their data is used by third parties. I think that is critically important. In fact, one of my good friends in Germany, Klaus Stoll, he is the co-founder of the Internet Integrity Task Force. And one of their focuses is to actually take the UN Declaration of Human Rights and extend that into digital identity in cyberspace.</p>
<p>That being said, you know, my partner, Frank Cona, often calls SSI the myth of self-sovereign. Personally, I struggle to see a long-term market viable identity solution that does not rely upon a government-issued ID as that trust anchor. Where I think a lot of the constructive efforts of the SSI community would be best harnessed would be to focus on a lot of the work being done in Europe with eIDAS 2.0 and the European Wall Initiative.</p>
<p>I think that the European Union has the potential to set the bar for digital identity, much like the GDPR set the global bar for data privacy. So, I see most or many of those SSI principles being incorporated into that work. And again, I tried to be more agnostic as far as the individual technology stack.</p>
<p>And just, you know, one other thing that I think is interesting is this year at the Identiverse Conference, one of the keynotes was given by Stephen Wilson, and his talk was trust in a post identity world. I would really encourage your listeners to watch that video. It’s only 10 minutes long, but it really is thought provoking and aligns with a lot of the work that InfoNetworks has been doing.</p>
<p>And instead of focusing in on identity, it’s more about building trusted ecosystems and creating a marketplace for the exchange of verified data. Because I think as you are aware, if you ask 10 experts what their definition of digital identity is, you’ll probably get 15 answers, right? So, to me, again, that’s part of teaching the core neutral, and trying to innovate on the edge. That’s what’s really worked in the internet, and hopefully, is a way of creating innovation within the identity space.</p>
<p>Oscar: And time will tell about the SSI, self-sovereign identity. One thing you have mentioned also a bit earlier in the conversation is called the organisation identities, which is mostly about today, about the LEIs, the Legal Entity Identifiers. So how this fits into the solution?</p>
<p>Michael: Yeah, so GLEIF, you know, for your listeners, GLEIF was spun up, and again, this is another area where Ubisecure is a provider of LEI. So not only did you participate in LIGHTest, but you also provide LEIs as well. So again, it really is interesting, and it shows kind of Ubisecure spot leadership in this area.</p>
<p>But getting back to GLEIF. So, after the economic downturn in 2008, one of the problems that was identified by the G20, was the inability to keep track of some of the derivatives that were owned by different financial institutions. And what they discovered was that they needed a globally unique identifier for legal entities. And this is basically the genesis of where GLEIF came from.</p>
<p>And what they have done with the LEIs I think, which is really interesting is they provided a unique identifier for a global business. One of the projects that GLEIF is working on now, I believe they’re concluding their pilot right around this quarter of this year is vLEIs. So, what they are looking to do is actually take the legal identifier and then actually be able to map that to individual corporate officers or employees within the organisation. And again, they are doing this using the KERI protocol.</p>
<p>And one of the things that I really like about the approach that Stephan Wolf, Karla McKenna, and Christoph Schneider has done is they have similarly taken an agnostic approach. The KERI protocol can interface with a number of different ledgers or databases for what they’re doing. So, I think this is something that is really interesting, particularly their work with vLEI.</p>
<p>The other thing that I think is unique about the work that GLEIF does, is not only do they work, not only at a standards level within ISO and some of the work they’re doing with the Trust Over IP foundation, but they also are very active in ensuring that the LEIs are recognised in individual national laws. So, if you go to their website, they actually have a database where you can see how LEIs have been incorporated or referenced in various national laws.</p>
<p>So, to me, this, I think, is a very important step in the further, if you will, codification of identity international laws. GLEIF was also one of the five founding organisational or institutional members of GAIN as well. So again, they’re doing a lot of great work there. And I think that’s something really interesting to watch.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, super interesting synergies on all these pieces that help us to have better identity for individuals, for organisations, et cetera. And yeah, thank you so much for yeah, enlightening so much, you are involved in very knowledgeable, so many projects and are super interesting. I have to listen to this conversation again and take note of what you have mentioned, super interesting projects.</p>
<p>Michael: And what I’ll do is I could follow up, and for your show notes, I can include some of the links to some of the standards bodies, some of the work that’s been done to help educate and point your listeners into the right direction.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please, please, thank you, we will add all that to our show notes of these episodes. So please, final question. As usual, for all business leaders listening to us, what is the one actionable idea that they should right on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Michael: That’s a good one. As someone who has come to this space a little later, as I said, I transition from identifier to identity, I think the best actionable advice I could give to them is network, network, network. Identity is an emerging area involving both technology and legal governance that I think is vital to almost every business. Therefore, I think it’s really critical to have a network of friends and colleagues to interact with and to bounce off ideas.</p>
<p>So, I would encourage everyone listening to this podcast today, to find resources in their budget and in their calendar to attend at least one identity event in-person in 2023. This year, for example, I started off with KuppingerCole in Berlin with the European Identity Cloud, then was Data Identiverse in Denver, FedID in Atlanta, and I just finished up last week with Identity Week in DC.</p>
<p>You know, the personal interactions and learning experiences through these face-to-face meetings are truly invaluable. And while I attended some of these events virtually during lockdown, there really is no substitute for that in-person interaction. And, you know, that really has allowed me, if I could just, you know, just thank some of the people that have helped in my journey, you know, Nat, Gail and Don at the OpenID Foundation, Christina and Ankur at Microsoft. Torsten and Daniel at Yes.com, and Mark in GAIN and Elizabeth at GAIN and Jeremy, Grant and Joni.</p>
<p>There’s just so many people. And I think the thing that’s most important here, which reminds me of the original domain name or ICANN community back in the late ’90s, was they were incredibly welcoming. All these people, when I had questions, they answered them, they pointed me in the right direction. And that is a camaraderie that I do not necessarily see in many industries. And yeah, go to an in-person identity conference in 2023. That would be my takeaway.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Excellent. Excellent. Well, I have to take it also that one and maybe see you in person next year. And many of the ones who are listening to this. So yeah, excellent. Thank you for telling that. It’s definitely great actionable idea. Put it already now that this year is ending and plan it for next year.</p>
<p>Again, thanks a lot, Michael, for a super interesting conversation. If you have something else to close or tell us how people can find more information about you, let us know.</p>
<p>Michael: Yes, you could find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpalage/">LinkedIn</a> and – or you can reach me via email <a title="MPalage@InfoNetworks.global">MPalage@InfoNetworks.global</a>, or my original digital identifier <a title="michael@palage.com">michael@palage.com</a>. So, any of those means of communication and for someone that’s new to the identity space, you know, don’t hesitate to reach out and hopefully I could pay forward some of the help that others in the community had given to me over the last three to five years.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Thanks a lot Michael and all the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Michael: Thank you.</p>

<p>In this vlog, Mike Engle and Michael Cichon discuss how government agencies can securely deliver digital services to their constituents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>All right, well, who are everybody? This is Michael Cichon, Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos here with Mike Engle, our Chief Strategy Officer. Today, I want to talk Mike a little bit about government services. We’ve had a lot of conversations recently with various agencies of the federal government. Can you talk a little bit about the growing need for government to deliver services digitally?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, yeah, I mean, the big enabler here or event was COVID obviously. Not only was everybody stuck at home, but the government had to hand out tons of services electronically and offices were closed. So the time was already here, but that really accelerated things.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. I guess the front door to a lot of this stuff is logging in and facial recognition has made its way into that discussion. Can you talk a little bit about some of the issues revolving around government agencies using facial recognition? Who are these agencies?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, I think first, if you take a step back, why do you need facial recognition, right? I log into my Bank of America today, and I don’t use my face or whatever website it is, right? It’s very rarely used. But the bad guys take advantage of that because if you’re not using something about me, my face, my voice, something you, something you have actually, then somebody else can impersonate. So the government, rightly so, wants to match your identity to the government identity that they have on file, driver’s license or state identity, whatever it is.</p>
<p>So now, if you’re going to look somebody in the face and say, “Yes, this is Michael,” you have to do it right. So yeah, a number of issues have come up. So that’s the kind of why. There’s no way to prove who somebody else is unless you can match something about them, right? So what the government’s doing today is looking you in the face, and we’ll talk about that, and matching that likeness to the credential that they gave you when you got your driver’s license in California.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Well, you use the word issue. So there are certainly issues I’ve read about in this use of facial biometrics. Decisioning bias or racial bias I’ve read has been one of them. Can you talk about either that issue or some of the other pressing issues in using facial recognition?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, there’s several, and we’ll talk about them all briefly. So you mentioned bias and there’s two forms of bias. One is when I am matching your face to this and it fails because I just don’t handle that kind of face well, right? Maybe it’s a certain ethnic persuasion or I don’t like females because my algorithm was made by a male, whatever it is. So that’s one thing you have to take into consideration. You need very low rates of false rejection. It’s called FRR is the industry term for that, false rejection rate.</p>
<p>The other is if you’re matching a face to a big database of other faces, this is where law enforcement gets in trouble a lot where they say, “Yeah, I think that’s the person in the database,” but it’s not. So they call that a one to many. That’s not really needed for the government to do what they do. But there’s been some issues where they’ve tried to do it and gotten into some heat recently. For example, at the IRS, there’s been some challenges over there where they were taking faces and comparing them to a database of other faces, and that’s a no-no.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So one of the other issues, and maybe this is just me, but there’s various services. For a while, to get in a sports arena, we had to either show a driver’s license there or use a system where we had already kind of shared a driver’s license online. I’m a little bit reticent every time a crypto service or Google, Google just asked me to provide my driver’s license. Am I out of line being concerned about providing my driver’s license images of my driver’s license online to prove who I am?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>You should be careful, right? Because you don’t necessarily know where it’s going unless you read the fine print. So if that driver’s license goes into some big database and then all of a sudden you start getting advertisements for a new Chrysler, well, that’s not good. That’s using your data for nefarious purposes, right? On the other hand, if there’s a very clear disclosure that this driver’s license would be in your control and you present it when you’re asked, that’s kind of the new way to do it. So there’s the old way, take your picture, your license and throw it into a database, or there’s ways to do it now where the user stays in control of it the whole time. It’s kind of called the Apple way, right? Apple’s all about privacy and there’s ways to do it like that now.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, what is the right way to do this? We’re talking about facial matching. We’re talking about providing credentials online. Aside from the issues, what’s the best way to address the issues? What’s the right way to do it?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>It’s with a wallet. So if you think about your physical wallet that you’ve had and enjoyed, just my fancy little wallet that I have here, it has credentials in it. I pull the credential out, I give it to somebody, I’m in control of it. Then you will look at the picture, look at my face, TSA agent, state trooper. I’ve never been pulled over, but maybe you have, and you’re proving your identity. Well, you can do that now digitally with a digital wallet. That wallet has to be in your control. A great form factor that for that is your smartphone, which has very secure technology in it and a great camera and all these things.</p>
<p>That’s the new way to do it. The key is that the data stays under your control at all times. It’s verified, right? So you get credentials, they’re verified, and you put them in that wallet, and then you use them whenever you give consent and give them to that stadium or whatever it is that you’re… In the example you gave earlier. So that’s the right way and the new way to do it.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So is government ahead of the curve or behind the curve on the use of these facial biometrics and verified identity?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>It depends which government. Here in the U.S., we’re still a bit behind the rest of the world. In several other countries, they’ve been doing either government or bank sponsored digital identity and putting the user in control, but we’re heading in the right direction. I’m seeing lots of RFIs, right? Requests for information and some real projects spinning up where the government is seeing the right things and they’re trying to figure out how to navigate the monstrous organizations and cross agency stuff. So we’re optimistic that in the next couple of years that’ll happen. There’s been some recent legislation passed that is really encouraging this type of activity as well.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So what are some of the governments around the world that are leading the charge in regards to digital identities and facial matching?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, it just so happens, I have a picture. So if you check out this graphic here, it’s a map of the world. You’ll see there’s pockets of identity efforts going on and this isn’t necessarily all of them. But some big ones. You see in Korea, they have something called SK Pass, combination of the telcos, some tech companies and the government digitizing your identity information. In the Nordic regions, they have bank and government led partnerships where you can use your government credential digitally across hundreds of services. There’s something called NEM ID and Bank ID. So pretty exciting stuff over there.</p>
<p>There’s some consortiums here that are heading in the right direction. There’s a organization called the CARIN Alliance, that’s C-A-R-I-N, which is a bunch of healthcare payers, providers coming together to say, “Here’s how we’re going to do identity right in the healthcare industry.” So that would involve you proving who you are from a government perspective, but then leveraging it, do it once and leverage it across your whole medical ecosystem. So more to follow on that as it matures.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So at least in the U.S., it looks like we have a little bit of catch up to do. But I read recently, I mean, coming out of the White House, there’s further guidance and clarity on using NIST as the standards body moving forward to govern some of this. Is that accurate? Is that what’s happened recently?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>It is, yeah. So the government agencies, three letter agencies that provide the services, the IRS, SSA, HHS, et cetera, they follow a standard known as NIST 800-63-3. What that does is it says, “If you’re going to onboard a remote identity, here’s how you do it with a high level of assurance. I need one or more strong forms of verification matching it to your face.” So it’s got all these rules. 1Kosmos is certified to the highest level that there’s certification for, and that has gotten us a lot of attention at these agencies, which need a certified solution to provide these benefits to citizens and residents.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>That’s really great. All right, well, I appreciate the roundup, Michael. You have a good rest of your day and appreciate as usual all the great information.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Great to be here. See you soon.</p>

<p>Getting a mortgage has traditionally been a long and challenging process. Customers have had to dig up paystubs and bank statements to hand off to loan officers. Loan officers and processors then manually uploaded the paperwork into the lender’s database for review and then hope for the best. When a borrower sent an incomplete document or a processor made an error in data transposition, it could delay the loan approval process by days, even weeks.</p>



<p>But in today’s climate of rising interest rates and low inventory, those long wait times have gone from just annoying to potentially costing house hunters the chance to close on the homes they desire. For example, serious buyers should arrive at each showing with a pre-approval letter in hand, in order to be competitive. Even those just browsing will need to move quickly if the right house comes up. And those refinancing—yes, even as rates are climbing, there are borrowers who could save by refinancing—must act fast to nail the lower rate in place.</p>



<p>These inefficiencies and delays were troubling to Guaranteed Rate, who, as the second-largest retail lender in the U.S., has been helping to make the mortgage process easier since 2000.</p>



<p>Two years ago the company decided to look into taking its underwriting process digital. There was a lot on the line. The mortgage industry sets a high bar for the financial data used to underwrite loans, requiring documents from verified institutions. What’s more, borrowers share some of their most sensitive financial information to secure a loan. Guaranteed Rate was committed to protecting the consumer’s privacy and financial data.</p>



<p>What Guaranteed Rate came up with is a platform that enables customers to go online or use a mobile app to grant permission for the lender via a third-party service to access their financial and payroll accounts. That lets the lender quickly and accurately verify assets, income and employment.</p>



<p>If everything checks out, the lender can give the borrower a quick thumbs-up. In some cases, that’s all the data the lender needs for the mortgage to go forward. This digital verification process can cut up to <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty">eight days</a> off the underwriting process. “From an efficiency standpoint, our underwriters don’t have to manually verify income and assets for every loan, so we can scale up,” says Brad Lando, Senior Vice President of Strategic Development, Guaranteed Rate.</p>



<p>The company protects borrowers’ sensitive data by using Mastercard’s open banking platform. When a borrower grants a lender access to their data, Mastercard’s technology issues a token. The token allows the lender to see the data, but never house it. Nor does the lender receive login credentials. The risk of those credentials being hacked during the mortgage process is reduced, and the customer gets a better experience.</p>



<p>Another advantage is that borrowers can grant ongoing account access for prolonged periods of time, such as 60 days. That means the lender can refresh the data as needed without having to go back and ask for renewed permission to track down more documents, alleviating the burden on the consumer. “It’s cut down on risk, in addition to bringing a better customer experience,” says Lando.</p>



<p>Loan officers and processors have been quick to adapt to this digital-first method. The automated verification system allows them to sign off faster on more straightforward loans, which frees them up to focus on the more complicated ones.</p>



<p>And while there’s still some trepidation among consumers, they’re also starting to see the benefits. When offered a choice to manually upload their documents or grant permission for the lender to pull their information, 83% of borrowers who chose the digital path said their loan processing time was shorter than they expected it to be, or that it met their expectations.</p>



<p>As digital verification becomes more prevalent, the mortgage process will speed up, from application to close. And that means more people can look forward to a smoother process on the way to landing in the homes they want to live in.</p>

				  Machine-readable governance files simplify the governance in a decentralized verifiable credential ecosystem: but who develops these files—and how?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 By Mike Ebert<p></p>
<p>Decentralized Ecosystem Governance using machine-readable files is the most effective and efficient way to implement the rules for using verifiable digital credentials in a Trusted Digital Ecosystem. These rules cover everything from who is a trusted issuer of verifiable credentials to the adaptive information flows for managing verification of specific information.</p>
<p>The benefits to using machine readable files, which reside in the agent software for issuing, holding, and verifying credentials, include removing friction in verification (the governance authority doesn’t have to be pinged for each verification) and enabling offline verification (with the rules being cached, verification can occur without an internet connection).</p>
<p>But, practically, how do these machine readable governance files come into existence?</p>
<p>It’s a two-step process. The rules and human governance are determined by whomever is responsible for creating the ecosystem with reference to relevant laws, requirements, and restrictions; then, a technical development group is created to implement those rules.</p>
<p>In the case of a national government, the governing body of the relevant jurisdiction would be in charge. For a community or an association, the board or leading organization would set the rules. For a company, the C-suite or operations would likely be in charge. After these governing bodies determine the rules for the use case, they decide on the team, department, or contractor to implement them.</p>
<p>The development process is collaborative. There will, inevitably, be specific issues and technical details revealed in development that the rule-makers didn’t consider. The result of this collaborative process is a machine-readable governance file.</p>
<p>Next, there should be an acceptance testing process, whereby this governance file is demonstrated as working properly to the governing body. This body can either directly audit or select an auditing group to make sure the code is stable, both initially and at regular subsequent intervals.</p>
<p>There are two main vulnerabilities. First, if no audits are conducted, the code may drift over time as updates are made (and they will need to be made). Second, if a disgruntled tech employee tampers with the file, it would likely have a negative impact. But these risks are similar to any other tech development process or IT system (e.g., domain names, hosting, databases, code repositories).</p>
<p>In the case of looser, ad-hoc, social governance, where no single party is in charge, individuals could assemble, adopt, and adapt their own governance. The tools and formats for these&nbsp; individual efforts will likely be similar, but additional effort will be needed to discover and share these socially created governance structures.</p>

The cashier will request to see your driver’s license to make sure you’re of age. For most of us, this is completely normal. But if you actually think about this process, it’s kind of&nbsp;insane.</p><p>You’re essentially handing over all of your personal information — including your name, date of birth, home address, and your ID&nbsp;number.</p><p>Does the cashier actually need all of that information? No.</p><p>Technically speaking, all they need to know is whether or not you’re over 21 (in the US). They don’t even need to know your birthday.</p><p>I spent some time in Portugal this past summer. When we arrived at the Airbnb, the host requested that he take photos of all of our passports. Another host earlier in the year requested that we text photos of our license beforehand.</p><p>You can understand where the hosts are coming from. They need to know who their guests are in case something happens. And because these interactions are beyond the scope of Airbnb’s own platform, copies of my personal documents are now sitting on someone’s phone, a person I know little&nbsp;about.</p><p>We’re not picking on Airbnb here — and to be clear, these were special requests by individual hosts. This is just how things have always been done. This process is normalized because it’s convenient and there aren’t really any better systems in&nbsp;place.</p><p>But there should&nbsp;be.</p><p>We should be able to share only the necessary information in the context of the interaction. For instance, if I’m purchasing wine, I should be able to share only my date of birth — not the whole kit and kaboodle.</p><p>In an even smarter future, we’ll be able to receive a credential that states we’re over 21. In that scenario, you’ll be able to do what you need to do as an adult while maintaining full privacy.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Osman Celik</a></p>Due to its value and sensitivity, customer identity and data must be protected with strong access management systems. Key use cases include managing usage of customer data and its availability both internally and externally; and managing availability of organizational data across employee and partner workforces. Organizations failing to manage access controls are at risk of suffering from cyberattacks or violating regulations. Authorization methods are constantly evolving to address ever-changing business requirements and the increasing threats. PBAC (Policy Based Access Control) is a concept that enables organizations to easily and continuously adapt to changes in human resources, roles, and regulations by building on organization-wide policies. Recently made available as a SaaS offering, PingOne Authorize offers a policy-based access control mechanism that integrates deeply with the authentication capabilities provided by Ping Identity, with API (Application Programming Interface) access management capabilities and enabling a broader range of externalized fine-grained authorization use cases.

<p>$40,000 in $OCEAN awarded to community teams to build interoperable data storage integrations on&nbsp;Ocean</p><p>We are back with updates, Ocean community!</p><p>Shipyard, the $2 Million OCEAN grants program for entrepreneurs looking to build open-source Web3 solutions on Ocean, is proud to introduce the winning projects of the Data Storage Initiative!</p><p>Launched in September 2022, the initiative was designed to support teams interested in working on decentralized data storage integrations for Ocean Protocol. The goal? To have up to 3 new data storage technologies integrated with Ocean in production by the end of 2022 — including Arweave, Filecoin and a decentralized data storage backend for&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>Let’s take a deeper&nbsp;look!</p><p>The data storage grants were issued using a request for work/feature approach and each grant recipient is expected to deliver work as outlined in their specific work package. Recipients will receive tech support and guidance from the Ocean engineering team and rewards will be awarded upon the successful completion and delivery of each project grant milestone. The awards are payable in&nbsp;$OCEAN.</p><p>The $10K “Arweave integration” grant was awarded to <a href="https://www.mantisdata.solutions/">Mantis Data Solutions</a>. The grant work will enable publishing assets stored in Arweave using the transaction ID, uploading data to Arweave and publishing it as an asset on Ocean Market in a few programmatic steps. Since Arweave eliminates ongoing storage costs, this integration is aimed at driving data publish&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Next up, the $15K grant to build a decentralized backend storage module for Ocean.&nbsp;. The winner of this grant is <a href="https://startinblox.com/en/">Startin’blox</a>. The grant work will improve the UX flow for publishers using the Ocean Market and allow developers to easily build &amp; deploy further decentralized data storage integrations to&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>The Filecoin integration grant worth $15K has been awarded to by <a href="https://www.lighthouse.storage/">Lighthouse</a>. The Filecoin integration is aimed at providing increased data availability with minimum copies of data without any waste of resources.</p><p>All three data storage grants are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022 and are designed to create exciting new opportunities for data orchestration and managing complex compute jobs using Ocean Protocol.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — October 10th to October&nbsp;16th <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! We are back with exciting news from the world of crypto regulations this week, from a European Parliament Committee giving the go-ahead to the Markets in Crypto Assets Bill. So, let’s dive straight into it without further&nbsp;ado.</p> European Parliament Committee Passes MiCA Crypto&nbsp;Law <p>The European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) has approved the landmark comprehensive and strategic regulation for crypto assets in the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) is meant to implement uniform regulations for crypto assets across the 27-strong bloc to ensure consumer and environmental protection and introduce safeguards against market manipulation and related financial crime.</p><p>The proposal concerns crypto assets not covered by the existing financial services laws and aims to regulate the activities of crypto service providers, including their issuance, exchange, and&nbsp;trading.</p><p>Once the bill gets signed into law, crypto firms will have up to 18 months to prepare themselves for the&nbsp;changes.</p> US Senator Urges SEC to Establish Crypto Regulation <p>US Lawmaker Hickenlooper is calling on the SEC to establish “clear rules” for the crypto market and engage with the public by opening a “notice-and-comment period.”</p><p>In his letter to chairman Gary Gensler, Hickenlooper urged the SEC to identify cryptos that will be considered securities, establish registration guidelines for trading platforms, and determine necessary disclosures for investors to be properly informed.</p><p>The Colorado senator also reminded the regulator about his duty to “protect” investors and promote “responsible” innovation. He further called for a “coordinated regulatory framework” between government agencies and equal enforcement.</p> FSB Proposes Crypto Regulation Framework <p>The international monitoring body, Financial Stability Board (FSB), has proposed a comprehensive framework for crypto assets to address the potential risks while “harnessing potential benefits of the technology.”</p><p>In its Oct. 11 report, the FSB suggested a potential crypto regulatory framework for public comment, including proposed policy initiatives, financial stability risks, and the approach to establishing guidelines for digital assets. The proposal will be open for public comments until Dec.&nbsp;15.</p><p>Moreover, in an accompanying letter to the G20, FSB chair Klaas Knot cited recent “turmoil” in crypto markets” behind the agency’s recommendations and demanded that policymakers soon develop a “robust international framework” to tackle the potential risks before they affect the broader financial ecosystem.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! <p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope. This offer will remain valid until December 31, 2022, or till the VASP exhausts its SHFT&nbsp;grant.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/shyft-dao-approves-veriscope-vasp-grant-proposal-to-enable-free-fatf-travel-rule-transactions-77e51d735cd6">Read more</a></p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/albania-gives-the-green-light-to-regulating-crypto-exchanges">Albania Gives the Green Light to Regulating Crypto Exchanges ‍</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/kim-kardashian-slapped-by-the-sec-with-over-a-1m-penalty-for-an-unlawful-crypto-promotion">Kim Kardashian Slapped by the SEC With Over a $1M Penalty for an Unlawful Crypto Promotion</a></p><p><a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/wild-west-no-more-g20-portugal--eu-all-planning-tighter-crypto-regulations-14916531.htm">Wild West no more?

<p>Bluesky was created to build a social protocol. In the spring, we released “ADX,” the very first iteration of the protocol. Over the summer we improved and simplified ADX’s design, and today we’re sharing a preview of what’s to come.</p>
<p>ADX is now the “Authenticated Transfer Protocol” — or, more simply, <a href="https://atproto.com">the “AT Protocol.”</a></p>
 A protocol for social networking 
<p>The “AT Protocol” is a new federated social network. It integrates ideas from the latest decentralized technologies into a simple, fast, and open network.</p>
<p>What’s a “federated” network? It’s a way for servers to communicate with each other — like email. Instead of one site running the network, you can have many sites. It means you get a choice of provider, and individuals and businesses can self-host if they want.</p>
<p>What makes AT&nbsp;Protocol unique:</p>
<p>Account portability. A person’s online identity should not be owned by corporations with no accountability to their users. With the AT&nbsp;Protocol, you can move your account from one provider to another without losing any of your data or social graph.</p>
<p>Algorithmic choice. Algorithms dictate what we see and who we can reach. We must have control over our algorithms if we're going to trust in our online spaces. The AT&nbsp;Protocol includes an open algorithms mode so users have more control over their experience.</p>
<p>Interoperation. The world needs a diverse market of connected services to ensure healthy competition. Interoperation needs to feel like second nature to the Web. The AT&nbsp;Protocol includes a schema-based interoperation framework called Lexicon to help solve coordination challenges.</p>
<p>Performance. A lot of novel protocols throw performance out of the window, resulting in long loading times before you can see your timeline. We don’t see performance as optional, so we’ve made it a priority to build for fast loading at large scales.</p>
 Up now: atproto.com 
<p>Since May, we’ve been doing protocol work in a public repository on GitHub, but we’ve mostly been quiet on our blog and Twitter.</p>
<p>This is starting to change: as of today, there’s an <a href="https://atproto.com">AT Protocol website</a>. It’s not completely finished — you’ll find a few “TODOs” in the specs — but the technology is stable enough that we can start to communicate what we’re doing now.</p>
 
  <a href="https://atproto.com/">Read the protocol docs&nbsp;here </a>
 
 Coming soon: the Bluesky app 
<p>The World-Wide Web wouldn’t have been much fun if it was created without a browser, and the same is true of the AT Protocol. So we’re also building a social app called <a href="https://bsky.app">Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>The word “Bluesky” evokes a wide-open space of possibility. It was the original name for this project before it took shape, and continues to be the name of our company. We’re calling the application we’re building Bluesky because it will be a portal to the world of possibility on top of the AT Protocol.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to sharing more about the Bluesky application as it develops.</p>
 
  <a href="https://bsky.app">Join the Bluesky private beta&nbsp;waitlist </a>
 
 Initiate testing sequence 
<p>The next step is to start testing the protocol. Distributed protocol development is a tricky process. It requires coordination from many parties once a network is deployed, so we’re going to start in private beta to iron out issues. As we beta test, we’ll continue to iterate on the protocol specs and share details about how it works. When it’s ready, we’ll move to the open beta.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in participating in the private beta, <a href="https://bsky.app">sign up for the waitlist on the Bluesky website</a>.</p>
<p>And if you’re interested in joining the team, we’re hiring a mobile developer to help build the Bluesky app. <a>Check out our open position here.</a></p>

It is issued by <a href="https://www.h2odata.xyz/">H2O</a> upon providing $OCEAN tokens and it allows users to earn rewards, participate in governance and directly influence how the H2O protocol earns revenue. psdnOCEAN liquid tokens are transferable and all rewards are distributed in $OCEAN and&nbsp;$PSDN.</p> How to earn psdnOCEAN? <p>To earn psdnOCEAN users need to exchange $OCEAN for psdnOCEAN. To enjoy the incentives offered by psdnOCEAN, holders can stake their tokens in one of the following ways:</p>  By providing liquidity in the psdnOCEAN/OCEAN LP to&nbsp;earn:    80% revenue share of locked veOCEAN (4 years) through psdnOCEAN.  80% revenue share generated through the allocation of veOCEAN in Data&nbsp;Farming.  $PSDN Emissions  <p>2.

<p>RBAC, ABAC, and PBAC are all access controls that can help keep certain information or systems restricted to those based on user, environment, role and more.</p>
<p>What do RBAC, ABAC and PBAC stand for? PBAC stands for Policy Based Access Control, ABAC stands for Attribute-Based Access Control, and PBAC stands for Policy Based Access Control.</p>
 What Is Access Control? 
<p>Access control is using security measures to protect system resources against unauthorized access. Because such protection is foundational to nearly any security framework, regulatory compliance standard, and basic security strategy, it is often one of the paramount security technologies a company will implement.</p>
<p>Access control can include several different components, but a few of the most important are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/authorization-vs-authentication/">Authentication</a>: Authentication is verifying user presence and identity by comparing provided credentials against a digital identity contained within a system. Often the first line of defense in access control setups, authentication is responsible for determining that a user is who they say they are and that they are present at the point of verification. 
 Authorization: Authorization is the (often continuing) determination of a user’s privileges and ability to access system resources. These privileges include access to data (including the ability to read, modify, or execute files), modifying system services, or changing system configurations. 
 Identity: At the heart of both authentication and authorization are the use of digital identities for users. These identities contain critical business operations and security information, including authentication credentials or data related to that user’s role in the company. 
 
<p>Authentication systems will use credentials for that identity to verify users, and authorization services will rely on that identity to determine system privileges.</p>
<p>The terminology can be flexible, however. These combined services will sometimes be called <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/identity-management/what-is-iam">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a>. Additionally, experts often refer to system authorization methods when referring to access control.</p>
 What Are Different Types of Access Control? 
<p>The central goal of access control is to ensure that unauthorized users do not access restricted resources while also allowing authorized users to do what they need to do within the confines of their job, position, and privileges. Thus, access control can provide a complex and challenging exercise for security professionals to balance these priorities.</p>
<p>With that fact in mind, there are several methods for implementing access controls, each built around specific needs and philosophies of authorization. These include:</p>
 Access Control List (ACL) 
<p>Access control lists are the meat and potatoes of access controls. An ACL is, in its simplest form, a list of users that can access system resources. Anyone on the list can access the designated resources and no one else.</p>
<p>This simple approach is easy to deploy for simple services and can provide some excellent security in a black-and-white practice. ACLs also often serve in tandem with other forms of access control. However, as a standalone method, ACLs are also rigid and hard to adapt to more complex technical and organizational structures.</p>
 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
<p>Perhaps the most well-known form of access control, RBAC relies on an organizational hierarchy or structure to help define privileges in a technical system. This approach has several critical benefits, including its ability to conform to principles of least privilege and its clear adherence to the structure of a business–that is, it can support existing role structures rather than relying on the organization to change to support access control.</p>
<p>Because organizational roles and responsibilities differ between enterprises, there are several subtypes of RBAC. <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/conference-paper/2000/07/26/the-nist-model-for-role-based-access-control-towards-a-unified-/documents/sandhu-ferraiolo-kuhn-00.pdf">The National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> defines these four subtypes as an increasingly restricted access structure:</p>
 
 Flat: Every employee in an organization has at least one role that aligns with a specific level of access. 
 Hierarchical: Role access is defined by seniority in that, as employees move up the hierarchy (through promotion or otherwise), they gain new access privileges while retaining old ones. That is, rules for access at the top of the hierarchy contain the privileges of the roles on the lower levels. 
 Constrained: Includes separation of duties. So, RBAC systems could functionally be a flat systems but include duty-based privileges for roles that are otherwise the same. 
 Symmetrical: Symmetrical systems include regular reviews of role-based privileges and changes in access permissions based on changes to roles or other security issues. 
 
 Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 
<p>ABAC is a more specialized and fine-grained form of access control. Unlike RBAC, which focuses on the user’s role, ABAC collects data points from several contexts to determine access.</p>
<p>Some of these contexts include:</p>
 
 User Attributes: User attributes are those inherent to the user, including their department, business role, job, or clearance level. 
 Environmental Attributes: Environmental attributes are inherent in an access session’s context, including time or location of access or something related to the user’s behavior. 
 Resource Attributes: Resource attributes are those inherent to the resource accessed. This can include regulatory requirements for documents (HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc.), classification, or sensitivity to business operations. 
 Action Attributes: Action attributes are those inherent to the actions the user wants to take with the resource–reading, writing, copying, deleting, executing, etc. 
 
<p>Because there are so many different criteria for access in an ABAC system, control can get fine-tuned across multiple contexts. Furthermore, these contexts can provide a dynamic approach to access–that is, as the context changes (even from hour to hour), access privileges will also change.</p>
<p>The flip side is that, with so many different variables in play, ABAC can quickly become costly and challenging to implement without expert planning.</p>
 Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC) 
<p>PBAC sites are somewhere between RBAC and ABAC in terms of complexity. As the name suggests, PBAC emphasizes access policies, which can include governance over many of the same attributes as an RBAC or ABAC setup. PBAC focuses on the overarching policies that determine access rather than the individual roles or attributes that make up the policies.</p>
 Which Form of Access Control Should I Use? 
<p>As with any security, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to access control. Different strategies will fit different business contexts as well as security capabilities.</p>
<p>When considering adopting an access control system, consider the following factors:</p>
 
 Granularity refers to the level of control an organization has over its access systems. Fine-grained access control would provide more granularity, often with more available criteria or mechanisms that support complex access control configurations, with expanded costs regarding technology, money, and time to manage. 
 
<p>Conversely, coarse-grained access may cover fewer access criteria but cost less to implement and maintain.</p>
 
 Security: How well can the system effectively protect system resources without sacrificing accessibility? An overly-rigid access control system can prove to be more of a detriment than a benefit if not configured properly, regardless of how secure it is. 
 Flexibility: Roles and contexts change, and flexibility is a huge boon with modern IT infrastructure. Some organizations need access control systems that can support changing conditions, sometimes daily, while others are OK with rigid and secure approaches. 
 
<p>With these criteria in mind, each access control approach suits a few specific needs:</p>
 
 RBAC: If your organization has a clearly-defined hierarchy, or utilizes company roles to determine data access without too much consideration outside of those roles, then RBAC is suitable. Its alignment with business hierarchies and relatively simple implementation make up for the lack of fine-grained control. 
 ABAC: If your organization needs to manage access across several contexts that cannot be put under a simple policy or role, especially if you also need those controls to function dynamically, then ABAC is an appropriate approach. Note, however, that ABAC can become highly complex and would require significant time and effort to manage. 
 PBAC: If regulatory requirements or other security demands primarily determine your access controls, and you need maximum flexibility to apply those controls over different business contexts, then PBAC is a good choice.

 Institutions adopt asset tokenization with recession in sight 
<p>It seems like everywhere we look, prices are soaring. As fast as Covid-19 faded, the world faces yet another challenge with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, broad high inflation and a fast tightening monetary policy. The rising cost of living and of doing business is bolstering consumer and entrepreneur pessimism across the globe, raising the question of whether a global recession is coming our way.</p>
 TraFi is on the brink of a recession 
<p>In Europe, Credit Suisse’s stock dropped more than 50% this year so far, there’s a restructuring plan being designed and thousands may be fired. Some even compare it to Lehman Brothers’ collapse more than a decade ago. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, Deutsche Bank’s stock is also under immense pressure.</p>
 Crypto winter is far from over 
<p>Likewise, the DeFi world is also suffering from the adverse macroeconomic environment. The cryptocurrency sector lost $2 trillion since November last year, and the winter is far from over. Rather than taking a negative view of it, we see this as the necessary process for an industry to mature. As they say in the crypto world, it is time to “BUIDL”.</p>
 Tokenization is one of the sectors that is thriving 
<p>The time has come to reshape existing businesses to bring about radical change. Tokenization is the innovation financial institutions need to stay relevant and competitive. There are three main needs as catalysts for institutional tokenization adoption:</p>
 
 
 Cost reduction:&nbsp;Wiping out manual, expensive and time-consuming procedures, tokenization reduces the costs of management and corporate actions significantly thanks to automation through smart contracts. 
 Increased liquidity: Automated compliance and easier transferability increase the liquidity of the assets, which is a crucial market feature during downturns. 
 New revenue streams:&nbsp;Digital onboarding and fractionalization of assets allows institutions to reach a broader and global audience. In addition, institutions are able to monetize their services in DeFi at a low integration cost due to interoperability. 
 
 The institutional adoption is happening now 
<p>Tokenization is the future of finance. As history has shown, companies that fail to adopt innovative technologies risk being eliminated from the market. Thus, most institutions began to adopt tokenization. In the last 10 months, demand for our tokenization technology has doubled, mostly from major institutions, and several deals were signed with large entities.</p>
<p>It’s fair to conclude that even in this uncertain macro-financial environment and crypto winter, many mainstream institutions are already surfing the next wave to revolutionize finance and breaking from the decades-long status quo on how the financial world operates.</p>

  Launch of Data Spaces Support Centre to build a more sustainable digital future
trudy

17 October 2022 - 11:27

                    
      
    
      
             <p>Last week saw the launch of the Data Spaces Support Centre. Funded by the European Commission as part of the Digital Europe Programme, the Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC) will explore the needs of data space initiatives, define common requirements and establish best practices to accelerate the formation of sovereign data spaces as a key element of digital transformation at all levels. INNOPAY is proud to be an associated partner of the DSSC and is eager to contribute to its ambitions, which are very much in line with INNOPAY’s own mission to create a more sustainable digital future.</p>

 Blueprint for data spaces in Europe 

<p>The DSSC will identify standards, technologies and tools to enable both the public and private sectors in Europe to use and share data across sectors. It will carry out comparisons in regard to sectoral requirements for security and access procedures, while considering sector-specific standardisation activities. The project will create appropriate conditions for building an open data ecosystem characterised by interoperability and mutual trust between all participants. The goal is to provide a blueprint for data spaces that comprises common building blocks for business, legal, operational, technical and societal aspects.&nbsp;</p>

 Supporting knowledge transfer&nbsp;and resource sharing 

<p>To foster the adoption of common building blocks and standards for data spaces, the DSSC will contribute to knowledge transfer, resource sharing and active stakeholder engagement through activities such as a web portal, a helpdesk and toolboxes. It will also support the work of the envisaged Data Innovation Board aimed at enhancing the interoperability of data as well as fostering data sharing services between different sectors and domains.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>With its investigation against BAYC creator Yuga Labs, the SEC has made its intentions clear that NFTs, too, are within its&nbsp;radar.</blockquote><blockquote>The SEC is scrutinizing Yuga Labs to study if its NFT collections are actually securities.</blockquote><blockquote>Other than the Yuga Labs’ popular NFT collection, Bored Ape Yacht Club, the SEC is also looking into its Apecoin token distribution.</blockquote><p>In a move that may ring warning bells among NFT enthusiasts, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Yuga Labs for its collection of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the ApeCoin (APE) cryptocurrency.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1579876549683458050?s=20&amp;t=vYh5FEGfIaPmMAa0hd7TBw">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>If we go by the Bloomberg report, an anonymous source claimed that the SEC believes that Yuga’s labs’ NFT tokens are unregistered securities.</blockquote><p>Speaking of the Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT collection, it is among the most popular NFT collections today. Launched in 2021, it had an original minting price of 0.08 ETH and has reached a floor price of 75.6 ETH&nbsp;today.</p><p>On the other hand, ApeCoin (APE) is a community-driven, utility-based token for the BAYC community, which is issued by the ApeCoin DAO and the Ape Foundation. Built on top of Ethereum, APE is a governance token released earlier this year to be used within the APE ecosystem.</p><p>The token was distributed to the holders of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club&nbsp;members.</p><p>62% of the APE Coin’s one billion fixed supply was allocated to the ApeCoin community, while 5% was airdropped to existing NFT holders. Additional percentages of tokens were allocated to Yuga Labs and the four founders of&nbsp;BAYC.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/kim-kardashian-slapped-by-the-sec-with-over-a-1m-penalty-for-an-unlawful-crypto-promotion">Kim Kardashian Slapped by the SEC With Over a $1M Penalty for an Unlawful Crypto Promotion</a></p> What Exactly is the SEC Looking&nbsp;Into? <p>The SEC is specifically reviewing whether some of Yuga Labs’ NFTs are more similar to stocks and should be subject to the same disclosure rules. On top of that, it is further examining the distribution of ApeCoin to the NFT holders at no&nbsp;cost.</p> Is it the First Time the NFT Space has come Under the SEC’s&nbsp;Radar? <p>No, this is not the first time the NFT segment has come under the SEC’s radar. Reportedly, the SEC has been investigating NFT creators and collections since March to determine whether the NFTs exhibit the properties of securities.</p><p>So, Yuga Labs is just one of several companies being investigated by the SEC as it analyzes the broader NFT market. As such, we may see the SEC taking action against even more NFT creators in the coming&nbsp;days.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/herotimecbg/status/1579974529677668352?s=20&amp;t=-nPhecW2XPSFLa1q1L6qJA">Image Source</a>)<p>Thus, quite naturally, there is fear among industry players that the SEC’s probe of Bored Ape will not only cement the definition of NFTs as financial securities but also signals how the SEC will approach well-known tokens explicitly tied to such collections, like&nbsp;ApeCoin.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/sec-head-honcho-gary-gensler-double-downs-on-demand-for-strong-crypto-regulations-and-investor-protection">Kim Kardashian Slapped by the SEC With Over a $1M Penalty for an Unlawful Crypto Promotion</a></p> Statement From Yuga&nbsp;Labs​​ (<a href="https://www.trendingtopics.eu/bored-ape-yacht-club-founder-yuga-labs-raises-450m-in-a-seed-investment/">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>“It’s well-known that policymakers and regulators have sought to learn more about the novel world of Web3. We hope to partner with the rest of the industry and regulators to define and shape the burgeoning ecosystem. As a leader in the space, Yuga is committed to fully cooperating with any inquiries along the way,” said a spokesperson for Yuga Labs, confirming that it was cooperating with the SEC’s probe into the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Complete the following sentence: “Cybersecurity is... / is not...”</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is... Cybersecurity is really hard. One of the things that I think we should never forget, we exist in an imperfect world. Security controls are varied and complex, and we face every day a dynamic and relentless adversary. So I always tell people cybersecurity is really, really hard and it needs us all to work together to make it a little bit easier for some of us.</p>
<p>What prompted you to work in cybersecurity?</p>
<p>I think I was first prompted to work in cybersecurity many, many years ago when I realized that some of the world's most complex and largest networks were only as strong as their weakest link. And that, you know, that led me down a series of sort of engineering and developing pathways, which really helped me understand that the interlinked nature of everything we build from a technology perspective has to be seen through a lens of security and privacy. And every time you enable a piece of that technology landscape, you also need to protect it. You know, rolling out secure networks for governments around the world was, I think, the first realization for me that every single time you connect something, you also have to protect it.</p>
<p>If you could go back in time and tell your younger self something about cybersecurity, what would it be?</p>
<p>I think if I had a time machine and I could go back and talk to myself, I'd ask a series of questions. But the piece of advice I would give would be never assume that other people understand the implications of security or actually take it as seriously as you do. I think most organizations, businesses, governments and people are positively minded. They think about the good that the world can bring. They think about the opportunities. But so seldom do they really understand and are able to articulate the cybersecurity risk that's facing them or their organizations. So the piece of advice would be, we never assume that people understand their risk and they understand the complexity of the security world behind it. I think if we start every conversation with reminding ourselves the importance, the impact and the risk, you know, we will level set every time. That would be my piece of advice to myself, because I think that's a that's a really important place to start.</p>
<p>What are you looking forward to most at the conference in November?</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to getting together in Berlin in November and sharing with lots of other people, I think, who are joining virtually. The thing that I most look forward to in these events is taking the time, taking the time to share ideas with other people who have got unique and expert perspectives and really thinking about what's coming next. We so often understand and are planning for what's happening today, this month, next month, next year. But actually genuinely thinking about the next wave of change and what will quantum mean and how will we manage identities in the metaverse, how will people and organizations interact to develop an enhanced privacy? These are the things that I'm really looking forward to, sharing and understanding with peers and experts from around the world.</p>
<p>Is there anything you would like to add?</p>
<p>One thing that I would really ask and hope from the people attending the conference and actually for the entire security community, is that we help organizations who are smaller or less fortunate than ourselves. Security has always been an opportunity and an industry designed for large, complex, well-funded organizations. And we help build large, complex and expensive solutions. What I think we're moving into now is an area where security affects everybody, no matter your size. And it's something I'd really like our industry to do is think not just about the large organizations and the large risks, but the smaller organizations who have just as equal importance in this ecosystem but don't have the skills, the capability or always the funding to address security in a way that should be. So that would be my call to action, it’s let's help the little guys as well as the big large organizations.</p>

<p>Multi-party Computation (MPC) has recently emerged as one of the most promising techniques for protecting secrets such as cryptographic keys and personally identifiable information (PII). So far, data protection has largely focused on data at rest and in transit. MPC-based techniques fill the gap by providing data protection in use, enhancing security and privacy to traditional security approaches.</p><p>In Gartner’s recent research note, “Hype Cycle for Digital Identity, 2022,” MPC is classified as currently falling down the Trough of Disillusionment. Despite the declining expectation and hype, MPC is predicted to be “transformational” in 5–10 years. Hence, we expect that MPC will be mainstream by the end of this&nbsp;decade.</p>Gartner Hype Cycle for Digital Identity, 2022<p>Here, we outline the MPC’s overview and discuss its use cases and applications. Although the inherent capabilities of MPC are broad, here we limit our discussion to key management applications of&nbsp;MPC.</p> Overview <p>Multi-party Computation (MPC) is a cryptographic technique for multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs secret from the others. A more elaborate definition is also given in “Hype Cycle for Digital Identity, 2022” by Gartner as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>Secure multi-party computation (s-MPC or MPC) is a method of distributed computing and cryptography that enables entities (e.g., applications, individuals, organizations, or devices) to work with data while keeping data or encryption keys in a protected state. Specifically, MPC allows multiple entities to share insights while keeping identifiable or otherwise sensitive data confidential from each&nbsp;other.</blockquote><p>In essence, MPC could be considered a form of distributed computing, where distinct parties spreading over the network perform a joint computation of any function with arbitrary input. However, such computation comes at a great cost and requires a much greater number of computation steps compared to normal computation. A typical example of MPC is where multiple employees jointly compute the average of their salaries while each employee does not reveal their salary to the others. Such an example has been detailed extensively elsewhere, e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://inpher.io/technology/what-is-secure-multiparty-computation/">here</a>.</p><p>The concept of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) has been formulated since the 1980s. Two-party computation was first introduced by Yao in 1986 for <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4568207">[FOCS 86]</a>. Later, Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson introduced a more generalized formulation for any number of parties <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/How-to-play-any-mental-game%2C-or-a-completeness-for-Goldreich-Micali/08245022f6b376397ebce43c8e00af0fa3d7a28c">[STOC 1987]</a>. Thanks to Moore’s law as well as the four decades of research, MPC has matured to the point where it is now practical to use in real-world applications. Different techniques have also been developed to construct MPC protocols that suit different scenarios and use cases, which results in its gradual adoption in recent&nbsp;years.</p> Security Models <p>The main security consideration for developing an MPC protocol&nbsp;include:</p>  Correctness: the MPC protocol gives the correct output for the given function and input;&nbsp;and  Privacy: no party should be able to learn anything except the output of the MPC protocol.  <p>To consider the security of an MPC protocol, we must review how one or more participating parties that become corrupted, also called adversaries, could attack the protocol. The abilities of such adversaries indicate the security level of the MPC protocol, also known as the adversarial model. Two common MPC adversarial models include the semi-honest and malicious adversarial models:</p>  In the semi-honest adversarial model, which is also known as the honest-but-curious or passive model, the adversaries are capable of reading or learning all the information to and from the corrupted parties. However, the adversaries are assumed to strictly follow the specified MPC protocol, e.g., corrupted parties will provide proper inputs to the MPC protocol.  In the malicious adversarial model, which is also known as the active model, the adversaries are capable of acting arbitrarily and deviating from the specified MPC protocol. In other words, a single adversary may control or learn any information from the corrupted parties.  <p>An MPC protocol that only achieves the semi-honest security level guarantees no data leakage only when the adversaries are also semi-honest. That is, corrupted parties, which follow the specified MPC protocol, cannot learn anything more than the output. On the other hand, if an MPC protocol achieves the malicious security level, it guarantees that no adversarial attack can&nbsp;succeed.</p><p>There are also other security models that are not listed above, e.g., the covert adversarial model <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/060.pdf">[AL 2007]</a>. Unfortunately, adversarial models with higher security often come at a higher cost, and MPC practitioners must consider the tradeoff between security and efficiency that is suitable for their use&nbsp;cases.</p> Key Management Applications <p>The biggest fear of anyone who owns a cryptocurrency wallet is to lose their private key or get it stolen. Losing a private key means losing access to your cryptocurrency for practically eternity. As a result, many key management strategies have been invented such as using seed phrases. One of the most popular approaches is distributed key management using Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS), known as key sharding. Key sharding splits a private key into many pieces to prevent a single point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Recently, MPC has become a popular method for implementing key sharding. The advantage of using MPC is that the full private key is never exposed in its full form anywhere, neither during key generation, digital signature creation, or key recovery. This closes many potential vulnerabilities of traditional key-sharding solutions.</p> Shamir Secret&nbsp;Sharing <p>Before we discuss key management applications of MPC, let’s first briefly describe the underlying cryptography for secret sharing, the Shamir Secret Sharing&nbsp;(SSS).</p><p>SSS was introduced by Adi Shamir as one of the first threshold secret-sharing schemes <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/359168.359176">[S 1979]</a>. Shamir’s shares are formulated as the polynomial interpolation over finite fields. SSS allows a secret — such as a private key — to be split into multiple parts, called shares (denoted by n). To recover the secret, a minimum number of shares, called the threshold (denoted by t), is required. As a result, an SSS scheme is often written as (t,n)-threshold scheme. For example, in a (4,6)-threshold scheme, a private key may be split into 6 parts with a threshold of 4. Here, at least 4 out of 6 shares are required to reconstruct the private&nbsp;key.</p><p>Traditional SSS schemes fully reconstruct a secret from its shares. This leaves a brief vulnerability for an adversary to recover the secret right after the reconstruction. For example, during key share generation, if a full private key is first generated before it is divided into shares, the adversary has the potential to intercept the full private key before it is deleted from the&nbsp;memory.</p> Distributed Key Generation <p>By using MPC, the private key shares that constitute a full private key can be generated in such a way that the private key is divided into multiple parts since its&nbsp;origin.</p> Distributed Digital Signature Creation <p>To create a digital signature, the traditional key sharding approaches require the reconstruction of a private key. As a result, the private key is exposed in memory during the signing transaction, leaving a brief potential vulnerability for the attack. By using MPC, the key shares generated by the MPC protocol can be used to create shares of digital signature in a distributed manner that does not reconstruct the private key. Later, the shares of the digital signature can be aggregated into the full digital signature.</p> Distributed Key Recovery and Key Redistribution <p>In a similar manner to using MPC for digital signature creation, it can be used for key recovery and key redistribution — i.e., recovering key shares that are lost or distributing a new set of key shares to a new set of holders — without exposing a full private key anywhere. As long as the number of missing key shares is below the threshold that is set during the initial key share generation, the rest of the key shares can be used to generate a new set of key shares while preserving the underlying public and private key&nbsp;pairs.</p> Key Management Use&nbsp;Cases  Cryptocurrency Wallet <p>Currently, the most popular use case for MPC is, by far, key management for cryptocurrency wallets. Since the security of cryptocurrency wallets relies on the security of their private key, MPC is a great option for enhancing the overall security of the wallets by mitigating the risk of losing private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>By dividing private keys into key shares, if some key shares are lost, the remaining shares, whose number is greater than or equal to the set threshold, can still be used to reconstruct the private key or can be used to digitally sign a transaction. The key shares may be spread to different physical locations — e.g., to a combination of hot and cold storage — making it harder for an adversary to steal more key shares than the set threshold.</p> Enterprise-authorized signatories <p>MPC can also be used to digitally sign traditional documents, e.g., signature authorization for enterprises. Activities of a company must be authorized by the board of directors where each action requires a specific number of directors to authorize it in the form of signatures.</p><p>The directors may authorize a specific action by signing separately and asynchronously. However, this complicates the verification process since multiple signatures may be created by any set of directors and in any order. To simplify the verification process, the MPC approach could be employed where key shares are distributed to the directors. The corresponding public key that represents the company may be publicly published as well as certified by a reputable Certification Authority (CA). As a result, the verification process now involves verifying a single signature that is created by a number of directors above the set threshold.</p> Extracting Intersection of Data&nbsp;Records <p>Another notable use case for MPC is extracting intersecting data records from multiple databases. This use case requires using MPC together with a private set intersection (PSI) protocol that allows multiple parties to retrieve the intersection of their input without revealing the input to the other parties. For example, food delivery companies may wish to find the intersection of their customers’ food preferences for marketing purposes. However, the companies may be limited by personal data protection regulations such that they cannot directly share their customers’ information.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_set_intersection#/media/File:Example_PSI_diagram_depicting_basic_security_requirements.png">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_set_intersection#/media/File:Example_PSI_diagram_depicting_basic_security_requirements.png</a><p>Alice and Bob use the PSI protocol to find the interaction of their sets, {1,3}. Here, Alice does not learn Bob’s items that are not in the intersection, {4,5,9}, and, similarly, Bob does not learn Alice’s&nbsp;{2}.</p> Conclusion <p>Multi-Party Computation (MPC) has been well under research and development for several decades and has now become sufficiently mature for industrial adoption. Implementing MPC to enhance the security of an application has the advantage of eliminating a single point of failure. MPC also enhances privacy by allowing shared computation between multiple parties without revealing their&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>The industry has now started to embrace and develop MPC products. Notable examples include companies in the <a href="https://www.mpcalliance.org/">MPC alliance</a>. For example, <a href="https://sepior.com/">Sepior</a> and <a href="https://zengo.com/mpc-wallet/">Zengo</a> implement MPC for Digital Asset Wallet and Custody Infrastructure. <a href="https://keyless.io/technology/cryptography">Keyless</a> also developed an MPC authentication protocol to enable privacy-preserving key share recovery. <a href="https://www.unboundtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Unbound_Tech_A_Primer_in_Secure_Multiparty_Computation_MPC.pdf">Unbound Tech</a> utilizes MPC technology for cryptographic key management and protection solutions.</p><p>At Finema, we are developing an MPC key management application for Self-Sovereign Identity solutions. The MPC technology allows us to provide privacy-first solutions for our users by mitigating the risks of losing private keys in identity&nbsp;wallets.</p> References <p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/359168.359176">[S 1979]</a> Shamir, A., 1979.

Once it comes into implementation, it would make it possible for countries to monitor the cross-border transfer of crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><blockquote>Commenting on this release, OECD secretary-general Mathias Cormann said the new crypto reporting framework and the amendment made to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) will help “ensure that the tax transparency architecture remains up-to-date and effective.”</blockquote><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/albania-gives-the-green-light-to-regulating-crypto-exchanges">Albania Gives the Green Light to Regulating Crypto Exchanges</a> ‍</p> In Response to Crypto’s Rapid&nbsp;Growth (<a href="https://twitter.com/Jaime_Esteves/status/1517786544660226048?s=20&amp;t=pNjXKZd8KVWYuSbS7skyug">Image Source</a>)<p>The report defines cryptocurrencies as “assets that can be held and transferred in a decentralized manner, without the intervention of traditional financial intermediaries.” It then goes on to cover derivatives issued in the form of a crypto-asset, stablecoins, and certain non-fungible tokens&nbsp;(NFTs).</p><p>Intermediaries and other service providers that facilitate exchanges between crypto assets, such as exchanges, brokers, and ATM operators, will also be included in the scope of&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>However, the scope of crypto assets covered by the current standards in the Common Reporting Standard “does not provide tax administrations with adequate visibility on when taxpayers engage in tax-relevant transactions in or hold relevant crypto assets,” stated the&nbsp;report.</p><p>(<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/730876/cryptocurrency-maket-value/">Image Source</a>)</p><p>That’s why the OECD has created this new framework, CARF, which also comes in light of the crypto industry’s rapid growth — from $135 billion in March 2020 to surpass $3 trillion by the end of 2021 before plummeting this&nbsp;year.</p><p>In addition, these developments align with the recent developments from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the form of the global anti-money laundering standards, which the crypto industry has pushed back&nbsp;on.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-white-house-launches-a-comprehensive-framework-for-crypto-assets">The White House Launches a Comprehensive Framework for Crypto&nbsp;Assets</a></p> Broader Implementation of&nbsp;CARF <p>According to the CARF rules, crypto asset firms must report in the country where they conduct their businesses.

<p>On Wednesday October 19th, InfoCert will take part of the main romanian event for fintech and digital banking sector: the Future Banking Conference 2022, the physical event will take place in Brașov.</p>



<p>Adrian Moraru – Sales Director for Romania at InfoCert – will introduce you to Dizme, a blockchain-based app that enables users to manage their Digital Identity.</p>



 What’s all the fuss about decentralized identity? 



<p>Decentralized identity is the upcoming paradigm in identity management. It allows people to control their own digital identity, and ensures that anything is provable and will be accepted and trusted by banks, fintechs or different online services.</p>



<p>But what’s more important for financial service providers is that decentralized identity raises lots of opportunities, reduces repetitive and expensive processes, and is customer focused.</p>



 What is DIZME and what DIZME brings new? 



<p><a href="https://www.dizme.io/">DIZME</a> is a decentralized platform that promotes Self Sovereign Identity principles for distributed management of your identity and information. DIZME allows you to create an ecosystem in which you become the true “owner” of your digital identity, combining several functions and features:</p>



  A full SSI wallet available as free app, white label app and SDK;  an easy and fast identification process;  sign documents via eIDAS qualified signature;  push realtime messages via secure channel;  one universal log-in for everything.  



<p>We like to think of DIZME as the future present, as it far anticipates what will be the trend soon.&nbsp; DIZME is the first decentralized identity network to combine the benefits of the SSI world with the compliance to eIDAS regulation and to GDPR.</p>



<p>InfoCert is inviting you to Future Banking Summit to find out more about decentralized identity, why it matters in 2022 and how to profit from this change of paradigm.</p>

<p>In July the UN/CEFACT eDATA project published a white paper on the adoption of Verifiable Credentials for Cross Border Trade. It discusses many aspects of the topic, from macro economic drivers to technical details and common use cases. As a co-author, I obviously recommend it to anyone with an interest in international standards and digitization of supply&nbsp;chains:</p><p><a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-07/WhitePaper_VerifiableCredentials-CBT.pdf">https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-07/WhitePaper_VerifiableCredentials-CBT.pdf</a></p><p>In this blog post, I will specifically focus on the concept of Trust Graphs, introduced in the white paper (section 3.3). Trust Graphs essentially combine the cryptographic verifiability of VCs with the data analytics potential of knowledge graphs. I will elaborate on the potential of this combination, and implement it as a graph algorithm in&nbsp;Neo4j.</p> Introducing the Sample Trust&nbsp;Graph United Nations CEFACT sample Trust&nbsp;Graph.<p>Above is the sample trust graph from the white paper. It exemplifies a number of Verifiable Credentials issued by Issuers about Subjects. On the left hand side are a number of Trust Anchors. These are Entities which the verifiers on the right hand side have undergone processes to trust. As an example, the trade finance Bank has established the Customs authority of a foreign country as a Trust&nbsp;Anchor.</p><p>The Bank receives an Invoice for a shipment issued by a foreign Exporter. Being a VC, the Invoice can be cryptographically traced to the Exporter. But if the bank does not know that Exporter, verifiability alone is not enough to establish trust.</p><p>However, the Exporter holds an Authorized Economic Operator certificate issued by Customs. When presented with both VCs, the Bank can establish a cryptographically verifiable chain back to the Customs Trust&nbsp;Anchor.</p><p>The two mentioned Verifiable Credentials could for example be instances of <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#CommercialInvoiceCertificate">Commercial Invoice</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://w3id.org/traceability/#CTPATCertificate">CTPAT</a>.</p><p>Note that the top most branch of the trust graph does not end at a Trust Anchor. This is where the verifying side needs to focus attention. All the rest, which does trace back to Trust Anchors can be processed completely automated. This is a huge deal to verifiers. Banks, customs authorities, large importers and exporters process thousands of documents each day. Massive amount of resources are spent on risk assessment based on human judgment of PDFs with analogue signatures.</p><p>A trust graph is the key which unlocks digitizing international documentation procedures: establish and grow Trust Anchor points and trace data verifiably back to&nbsp;them.</p> Verifiable Credential Link&nbsp;Details Graph link details: credential issuer and&nbsp;subject.<p>Zooming in slightly, each of the graph edges are represented graphically by the arrows going from “I” to “S”. This reads “Customs has issued an AEO Certificate about the Exporter”.</p><p>This is a nice abstraction. Anyone familiar with the Verifiable Credentials data model will know that in fact that “AEO Cert” arrow is a VC node with two edges. Not an issue at all, just something to keep in mind as we switch into “real” graph data perspective in a minute. Here, our data model will&nbsp;be:</p>The actual data&nbsp;model. A Note on Identifiers <p>A quick word about the identifiers too: the identifiers in the sample trust graph are a bit sketchy. “customs.gov.x“ is not a decentralized identifier, and certainly neither is “abcd”. However sketchy, the sample identifiers are locally unique and will be good enough for the point we are aiming to make here, so we’ll just go with&nbsp;them.</p><p>In reality, the customs DID for example would look something like did:web:customs.country.gov. This would resolve to a DID Document with public cryptographic material, and customs would control its private keys behind it. This is an essential part of the earlier described infrastructure, enabling verifiable data.</p> Verifiable Data&nbsp;Pipeline <p>In the following, we take the role of verifier. This could be one of the two verifiers represented on the sample diagram: a Trade Finance Bank or an Importer. But it could certainly also be destination-side Customs Authorities processing import filing data. Indeed, anyone else receiving data!</p>Building a knowledge graph from Verifiable Credentials.<p>We should imagine a bunch of inbound data documents which have originated through different APIs, varying channels, pipelines, and at different points in time. Some relate to the particular shipment at hand, others are about entities or organizations. Remember that every arrow on the Sample Trust Graph is a Verifiable Credential.</p><p>All data gets verified at the time it is presented. The bank, for example, verifies the Air Waybill when it is presented, the Packing List when it is presented, and so forth. Clearly, if the data does not verify, we will reject it immediately.</p><p>You can verify a sample Commercial Invoice&nbsp;<a href="https://api.did.actor/v/eJztV9122jgQfhUf721M_IMN-KoE0pQ25M9A0_T07BHyYJTYEpFkCOnpw_QZ-gh9sR0ZQkia9rTZu93cIenTzHwz8wnPZ_sVFVzDjbbjj_ZU65mKd3cXi0VtEdSEzHZ912vuUgkpcM1Irnbnnr1zDwxYWsG0JBTImOVMLw3k047NUju2S8njsmRpHEI9nHhh6NBWveXUXTd0SANCx484C5vjiIQtgob1cgYmkhFINmFknENn4xuPO6IoQFJc9PhcMAodkBqBlGgwPjkp8PoWzFrjrG3gjp2CopLNNBMc4V1BywJ9WBKokCnjmUUsZMQVoQZijUEvADjuKshzkBbhKS7G5RIkWmNKlYRT6Brjse27vu-4vuMHA8-LwzB23Ys1CuHx5w3JY5kRzm5JFcZdxlJM1hUs49uof6XfnIpgcnYmplf1eqrG-42oU7LBbK9Y9t9f-6PR5XwUkb0E9oOhvWHfJzfMalOQwurDDVLm4gfKr0vFvn_j1tKakLFEDK2WKVikuqi-f8tZau7lgq4C3Ar8JEeUiTgDsb1_AKIjqgxiJpQB5HhXl2mVlrAWNf0gaDYbkRuFkduorPPsDuB4rlsLvKARNJpNz627ftP-smOTNJWg1AP_QmmSt9cH6EZpCaDvNmK7PQfOUmJ1iMyFstCwvTF0iIRMmyLsDUj-_WsKt4Z4n0hyjzqDbJWpoxLmwjoEXOzYs8pxR1TxBr6_bbcjSq6lMVtlXdhfMHgoCMtxi_GJeAU3pJjlUOOgja2p4HBUFmPTFHaI0vD8htNoeoFhfS-5pBxfAtXb_NdNbZjPhNTHk_2V5ycqVHLku4p3mBwe7Bnb2AralAgJbgV9bmIqJZ0StdXJXtXJRvOr1v9V_77033-n_1Zv2y-K_TtpWTfEAXB8zqnVF1pIZYmJ1S7MhqH7OHOebz2Cd-WTueuCloLpJzLWZ3TKMsJ-SFgdy-87odd4MmvDpF2ljGkoVDJlsxnge_zxnt5AkhQOGYceIirtSZGWD5V5st7C04LwcoJ_IKV8Uc3_RTUPyzU8SqwkwJS4Fp1KUbCycDijV5BbGBDjOfrHX4BrKfJc1dD-Alg2fdBSp_htgeXAksxhRPJy_awzvSaUjxXem1cnqJ8oRHp3fVyxs-MQay6FUu9_z_idraYfVql65OyL6Xz8-0lmQFefVI8b7cfTT-s7GAumf73olFICpyvxdU3QL2J7EdszxXZAcuxbwjmQHFKrnQz6VtuJwsC6ZZw6TOJ3PMlzsXSowNSna-GpKWblT5S3EZofNZ8Sx0Pl-e7zpOeHQfQM7T0lvY3y6vWfKw9da4F1-8MwgyDyfhJmZe6ELM1g1TXg33wfWtEv3gfzCojJFt_91A9Dr5WwDPWE4jfjql19PZsa3w1jnuu4OIz5Mc5j9dAMY_Nqvlw574Oein8zev31jFmtInJSSpSL4UGUMgPqJpgd-3JhVArLt9PxAWXH7O3ri_2zwWnSU72i5x91etFF8VpRf4jroyU5P2XHuWIfLj-4vdxr1Wr9aFi-eY_2IYNRQN8xNrgu_AW_dJPRoNtqyTNO6sn0pjM8PzxjF7OCvnvnHWXXdTiH_Pht66SRaToNjk-yRGYXcHkx-nt_7xSL8A_wJWSc">here</a>.</p>Successful verification of a Commercial Invoice.<p>We would likely also re-verify credentials at the time we run our data analysis (a principle of <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">Zero Trust Architecture</a>). After all, credentials could have expired, been revoked, or issuing DIDs be deactivated.</p><p>Once verified, we can progress with our data analysis. Because Verifiable Credentials are Linked Data, they can be directly imported into a graph database, establishing a knowledge graph.</p> Building the Knowledge Graph <p>We will now switch focus to the right-hand side of the data pipeline. To simplify matters, we are pretending that all data at this point has been successfully verified. We are also going along with rather simplified sample data from the UN whitepaper. In reality, VCs typically contain lots of valuable data, but for this all we really need is the type of VC (AEO Cert, Invoice,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>I will use <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> to build and analyze the knowledge graph. If you want to follow along yourself, here is the cypher commands needed to establish the base&nbsp;data:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/nissimsan/trust-graphs/blob/main/sample-trust-graph/un-trust-graph-data.cypher">https://github.com/nissimsan/trust-graphs/blob/main/sample-trust-graph/un-trust-graph-data.cypher</a></p><p>Here is what we get when importing it:</p> Trust Determination Algorithm <p>With the verified knowledge graph in place, we can analyze the graph to determine potentially untrusted branches. As mentioned earlier, trust start from Trust Anchors — entities which have undergone due processes to establish them as a reliable authority of the type of credentials which they&nbsp;issue.</p>Example Trust&nbsp;Anchors.<p>The following cypher algorithm marks all graph nodes which trace back to a Trust Anchor. Starting from an evaluation node (“eval”) which in the case of the trade finance back is the shipment, it finds all paths back to the Trust Anchor points (“anchor”). All the five Trust Anchor points from the sample are defined as part of the command. Finally, all the nodes on the paths back to Trust Anchors are labeled as “trusted”.</p><blockquote>MATCH n=(eval)-[*]-(anchor)<br>WHERE eval.did = ‘xyz321’ AND anchor.did IN [‘trade.gov.x’, ‘customs.gov.x’, ‘agri.gov.x’, ‘accredit.org’, ‘ip.gov.x’]<br>FOREACH (m IN nodes(n) | SET m.trusted =&nbsp;true)</blockquote><p>In Neo4j Bloom, we can now paint a clear picture which indicates the part of the graph which needs attention. The Forwarder is not known already, and therefore we do not have a basis on which to trust the Air Waybill which it issued. Procedures must be initiated to assess whether the Forwarder is a legitimate and trustworthy actor.</p>Trust Graph implementation. Conclusion <p>The green parts of the Trust Graph can safely be automated — whether running finance rules and risk assessment, customs release or any other rules-based procedure. Manual focus can be switched to exception management, determining Trust Anchors. This is both cheaper, faster and&nbsp;safer.</p><p>We have seen here how the powerful United Nations CEFACT Trust Graph concept can be implemented. Digitization has traditionally been particularly difficult in the inherently heterogeneous environment of international trade. Cryptography and standards are the keys to unlock this potential.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-united-nations-trust-graph-d65af7b0b678">The United Nations Trust Graph</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Here I’m exploring the potential of combining cryptographically verifiable data with Neo4j’s Graph Data Science algorithms.</p><p>These are simple first steps. I made sure to keep a real business case in focus, albeit a simple one, clustering organizations based on the types of VCs they are connected to via standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer">issuer</a> relationship.</p><p>Sample data and commands are available on <a href="https://github.com/nissimsan/trust-graphs">https://github.com/nissimsan/trust-graphs</a> if you feel like following along.</p>Our very simple sample data&nbsp;set.<p>Above is a picture of our starting point. A knowledge graph, imported from various types of Verifiable Credential (orange) and Organization (blue)&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>Between them are issuer relationships as well as several other business relationships: manufacturer, consignee, shipper, etc, all from the credentialSubject. For simplicity, for now we will just focus on what insights we can reap just from the&nbsp;issuer.</p>The data model in&nbsp;focus.<p>The first thing we must always do when working in Neo4j GDS is to <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/graph-project/">project</a> an in-memory graph for the algorithms to run against. Below is a projection which “carves out” just the issuer relationship.</p>Basic projection.<p>This is a much more focused picture already. It is visually clear that we have removed clutter which is not relevant to our analysis.</p><p>However, these nodes no longer have anything topological in common. That’s not good for a graph algorithm. The answer is to merge the VCs by their types: Bill of Lading, Commercial Invoice,&nbsp;etc.</p>Verifiable Credentials merged by&nbsp;type.<p>Now, on a new projection we can run the <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/label-propagation/">Label Propagation</a> graph algorithm. It is a community detection algorithm, which determines communities based on node connection density. Clearly, we have found four types of organizations — communities — in our&nbsp;data.</p>Detected organization communities.<p>By writing this result back to the database, we can also make nice visuals of the same result, for example representing the Organization community clusters by&nbsp;color.</p>Organization communities visualization.<p>And so we have reached our goal, deriving business meaning from a knowledge graph produced from a set of Verifiable Credentials. We only used a single relationship, and a single one of Neo4j GDS’s <a href="https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/">catalog</a> of graph algorithms, and on a very small data set. Yet, it was enough for us to detect a meaningful pattern.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/neo4j-graph-data-science-with-verifiable-credential-data-98b806f2ad78">Neo4J Graph Data Science with Verifiable Credential Data</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated with the number of bad actors involved increasing at an alarming rate. New and sophisticated techniques are being used that have evolved over the years to leverage modern computational hardware. These developments have aided and abetted the guessing of passwords and hacking of digital credentials. While these threats expose the inherent weaknesses of password-based authentication schemes, simplistic identity-detached passwordless authentication is not the answer either.</p>
 Personnel Onboarding Risks and Requirements 
<p>Organizational risk tolerance for new hire onboarding is very low because of the Day 1 access granted to services and applications. Granting access comes with risk and therefore companies will try the usual means of identity proofing via background checks on government-issued documents, work history, address history, etc., as a means to establish trust. But there are limits to background checks that a company normally performs, as these might not extend exhaustively to domestic and international subcontractors. Therefore, establishing trust via identity-linked proofing becomes mandatory.</p>
<p>Passwordless for employees does not by itself inoculate the enterprise against credential compromise. Ensuring the employee is who they claim to be is the gap in most passwordless solutions today because while passwordless only eliminates friction in the employee’s journey, it does not make the journey more secure.</p>
<p>What is needed is a means to mitigate identity theft and identity spoofing to ensure the individual is exactly who they are claiming to be. For the new hire onboarding journey to be secure the employee’s identity must be established irrefutably as well. Companies ask for government-issued identity documents to prove an individual is who they are claiming to be, but that does not prove that the individual logging in to applications at any given time is indeed the same person.</p>
<p>Authorization is another added requirement for onboarding an existing employee to new applications and services. Risk is minimized best when there is continuous authentication as well as transactional authorization in place where the company checks for the identity and authentication assurance level of the individual in real-time before granting them access to critical service and application assets.</p>
 Privacy, PII and the Onboarding Process 
<p>A CIO is interested in simplifying and securing the Information Architecture of the Enterprise and implementing guardrails for preserving user privacy. Data privacy has recently attained critical focus in the international community with violations costing companies billions in penalties and significant reputational damage to boot. The organization has a fiduciary responsibility to protect the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of their employees and customers.</p>
<p>In essence, there are a few key factors driving the need for a digital transformation of the new hire onboarding process: verify the identity of the individual, secure the PII data in a way that it is impossible to compromise it, secure or even better, eliminate login credentials (i.e., passwords), implement continuous verification of the identity, continuous transactional authorization before granting access, and finally, ensure continuing privacy of the individual by imposing protections and restrictions on any PII release to third-parties.</p>
 Simplified Access 
<p>Simplified access to legacy systems using passwordless sign-on improves productivity, no doubt about that. Even better, enabling quick password resets to legacy apps after the individual has completed a strong <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/identity-authentication/">identity-based authentication</a> roundtrip using live biometrics enables faster and frictionless access to legacy applications. Another strategic benefit of deploying an identity-based passwordless solution is to reclaim 2FA spend on migrating legacy systems to passwordless. Why not re-use the identity from a secure digital identity wallet for onboarding new hires and existing employees to modern and legacy services?</p>
 Reduce Costs 
<p>A CIO’s broad mandate is to reduce IT costs, including personnel onboarding administration costs by implementing projects that automate the self-service workflows for new hire onboarding, identity proofing, and identity verification. Another key requirement is to reduce help desk costs, which can be implemented by automating password resets for legacy applications as described previously. This identity-based authentication strategy also eliminates help desk calls for those same password resets and reduces 24/7 helpdesk overhead and support costs with fewer complaints and ‘stalled’ or stuck employees.</p>
 Improve Security 
<p>A quick word is in order for a CISO’s mandate as well. They are looking to improve the overall security posture and prevent – or the more likely scenario – manage losses from data breaches (they are inevitable!). CISOs want to restrict the amount of PII stored in a central user repository to only what is needed to do business. A good information security program also attempts to eliminate vulnerabilities resulting from weak non-identity based authentication techniques.</p>
<p>In summary, CXOs want to simplify the information and information security architecture of the organization, minimize the reputational damage of information breach, and reduce their insurance liability at the same time. Why not go with an identity based authentication and proofing platform that makes mass credential compromise impossible?</p>
<p>It is clear that live biometrics-based aka identity-based authentication that uses pre-proofed identity is much stronger for use in a continuous authentication and continuous authorization paradigm than any other form of identity-detached passwordless scheme. It is the only way to verify that the individual is who they are claiming to be at the time of an access request.</p>
 1Kosmos Identity-Based Authentication 
<p>All these goals can only be achieved if an organization starts with identity and not just authentication. The traditional approach to passwordless authentication is to focus on MFA or passwordless login. While 1Kosmos is passwordless, we bring identity-based features to an authentication scheme used by the organization. This flexibility may be used to enhance the identity verification process using strong biometrics-based identity and verification of user credentials via industry standards.</p>
<p>What’s unique about 1Kosmos is that we start with Identity, instead of starting with authentication, as the basis for strong authentication and this enables us to solve many of the same challenges for both employees and customers. Our biometrics engine allows for continuous identity verification of the individual at login-time, and continuous transactional authorization at access-time, while remaining aligned with the company’s risk policies. It is no longer acceptable to identity-proof an employee or a customer once – for example during onboarding or new hire – and let them use services indefinitely.</p>
<p>By combining authentication with true Identity (NIST 800-63-3a principles and modified versions for corporate applications), you have a much higher assurance to know who is truly at the end of a digital connection every time they authenticate.</p>
<p>These principles apply to customers especially in the banking industry where strong KYC is needed. 1Kosmos is a member of the FIDO alliance, DIACC, The DIF foundation, Linux Foundation (for Trust over IP), W3C, and the COVID Credentials group. This ensures that you will have a partner with a product that is not only open, preventing vendor lock-in, but is on top of the latest trends in Identity.</p>

 Through blockchain technology and user behavior verification, DID is providing trust foundation for Web3 communication <p>Since the launch of OWN Infrastructure, Ontology has released multiple issues of Insights blogs and Twitter Spaces to share thoughts around the blossoming space that is trust infrastructure.</p><p>In this article, we review the first OWN Insights Twitter Spaces. The event featured Shrey Jain (@shreyjaineth), a well-known Microsoft Web3 researcher, to discuss “the path to Web3 Identity building”.</p><p>Shrey has in-depth insights into the field of decentralized identity (DID) and has authored several well-known papers and research reports, such as the recently released ‘A Plural Decentralized Identity Frontier: Abstraction v. Composability Tradeoffs in Web3’, with professional and in-depth research on the construction of decentralized identity and the realization of verifiable credentials.</p><p>Here are some of the highlights:</p> In Web3, communication is changing in a very meaningful way. <p>What are the key elements we need to transmit information externally? Tracing the history of communications, it is essential to have a trusted transmitter — one who can deliver information accurately, without looking at it, and without tampering with it. So, for the Internet, the transfer of trust requires that the communication protocol has some form of assurance that the information will not be interfered with along the way and that privacy will be guaranteed. However, in the current environment of the Web2 network, this demand is often not achieved, and a lot of personal privacy information is exposed in the communication process, such as personal identity, hobbies, and&nbsp;needs.</p><p>In response, cryptographic primitives are being used in Web3 to promote privacy protection and anti-censorship. For example, zero-knowledge proof technology can encrypt information and set a specific public key to unlock it, so as to achieve the purpose of information protection. In this way, Web3 communications can be more trusted — establishing secure delivery without manipulation or privacy violations. Before that, it is also crucial that the source of the information (the person) can be trusted, which will be achieved based on&nbsp;DID.</p> Four key goals that Decentralized Identity is achieving. <p>First we have privacy. Through verifiable credentials (VC), DID allows users to only provide relevant credentials instead of identity data on the premise of completing identity authentication, avoiding information collection and disclosure in the transmission process or at the receiving end.</p><p>Secondly, resistance to censorship. Combined with cryptography (zk) to encrypt identity data, a DID identifier is used to replace the real identity in the network, and users are allowed to construct multiple identities to achieve identity isolation.</p><p>Thirdly, there is interoperability with smart contracts. The universality of the DID specification enables the identity system to be integrated by various applications and platforms. Users need to use DID to fetch smart contracts to participate in DAOs, NFT activities, social interactions, and other on-chain interactions.</p><p>Finally, self-management. The identity data and VCs set by DID are owned and managed by users. Any party without a private or public key cannot read and manage DID and related&nbsp;data.</p><p>Among the above four key points, privacy and interoperability with smart contracts are the requirements that DID must meet, and they are also the preconditions for DID to achieve large-scale application. In particular, interoperability with smart contracts will promote the use of DID as a key identity account system in all fields of&nbsp;Web3.</p> From a sociological and non-technical perspective, network interaction can be used as proof of identity for verification. <p>When people collaborate in Web3, trust will be the key to making it work continuously and smoothly. This is one of the main reasons why building a “de-trust” solution into Web3 is getting a lot of attention. Therefore, for the public or non-technical people, we have to answer the question of how to prove identity and build a trust network? You don’t need KYC or biometrics to identify a person. As a social person, the accumulation of their interactive behaviors will also form their unique personality identity.</p><p>Therefore, it is also possible to establish a person’s accurate and true identity without disclosing personal privacy data through the user’s network behavior and the people who interact with them. Based on this certificate, others can trust the holder’s corresponding partial identity; The holder can obtain the trust of others in this respect by providing the proof. Currently, this set of logic has been implemented in the DID scheme. In both W3C’s DID recommendation standard and Ontology ONT ID framework, a scheme for individuals to verify the identity of others and form trusted credentials has been implemented.</p><p>Namely, DID holders authentication can not only be others’ authenticator, but also invite others to verify their identities, the identity credential that has been validated will be recorded in the blockchain. This credential will serve as part of the holder’s identity in the network, providing a source of trust. This is part of the first OWN Insights Twitter&nbsp;Spaces.</p><p>For more discussion, you can access the full <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1560340984692494336">Twitter&nbsp;Spaces</a>.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more. Individuals can also seamlessly and quickly access Web3 through products such as ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/own-insights-ama-review-four-key-points-of-did-implementation-with-microsoft-web3-researchers-92a70eb0f86f">OWN Insights AMA Review: Four key points of DID implementation with Microsoft Web3 Researchers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The ICC firmly believes that “switching from paper to digital documents will provide more transparency to help businesses, consumers, and governments make more informed choices on the products and suppliers they choose while making international trade faster, simpler and cheaper for all involved.” The ICC also expects to see the Bill lead to £225 billion in efficiency savings, £25 billion in SME trade growth and £1 billion new trade finance.</p>
<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is an essential component to realising the opportunity created by the Bill.</p>
<blockquote><p>“To help prepare the market for digitalised trade systems, C4DTI is launching a package of new services: [including] A national campaign in partnership with Ubisecure and the Global Legal Entity Identification Foundation (GLEIF) to promote the adoption of Legal Entity Identities (LEIs), the widely recognised and standardised organisation identifier. These will enable companies to speed up due diligence checks, reduce fraud and efficiently track secure transactions of goods and finance.”<br>
ICC United Kingdom</p>
<p>“The need to accurately identify, authenticate and trust organisations is essential if we are to realise the full potential of the digital economy. The LEI is the only publicly accessible global identifier that represents current organisation identity information, connects counterparties for trading, simplifies client onboarding, and enables trusted business relationships. Over 2m organisations already have LEIs, but this is the tip of the iceberg of the greater global economy.”<br>
Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO<br>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ubisecure, along with other ICC partners including Deloitte and Plexal, is honoured to be involved in the rollout of initiatives. Through our RapidLEI service, we are working closely with the ICC’s C4DTI, the GLEIF (Global LEI Foundation) and the Institute of Export and International Trade to educate and promote the use adoption of LEIs.</p>
<p>As well as a number of educational programmes, UK businesses can obtain special reduced pricing of just £35 per LEI at&nbsp;<a title="https://rapidlei.com/c4dti/" href="https://rapidlei.com/c4dti/">rapidlei.com/c4dti/</a>. RapidLEI is based in the UK with a local client service team ready to help UK businesses around the clock.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
 
 
<p>My name is Matt Raible, and I am a developer advocate at Okta. In early 2019, I created OktaDev Schematics to simplify my life when doing Angular demos. But let me step back a bit first. I’ve worked at Okta for over five years; before that, I was an independent consultant for 20 years, mainly doing Java and web development for clients.</p>
 
 
<p>I’ve learned a lot about OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Okta’s JavaScript SDKs over my years and only recently tried to use Auth0’s JavaScript SDKs. Over the last couple of weeks, I learned how to use them and integrated many into OktaDev Schematics.</p>
 
 
<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the experience because the configuration often boils down to two main values: <code>domain</code> and <code>clientId</code>. You do have to add callback URLs too, but these are often the same as your app’s homepage, so you don’t need to add routes in your application. And then, it just works! There’s no need to worry about issuers or other OIDC concepts.</p>
 
 
<p>This is a strong departure from how we’ve done things in Okta’s SDKs, where we expect people to know about OpenID Connect. We often try to educate developers about OAuth and OIDC but since these topics are complex, they can be challenging to understand. I like the approach of just needing two values, and everything just works!</p>

 What is OktaDev Schematics? 
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics">OktaDev Schematics</a> is a tool I developed to help streamline the integration of OpenID Connect into JavaScript (or TypeScript) applications.</p>
 
 
<p>In my first few years at Okta, I’d demo how to use our Angular SDK at conferences, and I’d inevitably miss a step, causing the demo to fail. A failing demo is frustrating, so I created OktaDev Schematics to fix it.</p>
 
 
<p>My idea was simple:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Create an app using the framework’s CLI</p>
 
 
<p>Integrate OIDC authentication using templates</p>
 
 
<p>Add a unit test to prove nothing breaks</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The project builds on <a href="https://angular.io/guide/schematics">Angular Schematics</a>, so it’s incredibly easy to use, particularly in Angular projects, but applies to other frameworks as well.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ng add @oktadev/schematics</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will prompt you for an issuer and client ID, and then OktaDev Schematics will configure your app to use them. If you’re using the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli">Auth0 CLI</a>, you’ll need to create a Single-Page Application (SPA) app to get these values.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>auth0 apps create</code> 
 
 
 






You can also create a SPA app using <a href="https:///manage.auth0.com">the Auth0 dashboard</a> if you prefer GUIs over CLIs.



 
 
<p>In the latest release, I’ve made it so that adding an <code>--auth0</code> flag will set up your project to use Auth0 instead of Okta.</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>OktaDev Schematics 6.0.0 is now available with full support for <a href="https://twitter.com/auth0?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@auth0</a>! 🤩<br><br>⭐️ <a href="https://t.co/PeK8gMBYsV">https://t.co/PeK8gMBYsV</a><br><br>Other improvements:<br><br>✅ Upgraded to Angular 14 and React 18<br>✅ Added support for Capacitor 4<br>✅ Removed Cordova and Vue 2 as options<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/javascript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#javascript</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/typescript?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#typescript</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/schematics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#schematics</a></p>— Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1566907778161049600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2022</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>If you’re using Angular or Ionic with Angular, you can create an app and then add OIDC authentication in just two commands!</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Angular: <code>ng new</code> and <code>ng add @oktadev/schematics --auth0</code></p>
 
 
<p>Ionic: <code>ionic start</code> and <code>ng add @oktadev/schematics --auth0</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>My <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/add-oidc-to-angular-apps-quickly/">Add OpenID Connect to Angular Apps Quickly</a> tutorial explains what this command does and shows screenshots of the changes. You can even <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-angular-example/pull/1/files">view the changes it makes on GitHub</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The tool is smart enough to detect the framework you’re using and if you’re using TypeScript or JavaScript.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to create a React or Vue app, you’ll need to perform a few steps:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Create your React app with Create React App:</p>
 
 
 npx create-react-app secure-app 
 
 
 






Add <code>--template typescript</code> if you want TypeScript support.



 
 
<p>For Vue, use <code>npx @vue/cli create secure-app</code>.</p>
 
 
 
<p>Install the Schematics CLI globally:</p>
 
 
 npm i -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli 
 
 
 
 
<p>In the <code>secure-app</code> project, install OktaDev Schematics and run the <code>add-auth</code> schematic:</p>
 
 
 npm i -D @oktadev/schematics
schematics @oktadev/schematics:add-auth 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>As you can guess, the integration is pretty bare-bones. It configures the SDK and adds a login/logout button. I believe this is in line with the apps each CLI generates. They’re pretty bare-bones too!</p>
 
 
<p>If you’d like to see how the templates differ between Okta and Auth0, you can <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/tree/main/src/add-auth">view the templates on GitHub</a>. If you have a GitHub account, you can also <a href="https://github.dev/oktadev/schematics">launch github.dev/oktadev/schematics</a> and navigate to <code>src/add-auth/{auth0,okta}</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 JavaScript Framework Support 
 
 
<p>There’s a wealth of popular frameworks currently supported by OktaDev Schematics:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#angular">Angular</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#react">React</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#vue">Vue</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#ionic">Ionic with Angular</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#react-native">React Native</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#express">Express</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>See the project’s <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics#links">links section</a> if you want to learn more about Okta or Auth0’s SDKs.</p>
 
 
<p>The support for Ionic currently only includes Angular. However, Ionic does support React and Vue too. To make OIDC authentication work, I leveraged <a href="https://github.com/wi3land/ionic-appauth">Ionic AppAuth</a>. One cool thing about this library is it has <a href="https://github.com/wi3land/ionic-appauth/tree/master/demos/react">React</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wi3land/ionic-appauth/tree/master/demos/vue">Vue</a> examples available. I recently updated these to work with Capacitor 4.</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>I'm pleased to announce the release of Ionic AppAuth 0.9.0 with full support for <a href="https://twitter.com/capacitorjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@capacitorjs</a> 4!<br><br>🚀 <a href="https://t.co/RRqy3Ywmsk">https://t.co/RRqy3Ywmsk</a><br><br>All the Capacitor demo apps have been updated and QA'd with <a href="https://twitter.com/oktadev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@oktadev</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/auth0?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@auth0</a>.<br><br>✨ <a href="https://t.co/UseM0R8JnB">https://t.co/UseM0R8JnB</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ionic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ionic</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/oidc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#oidc</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/oauth2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#oauth2</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/angular?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#angular</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/react?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#react</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vue?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#vue</a></p>— Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1566829762026291200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2022</a></blockquote>

 
 
 
 
 The Beauty of Continuous Integration 
 
 
<p>To avoid situations where a framework integration would fail in public, like the story I told before, I made sure the library is well tested, limiting the scope of the tests not only to the library code, but also to cover the workflow and generated code bases, e.g.:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Create an app with a CLI</p>
 
 
<p>Integrate Okta/Auth0 SDKs</p>
 
 
<p>Validate the integration to make sure nothing breaks</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>These commands are all encapsulated in a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/blob/main/test-app.sh"><code>test-app.sh</code> script</a> I wrote. It’s kinda ugly and can probably be improved, but it works pretty well for now.</p>
 
 
<p>If nothing else, this script shows you how to automate creating apps with framework CLIs for continuous integration. The project’s <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/blob/main/.github/workflows/apps.yml">Apps workflow</a> shows how all these frameworks are tested in a matrix.</p>
 
 
<p>You might notice that all the CLIs are installed without a version number:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>run: npm i -g @angular-devkit/schematics-cli @angular/cli @vue/cli @ionic/cli</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This is done on purpose, so these templates are continuously tested against the latest release. There’s a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/blob/main/.github/workflows/nightly.yml">Nightly worflow</a> that ensures nothing breaks every evening. Dependabot is also <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/schematics/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml">configured</a> to keep the project’s dependencies and SDK versions up-to-date.</p>

<p>When framework or libraries introduce changes, sometimes things break. But now, thanks to automated tests, I often find problems as soon as new versions are released. Cheers to continuous integration! 😃</p>

This has resulted in a proliferation of privileged identities that need to be managed.&nbsp;Join PAM experts from KuppingerCole analysts and iC Consult as they discuss the need for organizations to modernize their PAM capabilities to manage access and entitlements in today’s complex and volatile hybrid IT environments, that can operate at the speed of the cloud and grant access dynamically, based on tasks, toolchains, and workloads.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole will talk about the main trends emerging in PAM and he will explain why there is a need to modernize PAM to support the new and emerging needs of rapidly changing business IT environments.&nbsp;Johannes Hauer, PAM Lead Consultant will give an overview of the iC Consult’s methodology for PAM assessments and explain how to prepare to implement a future-proof PAM capability. They will also talk about the key success factors in starting a PAM initiative and the need to modernize PAM.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/modern-future-proof-pam"></a>

<p>Android development has been evolving non-stop since its initial release. At first, there were Activities containing nearly all of the code. Then the community started implementing high-level architectural patterns such as MVC and MVP. Today, we have Fragments, ViewModel, AndroidX, Kotlin, MVVM, and countless patterns, frameworks and libraries to help us build apps. However, no matter how excellent and fault-proof your chosen Android app architecture is, it is still challenging to do everything right.</p><p>This blog post demonstrates an example of small decisions that can break the whole architecture. It shows how poorly named functions end up poisoning Android views with logic by discussing an implementation of a login screen with MVP architecture. Yet, the main idea is independent of architectural patterns, and you can apply your learnings to any of them, such as MVC, MVVM,&nbsp;etc.</p> Sample login&nbsp;screen <p>The screen expects the user to type their e-mail and password; then, it validates them. If the user types a valid e-mail and password combination, the login screen lets them view the page content. Otherwise, it displays an error. It sounds pretty straightforward, yet the implementation is complicated. So let’s break this login flow into steps and then implement it.</p>  The user types their e-mail and password.  The user clicks the “Login”&nbsp;button.  The app displays a loading indicator and asks an authority whether the e-mail and the password are correct. Most of the time, this authority is a backend&nbsp;service.  The authority responds if the e-mail and password combination matches with a valid user&nbsp;account.  The app dismisses the loading indicator, and depending on the authority’s response, it lets the user view the page content or shows an&nbsp;error.  <p>If we dive into the details and divide “the app” into model, view and presenter layers, we would have the following flow.</p>  The user types their e-mail and password on the&nbsp;view.  The user clicks the “Login” button on the&nbsp;view.  The view shows a loading indicator, and the presenter sends the e-mail and password to the model layer to validate&nbsp;them.  The model layer transmits the e-mail and the password to the authority, and delivers the authority’s response back to the presenter.  After the presenter receives the response, the view dismisses the loading indicator. It then displays the content if the response indicates that the user has provided a valid e-mail and password combination. Otherwise, it shows an&nbsp;error.   What might go&nbsp;wrong? <p>As you see, each layer has its own responsibilities and performs different sets of operations. Even though their implementations are essential for an ideal architecture, the communication between them also plays a vital role. For example, after the user clicks the “Login” button, the view gets notified from the Android SDK Button. Then it transmits that event to the presenter layer, triggering the login&nbsp;flow.</p><p>Like most architectural patterns, MVP defines the way of communication between layers. For instance, it uses invoke-based communication between the view and the presenter layers. However, implementation depends on the developer, and things might go wrong here. So let’s look at the following activity, a possible implementation of the login screen using&nbsp;MVP.</p> class LoginActivity : Activity() {      override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {<br>        ...          loginButton.setOnClickListener { <br>            presenter.login(<br>                emailEditText.text, <br>                passwordEditText.text<br>            )<br>        }<br>    }  } <p>And here is the presenter:</p> class LoginPresenter {      fun login(email: String, password: String) {<br>        view.showLoadingIndicator()          loginUseCase.execute(<br>            email, <br>            password,<br>            onResult = { result -&gt;<br>                view.hideLoadingIndicator()<br>                <br>                if (result is Error) view.showError(result.error)<br>                else if (result is Success) view.showContent()<br>            }<br>        )<br>    }  } <p>Do you see any issue related to the communication between the activity and the presenter? The activity calls presenter.login function and triggers the login flow as soon as the user clicks the “Login” button. Keeping this in mind, which one relates the button click event with the login flow initiation, the activity or the presenter? If you say the activity, you are right. And this is the first stage of poisoning Android views with logic: letting the view control the&nbsp;flow.</p><p>Assume that you are required to add a feature to the login screen. For example, your company now wants to let the users use the app as guests without logging in. You need to add a “Continue as a guest” button and clicking that button would log in the user with an empty e-mail and an empty password. Additionally, the app should track the clicks on the “Continue as a guest” button to analyse the new feature’s usage.</p><p>One of the possible implementations is that the activity tracks the user behaviour and calls presenter.login function when the user clicks the “Continue as a guest” button. Like&nbsp;below:</p> class LoginActivity : Activity() {      override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {<br>        ...          guestButton.setOnClickListener {<br>            trackGuestButtonClick()<br>            presenter.login(<br>                email = "",<br>                password = ""<br>            )<br>        }<br>    }  } <p>It would work, but unfortunately, the activity now contains business logic. It knows that the clicks on the “Continue as a guest” button should be tracked and the user should be logged in with an empty e-mail and an empty password. This is the second stage of poisoning Android views with logic: executing business&nbsp;logic.</p><p>Of course, you can define another login function in the presenter that tracks the click event and logins the user as a guest. Then you can call it from the activity. Such&nbsp;as:</p> class LoginPresenter {      fun trackAndContinueAsGuest() {<br>        trackGuestButtonClick()<br>        login(email = "", password = "")<br>    }      fun login(email: String, password: String) {<br>        ...<br>    }  } <p>Unfortunately, this version is only slightly better. Even though the presenter calls the login function and executes the business logic, the activity still decides when to call which function. The developer must still think about the business logic while coding the activity, as there is no written contract between the activity and the presenter. They need to remember to call presenter.trackAndContinueAsGuest function when the user clicks the “Continue as a guest” button, and presenter.login function when the user clicks the “Login” button. Moreover, nothing stops them calling login function with empty parameters when the user clicks the “Continue as a guest” button. This is the third and the last stage of poisoning Android views with logic: hidden contracts.</p> Solution: logic-free contract <p>Let’s list all the requirements first.</p>  The view shouldn’t control the&nbsp;flow.  The view shouldn’t execute any business&nbsp;logic.  There should be a written contract between the view and the presenter.  <p>Basically, the view should only listen the required events and informs the presenter when they happen. Then the presenter should control the flow and execute the business&nbsp;logic.</p><p>Let’s update the login activity and the presenter according to these requirements. The activity should transmit the “Continue as a guest” button click events and the “Login” button click events to the presenter. If we define a contract for those events, we will end up having an activity like&nbsp;below:</p> class LoginActivity : Activity() {      override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {<br>        ...          loginButton.setOnClickListener { <br>            presenter.onLoginButtonClick(<br>                emailEditText.text, <br>                passwordEditText.text<br>            )<br>        }          guestButton.setOnClickListener {<br>            presenter.onGuestButtonClick()<br>        }<br>    }  } <p>And the following presenter:</p> class LoginPresenter {      fun onLoginButtonClick(email: String, password: String) {<br>        login(email, password)<br>    }      fun onGuestButtonClick() {<br>        trackGuestButtonClick()<br>        login(email = "", password = "")<br>    }      private fun login(email: String, password: String) {<br>        ...<br>    }  } <p>In the end, the activity doesn’t control flow or execute business logic. So even though it still calls the presenter’s functions, the contract is logic-free, and the developer doesn’t have to consider any logic while coding the activity. It is also safer to make changes on the presenter as the developer can quickly identify the use cases by looking at the function&nbsp;names.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/poisoning-android-views-with-logic-464dc3669e01">Poisoning Android views with logic</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>These questions originally appeared in an “Ask Me Anything” session in Telegram, in which NuID CEO &amp; Founder Locke Brown answered users' questions about NuID’s tech, the company’s upcoming development initiatives, and the Nu Identity Ecosystem. Some answers have been modified for formatting.</p><p></p><p>Could you please introduce yourself and NuID to the community?<br></p><p>Hi everyone, I’m Locke Brown – CEO and founder of NuID. <br></p><p>I started mining Bitcoin in 2013 – I had one of the first ASIC miners from Butterfly Labs (too bad I didn’t just buy BTC instead of mining gear). I published a paper in 2014 on BTC pricing models. I worked for Bill Gates’ family office for a few years before jumping ship to start NuID in early 2017. <br></p><p>NuID was founded in 2017, launched a trustless authentication solution in 2019, and is VC backed. Our core belief is that the future of the internet belongs to the user. Right now with the current digital identity model, individuals are limited in their ability to own and control their identities. We’ve set the foundation for a portable, user-owned identity platform with our authentication solution, and now we’re bringing it to the world through the Nu Identity Ecosystem and our token Kii. The Kii Foundation is a separate entity that was created to aid with the development and support of Kii and the KiiChain, which is a ledger we’re building to uphold identity-related data.<br><br><br></p><p>What are the major milestones achieved so far? And could you please tell us a bit about your upcoming plans?<br></p><p>Major milestones over the last 5.5 years include: bringing our core zero knowledge authentication solution to life - which is free to deploy into any app or site on our developer portal at <a href="https://portal.nuid.io/">https://portal.nuid.io/</a>. &nbsp; <br></p><p>On top of that, we've been granted patents on 57 claims in the US on the topic (<a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/10880089">https://patents.justia.com/patent/10880089</a>). <br></p><p>Now we’re launching the token Kii which kicks off the beginning of building out the Nu Identity Ecosystem.<br><br><br></p><p>What comes next for your team following the token sale?<br></p><p>Due to a high level of interest and demand, we’ll be holding another offering of Kii in the coming weeks before Kii goes live on exchanges in Q4 of this year. <br></p><p>After that, we'll turn more focus back to building out core Kii services like the generalized data attestation model, developing the KiiChain ledger, and scaling rollout of the authentication solution. We have a lot of exciting developments in the works for the near-term future to amplify adoption and really bring the Nu Identity Ecosystem to life. Plus so many cool identity-enabled projects and use cases that we will help others bring to life using NuID, like the Dev Fund, and making the developer experience more robust and easier to use. <br></p><p>We'll also be scaling our efforts in bringing NuID’s authentication solution to web2 services and organizations to continue increasing the value NuID has for end users. Immediately though, we will be further enhancing the user experience for managing their credentials, issuing attestations and so forth.<br><br></p><p><br>What can the token be used for?<br></p><p>So Kii is foundational in the Nu Identity Ecosystem and will be behind all transactions interacting with identities on the network. Kii will be used to register credentials, issue attestations (initially verified identity attestations for KYC, etc). Ultimately, users within the ecosystem will be empowered to decide what identifying data they want to provision, and to whom, and when they share that data, they’ll be using Kii to pay for it.<br></p><p>Also you may see in our documentation that there is a 10% allocation of Kii to the Verification Reward Incentive, which means that the first 10 million people to register credentials and receive an identity attestation issued to an authentication credential will be minted 10 free Kii. <br></p><p>While Kii is an ERC20 token initially, it will migrate to become the native token to the KiiChain, which we will be launching down the line. The KiiChain is an optimized ledger (build super light so full nodes can be run by anyone) for upholding authentication public parameters (public keys). This will incorporate what we call here Proof of Identity consensus. More on that to come!<br></p><p>It's worth noting that our authentication solution is already live and used by hundreds of developers/apps. <br><br><br></p><p>What’s your company’s mission with this project?<br></p><p>Our mission is to pave the necessary foundation for individuals to own and manage their personal digital data, and to empower them to choose who to share it with.<br></p><p>Identity on the web is important. Identity underpins everything - all online interactions depend on the notion of identity. The current model of digital identity is upheld by systems of service-owned and service-controlled identity data. As things stand, users don’t have much say over who owns their identifying information, or how it’s used.<br></p><p>The future lies with user-owned, user-controlled, portable systems for managing identity. NuID has set the foundation for this “nu’' model starting with our trustless authentication solution and continuing with the launch of Kii, the Nu Identity Ecosystem, and development of the KiiChain!<br><br><br></p><p>What was the most difficult part in developing the project, in your opinion?<br></p><p>It's been a journey for sure, and still continuing on. I think the most difficult part has been having people really understand the implications. As such a foundational technology that is relevant to so many things, it is easy to lose people if you aren't careful to keep a focused conversation. <br></p><p>Also it can be tricky sometimes to want to make decisions or act for the benefit of the short term at the expense of the long run. And we consciously try to ensure we are executing for the long run. <br></p><p>The world often wants things fast and “NOW,” but we took the time needed to meticulously develop and optimize our core tech because to have a persistent solid foundation you can't cut corners. It needs to be perfect. One disaster in this space and it's over. <br><br><br></p><p>Can you please explain the Nu Identity Ecosystem?<br></p><p>The ecosystem is going to be made up of participating individuals and services. Individuals can verify their true identity and associate it with their zero-knowledge authentication credentials (they can also spin up as many new credentials as they like which are not correlated to others - whereas emails typically correlate accounts today), stored on a public blockchain; services can deploy the NuID trustless authentication protocol to eliminate liability of storing user authentication data but also to use the Nu Identity Model of interoperable identities. <br></p><p>The interplay between individuals and services will grow a robust Nu Identity Ecosystem which will make interacting online more secure and less painful. It also sets the stage for so many great services that would be “identity enabled” like privacy-preserving asset transfer, ehealth, voting, etc.<br></p><p>In the future, any ecosystem participant will be able to attest to a piece of information about another party, which will provide the digital building blocks required to enable digital “reputation” in a similar way to how reputation works in the physical world.<br></p><p>If you noticed the allocation of Kii to what we call the "Dev Fund,” that is basically an incubator/accelerator to invest in 3rd parties building out some of these services in the ecosystem, as there are countless "identity enabled services" as I mentioned above which anyone will be able to develop.<br></p><p>Ultimately I view the ecosystem as really just setting a stage for an internet where explicated identity sits at the heart of transactions.</p>

<p>Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain applications by signing a standard message format. While SIWE focuses on user log-in, there is no canonical way to interact with an additional service on behalf of the authenticated Ethereum account, such as one that enables a user to bring their own data to a session.</p><p><a href="https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-5573-siwe-capgrok/10627">ReCap (EIP-5573)</a> allows an off-chain application to combine authentication and authorization while preserving security and optimizing for UX.</p><p>With ReCap, an off-chain application can ask the user to authenticate using SIWE (EIP-4361) while also allowing the user to authorize the application to access third-party resources for that session–all with a single wallet interaction. Because ReCap enforces informed consent, the wallet will always show the users exactly what permissions would be granted.</p><p>A ReCap is a valid EIP-4361 message that follows additional structure defined in EIP-5573, allowing an Ethereum account to delegate a set of capabilities (ReCaps) to a delegate through informed user consent. SIWE ReCap implements an object-capability (ocap) model using Ethereum-native signature algorithms and data models. </p><p>Through an extension mechanism, it can be combined with other ocap-like models as well such as a <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/zcap-spec">ZCap-LD</a>. EIP-5573 is fully compatible with EIP-4361 which ensures that existing SIWE-enabled applications won’t break.</p><p>Each resource service can define its own ReCap namespace which describes actions that can be executed on resources that exist within the namespace. Examples include but are not limited to creating, updating, or deleting certain resources, such as a blog post or key-value store entry. There is no limitation on what semantics a resource service might define for their given namespace since ReCap has a flexible extensibility mechanism built in.</p> Using Sign-In with Ethereum with ReCaps <p>Adding ReCaps to SIWE does not require major changes. The key difference is that the application encodes additional capabilities in the SIWE message, allowing the user to delegate permissions to the application for a limited period of time and under certain conditions (such as enforcing revocation checks or holder bindings).</p><p>After the application receives the signed ReCap from the user’s wallet, it may access the specified actions and resources on behalf of the user. This can only be done while the ReCap has not expired or been revoked. Revocation is out-of-scope of ReCap but can be implemented by the resource service on top of ReCaps. The following diagram illustrates a common ReCap usage pattern where the user gives informed consent to an application to allow the application to manage data on their behalf that resides in a third-party self-sovereign storage resource service:<br></p><p>Resource services need to authenticate that the application is indeed the valid delegate of the Ethereum account. Merely possessing a signed ReCap does not constitute authentication, as would be in the case of a bearer token. Instead, ReCaps are bound to a specific party ("holder binding"). The application can perform authentication for the resource service by signing a message with a delegated key as described our <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/from-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-session-keys/">post on session keys</a>, but resource services are free to define their own mechanism in their API.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/from-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-session-keys/">  From Sign-In with Ethereum to Session Keys  Session keys let users root all their digital interactions to their keys.  SpruceWayne Chang    </a> Adding SIWE ReCap to Your Application <p>Applications can use ReCaps to access user-controlled resource services by:</p>  Adding ReCap URIs to the SIWE <code>Resources</code> array.  Appending the deterministic text to the SIWE <code>statement</code> field.  <p>This will ensure the user can be presented with a correct and human-readable summary of the granted permissions for purposes of ensuring informed consent through SIWE ReCap.</p><p>Resource services can serve protected resources through SIWE ReCaps by:</p>  Defining the namespace for their resource service.  Defining the possible actions per resource or for all resources the user may authorize.  If applicable, defining the resources that can be targeted in ReCaps and how they are identified in the namespace.  Verifying the signed SIWE ReCap and validating that the delegate was authorized to execute the actions on behalf of an Ethereum Account.  Verifying the requester is the designated delegate of the SIWE ReCap.   <code>example.com wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

I further authorize https://example.com to perform

This ensures that the user has an opportunity to read and understand what they are signing even without additional support from Ethereum wallets. It also ensures cryptographic integrity of the informed consent and prevents applications from diluting the attenuation after the user signed the message.</p><p>ReCap URIs are self-contained URIs with an embedded ReCap Capability encoded as a base64url-encoded JSON Object that follow a simple URI scheme:</p><p><code>urn:recap:&lt;namespace&gt;:&lt;capability-object&gt;</code></p><p>A ReCap URI starts with <code>urn:recap:</code> followed by the namespace chosen by the resource service, e.g., <code>example</code>, and followed by the ReCap Capability Object which describes which actions the user grants to the application. These actions can be defined by the resource service and selectively granted to the application. The following is the decoded ReCap Capability Object from the example above:</p> <code>{
    "def":[
      "read"
    ],
    "tar":{
      "my.resource.1":[
      	"append",
        "delete"
    ],
      "my.resource.2":[
      	"append"
    ],
      "my.resource.3":[
        "append"
    ]
  }
}</code> <p>In our example, the resource service decided to expose an API to allow users to delegate two different actions to applications: <code>append</code> and <code>delete</code>, under the namespace <code>example</code>. Actions can be either targeted or untargeted. While targeted actions are associated with resources defined in the ReCap Capability Object, untargeted actions are not tied to a particular resource.</p><p>To obtain informed consent from the user, SIWE messages with the ReCap extension must append deterministically-generated text derived from the ReCap URIs in the <code>Resources</code> array to the <code>statement</code> field. In our example above, the following represents this text:</p><p><code>I further authorize https://example.com to perform the following actions on my behalf: (1) example: read for any. (2) example: append, delete for my.resource.1. (3) example: append for my.resource.2, my.resource.3.</code></p><p>It is important to note that the user-controlled resource service, and not the application, must define the deterministic generation function outputting the text that the user will ultimately sign. This ensures that a malicious application cannot construct a nefarious message to fool the user into delegating different access than intended. Longer-term, we imagine wallets can add support to further interpreting these messages into more ergonomic UX, just as many are now providing fully-fledged "sign-in" dialogs for SIWE as opposed to unadorned personal sign requests.</p> Attenuation <p>Attenuation is the winnowing of permissions towards the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a>, and in ReCaps it's applied across two layers. </p><p>The first layer is the SIWE message containing attenuations affecting all ReCaps in the <code>Resources</code> section, and the second layer is the ReCap Capability Object itself. The ReCap Capability Object can only make the previous attenuations stricter or provide additional context information required by the resource service.</p><p>Certain SIWE message fields are used to further attenuate the scope of the delegation. Most importantly, the URI field in the SIWE message defines the delegate of the Ethereum account. Since it is a URI it can be a website (e.g., https://example.com), a public key (e.g., did:key:z6Mk…), an ENS name (e.g., did:ens:alice.eth) or anything else that can be identified by a URI.</p><p>Other SIWE message fields to attenuate include limiting the validity period of the ReCap Capability through <code>Issued At</code>, <code>Expiration Time</code> , and <code>Not Before</code>.</p> Getting Involved <p>SIWE ReCap is a proposed Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP). </p><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5573">  Add EIP-5573: SIWE ReCap Extension by awoie · Pull Request #5573 · ethereum/EIPs  When opening a pull request to submit a new EIP, please use the suggested template: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.mdWe have a GitHub bot that automatically merges some ...

<p>Over the past few months, we’ve continued building new features on our products to make it as easy as possible for people to share and consume verifiable data.</p>
<p>This post summarizes some of the new features that we’ve implemented between July – September, 2022.</p>
 <br>
(1) NB Orbit Enterprise 
<p></p>
<p>Orbit Enterprise is a No Code Self Sovereign Identity platform that facilitates the storage, issuance and verification of verifiable credentials that are held and owned by end users in digital wallets.</p>
<p>Orbit Edge is built entirely on open standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). We pride ourselves on respecting open-source project specification in our implementations, such as Hyperledger Aries, to which we not only consume, but contribute to.</p>
 (1a) Privacy Preserving Proofs 
<p>Northern Block is currently focused on building use cases which are privacy-preserving, thus best suited for AnonCreds (for those interested, we wrote recently about our learnings from Aries, Indy and AnonCreds <a href="https://northernblock.io/learnings-from-aries-indy-and-various-verifiable-credential-implementations/">here</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">AnonCreds specification</a> is being developed to address a privacy-preserving specific use case with participation from the community.</p>
<p>It allows us to use Zero-knowledge Proof (ZKP). In cryptography, the ZKP is a method by which an entity can prove that they know a certain value without disclosing the value itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AnonCred ZKP verifiable credentials provide capabilities that many see as important for digital identity use cases in particular, and verifiable data in general.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have implemented some of these capabilities into Orbit Enterprise. They include:</p>
 
 Restrictions – the ability for verifiers to restrict proofs to specific Schemas of CreDefs 
 Data Minimization – the ability to disclose only necessary claims to a verifier, while creating a Proposal or Proof Request 
 Compounding Proofs – the ability to combine multiple credentials into a single proof to present to a verifier without revealing any correlatable identifier 
 Predicate Proofs – the ability to reduce the sharing of PII by enclosing logical expressions, and potentially correlating data, especially dates (birth, credential issuance/expiry, etc.) 
 
  
 <br>
(1b) Self-attested Attributes as Proofs 
<p>Within a proof request, verifiers can ask for the holder to provide self-attested attributes. These are quite useful for low integrity/risk use cases, where a self-attestation meets a verifier’s policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example: as an organization, when I onboard a vendor, I want to verify their verifiable business credentials, but also their banking information (self-attested) to set them up for payments in our accounts payable system.</p>
  
 <br>
(1c) Holder-driven Presentation Proposals 
<p>We’ve written a blog post about why credential issuance should be holder-driven (<a href="https://northernblock.io/why-credential-issuance-should-be-holder-driven/">here</a>). We think that the same is true for verifications and other functions.</p>
<p>For this reason, we added a Presentation Proposals function in Orbit Enterprise to allow for an Organizational Holder to send a proposal to a verifier entity (more <a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise-features-presentation-proposals/">here</a>)</p>
<p>Presentation Proposals allow an organization to initiate the workflow rather than waiting on a verifier to send a proof request. We have implemented the orchestration provided by <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0</a> to enable all this to happen.</p>
  
 <br>
(1d) Image Attributes as Schema Attributes&nbsp; 
<p>One of the things that organizations can do through Orbit Enterprise is to create schema definitions with attributes. These attributes can be restricted by the data formats they must comply with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until now, we supported formats such as Text, Number and Date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, we added the support for Images Formats (more <a href="https://northernblock.io/feature-showcase-images-as-attributes/">here</a>).</p>
  
 <br>
(1e) Delete Connections 
<p>We added the functionality to Delete Connections within the Existing Connections page. It makes it a bit easier for users to keep a desired list of connections.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
(1f) Out of Band APIs 
<p>In Orbit Enterprise, when an organizational administrator is onboarded, they establish a connection to the organization. Once established, they are offered a credential which delegates administrative functions to them, so that they can act on behalf of the organization (e.g., issue, verify, revoke, etc.).</p>
<p>The above is a good example of a two-step process within Orbit Enterprise which is made into one because of built in business logic.</p>
<p>But if we were outside of Orbit Enterprise, and if we want to combine a similar two-step process into one, we would use the Out-of-band Protocol (out-of-band was one of the items we listed as exciting us as part of AIP 2.0 <a href="https://northernblock.io/aip-2-interoperability/#4A_Out-of-band_With_Connection_Reuse">here</a>).</p>
<p>The advantage is that if a connection isn’t established, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">Aries RFC 0434</a> (Out-of-Band Protocol 1.1) can now combine two processes into one (e.g, Connection + Credential Offer).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve now exposed these out-of-band APIs for our customers needing to consume them inside of their systems:</p>
 
 Cred Offer&nbsp; 
 Proof Presentation&nbsp; 
 Proof Verification 
 
 <br>
(1g) Email Notifications to Peers 
<p>Our customers needed a way to be notified about various offers and requests they receive in Orbit Enterprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We added Email Notifications as a way to keep them aware of activity.</p>
<p>You can see this feature in action within this video showcasing a pilot project Northern Block participated in.</p>
  
 <br>
 
 (2) NB Orbit Edge 
<p><a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-edge-wallet/">Orbit Edge</a> is a digital wallet app from the Northern Block. It allows users to securely and privately receive, store and present digital credentials, build direct and secure peer-to-peer connections​, use private messaging functions and leverage holder-driven workflows (e.g., request to be issued a credential, ID proofing).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Orbit Edge is built entirely on open standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). We pride ourselves on respecting open-source project specification in our implementations, such as Hyperledger Aries, to which we not only consume, but contribute to.</p>
 <br>
(2a) Notifications Inbox 
<p>We added a Notifications Inbox feature within the digital wallet app.</p>
<p>It enhances the product by:</p>
 
 Providing an inbox type capability which lists all the credential exchange transactions. 
 Visually notifying the mobile wallet holder that a proof request or a credential offer has been received. 
 
<p></p>
 <br>
(2b) Hide Credentials Attributes 
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes a holder simply wants to show a credential within their wallet to a verifier, who will examine the credential by looking at it.</p>
<p>For example, I don’t think we can expect every small bar owner to be set up with a verifier app at the entrance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of showing a physical ID, you can gain further privacy by showing an identity credential from within your digital wallet, while hiding certain attributes which you may not wish the verifier to see.</p>
<p>We added this privacy feature in the Orbit Edge Wallet to ensure the above scenario can be achieved.</p>

 Research from IDnow reveals customers’ disgruntlement with time heavy procedures in traditional banking 



<p></p>



<p>Manchester and London, October 13 2022:&nbsp;New research from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a leading identity proofing platform provider, has revealed that 64% of Britons believe digital processes such as remote account opening, online banking options or an easy-to-use app were either extremely important or important when deciding who to bank with. This highlights an obvious demand for easy and more efficient banking processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the flipside, almost half (47%) of the 2,001 UK adult respondents were most annoyed by the time constraints involved with banking, including limited opening hours of local branches (22%), lengthy processes (16%) and having to visit a branch to open an account (9%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This presents a significant opportunity for both traditional and challenger banks to harness the current appetite in the UK for digital-led processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online safety concerns and ease of use remain in the minds of customers&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research also revealed that more than half of those surveyed had opened a bank account online (53%) with the same percentage also stating they felt safe and secure to do so. However, that did leave 47% of respondents feeling it was unsafe, with more than a third (37%) citing digital bank fraud and cybercrime as the main reasons for this.</p>



<p>This highlights the need for banks, both traditional and challenger, to address the concerns of consumers when it comes to fraud, and ensure they have stringent onboarding processes that meet the highest security standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fintech versus traditional banking&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite continued growth in the fintech sector, only a quarter (24%) of respondents banked with a challenger bank, though in the London city region this figure rose to 32%.&nbsp;Meanwhile, 15% admitted to being concerned about making mistakes in the onboarding process and 13% had either cancelled or abandoned the process of opening a digital bank account, suggesting that banks need to make their onboarding process as smooth and frictionless as possible for their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The past two years have acted as a major catalyst in digital adoption across every sector, and this research illustrates how important digital processes continue to be for consumers,” said Mike Kiely,&nbsp;Sales Director for Financial Services from IDnow.</p>



<p>“It’s interesting to see that the majority of respondents still bank with a traditional bank. The demand for more digital processes remains high though, which presents a huge opportunity for those institutions equipped and prepared to embrace technologies that will enable them to provide the online services that many have come to expect,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adoption of digital varies by age</p>



<p>When delving deeper, those aged 55 or over are least likely to have opened a bank account digitally (37%) compared to nearly two thirds (63%) of 18-24-year-olds and 35-44-year-olds and 62% of 25-34-year-olds, showing a clear age gap in the adoption of digital services. Therefore, banks should provide freedom of choice for their customers, offering them the processes that fit them best. And while digital bank accounts are most popular with 18-24-year-olds, this age group is also the most likely to abandon or cancel opening a remote bank account (24%), suggesting higher expectations for the onboarding process from those most digitally savvy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, this young age group also feel the most unsafe when it comes to opening a bank account digitally, with only 41% saying ‘yes’ to feeling safe and secure compared to 60% of 35-44-year-olds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The threat for young adults looks set to continue, unless businesses up their game and also educate people on the need to protect their own information,” explained Mike Kiely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“With young people spending so much of their time online, there are naturally more potential touchpoints for fraudsters to target. Meanwhile, older generations tend to be naturally less trusting of digital, so some fraudsters may see young adults as an easier target.</p>



<p>“Many young adults have a heightened awareness of the potential risks associated with digital activity. This is supported by the statistic which showed that cybercrime is their biggest worry (20%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>“To overcome these concerns and capitalise on this growing market, it’s vital for banks to invest in the right technologies that will deliver the highest levels of security at every stage of the digital banking process while also addressing the demand of a smooth and simple user experience,” he concluded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Unfortunately, every organization is vulnerable to a cyberattack. We have seen in the last years a considerable increase in cybercrime and the negative impact that it causes on businesses. The obvious consequences are financial, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. There are several other aspects to consider, such as intellectual property loss, reputation damage, or data privacy breaches. It is undeniable that there is no way to be totally safe, but it is always good to work on a plan to mitigate disasters and cyber-crisis.</p>
 Disaster plan vs Cyber recovery plan 
<p>Although a disaster recovery plan and a cyber recovery plan overlap to a certain extent, their aims are different. While the disaster recovery plan intends to ensure business continuity after a cyber-attack, the cyber recovery plan seeks data protection. Preparing a plan against disaster can enable a fast repair of the systems that allow the reactivation of the operations after the attack occurs. On the other hand, a cyber recovery plan will aim to regain the access to critical data as soon as possible. In the light of the increasing trend of cyberattacks against organizations, especially ransomware, it is vital to have in place both protocols to ensure data protection and business resumption.</p>
<p>A cyber-attack could be devastating for an organization. Consequences could be frightening, to the point of affecting a state or a nation, as it was the case of the Colonial Pipeline in the US, the ransomware attack to the HSE in Ireland, or the current emergency situation in Costa Rica. At KuppingerCole, we discussed about these incidents and the impact to the societies afterwards in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022/blog/ransomware-the-invisible-enemy-of-organizations">a previous blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Even though it may sound obvious, keeping the team calm is key during a cyber-attack. Different responsibilities should be assigned to different people and teams, to spread the workload and expedite recovery. When organizations suffer major incidents, it is common that an immense pressure takes over the environment, and it contribute to make it harder to respond and coordinate actions. However, following the protocols prepared in advance are vital in this scenario.</p>
 The organization suffered an attack, what to do now? 
<p>A security alert arrives at your SOC or helpdesk. Who investigates? Who performs triage? How is the severity determined? Who needs to be made aware? Who are the decision makers? Identifying stakeholders and responsible team members is a good first step to take. Communications protocols need to be established. Rushing the recovery could itself cause greater harm. Starting cleanup procedures before ensuring containment may take critical time away from the investigation, allowing other assets to be compromised while the initial victim assets are being restored. There are some steps that are essential to succeed with recovery during and after a cyberattack:</p>
 
 Safe backups: It is true that having a backup is a must, however, backed up copies of the data are also at risk. It is vital to contract with an appropriate Cloud Service Provider that provides a useful solution ensuring a high degree of resilience. Offline backups area also necessary. Ransomware operators can leverage compromised credentials to encrypt backups they can find online within the targeted organization. 
 Prevent re-infection: Some ransomware perpetrators break into systems days or weeks before they detonate their payloads. Backups may be contaminated with malware, such that restoring it would also restore the threat. Assessing the damage to critical systems will help the company to determine the extent of the impact and the origin of the attack in the Cybersecurity Supply Chain. 
 Business continuity plan: Organizations should be able to restore the affected services quickly. Achieving this will depend upon how well the data was backed up and the selection of the essential backup services. 
 Improve the process: Once the attack occurs, it is important to recognize and fix the vulnerabilities to close the gaps that allowed the breach. Improving the security posture will reduce the risk of a future incident. 
 
 Then, is it possible to recover after an attack? 
<p>Yes, it is possible, but the time that it takes to reverse the damage will depend entirely on the organizational plan. Nowadays, cybersecurity must be pro-active and not reactive. Having the right cloud backup and a cyber insurance policy could make the difference. Although the cyber insurance does not eliminate the risk, it may help in many cases to minimize the impact, for instance in cases where equipment is damaged, and productivity is lost due to the event. In the CSLS we will have special tracks discussing the importance of increasing resilience, and we discussed in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022/blog/cyber-crisis-becomes-an-opportunity-for-insurers">a previous blog post</a> that a cyber insurance policy is an essential component to protect the digital economy.</p>
<p>Transparency with other organizations and individuals affected is also important after being targeted. One goal cyber-attackers have in some types of incidents is to acquire and use personal data to impersonate real individuals and request bank loans fraudulently. Informing users about the unfortunate incident and contacting the authorities is now required in many jurisdictions. Although many companies do not feel comfortable reporting that they have been the target of a cyber-crime, it is essential to understand that consequences for non-compliance in reporting can add fines and legal fees to the cost of cleanup.</p>
<p>Understanding your IT and OT environments, including your asset inventory and their &nbsp;vulnerabilities will contribute to building a better recovery plan and a better cybersecurity stance. Hiring a third-party like KuppingerCole Analysts could help your organization to measure the risks and make better plans to repel attacks.</p>

<p>After the 2018 World Cup, it’s time to look forward and prepare for all the action that will unfold during the Qatar 2022 World Cup. </p>



<p>What type of sports betting products can you expect? </p>



<p>What kind of algorithms will broadcasters use, and how should operators respond to optimize their development and prevent fraud or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> after players have gained access to their online betting accounts? </p>



<p>Find all the answers below.</p>



 FIFA World Cup 2018 recap 



<p>The 2018 FIFA World Cup was a massive success for the betting and gaming industry. It was a record-breaking tournament, with an estimated <a href="https://www.gamblinginsider.com/news/5660/uk-wagers-15bn-on-fifa-world-cup">$155 billion wagered on the game, including $1.9 billion in the UK</a> alone.</p>



<p>As more and more people got involved in betting on the World Cup, with many of them placing bets for the first time, the market expanded rapidly. The high level of consumer engagement can be attributed to the fact that it’s one of the few sports that can be bet on almost anywhere in the world.</p>



<p>It’s also one where there are plenty of opportunities to make money: A person can bet on who will win each game, which team will win each group stage match, and whether a player will score goals or not during their time at a specific club, and many more aspects of a game or tournament.</p>



<p>The popularity of betting on football has caused many operators to offer new products specifically designed for World Cup fans: They have created markets offering odds on everything from which team will be sent off first to particular bets, such as how many yellow cards England will receive during their game against Belgium.</p>



 World Cup betting trends, facts, and figures 



<p>This trend will likely continue as we head into Qatar 2022, which will take place from November 21 through December 18 this year. While we don’t know exactly how much money will be wagered on this year’s World Cup, it’s safe to say that it will be even more than last time since there are more ways than ever for people all over the world to place their bets.</p>



<p>For the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, online gambling will be available for residents with a license to gamble online – which is only granted to locals. Qatar’s strict laws against illegal gambling mean that it has been difficult for foreign operators to obtain licenses there – but it seems they’ll have a chance at monetizing this massive event within the borders of the oil state.</p>



 Security and betting fraud 



<p>The last World Cup was an excellent success for betting and online gambling. The action was thrilling, the games were exciting, and it was a big success for those who had placed the right bets. However, not everything went according to plan. Looking back, there were some concerns about security and betting fraud at the 2018 World Cup. To avoid a repeat of the issues four years ago, gaming operators should look out for those anomalies that happened in 2018:</p>



<p>Bookmakers offered inaccurate odds due to a lack of liquidity, and many customers could not place bets.</p>



<p>There was a lack of transparency, and some bookmakers were accused of fixing matches.</p>



<p>Fraudulent activities were carried out by criminals who used bots to manipulate bettors into placing wagers on specific teams or players.</p>



<p>Betting fraud is a problem that affects all countries where gambling is legal, not just those hosting major sporting events like the World Cup or Olympics. For example, during the 2018 World Cup in Russia, numerous match-fixing instances were reported by players and officials from various nations participating in multiple stages of the competition.</p>

 Forecasts for Qatar 2022 



<p>World Cup 2022 is approaching fast, and the iGaming industry is preparing itself for the upcoming event. For the Qatar 2022 edition, we expect increased betting activity. This inevitably increases the risk of revenue fraud and other issues.</p>



<p>The online gambling market is still increasing, and online gambling operators expect an uptrend in revenue during this upcoming World Cup. There’s also an anticipated increase in fraudulent parties trying to take advantage of this situation by using fake websites or even creating new ones just for this purpose.</p>



<p>There are still some challenges facing the gambling industry as they prepare for this massive influx of new customers. One thing we expect to see happen during this period is an increase in online gambling sites that take advantage of loopholes in legislation to offer their services without regulation or oversight by any government agency. We also expect a growth in illegal betting operations and underground casinos operating out of private homes or warehouses where gamblers can make bets anonymously without having any records.</p>



 How to prepare for the 2022 World Cup

<p>JAKARTA, INDONESIA / 12 October 2022 — We are delighted to announce that <a href="https://www.dfintech.com/">Dragonfly Fintech Pte. Ltd.</a> has won the much coveted G20 TechSprint 2022 challenge.</p><p>Organized by BIS Innovation Hub (Bank for International Settlements) and Bank Indonesia under the Indonesian G20 Presidency, this third edition of the TechSprint aims to catalyze the development of CBDCs. Technologists and innovators from all over the world presented solutions for the design and implementation of retail and wholesale CBDC.</p><p>In this showcase of best-in-class solutions, each participating team had to show prototypes and was asked to address one of three high-priority problem statements:</p>  Building effective and robust means to issue, distribute, and transfer&nbsp;CBDCs  Enabling Financial Inclusion  Improving interoperability  <p>Team Dragonfly from Singapore, led by CEO and founder Lon Wong, won the much coveted “Building effective and robust means to issue, distribute and transfer CBDCs” category with their production-ready prototype “End-to-End CBDC Solution.” The Dragonfly solution features a holistic and cost-effective proprietary blockchain ledger with unique built-in features and includes a mobile wallet and digital identity platform.</p><p>In his acceptance speech, Lon stressed that the basic tenets of an effective CBDC solution must include the ability to&nbsp;be:</p>  implemented as a self-contained initiative  connected to existing financial systems already in&nbsp;place  highly flexible, scalable, and compatible  cost effective in implementation, maintenance, and operation; taking into account the lowest attainable cost of ownership  Moderators and winners getting ready to make their acceptance speeches<p>The technology for the solution should be distributed and decentralized so that there is no single point of failure. Moreover, the system design should also include the use of other devices such as NFC cards to transact instead of just using smart devices only. System components should be kept to a minimum, simple, and inexpensive, preferably in a cloud environment.</p><p>Payment service providers and financial institutions should be given some flexibility in the technology without requiring implementation of expensive CBDC edge servers in their premises. In a geographically expansive country like Indonesia, the design should be a cluster of networked clusters for high throughputs and reliability, similar to how the internet is designed.</p><p>User experience and transactions should be seamless, regardless of the location, and a payment settlement rail should be a core component of the CBDC system where counterparty risk is almost non-existent via an augmented escrow function performed by a neutral and independent party.</p><p>It is clear from Lon’s speech that Team Dragonfly are fully cognizant of the intricate needs of a winning solution that can be both an effective and robust means to issue, distribute, and transfer&nbsp;CBDCs.</p><p>The official press release of the G20 TechSprint Challenge can be found <a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p221012.htm">here</a> and the award ceremony&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/--YT8DVHQLE">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Security in many organizations is not evolving fast enough to keep up with business transformation, including migration to the cloud and to Industry 4.0. These changes, while essential to remain competitive, bring fresh security risks. A new approach is needed to ensure cyber resilience.&nbsp;Join security experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and Illumio as they discuss the need to go beyond cyber-attack prevention to cyber resilience, which is aimed at keeping business operations running in the face of ransomware and other cyber-attacks. Survival is all about having a plan to restrict the activities of attackers once they are inside the corporate network and preserve business operations.</p>
<p>John Tolbert, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole will talk about the Zero Trust approach to security, the various components of Zero Trust such as user and device identity, risk evaluation, authorization, and access control, and how it all relates to cyber resilience. Trevor Dearing, Director of Critical Infrastructure Solutions at Illumio will explain the importance of building a strategy for cyber resilience and adopting Zero Trust with reference to Zero Trust Segmentation for applications, systems and the cloud.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-approach-cyberresilience"></a>

<p><a>A&nbsp;</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/22/oracle-us-privacy-class-action/">class action</a>&nbsp;has been lodged in the U.S. against tech giant Oracle, accusing the multinational and its AdTech and advertising subsidiaries of running and profiting from a “worldwide surveillance machine” that has “amassed detailed dossiers on some five billion people” and violated “the privacy of the majority of the people on Earth.”</p>



<p>The sweeping complaint&nbsp;<a href="https://au.pcmag.com/security/95802/oracle-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-tracking-5-billion-people">accuses</a>&nbsp;Oracle of collecting the personal information of the five billion users, including their names, home addresses, emails, online and real-world purchases, physical movements in the real world, income, interests and political views, and online activity. The profiles or dossiers are&nbsp;<a href="https://au.pcmag.com/security/95802/oracle-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-tracking-5-billion-people">allegedly referred</a>&nbsp;to as “consumer identity graphs” and are stored in the “Oracle Data Cloud.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/oracle-class-action-lawsuit-data-privacy-tiktok">Input magazine</a>&nbsp;reports: “The case focuses on a service called “ID Graph,” which synthesizes collected data and matches it to a consistent user profile. According to the plaintiffs, Oracle is collecting this trove of data without user consent. The lawsuit alleges that Oracle even uses proxies to get around privacy controls.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The size and scale of the complaint is noteworthy. There are three&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/File-Stamped-2022-08-19-Oracle-Complaint.pdf">complainants</a>&nbsp;to the class action – Dr Johnny Ryan from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), Michael Katz-Lacabe from The Center for Human Rights and Privacy, and Dr Jennifer Golbeck from the University of Maryland — who say they are “acting on behalf of worldwide Internet users who have been subject to Oracle’s privacy violations.” And in the absence of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/new-bipartisan-federal-data-privacy-bill-in-the-us-but-will-it-pass/">federal privacy law in the U.S</a>., the complaint&nbsp;alleges violations of various other instruments: the Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Constitution of the State of California, the California Invasion of Privacy Act, competition law, and common law.</p>



<p>One of the complainants, the ICCL’s Dr Johnny Ryan,&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/22/oracle-us-privacy-class-action/">said</a>: “Oracle has violated the privacy of billions of people across the globe. This is a Fortune 500 company on a dangerous mission to track where every person in the world goes, and what they do. We are taking this action to stop Oracle’s surveillance machine.”</p>



<p>But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/oracle-class-action-lawsuit-data-privacy-tiktok">Input</a>&nbsp;cautions: “There’s a steep road ahead for this lawsuit, no matter who backs it. Data privacy laws in the U.S. are piecemeal at best — which makes it very difficult to prove Oracle is doing anything wrong at a federal level. As&nbsp;TechCrunch&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/22/oracle-us-privacy-class-action/">notes</a>, similar privacy suits have very much struggled to find footing in the past. Oracle, as a titan of the tech industry with a $227 billion market cap, will have top-notch legal aid on its side, too.”</p>



<p>Incidentally, Oracle was just appointed the official&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/oracle-reviewing-tiktok-algorithms-project-texas-china">reviewer of Tik Tok algorithms</a>&nbsp;to make sure the social media platform isn’t sending American data to China – which some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/oracle-class-action-lawsuit-data-privacy-tiktok">commentators</a>&nbsp;note is poor timing since the Tik Tok reviewer role is about making sure “everything’s air-tight from a data privacy perspective.”</p>



 What this class action says about big tech and data surveillance 



<p>We view this class action as yet another major push back against big tech and surveillance capitalism. The tide has definitely turned. Consumers are sick of trading their personal data for access to web sites and services, and there are privacy advocates willing to act on their behalf to better protect consumer data privacy. In this case, advocates are going into bat for most of the world’s population!</p>



<p>While Oracle has faced similar class actions over tracking in&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/22/oracle-us-privacy-class-action/">Europe</a>, this is the first time a class action of this scale has been filed in the U.S. and tested U.S. law on the matter. We’ll follow this story closely because it might well set a remarkable precedent and be a real turning point for data privacy.</p>

<p>In September 2022, <a href="https://northernblock.io/">Northern Block</a> was selected as part of&nbsp;16 startups to join&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/innovation/accelerate/">Accelerate@IATA’s</a> 2022 cohort, a travel tech startup accelerator jointly run by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Plug and Play and was chosen as 1 of 3 companies to pitch at the ATA World Financial Symposium (WFS) stage.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of introducing our no-code SSI solutions on the stage and let me tell you, what a memorable experience!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The IATA World Financial Symposium (WFS), hosted at the Sheraton Grand Doha Resort &amp; Convention Hotel Doha from September 19 to 22, focused on airline resilience following the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis and its main topic; Reshaping Airline Resilience.</p>
<p>Throughout the crisis, airlines demonstrated their ability to adapt to volatile times. This edition drove into topics that are strategic to airlines financial sustainability, and for the travel industry as whole.</p>
<p>The World Financial Symposium (WFS) brought together financial leaders and experts to share ideas and address industry concerns such as the pandemic and economic sustainability measures. As travel resumes and shows indications of improvement, concerns remain that must be addressed for future and financial viability.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Airlines are resilient. Now is the time to build on the hard work and difficult restructurings of the past two years to seize opportunities coming out of the crisis.&nbsp;Finance will play a vital role in supporting the ongoing recovery while creating a sustainable capital structure to support our ambitious environment agenda,” said IATA Director General&nbsp;Willie Walsh.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although customer centricity was covered in multiple sessions and conversations, the networking events provided greater space for debate concerning financial sustainability, financial risk management, settlement systems, and so on.</p>
<p>WFS also provided an excellent learning environment on the dynamics of the aviation sector. I had the pleasure of meeting attending IATA members, who were ecstatic about our company’s engagement towards building a stronger global digital transformation.</p>
<p>Lastly, the aviation industry needs modernization. However, it is still a challenge to get buy-ins and an airline use case is a strong starting point as we start the process to achieve our common goals.</p>

<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently held its first post-pandemic,&nbsp; in-person meeting for <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">IATA’s One ID</a> working group in Montreal, with airlines, airports, governments, and other international organizations and companies involved in air travel presenting and discussing new digital identity solutions for the future of air travel. Indicio attended with <a href="https://www.sita.aero/">SITA</a> to demonstrate how its <a href="https://indicio.tech/all-aboard-a-new-era-of-travel-with-the-digital-travel-credential/">DTC-enabled travel credential</a> transforms the entire passenger experience from home to airport to hotel.</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/decentralized-identity-opens-the-doors-for-safe-travel-and-tourism/">Indicio began working with SITA</a>, the world’s largest supplier of IT solutions to the air transport sector, at the start of the pandemic: the goal, to create a privacy preserving way for travelers to prove their Covid test or vaccination status so that they could safely enter countries—and do so without these countries having to create complex, direct integrations with health providers or rely on third parties for data management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working with the Government of Aruba, the project successfully deployed open source decentralized identity technologies to create the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=sita+indicio&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safari_group=1">Aruba Health Pass</a>. This grew in sophistication to handle more complex use cases: Passengers in the US and Canada were able to get their Covid test from their health providers, combine it with air travel requirements, and check in and get approval for travel to Aruba—all before arriving at the airport.</p>
<p>This breakthrough laid the foundation for a big leap forward in the digitization of travel—a privacy-preserving verifiable digital credential based on the <a href="https://icao.int/">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO)’s protocol and standards for a <a href="https://www.icao.int/Security/FAL/TRIP/PublishingImages/Pages/Publications/Guiding%20core%20principles%20for%20the%20development%20of%20a%20Digital%20Travel%20Credential%20%20%28DTC%29.PDF">Digital Travel Credential</a> (DTC), which sets out the stages to creating a full digital and tamper-proof&nbsp; equivalent of a physical passport, something that would dramatically simplify check in and border control and transform the passenger experience (in other words, eliminate long airport lines).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together at the IATA working group meeting SITA, the Government of Aruba, and Indicio demonstrated how they implemented the DTC allowing travelers to create a digital version of their passport that could be used not only for check in and border control electronic travel authorization, but also for expedited check in at hotels and other tourist venues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By implementing an Indicio DTC-based verifiable credential, a hotel will get passport and connected data—with guest consent— before their guests arrive, streamlining the check-in process, saving guests time, and enabling staff to deliver a more personalized service. With the addition of biometric controls, travelers will be able to directly check into their hotel before they leave home for the airport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Indicio DTC will also be able to support hotels to securely use mobile keys — room keys on mobile devices — to provide guests with a more home-like experience. These kinds of personalized interactions are made possible by verifiable credentials using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiFbxcL_gv8">DIDComm</a>, a communications protocol for secure, peer-to-peer communication where each interaction is uniquely encrypted. DIDComm enables rich, personalized interaction and will help hotels deliver private, secure, digital concierge-like relationships with guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the kinds of processes and services enabled when verifiable digital credentials create Trusted Digital Ecosystems. Indicio and SITA are leading the market in digitizing the check-in process for airlines and using digital wallets to generate one-time, secure digital versions of passports that preserve passenger privacy.</p>

<p><a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-edge-wallet/">Orbit Edge</a> is a digital wallet app from Northern Block . It allows users to securely and privately receive, store and present digital credentials, build direct and secure peer-to-peer connections​, use private messaging functions and leverage holder-driven workflows (e.g., request to be issued a credential, ID proofing).<br>
Orbit Edge is built entirely on open standards, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). We pride ourselves on respecting open-source project specification in our implementations, such as Hyperledger Aries, to which we not only consume, but contribute to.</p>
<p>Recently, we’ve added a Notifications Inbox feature within the digital wallet app.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It enhances the product by:</p>
 
 Providing an inbox type capability which lists all the credential exchange transactions. 
 Visually notifying the mobile wallet holder that a proof request or a credential offer has been received. 
 Enhancing the user experience by including a notification type, sender and date stamp. This allows the user to have a full overview and act accordingly. 
 Allowing the user to delete notifications; For example if a sender is spamming for a proof request, or issuing credentials to the user which they’re not interested in. 
 Organizing the notifications through a date stamp to help the user to know the recency of them. 
 
<p>In our upcoming mobile wallet release,&nbsp; we will further improve the user experience of the Notification Inbox by enabling users to sort and filter through them.</p>
<p>As the best no-code SSI solutions, both the Orbit Edge mobile wallet and Orbit Enterprise platform allow for better interactions with customers, employees and organizations.</p>

 The Fast and Simple Way to Sell Physical Assets on the Blockchain <a href="http://mattereum.com/land">http://mattereum.com/land</a><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum’</a>s approach to linking physical assets to the blockchain is unique because it forms a “Universal Bridge” between the two. It’s like a bridge between two different blockchains, but it’s a bridge between real world assets like real estate and gold bullion, and the blockchain world of NFTs. We’ve cracked the hard problem of putting real estate on the blockchain using our Universal Bridge; there’s a <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa6cd9f96f73015bf6b2eaac9d7da09c860b377b2/0/">£1.9million piece of beachfront property</a> in the south of England being traded as an <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa6cd9f96f73015bf6b2eaac9d7da09c860b377b2/0/">NFT on OpenSea</a> by our clients West London City Lets through their blockchain subsidiary <a href="https://tokenized-properties.com/">Tokenized Properties</a>, using the Mattereum Universal Bridge.</p><p>Buying the NFT gives you the option to have full title to the land transferred to you. We offer this to the rest of the industry as as service: bring us your projects, your assets, and we’ll bring them across the Universal Bridge for you by securely turning them into&nbsp;NFTs.</p><blockquote>We’ve cracked the hard problem of putting real estate, and everything else, on the blockchain</blockquote><p>There are other approaches to putting physical assets on the blockchain, but these are designed for a specific asset class, or a small number of related asset classes, and doing something different would need a whole lot of new legal work. If it exists in the physical world, however, Mattereum can put it on the blockchain — a Universal Bridge. We did think of calling it “the Mattereum Rainbow Bridge’’ because Asgard, right; that would be cool; and it is capable of putting the whole spectrum of property on&nbsp;chain.</p><a href="https://en.celebrity.tn/whats-the-bridge-called-in-thor/">https://en.celebrity.tn/whats-the-bridge-called-in-thor/</a><p>But then we thought — Marvel, hmmm, they have <a href="https://screenrant.com/she-hulk-other-marvel-comics-characters-lawyers/">serious lawyers</a>, so maybe we shouldn’t go there, we do not want to be tangling with Matt Murdoch or She-Hulk — so “Universal Bridge’’ it&nbsp;is.</p><p><a href="https://screenrant.com/she-hulk-other-marvel-comics-characters-lawyers/">She-Hulk And 9 Other Marvel Comics Characters Who Are Lawyers</a></p><p>And it is universal; we can literally use this Mattereum Universal Bridge for anything you can think of, and for anyone — asset owners, exchanges, other physical asset NFT protocols, brokers and dealers — <a href="https://mattereum.com/contact-us/">Mattereum’s Universal Bridge service is open </a>for you to bring your physical assets to the blockchain of your choice, enabling them to be sold using a Physical Asset NFT that gives the purchaser ownership of the physical thing itself. Literally reach out, talk to our team, and we can get your project&nbsp;started.</p><blockquote>Mattereum’s Universal Bridge service is open for you to bring your physical assets to the blockchain</blockquote><p>So, how does the Mattereum Universal Bridge work? Deep breath… Property is defined by law. Mattereum’s ability to bind a smart object to legal contracts means we can connect the physical property and associated property rights to the blockchain, forming a bridge. All forms of property more developed than a bear guarding a cave are created by law; this is something that is under-appreciated, even by the libertarians. The thing that makes something property is law and there is no property that exists that is not defined by law. This means that if you can figure out the binding between the law and the blockchain, you can load any kind of property you like into the blockchain by only having to write the configuration contracts that specify the attributes of the property and the correct parts of the legal invocation such that the binding&nbsp;works.</p><blockquote>All forms of property more developed than a bear guarding a cave are created by&nbsp;law</blockquote><p>Let’s take a deeper dive into the law side of things so we can understand precisely how this forms part of the Universal Bridge. Commercially significant law is either the law of the jurisdiction the property is in, for example a Japanese house is subject to Japanese law, or the law governing the contracts agreed between the two parties making the transfer. This doesn’t have to be in the same jurisdiction as the parties contracting internationally (or even in the same country) can choose the law under which they want the contract to operate. The most common choice is English common law, so as part of the contract the two parties agree that the contract will be under English common law. If there is then a dispute it will be referred to an arbitrator who will be drawn from a contractually defined group of arbitrators knowledgeable and qualified in English common law. Any disputes that then arise get resolved by courts or arbitrators in the agreed contract jurisdiction and the local court will honour the word of that arbitration court. All that is standard commercial law and it already handles hundreds of millions of transactions a year. That gives us the binding between the physical object and the law, and it applies to all forms of property in the almost <a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/countries">170 countries</a> who are signatories to the 1958 New York Convention on Arbitration, which makes it <a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/court+decisions/decisions+per+country">universal</a> for almost all practical purposes.</p><a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/countries">https://www.newyorkconvention.org/countries</a><p>Binding the physical object to the law only gets us so far. For the bridge to reach all the way to the blockchain, there needs to be an extra step that binds the law to the chain; this is where Mattereum’s system comes into play. Mattereum makes this all-important final connection through its unique system of<a href="https://mattereum.com/mattereum-asset-passports/"> Mattereum Asset Passports (MAPs)</a>. MAPs accurately define the object and connect it to warranties that make legally enforceable claims about the thing being defined and link it to an automated custodian. This is the perfect legal counterpart to a smart contract, and it forms the final part of the legally binding bridge between the object, its legal status and related contractual obligations, and the blockchain. This allows trusted trade in any kind of object and in addition allows objects to be bought and sold as NFTs without the need to physically transfer the item or even necessarily see it, such as gold or an artwork secured in a vault. It also means that an NFT linked to a piece of real estate can be transferred without buyers having to redo all the legals because they are already there on the blockchain.</p><blockquote>Our unique system of Mattereum Asset Passports (MAPs) binds law to the blockchain</blockquote><p>Well, we now have a Universal Bridge that can connect literally anything to the blockchain with full legal backing, whether physical objects or things like intellectual property licences, but what can it be used for? We’ve already mentioned gold, and artwork sales — Mattereum has used the Universal Bridge to put <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/05/26/lohko-and-mattereum-launch-groundbreaking-verifiable-gold-bullion-nfts/">gold bars</a> on the blockchain that can be bought and sold as NFTs, allowing purchasers to realise the value and security of gold while at the same time keeping it safely vaulted, and we’ve put a <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/02/10/mattereum-sells-unique-historic-ring-as-an-ethereum-nft-warhol-up-next/">valuable Warhol</a> on chain too. So far the gold we have put on chain for clients has been bought by individuals, but it’s entirely possible to use gold with a MAP to back a currency — anybody can inspect the gold reserves of a project which buys its gold as NFTs by using a blockchain explorer. We’ve mentioned how we can <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/09/26/mattereum-customer-west-london-city-lets-launch-first-real-estate-physical-asset-nft-for-land-in-uk/">sell actual real estate as an NFT</a> that gives the purchaser an option to own the land, too, but there’s a whole bunch of other ways real estate can be managed through the Universal Bridge. It could, for example, have a role to play in preserving the Amazon, which is a whole different story. We’ve done it for collectables, starting with <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/03/30/the-william-shatner-collection-is-live/">William Shatner memorabilia</a> and more recently <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/02/24/real-world-asset-nft-auction-for-million-dollar-trumpet-goes-live/">a famous musician’s favourite instrumen</a>t that came with a suite of associated perks for the purchaser.</p><p>You could choose to use the Universal Bridge to lend money on cars or to precisely specify second hand parts for a jet engine, then move them round the world so airlines could get exactly what they need, when they need it, in the sure knowledge that the part is genuine and its service history hasn’t been falsified. You could use this system to manage the transfer of assets along a supply chain, making it impossible for anyone to slip counterfeits into the&nbsp;system.</p><a href="https://mattereum.com/asset-classes/">https://mattereum.com/asset-classes/</a><p>The assets don’t even need to be physical (although physical assets are at the heart of what Mattereum does), it is entirely possible to manage intellectual property on the blockchain via the Mattereum Universal Bridge, or to arrange hotel bookings. And that’s all without even mentioning tags — we already have the capability to put tags on physical objects that encode the details of their MAP and so directly link the thing to the blockchain. This means that bulk goods such as clothes can all be tagged so that they can easily be resold and buyers can check that they were ethically produced, aren’t counterfeit etc etc, repairs can be logged, service histories included. This enables a more efficient <a href="https://mattereum.com/circular-economy/">circular economy</a> as when an item comes to the end of its life it will be possible to know exactly what is in it so it can be effectively recycled.These just scratch the surface of the possibilities, we’re always interested in <a href="https://mattereum.com/contact-us/">hearing from clients</a> who have new ideas for using our service to connect their assets to the blockchain via the Mattereum Universal Bridge, as well as those who have some of the above assets they would like to talk to us about; there are literally no limits. Universal.</p><blockquote>The Universal Bridge can connect literally anything to the blockchain</blockquote><p>This is all very well, but the Universal Bridge only works as a service if it is cost effective for its users. It saves businesses money by solving real business problems, that’s for certain. Real estate sales take forever, but Mattereum has streamlined the transaction by ensuring that legal documentation about the property and title, which would normally require time and expense on the part of the purchaser to sort out, is securely stored on chain. It isn’t good for investment grade wine to be moved all the time, but Mattereum <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/06/24/ig-wines-partners-with-mattereum-to-disrupt-fine-wine-and-whisky-trading-on-the-blockchain/">makes it possible for bottles to change ownership</a> without ever leaving their cellar, and so on. To do this via the Mattereum Universal Bridge is transactionally efficient too. We’ll bring any asset to the blockchain and typically charge less than 2% of its value for the service, and we can make it work in any jurisdiction and on any chain of your choosing. The Universal Bridge is flexible as well, it configures slightly differently depending on the needs of the asset class; we aren’t trying to force everything into a cookie cutter solution. The MAP can be configured to take account of the norms and conventions of the industry within which the asset is being traded, so a MAP for a gold bar will take account of different things from a MAP for a piece of real estate, and one for a bottle of wine will be different again. All of them, though, will do the same job and take their asset over the Mattereum Universal Bridge.</p><blockquote>We’ll bring any asset to the blockchain and typically charge less than 2% of its value for the&nbsp;service</blockquote><p>Mattereum isn’t just about selling stuff. We aim to use the Universal Bridge to make the world a better place while doing that; but how would that work? Well, on a very basic level, in an emergency situation, an earthquake, a refugee crisis, things like that, when a lot of specific things are needed now and there is a lot of chaos on the ground, being able to find exactly the right things and direct them to where they are needed will be made much easier by MAPs, and the ability to track aid means that the problem of corruption skimming off large amounts of it is essentially solved, so disaster relief becomes a lot&nbsp;simpler.</p><p>But that’s just one specific set of problems. The Universal Bridge has far wider implications for the world economy. Imagine if you could get rid of counterfeit goods; accurate descriptions of things supported by legally enforceable warranties in the MAP can do that, and that’s 2–3% of global GDP, right there. This is a small benefit, though, compared to being able to search the world’s goods to find an exact item that meets your precise specification. With the MAP being machine readable and on the blockchain it can do precisely that using semantic search. No more rummaging in online marketplaces to find something that is kind of OK-ish for what you need, but the exact right thing, found in moments and then shipped to you in hours — the Universal Bridge can make that a reality. Even so, that’s still a small benefit compared to the ability to get the truth out of everyone so that you know what you buy will perform properly.</p><p>With the warranties in the MAP, sellers are incentivised to provide the truth about the object for sale because they come with legally enforceable financial penalties, balanced by better prices for trustable items and an opportunity to get a payment against your warranty in every subsequent sale. There are still larger benefits to be had though; all these benefits are dwarfed by giving everyone the ability to get rid of surplus things and get them to the people who want them quickly, easily and profitably, it doubles liquidity of the global economy as you can get rid of clutter for 80–90% of what you paid for it because someone out there WILL want it, be able to find it and make a deal with you for it easily. Trickle down economics that&nbsp;works.</p><p>But the biggest benefit of all comes from all these systems working together to bring physical property into the digital age in a globally optimised way. This allows us to use the global market and other mechanisms to fix the human race’s relationship with matter, stop us being ruled by our junk and end the destruction of our planet that happens because we are making the wrong things at the wrong time and are not using the things we made yesterday in an effective way. Mattereum’s Universal Bridge is, in the end, the Universal Bridge to a better, <a href="https://mattereum.com/circular-economy/">more sustainable</a>, future.</p>For more about the spiral economy, see our upcoming&nbsp;piece.<blockquote>Mattereum’s Universal Bridge is the Universal Bridge to a better, more sustainable, future.</blockquote><p>This is not hype and hand waving about something Mattereum hopes to do in the future, it is a reality right now. Physical objects, bought and sold on the blockchain, using the Mattereum Universal Bridge.

<p>The latest initiative seeks to incentivise strategic predictions of ETH price post the Ethereum&nbsp;Merge</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol,</a> the Web3 platform to unlock data for AI and business innovation, has kicked off its latest ETH Prediction Challenge — the first of many crypto data competitions. In this challenge, contestants are requested to engage with the Ocean tools to predict ETH prices and show insights into their predictions. From a total prize pool of $5000, rewards for this challenge will be distributed as follows: 1st place: $2,500, 2nd place: $1,500, 3rd place: $1,000. Rewards are payable in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>The ETH Prediction Challenge is a part of the broader <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-the-ocean-data-bounty-7eb1e3bf3c0a">Ocean Data Challenge</a> program — a strategic initiative launched in July 2022 to incentivise data-driven insights and the building of algorithms to solve complex business challenges. The aim of the challenge is to activate relevant communities of data scientists and Web3 natives and facilitate learnings for accelerated adoption of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>As part of the challenge, participants will be invited to engage with the Ocean.py library to retrieve recent historical data from the APIs provided. The objective is to create a report with the predictions for ETH price over a 24-hour period, with the first prediction on Mon Oct 17, 2022, at 1:00 am UTC, and a prediction every hour on the hour after that, for 24 predictions total. Contestants are also challenged to submit a “final project presentation” of 10–30 slides describing their approach, any difficulties encountered, and insights gained in making the predictions.</p><p>In order to be considered for the competition, contestants are requested to closely follow the steps outlined in the <a href="https://bit.ly/3LFc5XP">ocean.py READM</a>E. Important deliverables include: Accessing data locally from assets on Ocean, building a simple AI model, running the model to make future ETH price predictions, publishing the predictions as an Ocean asset as a CSV file and sharing access with the competition organizers.</p><p>A panel of evaluators from Ocean will review and rank all submission entries selecting 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners. 80% of the score will be measured using the <a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/regression-analysis/rmse-root-mean-square-error/">Root Mean Square Error </a>(RMSE) of the predictions while the other 20% of the final score will be based on the presentation slides, and the relevance of the information provided. This will be measured by a panel of&nbsp;judges.</p><p>Note: Your predictions MUST be submitted as their own dataset in Ocean. The specific instructions are in the README. The selection will be announced publicly. All valid entries submitted will receive an award of 250 $OCEAN&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The ETH Prediction Challenge datasets are live on the Ocean Market and the entry submission deadline is Sunday 16th October at 23:59 PM UTC. To enter the competition and access the full challenge details, visit the dedicated Questbook page&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/3SpbpIm">here</a>.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a New Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data.

<p>React Native is a mobile app framework from Facebook. It allows you to quickly develop apps using React’s API and deploy them to iOS and Android. It allows you to quickly refresh the apps when you make changes and generally offers a pleasant experience for web developers.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/">React Native for Web</a> is a recent addition to the React Native family. It allows you to run your app in a browser and enjoy the browser’s built-in dev tools. It’s optimized for mobile and uses the same components as React Native, so it looks good too!</p>
 
 
<p>In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to create a React Native application that deploys to the web, iOS, and Android. You’ll configure it to use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication and use OAuth 2.0 access tokens to talk securely to a Spring Boot API.</p>
 
 
<p>Below is a diagram of the app you’ll create in this tutorial and its authentication flow.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11+</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://nodejs.org">Node 16+</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>If you’re on Windows, you may need to install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> for some commands to work.</p>
 
 
<p>I recommend using SDKMAN to manage your OpenJDK installations. Just run <code>sdk install java 11.0.2-open</code> to install Java 11 and <code>sdk install java 17-open</code> for Java 17.</p>

 Quick apps with JHipster 
 
 
<p>JHipster is a full-stack application generator that uses Spring Boot on the backend and Angular, React, or Vue on the frontend. It started as an open source project in 2013 before any of these frameworks existed. It then used Spring MVC for the backend and AngularJS for the frontend.</p>
 
 
<p>Its popularity grew quickly along with its adoption and rise of the frameworks above. Today, it averages over 100K downloads per month. It even has a healthy budget, thanks to its sponsors and backers via <a href="https://opencollective.com/generator-jhipster">Open Collective</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Why am I telling you this? Because JHipster will help you build your React Native app and it was used to create the backend in a previous tutorial.</p>
 
 
 
 
 JHipster blueprints for more power! 
 
 
<p>JHipster added a blueprints feature several years ago. It allows you, as a developer, to create a project that overrides the default behavior of JHipster. This feature has led to a <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/modules/official-blueprints/">thriving ecosystem of blueprints</a>, from Kotlin to Micronaut to .NET Core to NestJS to Svelte to Ionic and even React Native.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’ll show you how to use <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-react-native">JHipster’s React Native blueprint</a> to build a Flickr clone. The backend will be powered by the Spring Boot app created in <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/">Full Stack Java with React, Spring Boot, and JHipster</a> tutorial. The React Native app’s screens will be generated from the same JDL (JHipster Domain Language) file that created the backend entities.</p>
 
 
<p>I’m excited to show you how to use JHipster React Native because its <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-react-native/releases/tag/v4.3.0">4.3.0 release</a> upgrades it Expo 46, React Native 0.69.5, and React 18. Let’s giddyup! 🤠</p>
 
 
 
 
 Build a photo gallery with React and Spring Boot 
 
 
<p>Start by creating a new directory to hold your frontend and backend projects:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>take react-native-spring-boot</code> 
 
 
 






<code>take</code> is a command that makes a directory and moves into it.



 
 
<p>Clone an existing JHipster app into a <code>backend</code> directory:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git backend</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This app is configured to use OIDC for authentication and needs a provider configured to start correctly. To make things quick, a pre-configured Keycloak instance is configured with a Docker Compose file. You can start it:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd backend
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Apple Silicon and Keycloak 
 
<p>If you’re using Apple Silicon (aka M1 or M2), Keycloak will fail to start because its Docker image wasn’t available for an M1 when the backend project was created. To fix it, run the script below.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>VERSION=15.0.2 # Keycloak version specified in keycloak.yml
cd /tmp
git clone git@github.com:keycloak/keycloak-containers.git
cd keycloak-containers/server
git checkout $VERSION
docker build -t "jboss/keycloak:${VERSION}" .
docker build -t "quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:${VERSION}" .</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Then, start the backend using <code>./mvnw</code> and open your favorite browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You should be able to log in with <code>admin/admin</code> and upload photos. They’ll be displayed in a nice grid, and you can click each photo to zoom in.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Now let’s create a React Native app that talks to the same API.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Generate a React Native app 
 
 
<p>Install React Native JHipster and the Expo CLI:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-react-native expo-cli</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a directory for your React Native app:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>take mobile</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run the following command to use the React Native blueprint to create an app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster --blueprints react-native # you can also use `rnhipster`</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When prompted, use the following values:</p>
 







Prompt
Answer




<p>What do you want to name your React Native application?</p>
<p><code>Flickr2</code></p>


<p>Enter the directory where your JHipster app is located:</p>
<p><code>../backend</code></p>


<p>Do you want to enable end-to-end tests with Detox?</p>
<p><code>No</code></p>



 
<p>Next, generate screens based on the entities in the backend project. Press a (for all) when prompted to overwrite files.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>rnhipster jdl ../backend/flickr2.jdl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In the backend project, change its <code>src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml</code> to allow <code>http://localhost:19006</code> for CORS (cross-origin resource sharing):</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cors:
  allowed-origins: 'http://localhost:19006,...'</code> 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://expo.dev/signup">Sign up for an Expo account</a> and take note of your username.</p>
 
 
<p>Log in to <a href="http://localhost:9080/auth/admin/">Keycloak</a> (with <code>admin/admin</code> as credentials). Navigate to Clients &gt; web_app and add <code>https://auth.expo.io/@&lt;your-expo-username&gt;/Flickr2</code> as a Valid Redirect URI. Save your changes.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Hide the metadata (height, width, date taken, and date uploaded) for photos in the add photo screen (<code>mobile/app/modules/entities/photo/photo-edit-screen.js</code>) when uploading a new photo. This isn’t necessary, but the backend calculates these values for you, so they won’t be saved. Below are the changes you need to make.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>const metadata = (
  &lt;View&gt;
  // move the form fields for height, width, taken, and uploaded here
  &lt;/View&gt;
)
const metadataRows = isNewEntity ? '' : metadata;

// Replace the form fields you moved with the following
{metadataRows}</code>

 Run your React Native app 
 
 
<p>If the backend app isn’t running, open a terminal and navigate to the <code>backend</code> directory. Then, run <code>./mvnw</code> (or <code>mvnw</code> on Windows). Of course, if you have Maven installed, you can simply run <code>mvn</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Open a new terminal window and navigate into the <code>mobile</code> directory. Run <code>npm start</code> and type w to open in a web browser. You should be able to log in and view any photos you added to the backend. You can even edit and replace them.</p>

<a></a>
 
  










  
 
<a></a>
 
  
  
 
<a></a>
 
  



 
 Test on iOS 
 
<p>To see your React Native app running on iOS, press i in the window you ran <code>npm start</code> from. You will need to be on a Mac with Xcode installed for this to work.</p>
 







  
 

 
  
  
 

 
  



 






You can reload your app in Simulator using ⌘+R.



 
 
 
 Test on Android 
 
<p>To see your React Native app running on Android, press a in the window you ran <code>npm start</code> from. You will need Android Studio and an AVD (Android Virtual Device) running. I tested on a Pixel 5 with API 31 (Android 12.0).</p>
 
 
<p>For the Android emulator to communicate with your API and Keycloak, you’ll need to add some port mappings. You’ll know the command worked if <code>8080</code> and <code>9080</code> are printed to your terminal.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080 &amp;&amp; adb reverse tcp:9080 tcp:9080</code> 
 
 
 






If you get a <code>command not found</code> error, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10303639/adb-command-not-found">this Stack Overflow Q &amp; A</a> to solve it. I used <code>echo export "PATH=~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH" &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc</code> on my Mac.



 
 
<p>To reload your app, hit r twice with a focus on the Android emulator.</p>
 








  
 

 
  
  
 

 
  
  
 

 
  



 
 
 
 
 Use Auth0 for identity 
 
 
<p>JHipster ships with Keycloak when you choose OAuth 2.0 / OIDC as the authentication type. However, you can easily change it to another identity provider, like Auth0!</p>
 
 
<p>First, you’ll need to configure the backend to use Auth0 by registering a regular web application. Log in to your Auth0 account (or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">sign up</a> if you don’t have an account). You should have a unique domain like <code>dev-xxx.us.auth0.com</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Select Create Application in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications">Applications section</a>. Use a name like <code>JHipster Baby!</code>, select <code>Regular Web Applications</code>, and click Create.</p>
 
 
<p>Switch to the Settings tab and configure your application settings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Allowed Callback URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code></p>
 
 
<p>Allowed Logout URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes.</p>
 
 
<p>In the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles">roles</a> section, create new roles named <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new user account in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/users">users</a> section. Click the Role tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.</p>
 
 
<p>Make sure your new user’s email is verified before attempting to log in!</p>
 
 
<p>Next, head to Actions &gt; Flows and select Login. Create a new action named <code>Add Roles</code> and use the default trigger and runtime. Change the <code>onExecutePostLogin</code> handler to be as follows:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) =&gt; {
  const namespace = 'https://www.jhipster.tech';
  if (event.authorization) {
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim('preferred_username', event.user.email);
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
    api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This code adds the user’s roles to a custom claim (prefixed with <code>https://www.jhipster.tech/roles</code>). This claim is mapped to Spring Security authorities in <code>SecurityUtils.java</code> on the backend.</p>
 
 
<p>Select Deploy and drag the <code>Add Roles</code> action to your Login flow. Create a <code>backend/.auth0.env</code> file and populate it with your Auth0 settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;your-client-secret&gt;
export JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/</code> 
 
 
 






Want to have all these steps automated for you? Watch <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/issues/351">issue #351</a> in the Auth0 CLI project.



 
 
<p>Stop your backend app with Ctrl+C and run the following commands to configure Spring Security to use Auth0.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .auth0.env
./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
 Create a native OIDC app for React Native 
 
<p>For the React Native app to use Auth0, you’ll need to create a Native app and add the following Allowed Callback URLs:</p>
 
 
 
 http://localhost:19006/,https://auth.expo.io/@&lt;your-expo-username&gt;/Flickr2 
 
 
 
<p>Configure Allowed Logout URLs:</p>
 
 
 
 http://localhost:19006,https://auth.expo.io/@&lt;your-expo-username&gt;/Flickr2 
 
 
 
<p>And, set the Allowed Origins (CORS):</p>
 
 
 
 http://localhost:19006,http://localhost 
 
 
 
<p>The second value is the origin header that Android sends. Copy the client ID to <code>app/config/app-config.js</code> and update the <code>audience</code> in <code>app/modules/login/login.utils.ts</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>audience: 'https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/',</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your React Native app and log in with Auth0!</p>
 







  
 

 
  
  
 

 
  



 
<p>It works on Android too. 🥳</p>
 







  
 

 
  
  
 

 
  



 
 
 Use Okta for identity 
 
<p>If you’d like to use Okta as your identity provider, see <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">JHipster’s documentation</a> for configuring the backend app.</p>
 
 






You can configure JHipster quickly with the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>: <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>



 
 
<p>You’ll need to <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#create-a-native-app-for-mobile-on-okta">create a native app on Okta</a> for React Native too.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Log out from your identity provider 
 
 
<p>You probably didn’t notice, but if you log in to your app when it’s running on iOS or Android, then log out, when you try to log in again, you aren’t prompted for credentials. This is because the React Native blueprint configures the best developer experience. It’s kind of a pain to enter your credentials each time on a mobile device. Also, Expo’s auth proxy does not currently work with logging out from the identity provider. If you look at <code>app/config/app-config.js</code>, you’ll see that only <code>web</code> disables the auth proxy.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>useExpoAuthProxy: Platform.select({ web: false, default: true }),</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you want to sign out on native apps completely, change the value to <code>false</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>useExpoAuthProxy: false,</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Disabling the auth proxy will cause your app’s redirect URIs to change. You’ll need to update your identity provider to add the following to your login and logout URLs:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>exp://&lt;your-ip-address&gt;:19000 # e.g., exp://172.20.10.4:19000</code> 
 
 
 






You can open your Auth0 app quickly with the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli">Auth0 CLI</a>: <code>auth0 apps open</code>



 
 
<p>After making these changes, reload your app. On iOS, it’ll show a permission dialog when you try to log out.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Unfortunately, this is part of iOS and not something that can be suppressed. On the upside, your users probably don’t want to log out fully. You haven’t logged out of Gmail recently, have you?</p>
 
 
 
 
 Deploy to production 
 
 
<p>The React Native project is configured to work with Expo Application Services (EAS) Build. To use it, you’ll need to install the EAS CLI:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g eas-cli</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, log in to your Expo account:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>eas login</code> 
 
 
 
<p>And configure your project:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>eas build:configure</code> 
 
 
 
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/">Creating your first build docs</a>. To learn how to deploy to production and make your app available in app stores, explore <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/deployment-patterns/">EAS Deployment patterns</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about React Native, Spring Boot, and JHipster 
 
 
<p>I hope you enjoyed this quick tour of securely integrating a Spring Boot backend with a React Native frontend. JHipster generated most of the code, leaving you more time to implement your custom business logic. It’s nice that OIDC authentication is supported out-of-the-box. It works so smoothly with Keycloak, Auth0, and Okta!</p>

<p>In the last post, we looked at how EVM and Solidity worked. In this post introduction, various blockchains are classified according to their characteristics.</p> 1. Blockchain model <p>Blockchain can be classified into a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model. Such as Bitcoin and an account-based model that supports smart contract functions such as Ethereum, depending on how it works. Briefly, the UTXO model calculates the user’s assets by tracking the transaction records of the blockchain. In contrast, the Account-based model has a form in which all users’ status values (such as balances) are updated every&nbsp;block.</p> UTXO model Fig 1. UTXO model&nbsp;example<p>The UTXO model refers to an unspent transaction to generate a new transaction. For example, for Alice to send 5 BTC to Bob, Alice has a 1 BTC transaction and 4 BTC transaction for which she is set as the recipient. She creates a 1 BTC transaction and 4 BTC transaction for which Bob is the recipient. Suppose Bob sends 3 BTC to Charlie. At this time, Bob creates a 4 BTC transaction that he receives from Alice, sends 3 BTC to Charlie, and sends the remaining 1 BTC to himself. The transaction is recorded in the block to complete the remittance transaction. Referring to Fig 1., Bob creates a transaction to send 3 BTC to Charlie. The difference between 1 BTC and 3 BTC received from Alice is not used in the transaction so it can be used&nbsp;later.</p><p>The UTXO model is a working method used in Bitcoin and Cardano. It is advantageous in terms of storage capacity because it does not manage the status values of all users in the blockchain but needs to be calculated in previous transactions. The disadvantage is that it is complicated to implement functions other than remittance. In a remittance transaction, the current status value is fixed to the recipient, the output value of the transaction, and the remittance amount, so you can track and calculate the previous transaction. It is not easy to implement within the UTXO&nbsp;model.</p> Account Based&nbsp;Model <p>The account-based model is a model that updates and manages the state values of all subjects registered in the blockchain every block. The UTXO model calculated the current state by referring to the previous transaction. In the account-based model, an address is given to a smart contract, a program executed by the user. The program’s state value and the blockchain participants are updated whenever a program is called. For example, suppose that Bob, who has 100 ETH, donates 10 ETH to a donation platform registered in the blockchain.</p>Fig 2. Account-based model example&nbsp;(a)<p>The latest block without Bob’s donation stores and manages the state shown in Fig 2. in the blockchain. After that, when Bob donates to the Donation contract, the program is executed by immediately loading Bob’s state from the latest&nbsp;block.</p>Fig 3. Account-based model example&nbsp;(b)<p>When the donate function of the Donation contract that contributes 10 ETH is performed, the function performance is stored in the blockchain, as shown in Figure 3 as the latest state&nbsp;value.</p><p>Therefore, to support general-purpose smart contracts, most blockchains, except for very few, operate under an account-based model. These blockchains can provide services such as loans, exchanges, deposits, and simple remittance functions. Metadium also follows the Account-based model, especially DID Contract for using DID (Decentralized Identifier) authentication services in Government.</p><p>However, since the status values of all External Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts (CA) must be stored in blocks, the larger the number of Accounts and Contracts, the larger the overall blockchain size and the slower the transaction processing speed.</p> 2. Layer of Blockchain  What is Blockchain layer? <p>Recently, as the size of the blockchain increases, having a fast transaction processing speed is emerging as a task for blockchain. Slow transaction processing speed and large capacity size are undesirable in terms of scalability in which many users participate in the blockchain. Two main solutions are currently proposed to solve this problem. First, there is a solution to have a fast transaction processing speed of the existing blockchain or a fast consensus speed while abandoning some decentralization. Second, it can be seen as dividing the blockchain into layers according to its function and transferring the load generated by the existing blockchain to other blockchains. As the number of attempts at the second approach has increased recently, the main blockchain, such as Ethereum, is named Layer 1 Blockchain. On the contrary, the blockchain operates as a module to reduce the transaction load of the main blockchain called Layer 2 Blockchain.</p> Layer 1 Blockchain <p>Layer 1 blockchain refers to a base network that can verify and finalize transactions without the intervention of other networks. Examples of Layer 1 blockchains include Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana network, and Avalanche.</p><p>As described above, the Layer 1 blockchain has a problem of scalability degradation due to slow transaction processing speed and large size. Various methods are currently being proposed to solve this problem. Among them, ways to solve the scalability problem of Layer 1 without the intervention of Layer 2 have been proposed. However, the most efficient method is still being discussed. Layer 1-based scalability problems can be broadly classified into three&nbsp;types.</p><p>1. Modify consensus mechanism</p><p>2. Increase block&nbsp;size</p><p>3. Database&nbsp;Sharding</p><p>Factors hindering the scalability of Layer 1 include slow consensus speed, slow transaction processing speed, and large blockchain size, which can be resolved through the above solutions.</p><p>Until now, Bitcoin and Ethereum blocks were created based on Proof of Work, which uses the computing power of miners as a resource necessary for block consensus. There have been attempts to modify the consensus mechanism to solve this problem, and Ethereum 2.0 is a representative example. Ethereum 2.0 modified the consensus mechanism from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, which partially solved the scalability problem. As another example, in the case of the Solana network, the consensus algorithm is equipped with a fast consensus algorithm by using a Byzantine Fault Tolerance-based consensus algorithm. Metadium uses Proof of Authority to solve the problem of slow consensus speed caused by Proof of&nbsp;Work.</p><p>Even if the block generation speed is fast through the fast consensus algorithm, the number of transactions that can be processed in one block is small and can cause slow transaction processing speed. An approach to increase the block size and process many transactions in one block is also proposed to solve this problem. A representative example is a blockchain such as Bitcoinsv, which increases Bitcoin’s block&nbsp;size.</p><p>Finally, various blockchains have also proposed a method using database sharding. Database sharding is a method to improve transaction throughput. The blockchain is divided and managed individually to support fast transaction processing speed and low-capacity blockchain size. Rather than storing the entire blockchain record, each node can store the sharding database and create blocks from it. As Layer 1 blockchains to which database sharding is applied, there are blockchains such as Elond and&nbsp;Harmony.</p> Future works <p>In addition to solving the scalability problem in Layer 1, the method of using Layer 2 is also being actively discussed. As for the scalability solution using Layer 2, side chain, Optimistic Rollup, and zk-Rollup are predominantly suggested, which will be discussed in future&nbsp;posts.</p> References   <a href="https://bitcoinsv.com/feature/onchain-scaling/">On-Chain Scaling :: Bitcoin SV</a>  <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-layer-1-in-blockchain">What Is Layer 1 in Blockchain? | Binance Academy</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/classification-of-blockchain-types-and-introduction-to-layer-1-blockchain-12a0bc955eec">Classification of Blockchain Types and Introduction to Layer 1 Blockchain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Why customer identity and access management (CIAM) has become business-critical 

<p>Customer experience is the top priority for consumer-facing organizations today, and creating great experiences starts with a customer's very first digital interaction with a company, in other words, identity. Providing customers with simple and safe registration, login, purchasing, and managing preferences — regardless of what device they are on — engages customers so they'll spend more time on your site — and be far more likely to come back.</p>
	
<p>CIAM is an outgrowth of identity and access management (IAM), but its technical requirements differ considerably from traditional workforce solutions. The scale required to serve customers' digital identities, which may number in the millions, even billions, is vastly greater than what's needed for workforce IAM. In the consumer world, change is a constant, and consumer expectations require companies to act quickly to deliver fresh experiences, innovative features, and personalization.</p>
	
<p>As the demand for CIAM capabilities has grown, many new companies have entered the market and others have acquired technologies to bring CIAM solutions into their service offerings. But ForgeRock was built from the ground up for CIAM. Today, we have more than four billion identities under management and our platform supports more than 60,000 transactions per second per customer.</p>

<blockquote><p>"CIAM systems must be able to manage many millions to even billions of identities, and process potentially tens of billions of logins and other transactions per day."</p>
		<p>– John Tolbert, Lead Analyst and Managing Director, KuppingerCole</p></blockquote>

 Why ForgeRock stands out as an overall leader out of 22 CIAM vendors 

<p>We believe our continued recognition by KuppingerCole and other analysts is the result of our ongoing commitment to innovate on behalf of our customers. Our modern <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/CIAM">CIAM</a> platform is helping companies deliver exceptional digital experiences while ensuring that their customers’ security, privacy, and compliance needs are met.

<blockquote><p>"ForgeRock CIAM provides orchestration capabilities that enable enterprises to reduce fraud risks and improve the customer experience by appropriately matching identity assurance levels with business policy and regulatory requirements."</p>
		<p>– John Tolbert, Lead Analyst and Managing Director, KuppingerCole</p></blockquote>

				  Indicio recently participated in the Hyperledger Global Forum September 12-14 of this year, in this article we will touch on some of the reasons we attended and why we would highly recommend it to anyone in the community.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Some background on the event</p>
<p>The <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/hyperledger-global-forum/">Hyperledger Global Forum</a> is a once-yearly, three-day “mega event” put on by the Hyperledger Foundation to bring&nbsp; members of the open source, enterprise blockchain community together to discuss the state of the technology, the business environment, accomplishments, and future projects.</p>
<p>An open source project of the Linux Foundation, The Hyperledger Foundation houses premier blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) toolboxes, repositories, and libraries. It’s widely known as a place for people who are interested in blockchain to come and contribute to open source projects and participate in the community.</p>
<p>This year’s Global Forum was the first time since the pandemic to be held in-person, and people were particularly excited to attend this one in Dublin.</p>
<p>Why Indicio was there</p>
<p>Indicio was involved in a few sessions at the event, the highlights being Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio on <a href="https://sched.co/14H42">how to best solve market problems</a> with open source verifiable credentials (with <a href="https://idramp.com">IdRamp</a> CEO Mike Vesey), and the <a href="https://sched.co/1AUBM">state of decentralized identity</a>, where we are now and where we’re going with Kaliya Young, Marie Wallace, and Drummond Reed.</p>
<p>In addition to speaking engagements, Indicio has always been involved with and dedicated to giving back to the <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-source/">open source technology community</a>, and Hyperledger Global Forum is a great event to share ideas and make connections. Some of the notable sessions include Jim St. Clair, Executive Director of the Linux Foundation Public Health discussing <a href="https://sched.co/14H6Y">best practices for blockchain in healthcare</a>, Liz Tanner, Secretary of Commerce for the state of Rhode Island talking about how <a href="https://sched.co/14H6e">Rhode Island is leading the way with digital identity</a>, and a representative from the Government of British Columbia <a href="https://sched.co/15Agp">demonstrating the Hyperledger Aries Bifold digital wallet</a> in action.</p>
<p>Why you should make it a priority to attend the next Global Forum</p>
<p>There are three important reasons why you should attend the next Global Forum — if you are on the fence about whether or not you should go.</p>
<p>There is so much more to the event than just sessions, this is a place for conversation with peers about similar goals. Those refreshment breaks offer the chance to have the kinds of discussion, planned and serendipitous, that just can’t happen in the same way online.</p>
<p>You’ll get to ask questions. It can be daunting to ask questions in a working group full of experts or you may feel like there simply isn’t the time to address them. At Global Forum, the Hyperledger Foundation does a great job fostering an atmosphere that is welcoming to all skill levels, and most people are happy to talk at length about their experiences.</p>
<p>We can’t stress this last point enough: you’ll get to be a part of the community. The open source community working on decentralization technology is growing, but is still small enough where people can and do get recognized for their contributions. Being able to make face-to-face connections can give you the opportunity to learn about unfamiliar projects, how to join working groups, give you the chance to gain more experience, and, ultimately, make your own contributions.</p>
<p>For a taste of what some of the sessions are like we would encourage you to watch the panel discussion on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXEk8eCO2JU">state of decentralized identity</a> with Heather Dahl.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In 2006, Clive Humby, a British mathematician and entrepreneur, famously coined the term that data is the new oil. Today, that statement continues to hold true. However, not all data has equal value. If general data is the new oil, then digital identities are gold nuggets. Just like physical gold bars, digital identities should be stored and processed with utmost care and attention to detail.</p>
<p>Sadly, this hasn’t always been the case. When Ubisecure was founded over two decades ago, security and privacy online was still in its infancy – often an after thought that was managed reactively. The existing European privacy legislation at that time was from 1995 – a time when Internet access was a luxury, not a commodity if not a necessity.</p>
<p>Much has changed over the last two decades. We have witnessed the explosive growth of online services from both the public and private sector, and slowly but surely it has been recognised how central part digital identities play in digitalised ecosystems. Two major changes have been the adoption of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in 2016, and the massive expansion and adaption of cloud-based platforms.</p>
<p>The GDPR brought into limelight the value of digital identities, and cloud-based platforms have enabled trialling and scaling new online services easier than ever.</p>
<p>Lately, there has been considerable interesting in one specific subtype of cloud platforms – the hybrid cloud. A hybrid cloud approach is indeed an agile way to make quick adaptations to your digital business, but it is not without its considerations. Before we explore the benefits and caveats of a hybrid cloud approach, let’s take a high-level look at the three major cloud models.</p>
 Types of cloud 
<p>The most common cloud computing deployment is a public cloud. In a public cloud, the virtualised resources (the compute servers and data storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider. They are delivered over the Internet, and are readily available to the general public. All hardware and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider. Typically, there are no charges on a per-user basis and other costs follow a non-linear trend tier by tier, with the higher tiers being progressively less economical.</p>
<p>The next one is the private cloud. Unlike a public cloud, the virtualised computing resources and data storage in its infrastructure are dedicated to a single organisation. The daily management and operation services are performed by the organisation itself or a third-party cloud service provider. A private cloud may itself consist of a mixture of both self-managed and third-party maintained infrastructure, depending upon the organisation’s requirements. Private clouds are mostly used for processing confidential internal data, for very high loads where public clouds lose some of their cost advantages, and/or due to regulatory concerns.</p>
<p>More rarely encountered is the community cloud, in which multiple communities who process similar data with common concerns share the computing resources placed in a single cloud with shared data services. For example, several research institutes could have (virtualised) HPC (High-Performance Computing) clusters operating as a community cloud service.</p>
 Cloud Platforms 
<p>Now that we have gone through the three major types of cloud platforms, we can take a closer look at hybrid clouds. The hybrid cloud is the combination of an on-premises data storage (or a private/community cloud) with a public cloud or even several public clouds. Often a hybrid cloud model is chosen to balance the safety and security of data with scalability, the ease of maintenance and possibly even a lower total cost of ownership in case of traffic.</p>
<p>When computing and processing demand increases beyond an on-premises datacentre’s capabilities. Organisations can use a public cloud or several clouds to instantly scale capacity up or down to handle fluctuating demand. This is called “cloud bursting”. When demand spikes, additional computing resources can be quickly provisioned from a public cloud, while the private infrastructure handles the base load. A good example would be a retailer handling Black Friday or Christmas sales peaks by provisioning additional capacity from a public cloud, as it is not cost-efficient to size local datacentres according to peak loads. Offloading some of the work to a public cloud allows them to avoid the time and cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining new servers that are needed for only short periods of time.</p>
<p>Another very important advantage of a hybrid cloud approach is having strict control over the data – where it is stored and processed and by whom. In this kind of hybrid cloud architecture, organisations gain some of the scalability, flexibility and cost advantages of a public cloud for less regulated computing tasks, while still meeting their industry requirements for data protection and data residency.</p>
 Examples 
<p>For example, governmental and financial institutions typically have very strict rules on data residency. Logically, one might therefore ask why not go all way to a pure on-premises data centre solution then? After all, a third party that does not have access to your data can’t possibly lose, steal or leak it. Sometimes this indeed is the only reasonable option, but then the cost-efficacy advantages are lost.</p>
<p>Even for industries that work with highly sensitive data, such as banking, finance, government, and healthcare, a hybrid solution may well be their best option. For example, some regulated industries require certain types of data to be stored on-premises while allowing less sensitive data to be stored on the cloud.</p>
 How to choose 
<p>Choosing where to draw the line can be relatively straight-forward if clear legislation is already in effect, but in many cases, there are no rules set in stone. Balancing security and privacy with cost and flexibility is an ancient dilemma, and it continues to be very current topic as nation-state actors continue weaponizing cybersecurity.</p>
<p>In network diagrams, ‘the cloud’ is often represented as an icon of a fluffy cloud, floating somewhere outside the home organisation. However, if your data does not reside in your own servers, then it does not reside high up in the sky, but on somebody else’s server, possibly in another country or even continent. That another country has its own laws and regulations, and if not carefully designed and managed properly, storing or processing data blindly in another country could have drastic consequences.</p>
<p>Every organisation doing business within the European Union should be especially certain to have done their due diligence, as consistently providing ‘privacy by default’ is not a recommendation, but a legal requirement. This in turn necessitates that security and privacy should always be included by design, not bolted-on at the last minute. Homebrew solutions often have challenges in maintaining the code in long run, for example in keeping up to date with the constantly evolving regulatory environment. Embracing hybrid cloud can be an opportunity to outsource a part of these requirements to competent third parties, enabling your own staff to concentrate on your core business needs instead of playing catch-up with Brussels.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for part two, where we will take a deep dive on how another hot topic of today, data residency, affects hybrid cloud deployments after the Schrems II decision and the new EU-U.S. data privacy framework.</p>

 Contractor Fraud and the Rise of Remote Work 
<p>Many organizations require the use of contractors, known as third parties. Managing these non-employees through the HR system, the authoritative identity source for their IT ecosystem can be burdensome. In addition, third-party individuals often require access to organizational resources such as shared tools, applications, or data sets to provide critical services.</p>
<p>The issue is that this access is usually for a limited period. Third parties present challenges and bring additional risks, such as ensuring that access is managed correctly and, when required, deprovisioned quickly. With the rise of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, these concerns have only been exacerbated.</p>
<p>Many companies assume that virtually checking a photo of a new contractor’s driver’s license and passport ensures that they are always the person logging in and working from home every day. Unfortunately, this isn’t necessarily the case. The increase in remote work in the last year has made it easier than ever for fraudsters to attack your organization.</p>
 How Does Contractor Fraud Happen? 
<p>Let’s look at how identity fraud happens in an organization: When a new contractor gets hired, they receive access to numerous company resources like email and Slack. To gain access to these resources, they will likely use an active directory username and password as well as 2FA like a one-time code tool.</p>
<p>What happens if this contractor decides to outsource some or all of their work? The employee will provide a third-party outsourcer with their usernames, passwords, and 2FA codes. This can be done in seconds on collaboration tools like Whatsapp and Slack. Whether this person simply found someone cheaper to do their work, or they are getting paid by a third party to let them into the organization to steal intellectual property, this could have detrimental security consequences for your organization.</p>
<p>For example, your company likely did a thorough background check of your current employees and contractors. However, you did not do a background check of the subcontractor. This means that this individual could have a questionable background that is not suitable to work at your company. Your company resources and knowledge are now vulnerable to the will of the subcontractor.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Improve Third-Party Access Governance? 
<p>The reality is that nearly all organizations have a variety of these third-party individuals who need access to infrastructure, applications, and data. 1Kosmos improves the security of third-party access with our distributed digital identity platform that is both <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO2</a> and <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a> certified.</p>
<p>The benefit of onboarding contractors with 1Kosmos BlockID is the highest degree of identity assurance. When contractors are bound to their proofed identities with 1Kosmos, they have identity-based biometric authentication and a passwordless experience. In practice, contractors can utilize their secure mobile device for physical or logical authentication and step-up authentication required for privileged access. As a result, each access event is associated with a real, verified identity. Overall, organizations will eliminate the risk of contractor fraud and extra security exposures contractors introduce.</p>

 Quick overview of Dependency Injection 

<p>Dependency Injection decouples the creation of a dependency from using that dependency. This promotes loose coupling within our code, a foundation for creating well-architected software. When we use DI, we follow a design principle called Dependency Inversion. Dependency Inversion is a core tenet of software design principles. It’s so integral that it’s part of the acronym SOLID, used to describe design patterns for good coding practices. Dependency Inversion represents the letter D in the acronym. Following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID design practices</a> yields flexible, maintainable software that allows our applications to grow with new features more quickly. And by using DI, we can change the dependent code without changing the consuming code, which is pretty cool! This is nearly impossible with tightly coupled code, where you might have to touch everything to make a small change.</p>

<p>The cool thing is Angular has DI built-in and helps set us up for success. How handy!</p>

 Angular’s Dependency Injection system 

<p>When you use the Angular CLI to generate a service, it automatically adds the code to register the service within Angular’s DI system for us. Automation sure is sweet! Services contain business logic code that we want to keep separate from view logic.</p>

<p>When Angular CLI generates a service, it adds an <code>@Injectable()</code> TypeScript decorator, which is the bit of code that registers a service within Angular DI system:</p>

   <code>@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService {
}
</code>   

<p>Without doing anything else, we can use our dependency in the application by injecting it into the consuming code as a constructor parameter:</p>

   <code>@Component({
  // standard component metadata here
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) { }
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>In Angular v14, you have a new option to use the <code>inject()</code> function instead of injecting the service into the consumer as a constructor parameter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another way to register dependencies is to provide them manually through the <code>providers</code> array. Different Angular building blocks accept <code>providers</code> in the metadata. So you can register a provider like this:</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  imports: // stuff here
  declarations: // stuff here
  providers: [
    MyService
  ]
})
export class AppModule {
}
</code>   

<p>There’s something else to note, though. Angular’s DI system allows you to provide a dependency to different places within the application. We saw an example of this in the first code snippet of the <code>@Injectable()</code> TypeScript decorator. Angular CLI automatically generates:</p>

   <code>@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService {
}
</code>   

<p>The configuration option <code>providedIn: 'root'</code> specifies where within the application to provide the service. In this case, we’re saying provide to “root”, which means the root of the app, so this service is available across the entirety of the application.</p>

<p>While having this level of configurability sounds unnecessarily complicated, it allows you to fine-tune which dependency to use in your consuming code. You can configure the <code>providers</code> array in other modules and Angular building blocks, such as components and directives. You’ll get the provider you configured closest to the consuming code when you do so.</p>

<p>Now that we have a quick overview of how to provide dependencies, let’s review an integral piece of Angular’s DI system, injection tokens.</p>

 Injection tokens in Angular 

<p>Injection tokens allow us to have values and objects as dependencies. This means we can depend on strings, such as “Hello world!”, and objects, which include configuration objects and global variables such as Web APIs. But injection tokens are even more remarkable because we can also create dependencies to constructs that don’t have a runtime definition, such as interfaces! Let’s take a look at an example using an injection token.</p>

<p>Let’s say we want to have a dependency on the bread emoji. You can create the bread emoji, register the token to Angular’s DI system, and set up a default value like this:</p>

   <code>const export BREAD_TOKEN = new InjectionToken&lt;string&gt;('bread', {
  providedIn: 'root',
  factory: () =&gt; '🍞'
});
</code>   

<p>When you want to use the <code>BREAD_TOKEN</code>, you’d use the <code>@Inject</code> decorator:</p>

   <code>@Component({
  // standard component metadata here
})
export class MyBreadComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(BREAD_TOKEN) private bread: string) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Now we can access the 🍞 emoji from within the component! This might not seem like a big deal, but having injection tokens as a means to represent values and interfaces as dependencies is enormous! And it sets us up to leverage the power of Angular’s DI system.</p>

<p>We can use injection tokens along with configuring providers within Angular’s DI system for more power and fine-grained control.</p>

 Configuring providers in Angular’s Dependency Injection system 

<p>You can configure the <code>providers</code> array to add fine-grained control to your providers. When combined with injection tokens, we can unleash a lot of power. But first, it’s essential to know when it makes sense to do so. Always prefer the most straightforward, default way of registering a dependency and then use fine-grained control as needed.</p>

<p>To configure the <code>providers</code> array, you add an object containing the instructions like this:</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  imports: // stuff here
  declarations: // stuff here
  providers: [
    { provide: MyService, howToProvide: OtherDependency }
  ]
})
export class AppModule {
}
</code>   

<p>The “how to provide” gives Angular-specific instructions on this dependency configuration. Then you can provide the other new dependency. Angular supports the following options for “how to provide”:</p>

 
   <code>useClass</code> - Replace the current dependency with a new instance of something else 
   <code>useExisting</code> - Replace the current dependency with an existing dependency 
   <code>useValue</code> - Replace the current dependency with a new value 
   <code>useFactory</code> - Use a factory method to determine which dependency to use based on a dynamic value 
 

<p>Next, let’s walk through examples of each configuration option to understand how to use them.</p>

 Configure providers with <code>useClass</code> 

<p>The <code>useClass</code> option replaces the current dependency with a new instance of another class. This is a great option to use if you’re refactoring code and want to substitute a different dependency in your application quickly. Let’s say you have a language learning app and an Angular service that wraps the authentication calls you delegate to an auth library and an auth provider. We’ll call this service <code>AuthService</code>, and to keep things straightforward, the code looks like this:</p>

   <code>@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthService {
  public login(): void { }
  public logout(): void { }
}
</code>   

<p>In a stroke of luck, a large tech company decides to buy your language learning app, but they require you to authenticate using their social login only. You can create a new authentication service that wraps the calls to their auth provider and keeps the same member names; we’ll call it <code>NewAuthService</code>. (Note, you should not name your services with these terrible generic names. Be a bit more descriptive. )</p>

   <code>@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class NewAuthService {
  public login(): void { /* new way to login */ }
  public logout(): void { /* new way to logout */ }
</code>   

<p>Because both classes have the same public members, you can substitute the original <code>AuthService</code> with the new <code>NewAuthService</code> by configuring the provider:</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  imports: // imports here
  declarations: //declarations here
  providers: [
    { provide: AuthService, useClass: NewAuthService }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>The cool thing about having the same public members is that there’s no need to change the consuming code. Angular instantiates a new instance of <code>NewAuthService</code> and provides that dependency to consuming code, even if they still refer to <code>AuthService</code>!</p>

<p>It might not make sense to keep the original <code>AuthService</code> around, so eventually you might want to consider transferring all the code references to use the <code>NewAuthService</code> only. However, the <code>useClass</code> configuration option is a fast way for us to quickly substitute one instance of a class for another, which means proof-of-concepts and quick checks can be super-fast!</p>

 Configure providers with <code>useExisting</code> 

<p>The <code>useExisting</code> option replaces the provider with a different provider already existing within the application. This option is a great use case for API narrowing, that is, decreasing the surface area of an API. Let’s say your language learning application has an API that’s gotten out of hand. We’ll call this API <code>LanguageTranslationService</code>, and it looks like this:</p>

   <code>@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export const LanguageTranslationService {
  public french(text: string): string { /* translates to French */ }
  public japanese(text: string): string { /* translates to Japanese */ }
  public elvish(text: string): string { /* translates to Elvish */ }
  public klingon(text: string): string { /* translates to Klingon */ }
  // so on and so forth, but you see the problem here
}
</code>   

<p>And you consume the service like this:</p>

   <code>@Component({
  // standard component metadata here
})
export class ElvishTranslationComponent implements OnInit {
  private elvish!: string;
  constructor(private translationService: LanguageTranslationService) { }
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {
    this.elvish = this.translationService.elvish(someText);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Oops… The <code>LanguageTranslationService</code> looks a bit unwieldy. Let’s narrow the API surface by creating a new class called <code>FictitiousLanguageTranslationService</code> and move the translation methods for the fictitious languages there. We’ll use an abstract class for this:</p>

   <code>export abstract class FictitiousLanguageTranslationService {
  abstract elvish: (text: string) =&gt; string;
  abstract klingon: (text: string) =&gt; string;
}
</code>   

<p>Now we can add <code>FictitiousLanguageTranslationService</code> as a real dependency in the application by adding it to the <code>providers</code> array, but use the existing <code>LanguageTranslationService</code> implementation of the code:</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  imports: // imports here
  declarations: // declarations here
  providers: [
    { provide: FictitiousLanguageTranslationService, useExisting: LanguageTranslationService }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>Next we’ll update the consumer to use the new dependency:</p>

   <code>@Component({
  // standard component metadata here
})
export class ElvishTranslationComponent implements OnInit {
  private elvish!: string;
  constructor(private fltService: FictitiousLanguageTranslationService) { }
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {
    this.elvish = this.translationService.elvish(someText);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Only the methods defined in the <code>FictitiousLanguageTranslationService</code> are available now. Pretty sweet!</p>

 Configure with <code>useValue</code> 

<p>The <code>useValue</code> option replaces the provider with a value. This option is a great use case for values such as configurations and mocking services in automated tests where you need to control the inputs and outputs. Let’s go back to the <code>BREAD_TOKEN</code> in this example and override it to show a 🥐 (croissant) instead.</p>

<p>We can override the token:</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  imports: // imports here
  declarations: // declarations here
  providers: [
    { provide: BREAD_TOKEN, useValue: '🥐' }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>Now when we use this in the <code>MyBreadComponent</code> we’ll get a croissant instead of a loaf of bread!</p>

   <code>@Component({
  // standard component metadata here
})
export class MyBreadComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(BREAD_TOKEN) private bread: string) { }
}
</code>   

 Configure with <code>useFactory</code> 

<p>The <code>useFactory</code> option allows us to use a factory method to create a dependency. This option is a great use case if you have dynamic values to consider when creating the dependency. It’s also how we can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">factory pattern</a> for creating our dependencies.</p>

<p>In this example, let’s say in your Language Learning application, if the user is learning French, we want to show a croissant in the <code>BreadComponent</code> instead of a loaf of bread. The user’s language selection is in the user’s config, so the example code looks like this:</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  imports: // imports here
  declarations: // declarations here
  providers: [
    {
      provide: BREAD_TOKEN,
      useFactory: (config: UserConfig) =&gt; config.language === 'fr' ? '🥐' : '🍞',
      deps: [UserConfig]
    }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>Notice we were able to pass in a dependency to the configuration option. The <code>useClass</code> and <code>useFactory</code> options support passing in dependencies.</p>

<p>Now when we use this in the <code>MyBreadComponent</code> we’ll get a croissant instead of a loaf of bread only if the the user’s configuration has French as their language!</p>

   <code>@Component({
  // standard component metadata here
})
export class MyBreadComponent {
  constructor(@Inject(BREAD_TOKEN) private bread: string) { 
    // bread is either 🍞 or 🥐 based on the language setting
  }
}
</code>

This comes at a time when the UN’s report warned of a Fed-induced global recession.</p><p>Speaking of the matter, a group of financial regulators issued a report titled “Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regulation,” calling on lawmakers to reach an agreement on crypto-related matters, including how it is sold on the spot&nbsp;market.</p><p>The report also reviewed financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by crypto and provided recommendations to address such&nbsp;risks.</p> EU Passes Landmark MiCA Crypto&nbsp;Law (<a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/flag-of-european-union-gm489481917-40012752">Image Source</a>)<p>The European Union (EU) has approved its Markets in Crypto Asset Regulation (MiCA), which covers stablecoins, issuers of unbacked crypto assets, trading venues, and wallets, along with rules to reveal the identity of those transacting cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The legislation will now pass through a further vote in the European Parliament next week, and if approved, the laws will be implemented in 2024. As for the categorization of crypto, MiCA has classified it into three types: Utility tokens, Asset-referenced tokens, and E-money&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Overall, MiCA has attracted a fair share of praise and criticism. For instance, some industry proponents may criticize the proposed move to make it mandatory for all crypto asset service providers (CASP) or investment firms providing custodial services in the EU to be based within the borders of the 27-nation bloc.</p><p>On top of that, these institutions must also fulfill strong requirements to protect consumer wallets and declare information on their environmental footprint.</p><p>That said, there are many points that industry proponents will praise, such as MiCA’s focus on minimizing insider trading and other market manipulation activities related to crypto to preserve the market’s integrity.</p> OSC Head Warns Unregulated Crypto Firms of Most Serious Consequences (<a href="https://betakit.com/osc-announces-fintech-advisory-committee-including-portag3s-adam-felesky-impression-ventures-christian-lassonde/">Image Source</a>)<p>Upping the ante against non-regulated crypto firms operating in Ontario, the head of the Ontario Securities Commission, Grant Vingoe, said global crypto platforms must register with the Ontario market regulator or face bans or other sanctions.</p><p>The growth of international crypto trading platforms that operate in “regulatory ambiguity” without permission from their home countries or the jurisdictions where targeted investors live — created a “compelling” case for regulation in Canada, he&nbsp;said.</p><p>His remarks came amidst the reports of unregulated global crypto companies using VPNs to disguise their location. Vingoe said the OSC would seek “the most serious consequences” for those encouraging investors to use VPNs to conceal their online identities and location to invest in&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>“Compliance systems are improving rapidly, and we will demand vigilance,” Vingoe wrote in his LinkedIn post. Ultimately crypto firms will be required to register with the IIROC because they deal with retail investors, he&nbsp;added.</p><p>The chief executive of Canada’s largest capital markets watchdog also discussed the “great potential” of the underlying blockchain technology, stating, “it has broad applications for businesses, institutions, and governments that would benefit from transaction records that cannot be altered.”</p> Indonesia Says “No new Crypto Exchange Licenses” for Time&nbsp;Being (<a href="https://www.timeout.com/indonesia">Image Source</a>)<p>Indonesia has put a moratorium on the issues of new crypto exchange licenses starting August 15,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>According to the Circular Letter, Bappebti no longer accepts applications for Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) licenses. Surprisingly, there’s no expected date when the moratorium will be&nbsp;lifted.</p><p>As for the reason that may have led the Indonesian regulator to pause granting crypto licenses, there are speculations that Bappebti is drafting new regulations for exchanges that is likely to be made public by the end of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Meanwhile, the head of Bappebti, Didid Noordiatmoko, said 383 crypto assets are recognized and licensed by the Indonesian government to be traded by 25 registered companies.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer!

 The Albanian Financial Supervision Authority has approved a licensing regime for cryptocurrency exchanges.   Albania is all set to bring in a group of crypto-focused laws in the coming days, which will usher in a licensing mechanism for exchanges and make way for taxing the crypto profits of its citizens.  Various factors will come into play that will influence Albanian authorities’ decision to grant a license to exchanges, such as a detailed business plan, capital availability, source of funds, and investor protection mechanism, among&nbsp;others.  Although Albania already allows licensed exchanges to operate within its borders, no licensed digital asset trading firms are active in the&nbsp;country.  <p>The Albanian Financial Supervision Authority has approved a licensing regime for cryptocurrency exchanges. This comes ahead of Albania’s implementation of a digital asset taxation policy that will allow the government to tax income and profits from cryptocurrency investments by the end of&nbsp;2023.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/finrazorcom/status/1055413687677267968?s=20&amp;t=6wewuL25D2v-hnLC9stLMQ">Image Source</a>)<p>Under the licensing law, distributed ledger technology exchanges are referred to as exchanges where blockchain is used in combination with digital tokens, digital assets, and fiat currency.</p><p>As per the latest licensing regime, DLT exchanges will fall under one of three categories; those that use just digital assets and tokens, those that use fiat and virtual currency, and those that trade digital securities.</p> What Will Crypto Exchanges Have to do to Obtain a&nbsp;License? <p>To obtain the license, the exchanges must submit detailed documentation of their business plans, source of capital, company organization, and reputation. The application will then be passed to a joint commission to review and evaluate it in line with the&nbsp;law.</p><p>The relevant authorities will decide to grant a license based on protecting the interests of investors and the public, promoting stability and transparency of financial markets, adequate security systems, protection from cyber-attacks, and ensuring compliance with the&nbsp;law.</p><p>Other requirements for licensing include having enough capital, either in funds or through an insurance policy for professional liability. The regulators will also evaluate the company administrator, supervisory board, board of administration, and other key stakeholders.</p> Strengthening the Crypto&nbsp;Rules (<a href="https://medium.com/yardcouch-com/now-that-crypto-is-bearish-heres-what-s-next-b64b5172e853">Image Source</a>)<p>With this move, which is a first for its region, Albania is strengthening the crypto law “Financial markets based on distributed ledger technology,” which it passed in 2020 and entered into force on September 1st, the same&nbsp;year.</p><p>However, the law hasn’t been implemented yet because of the lack of bylaws. Last year, in November, the authorities (ASFA) approved two regulations on capital adequacy and on licensing requirements for entities working with digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Albanian parliamentary assembly drafted a resolution to order the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) <a href="https://exit.al/en/2022/06/09/albania-parliament-calls-on-regulators-for-quicker-cryptocurrency-bylaws/">to adopt new regulations</a> regarding cryptocurrencies before the end of the year as the country hopes to take advantage of the benefits presented by this nascent blockchain technology. While Albanian law allows crypto trading firms to operate legally within its borders, no licensed entities currently work within&nbsp;Albania.</p><p>It also referenced the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts’ report on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of Terrorism (Moneyval), which examined new international standards applied to virtual assets, including the providers of crypto assets. As per the report, additional measures were needed to deal with cryptocurrency risk.</p><p>“The next monitoring report for Albania concluded that this country has not significantly improved its measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing by the FATF recommendations,” stated the&nbsp;report.</p>

<p>Passwords are becoming a thing of the past with biometrics taking over. But what does this mean for security, and what types of biometrics can be used?</p>
<p>What are examples of biometrics? Some examples of biometrics are:</p>
 
 Fingerprint Scan 
 Facial Recognition 
 Iris Scan 
 Voice Recognition 
 
 What Is Biometrics? 
<p>Biometrics is the scanning and analysis of physical traits for use as a method of authentication or authorization. The traits used for biometric authentication are considered unique and generally immutable for the process of identity verification and provide heightened security as compared to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">passwords</a> or PINs.</p>
<p>Biometrics are often part of a more secure approach to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a> for a few reasons, namely that biometrics:</p>
 
 Are unique, meaning that information scanned for authentication (like a fingerprint or facial scan) is suitably distinct from anyone else such that the system will not accidentally confuse two different users. 
 Are personal, meaning that they make stealing and using the information in a hack more difficult, if not impossible. It’s much harder to fake a facial scan than to steal and use a password. 
 Are immutable, meaning that, outside of physical damage or temporary changes due to circumstance, they can be safely used for other platforms and applications. 
 
<p>Because of these advantages, biometrics are often used as the anchor for <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> purposes.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are three primary types of biometrics:</p>
 
 Biological: These biometrics are, as the name suggests, tied to immutable aspects of your biology. These traits include DNA, blood samples, or hair samples. The most expensive and invasive form of biometrics, these are often reserved for the highest levels of security. 
 Morphological: These are our outward physical traits, representing different body parts. Morphological traits include fingerprints, facial structure, or iris structure. Morphological traits are, for the time being, the sweet spot in terms of usability (uniqueness and security) and availability (through fingerprint scanners or cameras). 
 Behavioral: These biometrics are tied to patterns of behavior that we often overlook, including patterns in typing, handwriting, or gait. While these are increasingly becoming viable as a biometric security measure, some experts argue that they are easier to spoof than other approaches. 
 
 What Are Some Different Types of Biometrics? 
<p>Using the multitude of components in the human body, engineers and scientists have worked out several types of useful biometric tools to use for identity verification and authentication. However, a select few of these have percolated into general use in enterprise or consumer contexts. Often, popularity and adoption are tied to available technology and the viability of the biometric in question.</p>
<p>All biometrics have advantages and disadvantages of their own. However, all biometrics have specific benefits that set them apart from other forms of identification, including</p>
 
 Security: Common attacks, like phishing and social engineering, rely on the inherent weakness of passwords–namely, that they do not require the user to be physically present at the point of authentication. A biometric, however, requires physical presence. 
 Ease: Passwords require memorization, and dozens of passwords tempt users to create simple, weak, or reused passwords across their accounts–a significant security hole. Biometrics avoids this issue by making system access as easy as a face or fingerprint scan. 
 Compliance: Most higher-level compliance standards (HIPAA, PCI DSS 4.0, most government regulations) require MFA in some capacity. Biometrics are generally the go-to for these requirements. 
 
<p>Some common biometrics currently on the market include:</p>
 Fingerprint Scans 
<p>We’ve all seen fingerprint scans, if not from our immediate use, then from public perception in media round police and investigations. Because of their uniqueness, investigators have used fingerprint records to catalog and identify criminals for decades. Now, many digital devices include a fingerprint scanner to authenticate users.</p>
<p>Some advantages of fingerprint authentication include:</p>
 
 Uniqueness: Fingerprints are unique to individuals. As such, they can serve as a unique identifier for an individual that someone can’t just pick up and break into a device or account. 
 Ease of Deployment: Scanning technology is remarkably common. While many manufacturers have started moving to face scanners, fingerprint scanners are still a widespread technology on laptops and mobile devices. 
 Familiar to Users: People understand how fingerprint scans work and have no problem quickly adopting and adapting to the technology. 
 
<p>There are some drawbacks to fingerprint scans as well:</p>
 
 Fingerprint Damage: If the fingerprints are damaged by heat or other accidents, they may not work for authentication. This means the user can’t simply replace their fingerprint data; they would need another biometric. 
 Easier to Replicate: While fingerprints are very hard to spoof, it isn’t impossible. Spoofing a fingerprint doesn’t require a camera or video spoof, but just a fake fingerprint. These scans can also be taken from a user when they sleep. 
 
 Iris Scans 
<p>Iris makeup, like a fingerprint, is unique to the individual and is suitable for security purposes. However, iris scans require more advanced camera technology and can be more secure than fingerprints, but they also require ideal conditions to work.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-iris-biometrics/">iris biometrics</a> include:</p>
 
 Uniqueness: Iris structure, taken from the veins and structure of the iris itself, is as unique, if not more so, than fingerprints. These make iris scans incredibly unique. 
 Resilience: The iris is contained within the eye, which is highly unlikely to change via illness or damaging accidents. 
 
<p>There are also some limitations to iris scans:</p>
 
 Harder to Deploy: The camera analyzing technology for iris identification isn’t as common as fingerprint scanning. Such biometrics require a fine-tuned set of sensors that aren’t included in all camera setups. 
 Harder to Use: Because iris scanning requires fine-grained technology, it’s sometimes harder to get it to work correctly(i.e., in low-light conditions). 
 
 Facial Recognition 
<p>Facial recognition is one of the up-and-coming biometrics on the market, increasingly found in smartphones and laptops equipped with cameras. This biometric involves reading the geometry of your face, including metrics like the distance between your eyes, the distance between ears, and the shape of the face from chin to forehead.</p>
<p>Some key benefits of facial recognition include:</p>
 
 Easy to Deploy: Facial biometrics aren’t as fine-tuned as iris scans, which means they are secure but not as finicky. The most modern, camera-equipped device easily supports facial scans. 
 Effective and Unique: Facial geometry is a unique and distinguished biometric. Since these cans use several dozen measurement points, it’s highly unlikely that there will be two people with the same facial structure. 
 
<p>There are also some drawbacks to the technology:</p>
 
 Hard to Use with Accessories: As we learned in the pandemic, facial recognition doesn’t play well with masks, and many users found themselves unable to lock their phones with biometrics. Some adaptations have been made to account for specific accessories (namely, masks), but it’s still an issue. 
 Changes in Facial Features Can Hinder Use: Extreme changes, like drastic changes in weight, plastic surgery, or injuries, can change the shape of the face and render facial recognition inaccurate. 
 
 Voice Recognition 
<p>Voice recognition was not, for a long time, considered a strong enough biometric security method. Spoofing devices, as they became more sophisticated, could simply modulate the sound of a voice to the extent that it could pass for another person. However, modern advances in analytics and AI have led voice recognition to be much, much more accurate, so much so that some financial institutions use it for security.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of voice recognition include:</p>
 
 Easy to Deploy: Almost every digital device has a microphone, which means including voice recognition in an operating system or attached software is trivial at worst. Furthermore, advances in recognition have tied voice to AI assistants, so linking voice recognition to many different apps or services is relatively easy. 
 Easy to Use: Because voice recognition is so ubiquitous, it can be used as a secure way to protect system access in several ways. This includes the use of passphrases or app-specific authentication. 
 
<p>Unsurprisingly, voice recognition also has some drawbacks:</p>
 
 Can’t Use in Noisy Spaces: It can be hard to pull off successful <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-voice-authentication/">voice authentication</a> in a noisy warehouse, coffee shop, or office space–problems that visual authentication methods do not have. 
 Illness Can Hinder Use: If the user is suffering from a bronchial or lung-based illness like allergies or a cold, it can modify their voice enough to make voice recognition hard or impossible.

<p>On October 6th, InfoCert took part in an important international congress for the financial environment: the <a href="https://conferenziaworld.com/banking-4-0-digitalization-and-transformation-conference-p0522/">Banking 4.0 digitalization and transformation conference</a>, the event has been held by Conferenzia World, a world leader in corporate events, summits and forums for the top professionals in their fields.</p>



<p>Paolo Madella – Senior Business Development Manager at InfoCert, lead a speech during the day one titled: The Key to Digital Identity. DIZME decentralized identity: opportunities for banks and financial institutions.</p>



<p>During his talk he focused on 3 macro topics:</p>



  Traditional onboarding processes of prospect customers: expensive, inefficient and repetitive;  Decentralized ID: the present future;  Dizme: the new key to digital identity.  



<p><a href="https://authada.de/">Authada</a>, our partner company based in Germany, has been also represented during the event by the Sales Director Thomas Hampf.</p>



<p>The acceleration of digital trends across banking, payments and e-commerce has propelled the industry to this pivotal moment so that they may remain dominant in a rapidly evolving ecosystem. <br>From new technology to new competition to heightened customer expectations, banks have become increasingly vulnerable. The summit aimed to  help the stakeholders to develop understanding of new technologies in banking sector that allow the creation of digital assets and help in gaining a deeper understanding of the connection between customer, strategy and analytics.</p>



 Fill the gap between self-sovereign identity and eIDAS compliance 



<p>There have been numerous attempts made by public and private organizations to approach the issue of online identity, initial centralized solutions have given way to federated proposals and the trends of democratization and digital sovereignty have subsequently allowed the flourishing of a new approach, that of Self Sovereign Identity.<br>DIZME is the first decentralized identity network that combines the benefits of the SSI world as well as the compliance to eIDAS regulation perimeter.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>The pandemic changed our lives in many ways, some good and some bad. However, one impact has been that that cyber-attacks are more prevalent than ever before. &nbsp;Every organization across all industry sectors is now a target of cyber-crime. It seems like every day another cyber-security incident is reported in the press. Phishing emails, triplets, ransomware, SMS with embedded malware are now threatening organizations daily. These threats have put the spotlight on cyber-insurance.</p>
<p>Having a cyber insurance policy in place is now a must for a wide range of organizations, but there are many questions around this topic, such as: what is covered in a cyber insurance policy? &nbsp;Can my organization insure against cyber risk? Can we obtain protection against theft of private data? These questions can be answered because cyber risk is measurable and therefore it is insurable.</p>
 There is an option for every organization 
<p>Regardless of their size, every organization faces risks. Moreover, cybersecurity is not just about the organization itself, there are many actors involved in cyber risks.&nbsp; Recent events have highlighted the importance of the risks created by supply chains and the importance of managing and monitoring these.</p>
<p>Cyber insurances might cover first and third-party costs. Usually, a policy will be created according to the organization’s specific needs based on size, operational risks, and their specific vulnerabilities. When obtaining cyber insurance, organizations must check what is covered by the policy for various eventualities such as a network security failure, ransomware, email compromise or data breach.&nbsp; In addition, it is important to keep in mind the liability for privacy breaches, which is vital where the organization holds personal data (PII) and this should also include contractual obligations. If sensitive information is exposed, the organization could face litigation and legal expenses, and providing the insurance policy covers this, the service would be a major benefit for the company.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, there are other important details to consider, such as, business interruption, human errors, or risks on the company’s media channels. The best cyber insurance policy will be based on the organization needs; thus, it would be very hard to find a one-size-fits-all policy. The price will also vary according to any additional coverage added. Even though it sounds good to have, there are certain aspects that an insurance policy would not cover, for example:</p>
 
 Internal fraud: if there is a criminal act inside the organization, the insurance would not normally cover damages. 
 Loss of profits due to reputational damage: naturally, a cyber-attack impact on the organization’s reputation, which could lead to the loss of customers and contracts. 
 Failure to maintain security controls: organizations must ensure they maintain the security controls agreed in the contract for and an insurance claim to be approved.&nbsp; The organization may also have to submit an audit of their controls as part of the application process for the policy. 
 Loss of intellectual property: may cause additional costs as well as reduced profits, typically this is not typically covered by insurance policies. 
 
<p>&nbsp;These points mentioned above are part of what is known as “Silent Cyber”.&nbsp; This refers to the risks that are neither expressly covered nor excluded in the cyber insurance policies. In general, due to the sophistication of attacks which were not foreseen in the original policy, there may be exclusions. However, clarity is the key in this case. Reviewing what is covered and not covered is important to avoid the possibility of a disappointing surprise. It is vital to avoid any kind of misunderstanding or confusion.</p>
 Is it worth to have a cyber-insurance policy? 
<p>The first thing we should understand is that cyber insurability does not eliminate the risk of becoming a target of cyber-crime, it is intended to mitigate the negative impact when one occurs. Although organizations may be concerned about Silent Cyber, in fact that most insurers have responded positively to incidents suffered by their policy holders.</p>
<p>However, in the face of an unprecedent number of attacks, insurers have had to increase higher policy prices, demand greater scrutiny of the security controls of their policy holders.&nbsp; We must keep in mind that the pandemic has changed the world: entire workforces migrated from working onsite, where cybersecurity was monitored and controlled, to working from home which increases vulnerability to cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>Finding the best insurance is not an easy task. The best approach is to understand the important business risks to the organization and to check that these risks are covered in the policy. &nbsp;Hiring a third-party like KuppingerCole Analysts could help organizations to measure these risks and to review the terms and conditions in their cyber insurance policies. Identifying your organization’s weakest points has two main advantages: it clarifies the must haves for an insurance policy to address all aspects of your cyber risks as well as the extras that you need.</p>
<p>To sum up, the only thing needed to be the target of a cyber-attack is to be online and having a cyber insurance policy can help to reduce the impact after a cybercrime through supporting legal assistance, crisis communication and covering financial losses. The main goal of insurers is to offer long-term protection through encouraging their customers to increase their resilience and manage their cyber-security supply chain risk. In the light of the current events, it can be expected that the market for cyber insurance will grow and become an essential component for protecting the modern digital economy.</p>

<p>CSLS (Cybersecurity Leadership Summit) 2022, a fully hybrid event taking place Nov 8th to 10th in Berlin, is approaching quickly. Being asked to pick few must watch sessions, I had the challenge of selecting only a few, instead of a long list of sessions worthwhile to attend or stream. Here are my five favorites.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Frank Fischer, CISO of the Deutsche Bahn, will talk about the role a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) can potentially play in increasing cyber resilience. Just a hype or the one thing we need to tackle Cybersecurity Supply Chain Security?&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>With many CISOs speaking at the event, there is plenty of opportunity for learning from them. One good option is the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5178/2">CISO Panel</a> on mitigating state sponsored attacks. Five CISOs/former CISOs will share their knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>When it is about buzzwords, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5179/1">SASE and Zero Trust</a> appear first in the cybersecurity domain. John Tolbert will shed a light at these and what is really behind these concepts, as well as how these relate to each other.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Another important subject for increasing cyber-attack resilience is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5204/2">cyber hygiene</a>. This is where all starts. Manuel Garat Loureiro of booking.com will talk about cyber hygiene as the backbone of security and IAM strategies. Don’t miss this talk.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Last not least, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5209/1">MDM</a> is of increasing relevance and becoming a challenge not just for the media and marketing departments, but for CISOs. And it is not MDM as in Master Data Management or in Mobile Device Management, but MDM as in Misinformation – Disinformation – Malinformation. Fake news is part of it, and MDM can damage businesses, not to speak about the public sector. Dr. Barbara Mandl and Hila Meller will share their experience.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>These are just five out of dozens of interesting presentations and panels. Don’t miss <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022">CSLS 2022</a>. Looking forward to meeting you in person in Berlin in November.</p>

<p>Microservices have been quite popular in the Java ecosystem ever since Spring Boot and Spring Cloud made them easy to build and deploy. Things have gotten even easier in recent years with the proliferation of new Java frameworks built specifically for microservices: MicroProfile, Micronaut, Quarkus, and Helidon. Not only do these frameworks provide an excellent developer experience, but they also tend to have built-in Docker support. They even work with GraalVM, so you can compile your apps to native code!</p>
 
 
<p>To be fair, MicroProfile isn’t a framework; it’s a spec with many implementations. In fact, both Quarkus and Helidon have MicroProfile flavors you can use.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’ll show you how to build a Java microservices architecture that leverages micro frontends for the UI. The backend will use Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, while the frontend will use React. You can also use Angular or Vue if you’d like.</p>

 Java microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster 
 
 
<p>JHipster is an application generator that creates a Spring Boot backend. You can configure it to use SQL or NoSQL databases, plain ol' Spring MVC, or reactive with WebFlux. It also generates a UI for your REST API and offers you the choice of Angular, React, or Vue. Last year, I showed you how to build <a>reactive Java microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. In this tutorial, you’ll build a gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway. Then, you create a blog microservice and a store microservice, each with its own database.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>This microservices architecture had one major flaw: the UI for it is a monolith, with all its files on the gateway. This isn’t good from a loose-coupling point of view because changes in a microservice might require changes in the UI. Instead of being able to deploy the microservice independently, you have to deploy the gateway too.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’m proud to show you how you can solve this problem with micro frontends. JHipster recently added support for micro-frontends. Microfrontends provide a way for you to remotely load and execute code at runtime so your microservice’s UI can live in the same artifact without being coupled to the gateway!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>In the previous paragraph, you might notice I spelled micro frontends three different ways. The current literature is all over the place on this one!</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>Micro Frontends are cool, but how do you properly spell the term? We use "microservices" for the backend, but the frontend's spelling is all over the place. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/microfrontends?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#microfrontends</a></p>— Matt Raible (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1499098253920460802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 2, 2022</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>I’m going to use "micro frontends" for the remainder of this post since that’s what <a href="https://twitter.com/thecamjackson">Cam Jackson</a> used in his <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html">Micro Frontends article</a> on Martin Fowler’s blog.</p>
 
 
 
 
 A quick introduction to Module Federation 
 
 
<p>Webpack’s <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/">Module Federation</a> is one of the best-known implementations for micro frontends. Its <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/module-federation-plugin"><code>ModuleFederationPlugin</code></a> allows a build to provide or consume modules with other independent builds at runtime. It even allows you to share libraries between frontends to reduce the size of remote bundles.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy">Zack Jackson</a> is the creator of Module Federation and recently <a href="https://twitter.com/ScriptedAlchemy/status/1564411584851505153">collaborated</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/ManfredSteyer">Manfred Steyer</a> to create Native Federation. This means you can use micro frontend concepts with any build tool, not just webpack.</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>Announcement: You can  now use Native Federation with any framework and build tool:<a href="https://t.co/IvugOPpRCi">https://t.co/IvugOPpRCi</a></p>— Manfred Steyer (@ManfredSteyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/ManfredSteyer/status/1564312149580582912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2022</a></blockquote>

 
 
 
 
 Why should Java developers care? 
 
 
<p>I think micro frontends are a fascinating architectural concept. Microservices weave everything together on the backend with protocols like HTTP and gRPC. With micro frontends, it’s all HTTP. You can see your app get stitched together by watching your browser’s network console and seeing remote modules load.</p>
 
 
<p>I’ve encountered quite a few monolith UIs in my time as a consultant. The backend was a beautiful microservice architecture, but it was all tightly coupled on the frontend. There’s a good chance many Java developers don’t care about the UI because they just work on the beautiful backends. However, if you consider yourself a Java web developer, micro frontends are as revolutionary as HTML5!</p>
 
 
<p>And that’s the beauty of this tutorial; you don’t have to write any micro frontends. JHipster can create them for you!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Micro frontends in action with JHipster 
 
 
<p>I used a JDL (JHipster Domain Language) file named <code>reactive-ms.jdl</code> to create the reactive Java microservices tutorial I mentioned earlier. You can see this file online in the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples/blob/main/reactive-ms.jdl">JDL samples repository</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>I copied this file to <code>reactive-mf.jdl</code> and changed a few things for this tutorial:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Enabled micro frontends by adding <code>microfrontends [blog, store]</code> to the gateway’s definition.</p>
 
 
<p>Changed the client framework from Vue to React.</p>
 
 
<p>Added <code>clientFramework react</code> and Cypress to each microservice.</p>
 
 
<p>Changed the service discovery to <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>.1</p>
 
 
<p>Added a deployment section for Kubernetes.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>1 We’ll default to Consul in JHipster v8.</p>
 
 






JHipster’s JDL allows you to specify different client frameworks, but micro frontends will only work if you set the same one for all your apps.



 
 
<p>Run the following command to create a new directory for your micro frontends project:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>take micro-frontends-jhipster
# mkdir micro-frontends-jhipster &amp;&amp; cd micro-frontends-jhipster if you don't have take installed</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Download both the <code>-ms</code> and <code>-mf</code> JDLs and compare them in IntelliJ IDEA. You’ll need IDEA’s <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/working-with-the-ide-features-from-command-line.html">Command-line Launcher</a> for the <code>idea</code> command to work.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster download reactive-ms.jdl
jhipster download reactive-mf.jdl
idea diff reactive-ms.jdl reactive-mf.jdl</code> 
 
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 






The <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19697-jhipster-jdl">JHipster JDL Plugin</a> is a handy tool for working with JDL files.



 
 
 Micro frontend options: Angular, React, and Vue 
 
<p>JHipster has support for the big three JavaScript frameworks: Angular, React, and Vue. All are implemented using TypeScript, and a newly generated app should have around 70% code coverage, both on the backend and frontend.</p>
 
 
<p>There is also a <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-svelte">Svelte blueprint</a>, but it does not support micro frontends at the time of this writing.</p>
 
 
 
 Build Java microservices with Spring Boot and WebFlux 
 
<p>To generate a microservices architecture with micro frontend support, run the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster jdl reactive-mf.jdl --monorepository --workspaces</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The last two arguments are optional, but I expect you to use them for this tutorial. Without the <code>monorepository</code> flag, the gateway and microservices would have their own Git repos. The <code>workspaces</code> flag enables <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces">npm workspaces</a>, which are kinda like having an aggregator <code>pom.xml</code> that allows you to execute commands across projects. It also makes it so there’s only one <code>node_modules</code> in the root directory. To learn more, I recommend egghead’s <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-monorepos-with-npm-workspaces-c03f500b">Introduction to Monorepos with NPM Workspaces</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to use Angular, append <code>--client-framework angularX</code> to the command above to override the JDL value:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>--client-framework angularX</code> 
 
 
 






<code>angularX</code> is a legacy JDL value from back when JHipster supported AngularJS and Angular 2. We will change it to <code>angular</code> in v8.



 
 
<p>If you’d rather try out Vue, use the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>--client-framework vue</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Run your reactive Spring Boot microservices 
 
<p>When the process is complete, cd into the <code>gateway</code> directory and start Keycloak and Consul using Docker Compose.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd gateway
docker compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
docker compose -f src/main/docker/consul.yml up -d</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, run <code>./gradlew</code> (or <code>npm run app:start</code> if you prefer npm commands). When the startup process completes, open your favorite browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and log in with the credentials displayed on the page.</p>
 
 
<p>You’ll be redirected back to the gateway, but the Entities menu won’t have any links because the micro frontends it tries to load are unavailable.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Start the <code>blog</code> by opening a terminal and navigating to its directory. Then, start its database with Docker and the app with Gradle.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run docker:db:up
./gradlew</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Open a new terminal and do the same for the <code>store</code> microservice.</p>
 
 
<p>You can verify everything is started using Consul at <code>http://localhost:8500</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Refresh the gateway app; you should see menu items to navigate to the microservices now.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Zero turnaround development that sparks joy 
 
<p>At this point, I’ve only shown you how to run the Spring Boot backends with their packaged React apps. What if you want to work on the UI and have zero turnaround that sparks joy? ✨🤗</p>
 
 
<p>In the gateway app, run <code>npm start</code>. This command will run the UI on a web server, open a browser window to <code>http://localhost:9000</code>, and use <a href="https://browsersync.io/">Browsersync</a> to keep your browser in sync with your code.</p>
 
 
<p>Modify the code in <code>gateway/src/main/webapp/app/modules/home/home.tsx</code> to make a quick change. For example, add the following HTML below the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;h3 className="text-primary"&gt;
  Hi, I'm a quick edit!
&lt;/h3&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll see this change immediately appear within your browser.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Remove it, and it’ll disappear right away too.</p>
 
 
<p>Now, open another terminal and navigate into the <code>store</code> directory. Run <code>npm start</code>, and you’ll have a similar zero-turnaround experience when modifying files in the <code>store</code> app. The app will start a webserver on <code>http://localhost:9002</code>, and there will only be one menu item for product. Modify files in the <code>store/src/main/webapp/app/entities/store/product</code> directory, and you’ll see the changes in your browser immediately. For example, change the wrapper <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in <code>product.tsx</code> to have a background color:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;div className="bg-info"&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The UI will change before you can Cmd+Tab back to your browser.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>The backend has quick turnaround abilities too, thanks to <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using.html#using.devtools">Spring Boot devtools</a>. If you modify a backend class, recompiling it will cause Spring Boot to reload your component lickety-split. It’s pretty slick!</p>
 
 
 
 A look under the hood of micro frontends 
 
<p>When you’re learning concepts like micro frontends, it’s often helpful to look at the code that makes things work.</p>
 
 
<p>The gateway’s <code>webpack.microfrontend.js</code> handles setting up the <code>@blog</code> and <code>@store</code> remotes and specifying the shared dependencies and components between apps.</p>

 Build and run with Docker 
 
 
<p>To build Docker images for each application, run the following command from the root directory.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run java:docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The command is slightly different if you’re using a Mac with Apple Silicon.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run java:docker:arm64</code> 
 
 
 






You can see all npm scripts with <code>npm run</code>.



 
 
<p>Then, navigate to the <code>docker-compose</code> directory, stop the existing containers, and start all the containers.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd docker-compose
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q);
docker compose up</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will start and run all the apps, their databases, Consul, and Keycloak. To make Keycloak work, you must add the following line to your hosts file (<code>/etc/hosts</code> on Mac/Linux, <code>c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code> on Windows).</p>
 
 
 
 127.0.0.1  keycloak 
 
 
 
<p>This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine (where the name is localhost, or <code>127.0.0.1</code>), but inside Docker it will run in its own container, where the name is <code>keycloak</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to prove everything works, ensure everything is started at <code>http://localhost:8500</code>, then run <code>npm run e2e -ws</code> from the root project directory. This command will run the Cypress tests that JHipster generates in your browser.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Switch identity providers 
 
 
<p>JHipster ships with Keycloak when you choose OAuth 2.0 / OIDC as the authentication type. However, you can easily change it to another identity provider, like Auth0!</p>
 
 
<p>First, you’ll need to register a regular web application. Log in to your Auth0 account (or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">sign up</a> if you don’t have an account). You should have a unique domain like <code>dev-xxx.us.auth0.com</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Select Create Application in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications">Applications section</a>. Use a name like <code>Micro Frontends</code>, select Regular Web Applications, and click Create.</p>
 
 
<p>Switch to the Settings tab and configure your application settings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Allowed Callback URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code></p>
 
 
<p>Allowed Logout URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes.</p>
 
 
<p>In the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles">roles</a> section, create new roles named <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new user account in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/users">users</a> section. Click the Role tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.</p>
 
 
<p>Make sure your new user’s email is verified before attempting to log in!</p>
 
 
<p>Next, head to Actions &gt; Flows and select Login. Create a new action named <code>Add Roles</code> and use the default trigger and runtime. Change the <code>onExecutePostLogin</code> handler to be as follows:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) =&gt; {
  const namespace = 'https://www.jhipster.tech';
  if (event.authorization) {
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim('preferred_username', event.user.email);
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
    api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}/roles`, event.authorization.roles);
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This code adds the user’s roles to a custom claim (prefixed with <code>https://www.jhipster.tech/roles</code>). This claim is mapped to Spring Security authorities in <code>SecurityUtils.java</code> in the gateway app.</p>
 
 
<p>Select Deploy and drag the <code>Add Roles</code> action to your Login flow.</p>
 
 
<p>Edit <code>docker-compose/central-server-config/application.yml</code> and append the following YAML block to add your Auth0 settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster:
  security:
    ...
    oauth2:
      audience: https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/

spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/ # make sure to include the trailing slash!
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: &lt;your-client-id&gt;
            client-secret: &lt;your-client-secret&gt;</code> 
 
 
 






Want to have all these steps automated for you? Vote for <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli/issues/351">issue #351</a> in the Auth0 CLI project.



 
 
<p>Stop all your Docker containers with Ctrl+C and start them again.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker compose up</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now, Spring Security will be configured to use Auth0, and Consul will distribute these settings to all your microservices. When everything is started, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and click sign in. You will be prompted for your Auth0 credentials.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>After entering your credentials, you’ll be redirected back to the gateway, and your username will be displayed.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You should be able to add, edit, and delete blogs, posts, tags, and products, proving that your microservices and micro frontends can talk to each other.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’d like to use Okta for your identity provider, see <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">JHipster’s documentation</a>.</p>
 
 






 
<p>You can configure JHipster quickly with the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>okta apps create jhipster</code> 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Deploy with Kubernetes 
 
 
<p>The JDL you used to generate this microservices stack has a section at the bottom for deploying to Kubernetes.</p>
 
 
 
 deployment {
  deploymentType kubernetes
  appsFolders [gateway, blog, store]
  clusteredDbApps [store]
  kubernetesNamespace demo
  kubernetesUseDynamicStorage true
  kubernetesStorageClassName ""
  serviceDiscoveryType consul
  dockerRepositoryName "mraible"
} 
 
 
 
<p>The <code>jhipster jdl</code> command generates a <code>kubernetes</code> directory with this information and configures all your apps, databases, and Consul to be Kubernetes-ready. If you have a Kubernetes cluster created, you can deploy to its <code>demo</code> namespace using the following command.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
<p>It also generates files for Kustomize and Skaffold if you’d prefer to use those tools. See the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-micro-frontends-jhipster-example/blob/main/kubernetes/K8S-README.md"><code>kubernetes/K8S-README.md</code></a> file for more information.</p>
 
 
<p>I won’t go into the nitty-gritty details of deploying a JHipster microservices stack to cloud providers with K8s, mainly because it’s covered in previous blog posts. The first post below shows how to run Minikube locally, encrypt your secrets, and deploy to Google Cloud.</p>

 Learn more about micro frontends and microservices 
 
 
<p>I hope you enjoyed this overview of how to use micro frontends within a Java microservices architecture. I like how micro frontends allow each microservice application to be self-contained and deployable, independent of the other microservices. It’s also pretty neat how JHipster generates Docker and Kubernetes configuration for you. Cloud-native FTW!</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-micro-frontends-jhipster-example">@oktadev/auth0-micro-frontends-jhipster-example</a> repository.</p>

<p>What is passport scanning? Is there a convenient way to securely scan passports remotely? Our CSO, Mike Engle, joins our CMO, Michael Cichon, to answer these questions and more in their recent vlog.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>This is Michael Cichon, the Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos. We’re here today with Mike Engle, our Chief Strategy Officer to discuss passport scanning. Welcome to the vlog, Michael.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Thank you. Lovely to be here. I think this is my third time.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So passport scanning. I have a little personal experience here, but let’s just start off at the basics. Why are we talking about passport scanning? What is it?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, there’s only a couple ways for you to prove who you are in the real world, in the physical world. The most common are your state or country issued license. And then of course, there’s your federally or country level issued document, like a passport. And so when it’s time for us to prove who we are, those are the most common that are used out there. So we’ll talk a little bit today about the mechanics of that.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>All right. So I get that. We all are familiar with passports, but why do we have to scan them?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, similar to when you walk up to a police officer or a TSA agent at an airport, you have to give them a credential. They inspect it and they match your face. Well, this now is happening in a digital channel, but the challenge is you’re doing it over potentially thousands of miles. So the only way to get the data from this and to a trusted referee or a system is by extracting the data from the document that you’re trying to interact with. And we call that document verification, or DocV is sometimes an acronym that’s used.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. Great. So what are the issues here? I kind of have a little bit of experience with this, Mike. I recently was traveling internationally with my kids. The airline, major airline, gave me an opportunity to check in advance. So 24 hours before flight, I was just giving the opportunity to check in, and they asked me to scan my passport. It did not go well.</p>
<p>I tried my passport, it wouldn’t scan. I got different messages, different points in time that it did scan. It didn’t scan, tried both of my kids’ passports, which were brand new. Those didn’t work. So this idea of scanning passports isn’t new, but a little bit problematic, at least from my experience.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, no. It’s very difficult when not done right, and even when you do it right, there’s still challenges with all the environmental factors that can go on. But I know exactly what you’re talking about. I had tried it with one of the big three USA airlines. I had seven people ready to check in for a flight the next day, and we’re all sitting at dinner and we’re like, “Let’s do online check in.” App pops up and says, “Scan your passport.” And we tried 15 minutes while waiting for dessert to scan, and it did not happen. We didn’t get one successful scan.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>And so you like me, you got stuck in the long lines at the airport the next day checking in. So how do you solve this?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, so there’s a couple of ways. First is a better user experience. So what was happening when you were doing it and it was failing is the lighting wasn’t right. You were holding it too close, too far away, or maybe your camera wasn’t enough quality, probably not because you’re a iPhone rockstar kind of guy, but they should have given you some feedback. So when it goes 10, 20 seconds, something should pop up and say, “Listen, it’s a little, there’s too much glare.” So that simple two way user feedback is not happening in a lot of the applications.</p>
<p>Second is many organizations only rely on the camera when they’re scanning, and there’s a better way you can actually read the little chip inside of the passport. So most passports today support the same type of chip that’s in your credit card, which that goes really well when you tap your credit card to the little terminal, it’s pretty reliable. Your Apple Pay, same concept.</p>
<p>So it’s really just adoption of the latest technologies and being able to use all of the tools at your disposal that make it go very well.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So what are some of the issues? One issue, maybe for me, is my passport is a few years old. When I took the photo, I had kind of a partial beard. I looked a little bit different, maybe a little bit younger. Is that an issue or what are some of the issues? You mentioned lighting. Yes, I was trying a variety of angles. I was holding it up, I was putting it down on the table. But if you can just summarize the issues here with the passport, why is it so difficult?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>So part of the challenge is if I’m looking at my passport here, I’ve got a photo this big, right? It’s hard to get that photo. And plus it has lines going through it and security water marks to get that and match it to my face, which now you have this big with lots of features. And so that match from little to this larger is hard to do and do right with a high level of confidence. So that’s one of the challenges.</p>
<p>The technology you were using with the airline did not even give you the opportunity to scan the chip. So the way passport chip scanning works is you need to grab a couple of fields from the passport. So this is numbers, there’s birthdays, there’s passport numbers. Those numbers are what’s used to unlock the passport chip. So it’s really a two step process.</p>
<p>What most vendors should be doing when they scan a passport is just grab the little amount that they need. Don’t even look at the photo, that’s where it goes wrong, but grab the two numbers that they need and then ask the user to simply hold the phone up to the passport, unlock it, and now they have all the data that they need to present to you. And that data is cryptographically signed. It gives you a high res photo.</p>
<p>So even though it’s a couple years old, it’s very high quality and now you can match it with the user’s face in a much more reliable way.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So when you just said hold it up to the phone and unlock it, what’s unlocking it? Is it the near frequency? What’s unlocking it?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. The chip inside of all the ICAO, that’s the issuing authority, I-C-A-O, the chip here is protected with a simple password. So if you walk up to somebody’s passport and try reading it, you can’t. Unless you open it up to the first page and grab the two fields that you would need and then put that into the reading process.</p>
<p>So it’s a little bit of a screen door to allow you to read it. So then once you do that, it’s just like tapping your phone or credit card to a reader.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Got it.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>It takes a few seconds, It takes five, six seconds to get all the data off and then you’re done. And it’s a much more enjoyable experience.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So this process utilizing the chip and the few fields of data sounded like it overcomes some of the scanning issues I was having. Is that what we’re doing at one 1Kosmos here?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>It is, Yeah. So the idea is, and we’ll roll a video of it here in just a minute and show you how it works, is you do take a picture of the front, you ask the user to present that with their camera. And of course, if you do that part right with proper privacy disclosures and you don’t store any of the user’s data, you stay out of a lot of trouble, which we do.</p>
<p>So you grab the fields temporarily and then you simply ask the user to hold the passport up to the phone, to the back of the phone where the reader is, and you have to guide them through it. You show them a little cartoon of how to do it. And again, five, six seconds later you’ll see, “Okay, I’m reading, I’m reading, it’s done.”</p>
<p>And then you’re matching it to the user’s live selfie, final step in the process. And you’ve just onboarded an incredibly high, highly accurate, and what we call high level of assurance, factor for proving who you are remotely.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>And again, these passports last for 10 years. Some of us age in the process, our appearance change, we lose weight, gain weight. Does the facial matching work?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>It works great. Yeah. So that, because it’s a one to one match, if I take your face and any one of your photos from the past 30 years, frankly, today’s technology does a really good job of matching that. Because it’s going by the structures and mathematics of your face. It doesn’t care if you have some hair that you’ve grown or you’re bald now or you’re not, you put on weight, loss weight, So it’s really good.</p>
<p>And try this yourself. Go to Google Photos, upload your 100,000 photos and it’s going to pull your baby pictures out of a lineup. It’s pretty amazing.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>That’s pretty cool.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>See, when you’re going one to one, it’s highly accurate. If you go one to millions, that’s where you get into all kinds of problems in the industry. That is probably for a topic of another vlog someday.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Got you. Okay. Are you going to show us something?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, so I’m going to pull this up here. And all right, so what you’re seeing is the 1Kosmos application, of course, we brand this for our customers in their own branding, or they take these pieces and put them into their existing app. Lots of ways to do it.</p>
<p>You’ll see four green check marks. I’ve already enrolled a bunch of other factors. My driver’s license is already in there, my live selfie’s in there. We’re not going to show you that today for the sake of time. This little plus sign on the second line is for my passport to be scanned. So you’ll see me pressing the passport button, given some instructions, the front of the passport is scanned, and now it asks me to hold it up to the passport and read the chip.</p>
<p>And you can see that takes about six or seven seconds, validates the data, make sure the face matches, and if I’ve enrolled the driver’s license, it’ll even check to make sure that all the data matches between the documents and all the faces match and it’s done. So that whole process, of course, that was me doing it. My data was blurred out and I’m really good at it. So I can do it in about 15 or 20 seconds. It would take you about a minute, which isn’t bad, right? Far better than standing in a long line or trying to do it some other old fashioned way.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Well, if you can spare me from that long line again, I appreciate it. So you, you’re doing the matching, but we’re also doing, is that triangulation what you just described with the validation?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>The triangulation happens between multiple, what we call, sources of truth. So if you present a driver’s license and a passport, there’s photos in both of those documents and your live face is a third photo. So they all have to match. That’s one form of triangulation. And then the first name, last name have to match on both documents. The dates of birth would have to match. Passport doesn’t have an address, so you don’t match that.</p>
<p>So yeah, we do triangulation across a dozen different sources depending on what you’re trying to accomplish. And it really makes it so that one plus one equals three in those scenarios.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>That’s awesome. Well, it sounds like a much more modern approach, you’ve modern modernized the user experience. So I’m glad to hear that. Anything to add before we wrap?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>No, just today we have to manually scan our passports. The passport community is working really hard to have these go fully digital. So there’s something called DTC, Digital Travel Credential. We’re on level one where there’s a chip inside of it. It’s going to get to the point where your digital version comes first, and then you get it backed up with the paper. The industry’s heading in the right direction, and we’re going to see getting easier and easier for us to prove who we are remotely and keep the bad guys out.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>That’s amazing. We talked about the airline use model. Just real quickly, briefly, what are the other use cases here? When else would you want to do this scanning?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>It’s really unlimited when you need that level of assurance. So getting a new job, you have to present multiple forms of identity in the US, the I-9 purpose, for example. So why not scan and do it remotely? Privacy preserving, prevent emailing photos of a passport, which is a security nightmare. So that’s one. And then of course, the financial industry needs high levels of assurance for regulatory reasons, anti-terrorism and that type of thing. So that’s a very common use case as well.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>That’s awesome. All right. Well very good, Michael. Appreciate your time today. Thank you very much. Keep doing the good work.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Happy to be here. Talk to you soon. Have a good weekend.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/denys-popov-1623a614a/">Denys&nbsp;Popov</a></p><p>SSI adoption has many layers of challenges and complexities. One of the problems that I want to address in this article&nbsp;is,</p><p>“How to have an enterprise <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> when an employee 👨‍💼👩‍💼 can act on behalf of this company 🏢 with flexible permissions layer in a decentralized or peer-to-peer way?”</p><p>There are several hack solutions for this, but all of them have at least one major problem, which limits the usage and implementation of existing solutions.</p><p>Before we go into my proposed solution, let’s look at the problem&nbsp;first.</p> Problem Statement <p>Let’s say an organization wants to issue power of attorney as a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable</a> <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Credential (VC)</a> for an employee&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Such an issuance requires a custom method for VC verification, so there should be a custom flow. Here, the employee should pass any meaningful info/VC to prove his organization’s power of attorney VC, and the verifier must perform that extra check of authority VC.</p><p>This verification may not be as easy as it sounds because the verifier must know how to handle&nbsp;that.</p> Workflow <p>Here’s the workflow of the above&nbsp;problem.</p>  The founder/CEO/creator of the organization DID can add to the DID document public keys (with proper authority/access/entry points) of employees.  Next, an employee can use his personal DID to issue a document/VC on behalf of the organization and set it to an issuer field organization DID before sharing it with the verifier.  The verifier will <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-resolvers">resolve</a> the Issuer DID (in this case, it’s the organization’s DID). To do this, the verifier will get the issuing organization’s DID Document, find the proper employee public key, and verify the signature.  <p>Looks good so&nbsp;far.</p><p>However, we have a problem here. The founder, who created the organization DID, will have full control and access to the anchor/recovery key. Therefore, they can always update the organization’s DID document, and no CEO/Founder rotation is possible&nbsp;here.</p><p>Though some existing solutions include modifications to the DID document to have several controllers, they won’t solve the issue altogether.</p> Proposed solution <p>Here’s my solution to support the majority of DID methods without modifications/custom flows and simultaneously have the flexibility you&nbsp;need.</p>  Create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">DAO</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">smart contract.</a> In the initialize phase, define a set of stakeholders (their crypto addresses/DIDs) and define a threshold number required to get the consensus/perform action (should be equal to or smaller than the number of stakeholders), and initially perform the anchoring of DID by this smart contract on initialization.  Next, the smart contract (kind of DAO) interface should allow for the threshold number from that group of stakeholders to make a decision (change the smart contract&nbsp;state):  <p>- Update the related DID Document (by adding/removing public keys of employees or some permissions of&nbsp;it)</p><p>- Change the threshold number for making future decisions</p><p>- Add/remove stakeholders</p><p>With this solution, an organization’s authorized employee can sign documents using their personal keys, but can mark the Issuer as organization DID. Then, the verifier will perform just the standard verification, and it will&nbsp;work.</p><p>At any point, the stakeholders can remove an employee’s public key from an organization or change those permissions. Also, stakeholders can be changed when the required consensus is met. All this interaction is done and available in a decentralized way.</p><p>What do you think of this solution?</p><p>Join our community today</p>  Get conversations going with #teamaffinidi and the community on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>  Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>  Get the latest updates on what’s new at Affinidi; join<a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v"> our mailing&nbsp;list</a>  Interested in <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/careers">joining our&nbsp;team</a>?

<p>That’s right, Holochain has hit another milestone on its <a href="https://holochain.org/roadmap">roadmap</a>. I’m excited about this one, because it completes a feature that many application design patterns require: cell cloning. This feature lets an application make copies of a DNA, keeping its functionality but creating a new network. Some or all app users can then join that cloned network. This can be used for private spaces within a larger group, temporary storage, opt-in participation in certain spaces, and things like that.</p> Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.0.164: Archiving, restoring, deleting clones <p>Release date: 28 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.2, 0.1.3<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152, 0.0.153, 0.0.154<br>Breaking changes: app API, admin API, DNA manifest format</p><p>New: This release completes the inner work in Holochain needed to reach the Cell Cloning milestone. Clones can now be archived, restored, and deleted using the conductor APIs — the app API for <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.ArchiveCloneCell">archiving</a> and the admin API for <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.RestoreCloneCell">restoring</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.DeleteArchivedCloneCells">deleting</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1578">#1578</a>)</p><p>Clones are automatically given role IDs consisting of the original’s role ID plus the suffix <code>.0</code>, <code>.1</code>, <code>.2</code>, and so forth. Because not everyone using an app will be joining the same cloned DHTs or in the same order, these numbers are local to the user and shouldn’t be expected to correspond to the same cloned DNAs across all users. Instead, clones ought to be identified by the clone’s DNA hash, which will be affected by the DNA modifiers passed in when the clone was created.</p><p>What’s the difference between archiving a cell and deleting it, and why do you have to use two separate APIs to finish the job? Well, an app should have the power to retire cloned cells as needed (think of a temporary workspace), but in order to protect the user from data loss it shouldn’t have the power to delete those cells’ data, either through software bugs or malice. The admin API endpoints that let a user restore or permanently delete cells will generally be available through the UI of the software controlling the conductor — the Holochain Launcher, for instance.</p><p>Breaking: The term ‘DNA modifiers’ is a new one for this release. It describes the network seed, properties, and origin time — everything that affects a DNA’s hash without affecting its running code. (Theoretically, properties can affect the way the DNA behaves, but only in the same way that environment variables affect a shell script.)</p><p>As a result of the above work, these modifiers are now bundled together in one <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/prelude/struct.DnaModifiers.html"><code>DnaModifiers</code></a> structure wherever you interact with them. All fields are still optional (except for <code>origin_time</code>, which I’ll get to below), but the field <code>modifiers</code> is required because you have to supply a value for at least one field in order to actually modify the DNA. Here’s where you might see this struct:</p>  DNA manifests  The admin API endpoints <code>RegisterDna</code> and <code>InstallAppBundle</code>  The app API endpoint <code>CreateCloneCell</code>  <p>Breaking: The <code>origin_time</code> field in your DNA manifest, now part of the `modifiers` struct, is now required. This field is still optional for the admin API endpoints that install DNAs or clone cells, as they will default the DNA manifest.</p><p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220928014801">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.165: Relaxed RegisterDnaPayload call <p>Release date: 30 September 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.2, 0.1.3<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.152, 0.0.153, 0.0.154<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>This release contains only one small change: When calling <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.59/holochain_types/app/struct.RegisterDnaPayload.html"><code>RegisterDnaPayload</code></a> via the admin API, the entire DNA modifiers struct can be omitted if you have no modifiers to give. Previously you had to provide an empty struct.

The only consequences for you is that users of your hApp won’t be able to use both this conductor and previous conductors in the same DHT, and you may have to add or remove a few <code>.into()</code>s and change your use of <code>AnyDhtHash</code> to <code>AnyLinkableHash</code> if you’re using <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/external-links/#external-links">baseless links</a> in your zome code. Note that this doesn’t break host API compatibility; you can still mix and match zomes and conductors in this compatibility series. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1601">#1601</a>)  Breaking (Rust test utilities): There have been some small changes to helpers for creating inline zomes in our Rust-based test utilities. This is unlikely to affect you, even if you have been using Sweettest to write your zome tests. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1598">#1598</a>)  Bugfix: Attempting to restore a cloned cell by ID would fail; this is now fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1603">#1603</a>)  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased">changelog</a>.</p> Known issues   We’re still working on gossip performance issues for large entries.  The scheduler is still not firing correctly; it’s being worked on.  With the version bump of HDI to 0.1.0, developers are noticing some <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/1596">dependency mismatches</a> on new zome projects that prevent them from being compiled. A fix is <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1605">in the works</a>.   Client release notes  JavaScript client 0.9.0 - 0.9.2: cell cloning <p>I’m rolling these three releases into one, because 0.9.1 and 0.9.2 are just bug fixes. These releases bring support for the conductor’s new cell cloning features by exposing <code>createCloneCell</code>, <code>restoreCloneCell</code>, and <code>deleteArchivedCloneCells</code>. Keep in mind that the latter two are admin API calls and should only be used if you’re building a UI to control the conductor itself — not just a hApp UI.</p><p>Download the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client">client</a> and read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases">release notes</a>.</p> Rust client 0.2.0: cell cloning <p>This release also adds support for cell cloning.

If you’re in the area, these hackathons are wonderful opportunities to meet other lovely devs in the community and create some fun little experiments with a P2P app dev stack.</p><p>If you’ve been to a traditional hackathon, this one won’t be like that. Holochain hackathons are much more low-key, collaborative, healthy events where hacking and learning happen simultaneously with rich conversations about everything that matters.</p><p>It’s being hosted at the headquarters of Jolocom, longtime supporters of the <a href="https://getdweb.net">DWeb</a> movement. (Fun fact: I got to be present for the <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2022?query=joachim+%26+iryna&amp;sort=titleSorter">wedding</a> of Iryna and Joachim, Jolocom’s UX designer and CEO, at DWeb Camp!)</p><p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/holochain-community-hackathon-tickets-429485401397">Sign up for the hackathon!</a></p> Conclusion (almost) <p>With the above updates to Holochain and the JavaScript and Rust clients, this completes the Holochain-side work needed for the cell cloning milestone.

<p>In my last blog I looked into the high level role of the Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) and the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101-issuance-and-wallets/" title="wallet technology required to ‘hold’ credentials">wallet technology required to ‘hold’ credentials</a>. In this blog I want to look at the issuance process, how do you get an LE-vLEI or an OOR-vLEI or ECR-vLEI credential, but before we dive into that, we need to talk a little about the wider eco-system and the governance framework.</p>
 vLEI Governance Framework 
  
<p>The vLEI eco-system provides both organisations and individual identities to a defined level of assurance. It also provides linkage information, also at a defined level of assurance. These identities and the linkage between them have the potential to provide significant benefit to organisations and the processes they run. The <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Katso-Case-Study.pdf" title="Finnish Government Katso&nbsp;case study">Finnish Government Katso&nbsp;case study</a> published by Ubisecure details the value that can be achieved by linking strong individual and organisation identities .</p>
<p>It is important that the identities and the linkage are determined in a defined way. This definition, or framework, generates the trust in the claims that are provided regarding the identities and the linkage. Each identity eco-system will have a definition of the level of assurance and authentication required and it is this definition that allows a level of trust to be applied. The vLEI eco-system is no different.</p>
<p>The GLEIF have made significant investments into building the governance framework for the vLEI ecosystem. It is this framework that directly gives value to the credentials as third parties can rely on the claims contained within (to the level defined in the governance framework).</p>
<p>You can find all the details of the framework on the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework">GLEIF site</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the framework is at version 0.9, and not yet final, however it is sufficiently developed that issuance processes are well understood. We do expect changes to the framework in the coming months – for example in the last blog I said that the GLEIF were providing the wallets and issuance software for QVIs to use, it is now likely that QVIs will have to build their own ‘wallet’ and issuance software.</p>
 Identity assurance levels 
<p>The vLEI eco-system governance framework defines the assurance levels as follows:</p>



Organisation
valid, active LEI contained within the GLEIS


Individual
NIST IAL2


Linkage
Official public data source (for example business registry)



<p>The organisation assurance uses the work of LOUs in verifying legal entities as part of the LEI issuance. For the individual identity, NIST-IAL2 requires verification against an official identity document (for example a passport) that can be in-person or remote. The linkage between the individual and the organisation must be evidenced by official public data – such as a director listing in a business registry.</p>
 But how do I get a vLEI for my company? 
<p>The issuance process is a reflection of the assurance levels required and good practise in key management / usage. Let’s walk through what is needed to obtain an LE-vLEI, it is a little involved so grab a coffee then we can proceed.</p>
 Setting up the Representatives for the Legal Entity 
<p>The first step in issuance is for a representative to enter a contractual agreement with a QVI to provide the issuance service. The individual from the legal entity that undertakes this contractual signup is known as the Designated Authorised Representative (DAR). The DAR is responsible for contractual signup and the introduction of individuals who will manage the LE-vLEI for the company.</p>
<p>Once the contract is in place, the DAR will provide details of 3 Legal Entity Authorised Representatives (LARs). There can be more or less than three, but the Governance Framework looks for three as the (minimum) ideal. The LARs will between them control the issued LE-vLEI and be required to participate in further usage of the LE-vLEI. They jointly control the signing ability of the LE-vLEI.</p>
<p>Each LAR must have their personal identity assured to a NIST-IAL2 level, and the QVI will have its own defined process for undertaking this. Each LAR will also need a wallet to store their unique identifier and associated signing keys. One of the LARs will be designated as the Lead LAR and responsible for leading the issuance from the LE side.</p>
<p>The individual identity verification process might require a video call, however that is dependent upon the verification process used by the QVI.</p>
 Issuing the Credential for the Entity, the LE-vLEI 
<p>The issuance process will require a video call and will require the LARs to be present on the call.</p>
<p>From the QVI perspective there will be at least two QVI Authorised Representatives (QARs) involved, a lead and a secondary.</p>
<p>At the start of the issuance call the QARs will ensure that the LEI for the LE is active and is correct for the Legal Entity involved. The QARs must also ensure that the LARs present are the same individuals as have been assured previously. This can be via technical means or via the LARs representing their identification documents on the video call.</p>
<p>Once the LARs have been verified, they must each provide the ‘address’ of their wallets. This happens through sharing a URL known as the Out of Band Introduction (OOBI). The QARs must also share the OOBI for the QVI’s credential.</p>
<p>Each LAR will have a unique ID (AID) held in their wallet. Each LAR must prove that they are in control of the AID by responding to a challenge request. The challenge request is provided by the lead QAR for the LARs and by the lead LAR for the QVI’s credential.</p>
<p>Once control has been proved the Lead QAR can now initiate the LE-vLEI process by capturing the LE details. The details are then wrapped into an LE-vLEI credential which then must be signed by both of the QARs. At this stage a valid LE-vLEI credential will exist and using the OOBI, will be transferred to the LARs wallets.</p>
<p>The LARs are now able to view the new LE-vLEI credential and use it to perform actions that require ‘signing’ by the LE.</p>
<p>Please note that the above description is simplified. The full LE-vLEI issuance process is detailed in the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2022-02-07_legal-entity-vlei-credential-gf-draft-publication_v0.9-draft.pdf">Ecosystem Governance Framework vLEI Credential Governance Framework Legal Entity Official Organizational Role</a>. Also note that in the current documents LARs are referred to as AVRs but this will change in the next release.</p>
 Issuing Individual Credentials, OOR-vLEIs and ECR-vLEIs 
 The chain of trust 
<p></p>
<p>Once the Legal Entity has a LE-vLEI it is possible for Official Organisation Roles (OOR) or Engagement Context Roles (ECR) to be issued. The current Governance Framework does not provide a technical linkage between the LE-vLEI and the &nbsp;OOR-vLEIs however a change will shortly be made that requires the LARs to create a credential request credential that is passed to a QVI. The QVI will then use the request credential to issue the OOR or ECR and the system will ensure chaining between the LE-vLEI and the OOR-vLEIs / ECR-vLEIs.</p>
<p>The data subject for the OOR / ECR must be introduced to the QVI by the DAR or a LAR. The individual will go through identity assurance to a NIST-IAL2 level as per the LARs. If an OOR is being issued then the QAR must be able to locate an official public data source that confirms the official role being requested (there is a caveat here for OORs that cannot be proved externally, typically due to timing issues – for example a new company director, it is possible for multiple LARs to vouch for the linkage).</p>
<p>Each credential subject will require a wallet and must have a unique ID created along with the associated signing key pair. This will happen before the issuance process takes place.</p>
<p>As per the LE-vLEI issuance a video call will be required to issue an OOR, the data subject must be verified as must the LARs present on the call. Again, OOBIs must be exchanged and proof of control of the unique IDs must take place.</p>
<p>The QAR ensures that the official role requested exists in the published list of official roles and then proceeds with the issuance.</p>
<p>For ECRs it is permissible for the LE itself to issue the credential, or they can return to a QVI to have the QVI issue the credential. Also note that there is no requirement that the QVI used to issue the LE-vLEI is the same as the QVI used to issue OOR-vLEIs credentials.</p>
<p>As per the LE-vLEI description the above is simplified. The full OOR-vLEIs issuance process is detailed in the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2022-02-07_legal-entity-vlei-credential-gf-draft-publication_v0.9-draft.pdf">Ecosystem Governance Framework vLEI Credential Governance Framework Legal Entity Official Organizational Role</a>. Also note that in the current documents LARs are referred to as AVRs but this will change in the next release.</p>
 And Finally 
<p>I hope the coffee was good. One last item to point out is that the entire framework utilises the feature and capabilities of the <a href="https://keri.one/keri-resources/">KERI</a> platform. Our Principal Scientist has been writing about KERI, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials-understanding-key-principles/" title="Verifiable Credentials – how does it work?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t stress enough how great the work that’s been submitted this year has been. Reviewing all the nominations and seeing all the ways our customers are continuing to innovate in the field is both exciting and inspiring. It’s no wonder that it was harder than ever for our judging committee to pick just one winner for each award. Though all of this year’s nominees are doing something special for the industry, our winners have truly made an impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year we celebrated the award recipients at the Austin stop of our global user conference, PingYOUniverse. We were happy to sing our praises for all these deserving companies and I was delighted to congratulate each one of our winners in person.</p>

<p>And now, it’s my privilege to announce the 2022 Identity Excellence Awards winners as follows:</p>

  <p>Recent high-profile software supply chain attacks have highlighted the importance of security in the DevOps environment. But this can be challenging because DevOps teams are at the forefront of digital transformation and use agile techniques to deliver applications quickly, often not following traditional paths of identity management.&nbsp;Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and GitGuardian as they discuss security vulnerabilities in DevOps environments, which are often due to a lack of visibility and control of widely distributed secrets such as API keys, database passwords, cloud access keys, certificates, SSH keys, and service account passwords, leaving millions of credentials exposed.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole will discuss the challenges and importance of managing secrets in DevOps environments, which increasingly include the use of multi-cloud, workload containerization, and infrastructure-as-code. He will also explain how the business advantages and security of DevOps can be improved.&nbsp;Mackenzie Jackson, Developer Advocate at GitGuardian will explain the issues of secrets sprawl and poor secrets hygiene. He will also discuss in detail a secrets management maturity model developed by GitGuardian, highlight the benefits of automated secrets detection and remediation, and describe how these can be used to infuse security into development workflows.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/devsecops-maturity-model-secrets-management"></a>

At the time of writing this article, she had over 73 million Twitter followers and more than 331 million followers on Instagram.</p><p>Such massive popularity often translates into a fair share of promotional opportunities, including in the crypto space. So, Kardashian, too, received such promotional opportunities for posting about various cryptocurrencies on social media, and one of her posts caught the SEC’s attention.</p><p>Which post are we referring to here? Kardashian’s promotional Instagram post on Ethereum Max tokens in September last year contained a link to the EthereumMax website, which provided instructions on purchasing EMAX&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Ethereum Max reportedly paid Kardashian $250,000 for this post, which she failed to disclose to the SEC, as required under the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2022/33-11116.pdf">regulations</a> that make it mandatory for any person promoting a financial product to disclose the compensation amount, as well as the nature and source of payment to the regulatory body. This is why the SEC filed charges against Kardashian and made her pay penalties.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-white-house-launches-a-comprehensive-framework-for-crypto-assets">The White House Launches a Comprehensive Framework for Crypto&nbsp;Assets</a></p> What did SEC Chair Gary Gensler Say on the&nbsp;Matter? <p>Referring to the SEC’s charges against Kardashian, the SEC Chair Gary Gensler said, “This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean that those investment products are right for all investors.”</p><a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1576897535427448832">Image Source</a><blockquote>He also tweeted that “any celebrity or influencer’s incentives aren’t necessarily aligned with yours” and that the public shouldn’t confuse the skills of celebrities “with the very different skills needed to offer appropriate investment advice.”</blockquote> Is this the Only Instance of the SEC Barring a Celebrity From Crypto Promotions for Flouting Regulations? <p>No, this is not the first celebrity to be barred for not disclosing compensation for cryptocurrency promotions. The SEC had also barred the American boxer Floyd Mayweather, Hollywood star Steven Seagal, and “DJ Khaled” from promoting crypto assets previously.</p><p>Simply put, the SEC is making a statement of sorts with its action against these celebrities that it will no longer tolerate them breaking the law while promoting what it calls unregistered securities. So, the stars will have to play by the rules, or the SEC will make them face the&nbsp;music.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

With many people having switched to splitting their time between the office and home these days, traveling has become less about individuals and their personal vehicles and more about the most convenient, flexible, cost-efficient and eco-friendly daily transport options for everyone.</p>



<p>This is especially the case when it comes to modern cities and their residents. With a majority of individuals living in larger cities such as London, Berlin, New York City and Dubai, the demand and need for a more convenient, cheap, flexible and environmentally friendly means of transportation is present.</p>



<p>Major cities face obstacles such as population density, high living costs, and just an overall lack of space, especially for personally owned vehicles. In effect, this creates a desire for changing the transportation landscape by having fewer cars, making traveling more efficient, cleaner and more on demand.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/4/2418/htm">72 percent of emissions coming from road transport and 44 percent of that coming from passenger vehicles</a>, shared mobility provides society a more economical, eco-friendly and safer way to travel since more and more people opt out of using personal vehicles and switch to a shared mobility option. This is especially true since car sharing companies are reported to be <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/4/2418/htm">10-20 percent more fuel efficient</a> than the average vehicles.</p>



<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/how-shared-mobility-will-change-the-automotive-industry">costs are lowered</a> for both operators and passengers due to a lower demand for personal vehicles, gas emissions are lowered, and fatalities and injuries are consequently also lowered through the reduced usage of motor vehicles. Plus, an extra security and safety layer is added for both operators and drivers due to the requirement of driver’s license verification.</p>



<p>And with people being the second principle in the <a href="https://www.sharedmobilityprinciples.org/">shared mobility principles for livable cities</a>, it is important to remember that humans are the ones needing to be transported and vehicles are just the machines that get us there. This means that society—we—are at the front lines of transit where we belong, knowing that by placing mankind at the starting line, safety becomes the number one priority when it comes to the movement of people.</p>



<p>Ultimately, when planning for the transportation of the public, safety becomes the leader directing us into supporting and transforming what we know about mobility.</p>



 Transforming transportation 



<p>With <a href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/370287?archive=yes">car sharing</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/26/story-cities-amsterdam-bike-share-scheme">bike sharing</a> originating in 1960s Europe, shared mobility is no new concept and continues to see an upward increase. The reason that the future of shared mobility is headed in an upward direction is because it combines all the different possibilities of traveling from A to B, especially in cities.</p>



<p>Such options include ride sharing, ride hailing, car rentals, car financing and the ever-growing micro-mobility sector which includes escooters, bikes and mopeds. The real beauty is that people can use these services at any time and from anywhere. One of the actions that is asked of them is to verify their identity and/or driver’s license (depending on the operator, use case, or regulatory requirements) through a driver’s license verification before using the service. This allows everyone on the roads, whether walking, biking, driving or riding, the safety they deserve.</p>



 Prioritizing people over vehicles 



<p>As services and operators shift their sights to people, the needs and desires of those people must be taken into consideration. This includes offering a variety of choices for individuals <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">from every walk of life and ability</a>, along with giving both the operator and user peace of mind by verifying that those who use such services are legally allowed to do so. This can be achieved through a simple <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver license verification</a> where users simply snap a photo of their driver’s license along with a selfie and the authenticity will be cross-referenced in a matter of minutes.</p>



<p>Through such verification, people become the priority by guaranteeing the safety of all those commuting and travelling to their desired destinations by verifying the driver’s identity, screening out underage drivers and false licenses, and validating special requirements.</p>



 







 Benefits of automated Identity Verification in Shared Mobility 



<p>Not only is shared mobility providing millions of people with the transportation they need in a safe way, but it also allows them the convenience, flexibility and affordability they are looking for all due to automated identity verification.</p>



<p>Before automated ID verification became prominent, people had to physically go to a car rental facility and confirm their identity and driver’s license by filling out forms and presenting their physical driver’s license all before even getting into a vehicle. Being a major hassle, this took time away from getting on the road. Now, thanks to automated driver license verification, there’s no need to waste precious time before traveling. Drivers need only to install the car sharing app and verify their driver’s license and/or identity by taking a quick photo of themselves and their ID document. Customers are on the road in minutes while mobility operators steer clear of any potential fraud.</p>



<p>Thus, it comes as no surprise that convenience is the number one reason people are using shared mobility services <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">according to McKinsey</a>. This includes the smooth and quick onboarding when verifying their identities, along with the availability of services and the flexible travel that personal vehicles do not offer. Operators can therefore expect high conversion rates when such characteristics are met and provided to users.</p>



<p>However, the features customers desire, and in turn benefit from, include safety, coming in as number one, followed by price and availability or reliability. When companies can offer the convenience users are looking for paired with the safety both parties deserve, then everyone will benefit in the end.</p>



 How DL Verification provides the safety everyone needs 



<p>As the fields of shared mobility increase in size to include more and more options, the need for identity verification, specifically driver license verification, becomes a bigger priority.</p>



<p>IDnow and its products such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, provide the security, conveniency and flexibility that operators need and customers want.</p>



<p>A state-of-the-art driver license verification system should be able to run identity verification checks accurately and in real time. Plus, it should be fully complaint with EU regulations. By fulfilling these requirements, users know they can trust the mobility service they are using while getting on the roads faster, and operators have the peace of mind through the validation of their clients’ identities all while being compliant. When both parties are satisfied, conversion rates rise.</p>



<p>With IDnow’s service, mobility businesses can easily integrate their MaaS platform with AutoIdent and customers simply need only to sign up, take a selfie and picture of their driver’s license or ID document and AutoIdent will verify it in seconds so they can be on their way.</p>



<p>Driver license verification comes in handy for all types of shared mobility by providing age verification, special license verification, driver identification while also screening out fraudulent licenses. And not only that, but it can validate driver’s licenses from over 50+ countries around the globe.</p>



<p>With IDnow and AutoIdent, operators and users receive the safety that is needed through identity verification. In the end, no one is left stranded because people and their identities come first.</p>

 The new European standard for identity proofing, electronic signatures and trust services, developed in collaboration with regulatory expertise from the private sector&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, October 6, 2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a leading European provider for identity proofing, is&nbsp;one of the first companies to receive the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119461/01.01.01_60/ts_119461v010101p.pdf">ETSI TS 119 461 certification</a>, a new European technical standard for identity proofing for trust services, and especially qualified electronic signatures (QES). This certification enables IDnow to continue to provide compliant identity proofing solutions for trust services and act as&nbsp;Identity Proofing Service Provider (IPSP) for Trust Service Providers (TSP).</p>



<p>Technical standard raises the security level across the industry</p>



<p>The standard was first released in July 2021 by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and defines security best practices for different ident methods, including on-site, video, automated hybrid, and NFC-based solutions. With one of the broadest platforms of identity verification solutions, IDnow offers a fitting solution for all these categories.</p>



<p>The new technical specification revamps the policy and security requirements for identity proofing and trust services by introducing a new minimum Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP) which is aligned with the requirements of eIDAS.</p>



<p>Therefore, the standard raises the security level across the identity proofing industry and provides the foundation for issuing qualified electronic signatures and other trust services in the future. Furthermore, ETSI TS 119 461 is expected to influence and be a foundation to further industry regulations, such as the upcoming update to the 6th European Anti-Money-Laundering Act (AMLD6) and the new eIDAS 2.0 framework.</p>



<p>“We welcome ETSI TS 119 461 as the new industry benchmark and especially the introduction of the new minimum Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP), something IDnow has been demanding for years. This will contribute to harmonizing minimum requirements in identity proofing and raises the level of security requirements and quality expectations across the industry,” says Armin Bauer, Managing Director Technology &amp; Co-Founder of IDnow.</p>



<p>The importance of collaboration between lawmakers and private industry experts</p>



<p>The creation of this new industry benchmark demonstrates the importance of involving the private sector in the development of industry-wide standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are proud to have obtained the ETSI TS 119 461 certification because it clearly demonstrates that our IDnow platform fulfills the latest requirements in identity proofing for trust services. At the same time, we are quite pleased to have been selected as one of the private industry experts that contributed to the creation of this industry standard through the&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.etsi.org/stf/stfs/stf-homepages/stf588">ETSI Special Task Force 588</a>. As innovations in digital identity evolve both nationally and at the EU level, collaboration between technology leaders and policy makers is as relevant as ever,” says Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow.</p>

 Firm Foundations 

<p>Much of our work in Q3 has been forward-thinking, focused on creating the next generation of specifications for blockchain interoperability.</p>

<p>Hello to the Identity Community. Being able to create the next generation of specifications depends on having a wide-spanning community, and we’ve been thrilled to see the Blockchain Commons community continue to grow. That includes not just cryptocurrency nowadays, but also digital identity thanks to sustaining sponsor Proxy. We also reached out to more digital-identity companies at this year’s Rebooting the Web of Trust event, and hope to see that pay out in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tQ9SPek0mnI"></a></p>

<p>Gordian Envelope. Our specification work is intended to build firm foundations. Our newest foundational work of this sort has been on Gordian Envelope, a new sort of “Smart Container” that can be used to hold secrets and metadata of an arbitrary size and that can be opened by a variety of “permits”, including SSKR shares and public-key cryptography keypairs. Extensive <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/tree/master/Docs">docs</a> are now available as part of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents">BCSwiftSecureCompanents package</a>. Also see our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ9SPek0mnI">Gordian Envelope videos</a> on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPQ9LtDWZAkfItMF4B5tztw">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>MVA Algorithm Suite. The appendix of the Gordian Envelope docs contains our first <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/09-A-ALGORITHMS.md">MVA ALgorithm Suite</a>. This refers to the algorithmic suite we’ve decided to use in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0deyIHXukk&amp;t=7s">Minimal Viable Architecture</a>: effectively a future-proofed Minimal Viable Product. It overviews current cryptographic algorithms and discusses our decisions about which to use. Gordian Envelope uses BLAKE3, IETF ChaChaPoly, the secp256k1 curve, and more. Our Appendix talks about why we think they’re the best practices for this project.</p>

<p>Collaborative Seed Recovery. This new foundational work is largely in service to Collaborative Seed Recovery (CSR): we intend it to add independence, resilience, and openness to seed storage by allowing digital-asset holders to shard their seed and then store it with a variety of different steward services, making recovery painless and resilient. We are currently working with a companies such as Bitmark, Foundation, and Proxy in regular biweekly meetings to make CSR a reality this fall. For more, please see our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/CSR.md">CSR Overview</a>. Our Gordian Envelope videos also lay out the whole foundation, so take a look at the combined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aciTNh402Co&amp;list=PLCkrqxOY1Fbp-P1Yv-7gmu75i2QS2Z6vk">CSR playlist</a>.</p>

<p>CSR Use Cases. Why is CSR needed? We’ve written several sequences of <a href="https://hackmd.io/ZbRiwvUfQSy-1RKM15bM8Q#CSR-Focused-Use-Cases">progressive use cases</a> in a preliminary document that discusses options both for CSR and its 2023 successor, Collaborative Key Management (CKM). It covers everything from simple protection of keys to future possibilities where no one actually holds a complete seed, despite its keys being in active use.</p>

 Community Events 

<p>Preventing vendor lock-in via interoperability has been a Blockchain Commons goal from the beginning, but that requires bringing together multiple parties to buy into interoperable specifications. The growth of Blockchain Commons’ community of developers, sponsors, and other interested parties in 2022 has truly made that possible, with those parties coming together in community events such as the biweekly CSR meetings and others.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/"></a></p>

<p>Silicon Salon 2. Our other ongoing get-together this year has been the <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/">Silicon Salon</a>, where we’ve facilitated wallet makers and semiconductor makers talking about the creation of the next generation of silicon design that is specialized for cryptography. Our <a href="https://www.siliconsalon.info/salon2/">second Silicon Salon</a> was held on September 14th. Presenters included Bunnie Studios, Cramium Labs, Proxy Labs, Foundation, and the VLS team.</p>

<p>RWOT11. Blockchain Commons got its start with <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, where Christopher Allen first brought community members together to support the future of decentralized and self-sovereign technologies. Unfortunately, Rebooting the Web of Trust went on hiatus shortly after the foundation of Blockchain Commons, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it was back <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague">this September</a>.</p>

<p>Blockchain Commons submitted two papers for RWOT11, to bring some of our topics into the conversation in the Netherlands: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/collaborative-seed-recovery-csr.md">an introduction to CSR</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/advance-readings/elision-redaction-correlation-smart-documents.md">Elision, Redaction, and Non-Correlation in Smart Documents</a>. The elision topic paper led to a discussion of <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/selective-correlation.md">Selection Disclosure</a> that we’re looking forward to finishing in the coming months. We also participated in an article on <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/draft-documents/identity-threats.md">Identity Threats</a>, which returns to some of our early identity work in the field!</p>

<p>Congrats to DIDs. We can’t talk about RWOT without congratulating everyone who worked on turning <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/specifications/DIDs-Ratified/">DIDs into a standard</a>. This has been a long-running goal for both RWOT and Blockchain Commons, so we were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> become a W3C Recommendation this July.</p>

 New &amp; Updated Projects 

<p>We have also continued work on some of our smaller projects:</p>

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit/master/static/images/spotbit-screen.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Beancount. Beancount is a <a href="https://github.com/beancount/beancount">simple program</a> that allows double-entry accounting from text files. Because of its textual foundation, it’s very convenient to use in conjunction with command-line Bitcoin tools. As it happens, this type of tool is also crucial to Bitcoin because of regulatory decisions in the US treating Bitcoin as property, not currency, meaning that capital gains need to be calculated for every transaction(!). This requires careful accounting of your Bitcoin, and to support that, we’ve updated our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/spotbit">SpotBit server</a> to also include a script called <code>beancounter.py</code> that will take a descriptor, look up historical prices via SpotBit, and thus provide all of the data an accountant will need to properly report Bitcoin purchases, sales, and usages. We’ve iterated the software a few times during the quarter, and think we might have a final version; watch for some documentation on the process in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>SpotBit. We’ve actually had a few recent updates to SpotBit, primarily to improve the look, feel, and design of its <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">webpages</a>. Thanks to 2022 interns who supported in this upgrade.</p>

 Advocacy 

<p>The work that Blockchain Commons does on specifications, leading to libraries and reference apps, is bottom-up: we work with developers to incorporate specifications that meet our vision of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. However, we also do top-down work, where we advocate for this vision to lawmakers, agencies, and other organizations.</p>

<p>Law &amp; Advocacy Repo. To better highlight this work, which was also well-supported by our 2022 interns, we’ve added a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/law-and-advocacy">Law &amp; Advocacy repo</a> to GitHub, to report out much of our work. It includes a list of <a href="https://hackmd.io/Eat2gnYqT56HQStI63JCNg">Terminology &amp; Definitions</a> produced by this year’s interns, and links to other work.</p>

<p>Private Key Disclosure. That work includes our new article advocating for <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/articles/Private-Key-Disclosure/">protection for private keys in courts</a>, which was published by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/saving-bitcoin-private-keys-from-courts">Bitcoin Magazine</a>. In recent years, courts have begun to request private keys as part of pre-trial discovery motions. It’s dangerous and unnecessary and it needs to end, as is now being considered in Wyoming, where Christopher Allen continues to give regular testimony. Fortunately, the proposed law in Wyoming to protect private keys from disclosure has recently passed a select committee and moved on to others. It still has a ways to go though!</p>

 Web Site Updates 

<p>Blockchain Commons’ third birthday passed without mention this Spring. But, that span of time since our foundation is probably why we’ve been doing a bit of work cleaning up our web presence, to make sure it accurately reflects where we are today!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com"></a></p>

<p>About Page. Didn’t even know that Blockchain Commons had a birthday? It’s referenced on our brand-new <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/about.html">About Page</a> which also highlights our three principals: Founder &amp; Executive Director Christopher Allen; Lead Researcher Wolf McNally; and Lead Tech Writer Shannon Appelcline.</p>

<p>Vision Page. We’ve long known the goal of Blockchain Commons: to make it possible for people to control their own assets and information on the internet, using the decentralized power of blockchain technology. We slightly revised how we write about that vision this quarter. Our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/vision.html">newest statement</a> combines two previous statements to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Blockchain Commons advocates for the creation of open, interoperable, secure &amp; compassionate digital infrastructure to enable people to control their own digital destiny and to maintain their human dignity online.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Projects Page. You may also want to take a look at our updated <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/projects.html">Projects Page</a>. We’ve done a lot of different work over the last three and a half years. Our updated projects page now highlights what we consider most important to our vision, beginning with the Gordian System.</p>

<p>Airgapped Community. Though we continue to believe strongly in partitioning services to encourage the Gordian Principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, that’s today much bigger than the airgaps that we were considering several years ago. As a result, we’ve transformed the Airgapped Wallet Community into the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community">Gordian Developer Community</a>. We choose the name “Gordian Developer Community” for this update because the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian">Gordian System</a> today incorporates all of our developer-focused work, from Principles and Architecture to Specifications and Libraries, plus the Apps that demonstrate them. We look forward to talking with airgapped-wallet developers and those working on other partitioning techniques alike!</p>

 Doc Updates 

<p>As part of our web updating, we’ve also done some work on our docs.</p>

<p>Revised Gordian Page. How does the whole Gordian system fit together, from our air-gap and tor-gap overview to specifications such as Gordian Envelope? Our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#readme">updated Gordian page</a> walks through the whole system from top to bottom, including new pages on topics such as the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md">Gordian Architecture</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Roles.md">Gordian Architecture Roles</a></p>

<p>New Test Vectors. We’ve also produced some new test vectors, to help people who are implementing our specifications. These include <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-test-vector.md#256-bit-seed">SSKR test vectors based on 256-bit seeds</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-seed-test-vectors.md">crypto-seed test vectors for both 128-bit and 256-bit seeds</a>.</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>Thank you as always for your support for Blockchain Commons. In 2022, we have truly become the commons that we imagined. Moving forward, we will continue to build firm foundations with our big focus on the architectural and reference work needed to release CSR by the end of the year.</p>

<p>If you’re not already a sponsor of our work, you can become one through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">GitHub</a>. Now that we’re back from RWOT11 in the Netherlands, we’re looking forward to continuing to advance our work!</p>

As we move towards IAM 2.0 with the panes of evolution changing from what our approaches were in the pre-pandemic world, there is an opportunity for us to build our programmes based on sound Identity fabrics thereby leveraging the true power of cloud-based capabilities, drive agility in adopting and delivering new Identity services and reducing unmanaged technical debt significantly. The presenter will talk from his own viewpoint of having delivered IAM programmes and legacy transformation at scale using the sound principles of the Identity Fabrics.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive-identity-fabrics-kumar-future-proof"></a>

<p>In what we see as a huge vote of confidence for the development of technologies and services that better protect data&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/">White House</a>&nbsp;has listed “privacy enhancing technologies” as one of the “industries of the future” in its April 2022 “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/04-2022-OSTP_IOTF_Report.pdf">OSTP Report on the Industries of the Future Act</a>”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/04-2022-OSTP_IOTF_Report.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;from the Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and submitted to Congress defines IoTF as advanced industrial sectors that:&nbsp;</p>



  Support innovative, inclusive, equitable, and sustainable growth  Have profound connection with technology R&amp;D and STEM3 workforce  Require R&amp;D investments to support growth that will lead to transformative impact  Will significantly benefit future economic prosperity and national security.  



<p>According to the OSTP, the IoTF possess certain characteristics:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“… IoTF are not static. They change over time and reflect the potential of the future. They are topics that still have a firm footing in basic research and development (R&amp;D), yet show the potential to create economic value in the years ahead. They are often marked by a revolution in a technology as opposed to a natural evolution. This drastic change means they are accompanied by periods of uncertainty, with the most transformative applications still to be discovered. It is this hope for something new, something not yet realized, that drives excitement in the research, innovation, and policymaking communities. Sustained investments are required until economic drivers are established; this often necessitate public seeding of funds as risk may outweigh near-term gains as a specific industrial sector emerges.”</p>



<p>Privacy enhancing technologies sits on the list of IoTF in the White House report alongside:</p>



  Advanced computing&nbsp;  Advanced materials, manufacturing, and robotics&nbsp;  Advanced, next-generation communications technologies&nbsp;  Artificial intelligence&nbsp;  Battery technology&nbsp;  Biotechnology&nbsp;  Cybersecurity&nbsp;  Green products/clean technology  Plant genetics/agricultural technologies  Quantum information science/quantum computing&nbsp;  Nanotechnology&nbsp;  Semiconductors/microelectronics technologies.  



<p>The goal of the OSTP report is to identify “federal research and development investments, infrastructure, and workforce development investments that enable continued United States leadership in industries of the future (IoTF).”</p>



<p>In a further vote of confidence for privacy, the report notes the “Biden-Harris Administration has put forward proposals to dramatically increase Federal investments toward realizing Industries of the Future for the benefit of the American people, especially American workers.” Investments to support IoTF are currently at more than $10 billion annually.</p>



<p>We’ve always known privacy would be a defining feature of this decade and beyond. You might like:</p>

<p>Gambling with the future of our homes, streets and neighbourhoods.</p>Retrofit Reimagined 2022 at Link Road: Photograph by Angela Grabowska<p>This piece was co-authored by members of the Dark Matter Labs and CIVIC SQUARE teams to build upon the ideas explored at <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86">Retrofit Reimagined</a>, a four day neighbourhood festival that took place 13th — 16th July 2022 in Ladywood, an inner-city neighbourhood in Birmingham, UK. Retrofit Reimagined brought together neighbours, practitioners, and organisers from across the country who are focused on retrofit, its role in the future of decarbonising our built environment and a just transition. The festival was hosted in partnership between <a href="https://www.architectscan.org/">ACAN</a>, <a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">CIVIC SQUARE</a>, <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/">zero carbon&nbsp;house</a>.</p><p>This is the first of three blogs as part of the Retrofit Reimagined series. In this introductory blog we set out how the recent Energy Price Guarantee is a reflection of long-term systemic failures to invest, regulate and focus on our homes as essential infrastructure. Our second blog will unpack what we’ve learned together so far, amounting to a call for a Public-Civic Partnerships approach to the transition of our Homes, Streets and Neighbourhoods. Our final blog will outline our idea for a ‘Street Demonstrator’ that shows the possibilities of a Public-Civic Partnership and how it can respond to the age of poly-crisis.</p><p>Written in October 2022, this blog reflects our progress, learning and insights at that&nbsp;time.</p><p>If a long form read doesn’t suit how you would like to engage, here are a few shortcuts to different forms of media to explore the topics raised&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8VnIUrM2Q&amp;list=PLgIJxOKjWOpigXk97jKPuBLf5fsfGNWjb&amp;index=1&amp;t=25s">Retrofit Reimagined Festival: Video Playlist</a> — July 2022<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x3ThQZT9qbXo3L2eW0Bs_rxagFesL_E6">The Great Energy Gamble: Visual Slides</a> — October&nbsp;2022</p><p>Estimated Read Time: 14&nbsp;mins</p>Retrofit Reimagined 2022 at Selwyn Playing Fields and Link Road: Photographs by Angela Grabowska<p>The cascading impacts of the energy crisis in the midst of climate breakdown are converging on our homes, streets and neighbourhoods, affecting every aspect of our lives — from food prices, material prices, logistics resilience, and our collective wellbeing. How we live, and how we live together, is changing and will change radically over the coming years. This cascading reality demands a deep transition in how we live — in combination of material, energy-conscious futures and a new landscape of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H_pIB8H0ps">healing homes</a>, streets and neighbourhood.</p><p>This is not a crisis that can be addressed individually, at the level of our homes alone. Nor can it be resolved through imposed and enforced top down solutions. It requires both civic organising and infrastructure, nested at the level of the street, neighbourhood and the city, alongside new state intervention at the scale of establishing the National Health Service or seeding the Social Housing Movement. This future requires a new Public-Civic Partnership.</p> Short Term Shocks &amp; Long Term&nbsp;Trends <p>The UK is undergoing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60846951">the biggest reduction in living standards</a> since the Second World War with high levels of inflation, underinvestment in public services and growing inequality. The <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2022/september/huw-pill-speech-at-the-institute-of-directors-dinner">recent turbulence in financial markets</a> is the latest in a series of long term trends: the ongoing downward valuation of the pound; increasing levels of government debt and rising costs of food and energy (even before the war in Ukraine); and extreme weather associated with climate change. We find ourselves in a <a href="https://cascadeinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/What-is-a-global-polycrisis-v2.pdf">polycrisis </a>— where multiple globalised systems become entangled in ways that have cascading impacts on our lives and the natural world we rely&nbsp;on.</p><p>Amongst the economic, political and emotional tumult of the past few weeks, it is easy to lose track of the fact that a large part of the immediate cause of unrest in financial markets is the UK government’s decision to both cut taxes and commit an estimated <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/response-energy-price-guarantee">£100–150bn</a> of taxpayers’ money to fund an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-announces-energy-price-guarantee-for-families-and-businesses-while-urgently-taking-action-to-reform-broken-energy-market">Energy Price Guarantee</a> at the same time. The Guarantee will pay energy companies the difference between the wholesale energy market price and a maximum energy unit charge. This is perhaps the single <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCMoreOrLess/status/1570008762362073097?s=20&amp;t=dkS6ZYT3PITrgmRD82cmDw">biggest</a> government spending announcement of the past few&nbsp;decades.</p><p>Clearly an emergency response was needed due to previous lack of bold action. Domestic electricity costs are pegged to gas prices which have been rising for some time and have spiked during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the structure of the Energy Price Guarantee represents a huge transfer of wealth (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/climate-change/energy-subsidies">amongst other subsidies</a>) to the fossil fuel industry from the public purse — a sector that has historically been responsible for creating the climate emergency and one that has <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-brief-history-of-fossil-fuelled-climate-denial-61273">funded </a>climate change denialism for decades. The approach is <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/a-chilling-crisis">regressive and poorly targeted</a> with those in the largest houses typically getting the most benefit and those already under-heating their homes standing to gain the least. The structure of the Guarantee also does little to incentivise energy saving and could make other approaches to funding energy efficiency harder to implement.</p> Because the Guarantee is funded by government borrowing against future tax income in a period of rising interest rates, it represents a massive financial cost on future generations already burdened by the climate crisis and decades of under-investment. <p>The cost of the Guarantee is in effect <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/a-blank-cheque/">uncapped</a>, but current estimates put it in the same ballpark as the Banking Bailout of 2008/09 but, unlike in the bailout, this time the UK state won’t get any of this back in the future. The costs to the taxpayer will only stop increasing if the wholesale price of energy reduces (a factor largely beyond the control of the UK), if the government withdraws the support, or if there is fundamental market reform. And it does nothing to encourage retrofitting of homes which is a requirement for any path <a href="https://www.edie.net/only-through-a-retrofitting-revolution-can-we-meet-our-2050-net-zero-carbon-target-in-the-uks-major-cities/">to net&nbsp;zero</a>.</p><p>This Energy Price Guarantee is therefore a guarantee for fossil fuel companies, but also a massive gamble for current and future taxpayers more broadly. By not investing strategically in effective deep retrofit and neighbourhood resilience, we are gambling with our own prospects for a brighter future and perhaps equally critical, our ability to address the cascading impact of the energy crisis that are part of a wider polycrisis in the midst of climate breakdown.</p>Retrofit Reimagined 2022 at zero carbon house and Link Road: Photograph by Angela Grabowska How Did We Get&nbsp;Here? <p>We believe, this polycrisis is converging in our homes, streets, neighbourhoods and cities — and solutions needs to born there. It is a crisis not just of energy, but of materiality, of economic capacity, imagination and social resilience, affecting every part of our&nbsp;lives.</p><p>As a society we have failed to invest effectively in our homes and neighbourhoods. At the heart of this lies the challenge and opportunity of retrofit — improving the fabric of our homes to make them more comfortable, healthier and able to use less energy. <a href="http://civicsquare.cc/">CIVIC SQUARE</a> and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a>, in partnership with <a href="https://thirtypercy.org/">Thirty Percy Foundation</a> and <a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/">Lankelly Chase</a>, have been working together around <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">retrofit</a> for the past two years, understanding the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">barriers</a> and exploring its <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">potential</a> at a neighbourhood and city scale. We have found that retrofit is linked to a wide range of positive <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/new-value-flows-impact-modelling-and-financing-neighbourhood-retrofit-v0-1-8674f795cef8">outcomes</a> that are not currently reflected in how it is being organised, <a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fprovocations.darkmatterlabs.org%2Ffinancing-sustainability-transitions-in-search-of-a-new-civic-led-orthodoxy-1e615288309f">financed</a> or governed.</p><p>In the UK, political decisions were taken to <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8964/CBP-8964.pdf">reduce</a> funding that led to a cut in rates of retrofit and insulation by around <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/home-insulation-and-the-net-zero-target/">95%</a> compared to 2012. Yet, the issue lies as much with a fundamentally flawed delivery model as with the low level of financial investment. Currently only households that meet very strict criteria may be eligible for measures to be installed at rock bottom rates, typically by centrally procured contractors. Outcomes are mixed. For example, despite costing over £1bn a year, only 57% of recipients for grant-based insulation measures under one programme <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1003872/eco-wave-1-summary-report.pdf">reported</a> receiving some or significant benefits from the measures installed. In any case, most of the easiest measures have now been done, and a more <a href="https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fretrofitacademy.org%2Fwhat-does-whole-house-retrofit-mean-to-me%2F">holistic</a> approach to improving our homes is required.</p><blockquote>“Home is no place for&nbsp;profit.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Araceli Carmargo, <a href="https://www.thecentriclab.com/">Centric&nbsp;Lab</a></blockquote><p>And what about the four fifths of households who don’t qualify or don’t live in a socially rented home with a responsible landlord? Apart from some high level <a href="https://www.simpleenergyadvice.org.uk/">advice</a> and guidance, there is almost no support. A recent <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9235/">attempt</a> to build a debt-funded approach for homeowners to implementation didn’t deliver and was scrapped.</p> As a country, we have mistakenly assumed that the way to deliver on our retrofitting needs is to enable individual action through market-based solutions, supported by extractive labour practices through standardised measures dictated by Whitehall. It relies on low cost single-use materials mainly made with, or using, fossil fuels, and simply isn’t fit for&nbsp;purpose. Retrofit Reimagined 2022 at Selwyn Playing Fields and zero carbon house: Photographs by Angela Grabowska Retrofit Reimagined <p>With the above backdrop, and green shoots of hopeful, holistic and systemic practice emerging across the country. In July 2022 as a partnership <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matters Labs</a>, <a href="http://civicsquare.cc/">CIVIC SQUARE</a>, <a href="https://zerocarbonhousebirmingham.org.uk/">zero carbon house</a>, and <a href="https://www.architectscan.org/">ACAN</a> hosted a coalescence of people and organisations in Ladywood — the neighbourhood that CIVIC SQUARE is proud to call home in inner city Birmingham, UK. <a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86">Retrofit Reimagined</a> was designed to bring together people from across the neighbourhood and wider field who were interested in reimagining retrofit and convened around the core question:</p> What if the climate transition and retrofit of our homes, streets and neighbourhoods were designed, owned and governed by the people who live&nbsp;there? <blockquote>“With Retrofit Reimagined, architects were seen as valued members of communities first and that positioning amongst a plurality of voices and professions was a worthwhile reframing for everyone’s role in the climate emergency.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Sara Edmonds, <a href="https://www.architectscan.org/">ACAN</a><br><a href="https://www.architectscan.org/post/report-from-retrofit-reimagined-2022">https://www.architectscan.org/post/report-from-retrofit-reimagined-202</a>2</blockquote><p>Here we heard from a whole range of people both from the built environment, and beyond technical experts, community organisers, architects, financiers, policy makers, philanthropists, activists, citizens and many others. From ideas around the foundational healing justice role of the place we call home to how we redesign the finance to go beyond a top down house by house approach. The attendance and feedback from across many spaces, experiences, and vantage points reoriented our collective goals away from merely an individual technical challenge, and towards a important and unique moment to invest and organise in a way towards retrofit as a moment of deep societal renewal, the scale which could be likened to the founding of the NHS, or seeding of the social housing movement. This wide spectrum of voices and perspectives showed that there is deep and broad support for civic and community-led retrofit, but few clear pathways that overcome the major <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-system-challenges-to-retrofit-3913efd718a3">barriers</a> we&nbsp;face.</p><p>What <a href="https://www.architectscan.org/post/report-from-retrofit-reimagined-2022">emerged</a> was a consensus that retrofit is not just a technical exercise in optimising energy use or carbon emissions for each individual household, but a process of establishing a <a href="https://www.thecentriclab.com/heating-and-a-healing-home">deeper relationship</a> between residents, the homes they live in, the co-benefits possible and the communities they are part of in a way that supports mutual aid and social justice. Where talk of low demand and interest from communities for retrofit is loud in the national rhetoric, our work in Ladywood, the mix of participants at Retrofit Reimagined, the pioneering work happening across the country shows this story to be far from true. Our neighbourhoods are brimming with energy, insight, will, openness, imagination and deep hope. Our current organising, governance, and finance frameworks, or vision for national retrofit, aren’t close to unlocking this deep dividend.</p> Retrofit Reimagined was a demonstration of how convening and organising as a collective can broaden our incentive structures towards common goods and public-civic value — from investment in houses, to investment in places and the systems they depend&nbsp;on. <p>Whilst our national approach may be moving at a glacial pace, there are green shoots already demonstrating more equitable ways forward, generating hope, moving loudly and at pace. Collective and area-based models are starting to replace the piecemeal approach of consumer-led retrofit. Approaches like these that retrofit the home as part of a larger urban system must take priority, from the scale of the street to the social housing block. Providers are starting to develop one stop shops and services, neighbourhood labs and campaigns are ramping up the pressure for new models, and there is lots to draw energy and inspiration from.</p><p>Explore the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm8VnIUrM2Q&amp;list=PLgIJxOKjWOpigXk97jKPuBLf5fsfGNWjb">Retrofit Reimagined video playlist</a> to watch back the talks from the event, and find out more about how connect with those incredible practitioners we were honoured to have involved in this first festival.</p><blockquote>“By prioritising community and care with programming, participation and production the festival felt revolutionary in comparison to the staid circuit of architecture events we’ve gotten used to and exactly what we need more of in a climate emergency.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Bobby Jewell, Architecture Today<br><a href="https://architecturetoday.co.uk/retrofit-reimagined-festival/">https://architecturetoday.co.uk/retrofit-reimagined-festival/</a></blockquote>Explore these From → To primers for the broader scale of reimagination required in more detail&nbsp;<a href="https://civicsquare.notion.site/Retrofit-Reimagined-9eb1d36585824faa89486ebfa12d1e86">here</a>. The Expanding Sense Of&nbsp;Crisis <p>Since July, the cost of living and specifically energy costs have dramatically taken centre stage in our national political debate and in households and streets up and down the country. Strategic underinvestment, a broken market and failing regulations have and are increasingly tipping millions of households into real hardship, and making otherwise viable businesses fail through no fault of their&nbsp;own.</p><p>Most other <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/how-to-deal-with-europes-energy-crisis">countries</a> and commentators have come up with <a href="https://neweconomics.org/2022/09/warm-homes-cool-planet">better </a>solutions that are implementable, for example, a universal basic energy allowance supplemented by changes to the benefits system, changes to the energy market structure and regulation. There are multiple variations where energy tariffs are stepped, with low energy users paying less per unit of gas or electricity than those who may use much more. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/27/labours-low-carbon-plans-look-like-sensible-economic-policy">Labour Party</a> has announced that, if elected, they would establish a publicly owned energy company alongside a major uplift in investment in insulation and a decarbonisation of the&nbsp;grid.</p><p>These policy responses are welcome, but the question of how best to deliver them over the coming years remains unanswered. Simply providing more resources in the form of short-term, nationally mandated, single-measure grant programmes using existing procurement approaches will not lead to the long term, increased local resilience that we need. We need to reimagine how to reconfigure the approach to unlock and augment the latent energy and capacity of the civic sector, and to realise the cascading benefits of doing&nbsp;so.</p>Retrofit Reimagined 2022 on Link Road: Photographs by Angela Grabowska A New Pathway For Safe, Just Neighbourhood Transitions <p>So, what did we learn through the Retrofit Reimagined enquiry so far that can be applied to the situation we now find ourselves in? What would a different path look like that would be regenerative, progressive and long-term? How would this support building long term resilience, a green economy and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/24/keir-starmer-unveils-green-growth-plan-to-counter-liz-trusss-tax-cuts">energy independence</a>?</p><p>Imagine if we allocated the £150bn set aside for the Energy Price Guarantee to support locally-led, place-based retrofit programmes. Imagine if they supported local training, low-cost or free home upgrades, and were designed to circulate money into the local economy, help build community pride and strength, while also generating massive positive impacts in health and wellbeing. There is strong evidence that a tailored approach would create major benefits and help to support the wider transition beyond retrofit by building distributed capacity and capability across our neighbourhoods, regions and nations. Another way to put it, is imagine spending tens of billions, for something that creates no improvements to energy security, housing quality or carbon pollution, whilst also barely lifting the most vulnerable out of deep&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>That is why we are calling for a new national energy and retrofit programme that draws upon the power of the state as well as the power of our streets and neighbourhoods. We need these Public-Civic Partnerships to not only deliver our collective retrofitting needs, but for citizens to become stewards of their local transitions towards fairer, greener&nbsp;futures.</p><p>The Retrofit Reimagined blog series will continue with part two: A Better Way To Spend £150bn, to follow shortly, describing a new approach to investment in our homes and neighbourhoods through a long term restructuring of how the state and civic society work together, through a new Public-Civic Partnership.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-great-british-energy-swindle-92a059a49248">The Great British Energy Swindle</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>This week, Indicio&nbsp;announced an important new product in the Proven product line: Holdr+. As Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio, explains: Holdr+is “a mobile way to connect with and coordinate credentials from different systems that were otherwise unusable outside those systems. With Holdr+, they now have that flexibility. We’re focused on Aries-based credentials right now, given that they are the most widely used, but we aim to make Holdr+ a way to use all credentials-either directly or through development contributions from the open source community.”</p>

<p>As an information security standard, ISO 27001 can be beneficial to understand and comply with, but what exactly is ISO 27001?</p>
<p>What does ISO 27001 mean? ISO 27001 is a regulation for Information Security Management Systems, which explains physical and logical controls an organization should abide by to protect their information more methodically.</p>
 What Are ISO 27000 Standards? 
<p>The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international organization dedicated to developing practical standards around technical and professional operations such that any organization can follow them.</p>
<p>The ISO 27000 series is one such group of standards published by the ISO to address cybersecurity concerns in private organizations. This series covers several approaches to cybersecurity, from IT and network security to auditor guidelines and industry-specific practices.</p>
<p>Some of the primary documents in this series, found in the earliest sequential publications, include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html">ISO/IEC 27001</a>, “Information technology – security techniques – information security management systems – requirements”: ISO 27001 covers the specifics of creating and implementing Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), which we will cover in more detail in this blog. 
 <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/75652.html">ISO/IEC 27002</a>, “Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection – information security controls”: A list of specific security controls that may be used as part of an ISMS. 
 <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/63417.html">ISO/IEC 27003</a>, “information security management system implementation guidance”: As the title implies, this document guides on implementing ISMSs. More specifically, this will break down the requirements outlined in ISO 27001 to provide specifics on how to implement them in real-world enterprise situations. 
 <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/64120.html">ISO/IEC 27004</a>, “Information technology – security techniques, information security management – monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation”: This publication provides specific requirements and practices that enterprises using an ISMS would use to evaluate effectiveness. This practice includes creating metrics, measuring data, monitoring system components, and more. 
 
<p>These are just the tip of this iceberg, as the ISO 27000 series has over 60 individual publications. For the most part, however, ISO 27001 is the most commonly adopted standard.</p>
 What Is ISO 27001? 
<p>ISO 27001 is a standard for developing an ISMS, a unique designation for an organization-wide network of people, processes, rules, and technologies that promote security. These can include documented processes or informal practices for specific problems, but both will fall under an overarching management plan tailored to specific security goals.</p>
 What Is an Information Security Management System? 
<p>In the broadest sense, an ISMS focuses on addressing the so-called CIA triad of security concerns:</p>
 
 Confidentiality: That data remains confidential and secured against unauthorized disclosure. 
 Integrity: That data remains whole and unaltered due to malicious tampering or corruption through improper processing or technology failures. 
 Availability: That data remains accessible to authorized persons for business use or customer/client/patient support. 
 
<p>Furthermore, an ISMS will allow an organization to accomplish a set of objectives, including:</p>
<p>Identifying stakeholders in an organization to determine IT security expectations.<br>
Identifying risks to technology and data security<br>
Defining security controls to address concerns and expectations and mitigate risks<br>
Setting security objectives organization-wide for IT systems<br>
Implementing controls and mitigation efforts in line with security objectives<br>
Measure and monitor controls for effectiveness<br>
Improve controls in cases of new threats, breaches, or ineffective operation</p>
<p>The ISMS isn’t a specific set of technology, but the governance policies around what needs to be secured, how, by whom, and how effectively. The ISMS, therefore, should be able to address compliance and legal requirements, organizational and enterprise goals, and operational necessities like data usability and budget.</p>
 What Are the ISO 27001 Requirements? 
<p>The ISO 27001 documentation defines several requirements for an ISMS. These requirements are defined in this document, and any future documents take these requirements as a reference in helping an organization implement the ISMS.</p>
<p>The requirements of an ISMS are:</p>
 
 Context and Organization: Your organization must understand its own business context, including security needs, internal and external stakeholders, industry and regulatory standards, and potential fallout from ineffective security or data breach. 
 Leadership: Your organization must have the leadership to create, implement, and maintain an ISMS. This can include specific executives (CIOs, CTOs, CISOs), compliance officers, IT management, and stakeholders or their representatives. 
 Planning: Your organization should plan the ISMS with clear information (usually from knowledge fulfilling the first requirement). This can also include vulnerability scans, risk assessments, and other diagnostics. 
 Support: Your organization must be able to allocate and distribute resources to teams managing the ISMS. This includes having the ability to communicate with team members, create organization-wide policies and education, and distribute guides, documentation, and best practices. 
 Operation: All processes for any aspect of the ISMS must be implemented and controlled. This includes implementing risk assessments for those processes. 
 Evaluation: Your organization must monitor, analyze, and assess the ISMS during its operation. This calls for internal audits and reviews. 
 Improvement: Based on the results of any internal tests, measurements, or audits, your organization should be able to implement changes and improvements, including system upgrades, retirement and replacement of equipment, changes to policies, or mitigation efforts following breaches. 
 
 The 14 Domains of ISO 27001 
<p>Finally, the requirements of ISO 27001 will cover 14 specific domains, including several control categories, of security and operations in your organization. These domains include:</p>
 
 Information Security Policies, or aligning security policies with company goals 
 Information Security Organization, or the establishment of management and personnel structures and maintaining the security of tools used by those teams. 
 Human Resource Security, or securing personnel and data involved in HR operations. 
 Asset Management, or the identification, classification, and protection of governed assets – including data and processing resources. 
 Access Control, or maintaining restricted access to processing and data resources for only authorized users related to their role in the organization.<br>
Cryptography, or the obfuscation of data at rest or in transit. 
 Physical and Environmental Security, or protecting physical processing facilities against damage, theft, or disaster. 
 Operations Security, or the safeguarding of processing facilities against unauthorized access or data loss. 
 Communications Security, or data protection as it moves through business networks. 
 System Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance, or the securely strategizing and planning of acquiring, expanding, and retiring system equipment. 
 Supplier Relations, or analyzing third-party vendor relationships and agreements 
 Information Security Incident Management, or detecting and responding to security issues as they happen. 
 Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity, or ensuring that security measures will remain effective in cases of business disruptions. 
 Compliance, or integrating any regulations or frameworks specific to business or industry operations. 
 
 Stay On Top of ISO 27001 Certification with 1Kosmos 
<p>While ISO 27001 isn’t a mandatory regulation, it is a strong and productive framework around which organizations should build their cybersecurity and compliance efforts. It touches on several baseline security elements considered best practices across most industries.</p>
<p>One of these best practices is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a>, and like many frameworks, ISO 27001 calls for <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/strong-authentication/">strong authentication</a> that includes multi-factor approaches or better.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides this level of security with the following features:</p>
 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.

Then you can log&nbsp;in.</p><p>Do you know your social security number, home address, and mother’s maiden name? Then you can sign up for the&nbsp;service.</p><p>You can probably see why this is a problematic way to deal with something as important as your identity. If someone nefarious finds out what you know, not only could they access your existing accounts, they could open up new ones in your name. With data breaches on the rise at a mammoth scale, that proposition becomes likelier by the&nbsp;day.</p><p>Anyone who has had their identity stolen knows just how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/27/your-money/identity-theft-auto-insurance.html">painful the process of getting things back in order can be</a>. For some, it unfortunately <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/retirementspecial/old-trusting-and-prime-prey-for-swindlers.html">becomes a lifelong&nbsp;pursuit</a>.</p><p>A much more secure way for managing our digital identities is to base it on what we&nbsp;have.</p><p>For instance, do you have access to your smartphone?</p><p>It’s immediately clear why such a framework is far more secure than the former. Wouldbe criminals would need to physically have your phone in their possession. They’d also need a way to get in — a tough ask if you have a PIN or fingerprint security set up. That’s something that might be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262347/attorney-general-barr-fbi-director-wray-apple-encryption-pensacola">possible for the FBI</a> but likely outside the wheelhouse of most fraudsters.</p><p>Traditional digital identities still based on what we know have gotten the memo. It’s why two-factor authentication is highly recommended if you want to keep your accounts secure. Now, it’s also about what you&nbsp;have.</p><p>But that transition is still only a half&nbsp;measure.</p><p>Eventually, it makes sense to shift toward a completely device-based identity. That way, your sensitive personal data is stored locally on your own device rather than hosted on some company’s server that becomes a target for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>With device-based identity, you’re in complete control of your data as well as your private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>This also opens the door for additional features that should become commonplace in the future such as identity portability and reusability.</p><p>We’ll be able to bring our identities with us from one service to the next. The reputation and social connections you create on one platform will be easily transferable if you ever decide to venture elsewhere.</p><p>We’ll also be able to verify our identities once and never again, re-using that verified identity for any additional services we sign up for.

<p>What makes Holochain special? Google searches, TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram dominate the internet as we know it. These “KillerApps” represent the core of the internet to us. So what is Holochain’s KillerApp? </p><p>First let’s reframe from KillerApp to <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2016/03/16/id-328">MotherApp</a>; starting from a place of cooperation rather than competition. Consider how we could offer a genesis experience — a new way of interacting online — which will spawn many new apps and experiences built on these same principles. &nbsp;</p><p>We believe that at the heart of such a genesis experience lies one key capacity: the ease of forking, or what we also like to call walkaway (inspired by Cory Doctorow’s <a href="https://craphound.com/category/walkaway/">book</a>). This capacity forms the heart of what makes open-source software so valuable, the fundamental capacity for anyone to take what’s there and improve, modify, and fork it into a better reality. To walk away from the enclosure of one space and into the creation of a new one. Currently this capacity lives only at the code level (e.g. GitHub). But the deepest value of the current Internet lies not in application code, but in the data the users of the platforms provide and the web of relationships this data creates. All of our major platforms capture the value of this data in exchange for the services they provide. Corporations do not charge for these services because they have found another way to monetize them. In the modern attention economy, data mining reveals what holds our attention and turns it into a commodity. Brokering our attention to advertisers funds the current internet; and keeping our data unforkable, as a company's private property, maintains a profitable monopoly.</p><p>Thus, we claim that the MotherApp of the next internet arrives with the ability to fork not only code, but also platform level data. It’s not good enough that a single user can download their own history from Facebook. We need an underlying infrastructure by which an entire group of people can walkaway together with all of their data as well as the application’s code into a new improved space as easily as they can click “fork” on GitHub today.</p><blockquote>Rather than holding data centrally, Holochain distributes all application data collectively between the users of the apps. Each user not only holds the application’s code, but a portion of the network’s data along with their own personal data, allowing for both uptime and data ownership on a p2p network. </blockquote><p>Holochain delivers exactly such underlying infrastructure, what we call an <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blog-holochain-org-capture-resistance-from-the-ground-up/">uncapturable carrier</a>. More than just an open-source grammar with which anyone can build their own protocols and applications running those protocols, Holochain also provides a novel, distributed structure for data. Rather than holding data centrally, Holochain distributes all application data collectively between the users of the apps. Each user not only holds the application’s code, but a portion of the network’s data along with their own personal data, allowing for both uptime and data ownership on a p2p network. This collective data ownership means subsets of those users can always fork applications at will. If you don’t like how an app or community functions you can simply fork it and all of its relevant data, add your own adjustments, and invite others to join you. This deep level of interoperability helps to address network effects while allowing for evolutionary growth of the ecosystem. </p><p>A MotherApp for Holochain then must give users a visceral experience of this uncapturability. By giving users the ability to develop their own segmented spaces of coherence the MotherApp itself will help future projects grow from that initial experience. To fully embody this, communities need to undergo forking.</p><p>Next, this article will discuss a couple of recently developed Holochain apps (hApps) and how they might provide this experience of walkaway. The article will also consider some of the challenges and benefits of forking, finally looking to the future of the ecosystem and its growth.</p> Walkaway for Project Management <p><a href="https://acorn.software/">Acorn</a>, a project management hApp, provides a simple interface where users can arrange intended outcomes into a dependency tree structure that helps break-down and prioritize complex projects. Each tree represents a particular project space which can be shared with other collaborators. When a collaborator adds an item or extends a tree, this propagates out to other collaborators sharing the project space. </p><p>Now imagine if a sub-group of collaborators realizes that the project has gone off track, or they decide they want to go in a different direction with their work. They can simply copy the workspace and all the shared data, give it a new name so it has a unique identifier, and move on, potentially sharing this new space with an entirely new set of collaborators. Meanwhile, the old space continues to work just fine for those still using it.</p>Acorn's "Map Veiw"<p>This may seem almost identical to what happens when copying a google document and adding changes to a new private version of the doc, essentially forking the data. However, differences appear when we look more closely.</p><p>When working with a Google doc, Google holds all of that data in the cloud on their servers. Acorn users spread the data across their local devices, maintaining redundant copies but providing direct local access to each user. Even more importantly, Acorn provides open access to its locally held application code. Where Google could implement a new change that removes access to a particular tool, this cannot happen with Acorn. As long as a user holds this version of the code they can run the program and share it with others. And if they want to add a change, they can easily fork the software. </p> The Why of Walkaway <p>What makes walkaway important? The cloud storage of Google Drive and similar services already do exactly what many need. As Moxie Marlinspike has <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">already pointed out</a>, most people don’t want to run their own servers. Most people probably don’t want to run their own code either. </p>Walkaway is about the right to carve out a new road, avoiding monopolies and the tolls that come with them. Said another way, Walkaway is about biodiversity. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/0Ezh0PRhtPo">Source</a><p>Walkaway becomes important though as a way to break from and avoid monopolies by mega corporations and as a way to create diversity within our communities and tools. The example above looks at a small-scale, individualistic form of walkaway, but as we’ll go on to see, the larger more meaningful forms of walkaway require a collective. Thus communities, not individuals, will gain the most benefit from walkaway. Whether an offshoot of an open-source coding collective or a local youth group fracturing from a larger institution, the ability to fork code and data gives a community a sort of sovereignty that does not depend on either the individual nor the institution/state. </p><blockquote>...the ability to fork code and data gives a community a sort of sovereignty that does not depend on either the individual nor the institution/state. </blockquote><p>The design of Holochain as an uncapturable carrier means that hApps hold data publicly. Each individual has the right to their own data, but the data created in the public sphere at the same time remains public. As we’ll see, this gains importance when social groups split, helping to maintain the social histories and accounts across spaces. Thus, the group cannot hold an individual hostage, nor can any individual hold the group hostage by controlling the server.</p> Walkaway for Collaboration <p>We, a new hApp from <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/">Lightningrod Labs</a>, aims to provide users with a tool for <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2022/07/26/id-390">generalized collaborative power</a>. Developed as a container for social interaction, We allows users to build highly customizable digital spaces for collaboration, without predetermining the nature of these spaces. Users will be able to load “applets” into We to give it different functionalities from threaded chat and calendar invites to video calls, whiteboards, voting, and currencies. Because applets are just repackaged Holochain apps, almost all hApps could potentially be implemented within We.</p><p>Designed to be, per Einstein's provocation, “as simple as possible, but not simpler,” We is an interface for managing the boundaries and connections between different spaces. One example of this is cross applet functionality. When running multiple instances of the same applet in different We spaces at once you can easily shift between group-centric and applet-centric views, for example allowing you to see just the calendar events of your current group or all of your events across different groups at the same time. We provides developers affordances to enhance and enable both of these perspectives.</p><blockquote>We is an interface for managing the boundaries and connections between different spaces.</blockquote><p>The real strength of We comes from taking the idea of groupware and generalizing it beyond any one functionality, while at the same time allowing communities to form membranes and self govern. As agent-centric software, each user decides what groups and applets they opt into. Similarly, community governance would happen from an agent-centric basis. Bad actors can potentially be removed via ban lists that each user opts into rather than being censored from the top down. The overlapping decisions and interactions of individual agents form together into communities, rather than communities existing as something predefined. These principles and associated tools like <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/glossary/#membrane-proof">membrane proofs</a> and <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/glossary/#capability-grant">capability grants</a> are inherited from Holochain itself. We just provides the structure and user interface needed for these networked relationships to be integrated and more accessible. Because every Holochain app has the structural properties of a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">Sovereign Accountable Commons</a> (SAC), these social spaces can quickly morph into DAOs. As digital communities that need to make decisions collectively, each space will need <a href="https://hackmd.io/Xf9LhBnyQ9Ga0RGLUrxsIQ">different levels of protocol</a> to help them embody their decisions and agreements. </p><blockquote>Sometimes communities diverge. But with entwined pasts, each should be able to set out with a copy of the data and the platform. Walkaway enables this type of continuity.</blockquote><p>This is where walkaway and the art of the fork come back. Sometimes communities diverge. This doesn’t mean that their pasts were not entwined however; one group starting over from scratch while the other maintains the old platform sets up very different power relations than when both move forward from the same place, each with a copy of the data and the platform. Walkaway enables this type of continuity. </p><p>Like with Acorn, and any hApp for that matter, a user will be able to fork We at will. This goes for the code as well as the data. If you want to start a new space because you disagree with a decision made by your community, do so. Want to change how We verifies data structures? Copy your current version of the software, make the edits you need, and launch. </p><p>But don’t forget to invite your friends. We isn't of much use to just one person.</p> Walkaway is non-trivial Walkaway is costly, and it takes a community. While an individual can fork code and data, people have to follow for that to be useful. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/6U5AEmQIajg">Source</a><p>Walking away from anything takes effort. Most software on the internet today gains its use value not just from the technical aspects of the tool in and of itself but because of the community of people it connects you to. This is certainly the case with social media and groupware like We, but it is also the case for, as an example, a map application like Google Maps. Users, from businesses to individuals, add rich context to the map through daily updates and through their activity on the app. To learn how busy a restaurant is or a business's operating hours you check Google Maps. Users either add or create this data and give the app its value.</p><blockquote>To fork a social space you need allies, people who will shift with you to the new environment and bring it value.</blockquote><p>To fork a social space you need allies, people who will shift with you to the new environment and bring it value. Network effects make walkaway more difficult. However, in building an environment that encourages forking, we expect a greater culture of walkaway and a diversity of versions of any program. Holochain also enables interoperable connections between forked spaces. This gives users autonomy while not giving up the benefits of connection to broader networks and also provides groups the ability to customize their software without locking out potential users. </p> What’s Next: Walkaway for Digital Ecologies <p>We acts as a MotherApp for Holochain because it gives users an easy and intuitive way to experience forking on both social and technical levels. Once users can walkaway in practice, both its ease and its social costs, become readily evident.</p><blockquote>Imagine forking as a form of birth through mitosis, the splitting of cells. As protocols and communities continue to diverge and coalesce they fill niches and expand the ecology, meeting the needs of users through an iterative, evolving process.</blockquote><p>You often hear about digital ecosystems. But this rarely refers to more than products that somehow connect to or benefit each other. We, and Holochain more broadly, attempts to actualize the vision of a digital ecology. Imagine forking as a form of birth through mitosis, the splitting of cells. As protocols and communities continue to diverge and coalesce they fill niches and expand the ecology, meeting the needs of users through an iterative, evolving process. No longer simply products, they become organisms. </p>Meta-gramatics form a game for writing new rules. Like biology, different organisms form together to symbolically form new structures. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/1PpyUZceg_I">Source</a><p>Ecosystem-like structures use building blocks (DNA, code, grammar), which instruct the system on how the content (organisms, data, speech, energy), takes shape and gains meaning. Thus, We provides a meta-grammatics, a set of rules that facilitate the development of new rules. A meta-grammatics that makes it easy to iterate and create new spaces requires a rule that lets you walk away to new spaces and to choose which spaces to inhabit. Ecologies also need the ability to merge spaces and for organisms to interrelate. </p><p>A grammatics for powerful group evolution requires more than just forking. The 4 Fs (Forge, Fork, Federate, and Fuse) expand this grammatical capacity as described in the following:</p>  Forging creates original new spaces from scratch.  Forking simply creates a new space by modifying an old one.  Federating applies a protocol to interconnect two existing spaces while leaving them distinct.  Fusing merges two separate communities into one.   <p>Federation in We is just adding the same instance of an applet into two different We groups, each user independently opting in to the shared app. The fusion of two communities then is simply what happens when they fully federate all of their applets. Thus fusion can happen all at once or slowly over time on an as needed basis; the same goes for walkaway. What’s beautiful about the Holochain architecture is that it allows rule sets to be brought together as composable chunks, thus meta-grammatics. The examples here and throughout this article describe just a small portion of the problem spaces that the 4 Fs bring with them. They also only illuminate a glimpse of the benefits. </p><blockquote>What’s beautiful about the Holochain architecture is that it allows rule sets to be brought together as composable chunks, thus meta-grammatics.</blockquote><p>Ultimately, many in the Holochain community endeavor to provide not a platform but a new grammatic capacity with the goal of creating change and to allow others to build the platforms they need. With an explosion of social spaces, users have a diversity of options to choose from. These communities and the grammers that support them break the norm of monolithic institutions which provide a singular way to navigate society, rather they give many different avenues through which to access community and social services. As a diversity of platforms spawn from this root, it will provide ways to interact with others and build new ecosystems together. </p><p>You can now download an alpha version of <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">We</a> through the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a>.</p>

 UAE’s fintech revolution has begun. But can its banks balance customer expectations for better, more digital services with strict, local regulations? 



 



<p>Fintech has played a huge part in the UAE’s digital evolution over the last decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Government initiatives to propel the country toward a forward-thinking, technology-focused future have been matched by the launch of a plethora of online services from the private sector. Hospitality, commerce, and, of course, banking are just some of the sectors that have responded to the demand for digital services from tech-savvy citizens and residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The COVID pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation efforts of many local organizations. In fact, according to a <a href="https://legatum.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/170321-MIT-Wamda-E-Commerce-COVID19-report-EN-01.pdf">report </a>compiled by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  and Wamda, a platform of programs for entrepreneurs in the Middle East, eCommerce grew by 52% in the first year of the pandemic alone. As a result, investment in fintech startups more than doubled (US$78 million) in 2020. The fintech revolution has affected everything from online transactions and payment gateways to KYC processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With some of the world’s fastest internet speeds, and high smartphone adoption rates, fintech companies in Dubai and throughout UAE have been able to grow and diversify at a rapid rate, such as the Buy Now Pay Later local player Tabby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers now want more control over their finances – whether from a computer or through their smartphone. What they don’t want is to queue up at the bank only to be told they’ve forgotten a vital document to secure their loan.</p>



<p>Although regional challenger banks like <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk">Wio</a> have seized the opportunity to revolutionize banking, some incumbent banks have been slow to adapt. In fact, traditional banks across the world have been slow to kick-start their digitalization efforts. According to <a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/07/covid-19-impact-on-banking-m-and-a-2020.html">KPMG’s Global Banking Outlook H2 2020 report</a>, this is because institutions lack foresight, and how to correctly implement their digitalization efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abu Dhabi-based Wio, for example, offers 24/7 digital banking that allows its customers to access and manage their finances around the clock. Fully digital platforms like <a href="https://xpence.com/#home">Xpence</a> and <a href="https://ogpay.com/">OG Pay</a> are also thriving in the UAE, and pulling customers away from archaic incumbent bank setups and processes that force customers to access services in-person, or via a phone call.</p>



<p>However, while traditional banks and fintechs seem to be on different service paths, there are similar challenges and opportunities that they share.&nbsp;</p>



 The challenges of fintech. 



<p>Governments and regulators tend to prescribe the rules and regulations of what traditional banks can and can’t do. As they cannot extend their offerings without a rigorous number of approvals and checks, this can severely hinder their expansion efforts. Specific laws, rules and requirements can also change from country to country. While similar regulations apply to fintechs, the problem is compounded by a clunky fit of laws and regulations that are still catching up with the technology they’re trying to regulate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UAE, digitalization of services – especially when it comes to onboarding new customers – is a major challenge as central banks and regulators still undertake assessment on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; An additional complexity is that identities must be verified and approved by the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship, which can currently only be done in person. This means the customer must either drive to the bank and provide ID, or the bank sends a member of staff to the customer’s home or office with a card reader to confirm the authenticity of their documentation. Fintechs, on the other hand, allow their customers to onboard digitally using digital identity solution providers like IDnow, which has gained the approval of local regulators, The Dubai Financial Services Authority and Abu Dhabi Global Market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using fintech to streamline an established banking institution’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20stands%20for%20%E2%80%9CKnow%20your,element%20throughout%20the%20customer%20relationship.">KYC process</a> and customer journey seems like a logical step to take. It can speed up the onboarding process, deliver 24/7 access to money management, and provide customers with complete control of their finances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital identity proofing and verification can help onboarding for a range of financial services, including&nbsp;banking, fintech, Buy Now Pay Later, digital assets and cryptocurrency platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 The future of the financial landscape in the UAE. 



<p>Digital identity verification provides huge opportunities for fintechs and banks to shape the future of the UAE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to our recently conducted YouGov survey, UAE residents are keen to embrace the opportunities of digital services, with 8 out of 10 participants adamant they want their bank account opening process to be completely digital. And, despite 90% of participants saying they’re worried about the threat of fraud as banks become more digital, a massive 61% still use online banking in some form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Most users are just a bit techie. Some more, some less. But as we all know, real cybersecurity experts are rare. Thus, it is best to assume that the ones you want to educate on cybersecurity awareness and response are no technical, nor cybersecurity experts.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>However, with everyone of us being a user of devices in personal life, and everyone being in danger of cyber-attacks, cybersecurity awareness training has become way easier. The approach I take for several years now is to focus on what this means on the own device, in the personal life, and then to transfer to the business domain.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Everyone is receiving emails, from unknown people, from known people but with obscure email addresses, with strange topics, spelling errors, links or attachments. Demonstrating what to look at in this context, e.g., raises the interest of the audience and commonly triggers questions and discussions. Few samples from real life, both the personal life and the business life, help in increasing awareness and knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Instead of abstract rules, such concrete examples help, best by highlighting the fraudulent areas in such mails. From there to explaining “do a mouse-over across a link first, check the internet domain, and then – if all appears being safe, and only then – click the link (and only if there is a real value in doing so)” is a short step.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Another important element in my approach is to name the contacts to call when something looks strange, and to emphasize the importance of doing so instead of just acting by clicking links or opening attachments. Convince the team that no one ever has been blamed for asking. This is always better than making fundamental mistakes. Surely, the team has to react positively to the questions that will follow soon after the training (they are always raised, to my experience).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Last not least, you can add a little bit of tech content. My favorite subject here is explaining where in the Windows task bar to find the symbol with the current security status of the Windows system. This is a simple measure with very little effort that everyone can perform on a regular basis. If the symbol isn’t green, it then is about asking the experts.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>By the way: My trainings rarely take more than 15 minutes (unless a lot of questions occur, but that then is a good sign), and can be easily done in 5 minutes (without questions), as you can see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cybersecurity_awareness_training">here</a> (at least if you understand German).</p>

<p>We have been talking with the EU about some research they are doing into the role of ‘smart contracts’ in data portability. We won’t go into the details of that particular discussion here, but it raised some bigger questions that we think are worth sharing. This is an edited version of a document we sent&nbsp;them.</p> Is the EU discussion about data portability missing a key&nbsp;point? <p>In its discussion of data portability the EU rightly recognises the economic importance of this issue, stressing that “market imbalances arising from the concentration of data restricts competition, increases market entry barriers and diminishes wider data access and&nbsp;use.”</p><p>However, the way it has framed the issue of ‘control’ of personal data renders the biggest breakthrough opportunities for economic transformation — in productivity, service quality and innovation — largely invisible.</p><p>Hidden in the details of data portability lies the potential for organisations to deposit ‘verified attributes’ or ‘verified credentials’ in individuals’ personal data stores (sometimes called ‘wallets). These verified attributes confirm data that has been carefully checked about individuals. Because they are cryptographically secure, they cannot be tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>When verified attributes are deposited in individuals’ personal data stores, it becomes possible for individuals to bring this pre-verified data with them to their dealings with other service providers. These other service providers can rely on this data without having to regenerate it or check&nbsp;it.</p><p>This process greatly speeds up completion of data-driven tasks and eliminates friction, effort, risk and cost from every step of personalised service provision across every service dealing with individuals, including public administration, financial services, health, education, retail, transport, media and&nbsp;leisure.</p><p>The closest economic parallel to this is the productivity revolution ushered in by Henry Ford’s moving assembly lines for the production of automobiles. Verified attributes are the standardised parts of service provision and personal data stores are the assembly lines. Ford reduced the costs of making a car by over 90%. Similar productivity breakthroughs in service provision are being made possible by the portability of verified attributes.</p><p>In addition, the ability to make individuals the point at which information about themselves is gathered is creating powerful new-to-the-world person-centric data assets. Currently, individuals’ data is dispersed across the hundreds of different organisations that collect data about them. Enabling this data to be unified in the individual’s personal data store, under the control of that individual, is creating a data source whose richness surpasses any data asset ever created — while fully protecting individuals’ privacy. The economic potential of these new person-centric data assets is&nbsp;immense.</p><p>As long as these two opportunities — of verified attributes and of individuals as the point of integration of their own data — remain overlooked, EU discussions about data portability and ‘control’ over data risk missing the economic opportunities that could be opened&nbsp;up.</p> Two meanings of ‘control’ <p>In this context, it is crucial that the EU recognises there are two distinct and different meanings to the word ‘control’ as it relates to individuals ‘controlling’ their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The first, very limited, meaning relates to individuals exercising more control over the data that organisations collect about them. The second, broader, more expansive meaning of control is individuals being able to collect, store, use and share their own data for their own purposes — to make better decisions and to manage their lives better — independently of any organisation that may be collecting data about them. This subsumes the first, limited meaning of ‘control’ as one small part of a much bigger&nbsp;process.</p><p>Only if the second, broader, more expansive meaning of the word ‘control’ is embraced will the full economic potential of data portability be unleashed.</p><p>In this context, focusing only on the first, narrow meaning of ‘control’ is very limiting. The real defining characteristic of PIMS (Personal Information Management Services) is not the issue of control (which is just a means to an end). It is individuals’ ability to use their own data for their own purposes, e.g. to manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>Two forms of portability</p><p>The two meanings of the word ‘control’ imply two different forms of data portability, requiring differing data sharing infrastructure.</p><p>A narrow, limited, interpretation of data portability assumes that data about an individual will be transferred from one data holding organisation to another. This is a strategic non-starter for two&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>First, it ignores the mathematics of networks which mean that, as such a system scales, it quickly generates a cost and complexity catastrophe. Figure 1 below illustrates this&nbsp;point.</p>Figure 1: A system of data sharing based on organisations passing data directly to each other quickly gets overcome by a cost and complexity catastrophe.<p>In a one-to-one data sharing network, as each new node joins the network the number of connections needed to connect them multiplies by the number of nodes in the network (whereas, it the sharing is done via a hub like a personal data store, adding a node adds just one new connection).</p><p>With a network of just three participants, direct sharing is fine. But with just eight participants, the number of connections that are needed has already jumped to 28. And by the time it gets to 50 participants, the number of connections needed has jumped to 1225 (whereas, with the individual’s personal data store at the centre, the number of connections that are needed has now risen to&nbsp;50).</p><p>This complexity catastrophe unfolds on multiple fronts, including:</p>  Security, as each organisation exposes its systems to other organisations  Interoperability, as each organisation has to learn how to deal with other organisations different software formats, standards, and so&nbsp;on.  Governance, as each organisation has to check whether another connecting organisation is bona fide, and really has permission to access the&nbsp;data  Data protection, as individuals lose sight of how holds their data for what&nbsp;purposes  <p>In short, a strategy for data sharing which simply extrapolates forward from today’s reliance on organisation-centric databases is a certain recipe for a catastrophically costly, toxic snarl-up.</p><p>At the same time, if this approach is adopted, individuals never have the opportunity to take control of their data as in the second, broader, more expansive meaning of the term. With organisation-centric data portability individuals are continually excluded from the workings of the data economy, which remain firmly in the hands of data holding organisations.</p><p>The second interpretation of data portability is where copies of the data held by organisations, (including verified attributes) are deposited in the individual’s personal data store, so that they can use their data independently of the organisation that originally generated this data. This requires new infrastructure — empowering individuals with their own personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>This second approach to data portability has been explicitly recognised by the EU — by the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on the right to data portability (5 April 2017) which stated&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>“Data subjects should be enabled to make use of a personal data store, personal information management system31 or other kinds of trusted third-parties, to hold and store the personal data and grant permission to data controllers to access and process the personal data as required.”</blockquote><p>The take-out from this is simple. If the EU overlooks the pivotal importance of new enabling infrastructure for data sharing it risks a) sleepwalking into a data sharing complexity catastrophe and b) missing the true economic potential of data portability.</p> Distinctions between personal data stores and&nbsp;PIMS <p>The two interpretations of ‘control’ and the two forms of data portability as outlined above raise further questions about the EU’s understanding of the PIMS&nbsp;concept.</p><p>As stated above, in our view, the unique contribution of PIMS is to help individuals to use data to manage their lives better: the focus is on ‘use’. Examples of ‘using’ data may be making and implementing decisions about personal finances; managing a health condition better, or laying out a personal skills, training and career plan. All such services require data to be aggregated from many different service providers.</p><p>Personal data stores do not, per se, provide such services. They are personal data logistics enablers, providing the infrastructure that enables the necessary data collection, storage and data sharing for the provision of such services. A PDS enables data to be held by individuals independently of particular service providers and enables the maximum reuse of this data by many different services.</p><p>To that degree, we see personal data stores and PIMS as being part of the same movement towards citizen data empowerment but with different roles and functions — one enabling data access, the other helping better use of the data once it has been accessed. PIMS need personal data stores to function more efficiently (and if PDS infrastructure is not used, it will involve PIMS in huge amounts of extra, duplicated effort, the costs and complexity of which could stifle the growth of the&nbsp;sector).</p> Conclusion <p>The gist of our input was that the EU needs to build the full economic opportunity into its discussions about data portability. To do so, it needs to grasp the differences between two meanings of control and the two forms of data portability along with the need for new citizen empowering data infrastructure. Let’s see what they come up&nbsp;with.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-critical-fork-in-the-data-road-1eb29c5a42a8">A critical fork in the data road?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Please introduce yourself and the company Sovereign Wallet.</p><p>My Name is Cizar, and I’m the Chief Strategy Officer of Sovereign Wallet. I’m based in Stockholm-Sweden, overseeing the global market expansion to build a sustainable ecosystem for the company. Before introducing the company, let me give you a brief background of who I am and why I joined Sovereign Wallet two years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Before I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seokgu-phantom-yun/">Phantom</a> (the founder &amp; CEO of Sovereign Wallet), I was running several companies in investment mediation, innovation strategies, and business development for startups. I was also an academic researching innovation and entrepreneurship. I wrote the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Colony-Innovative-Startups-Practical-Policymakers/dp/9151958732">“Colony of Innovative Startups: A Practical Guide for Policymakers and Corporate Leaders”</a> published in early 2020. The book suggests an unorthodox way of building an ecosystem of innovative startups and proposes four main lessons to retain for the success&nbsp;formula:</p>  A company with a genius idea that can solve a real-world problem  A product with the ability to be sold to clients <br>(Customers-Based Business&nbsp;Model)  A vision to sustain through building its ecosystem.  Using futuristic technology (ex., Blockchain, DLT technology, etc.)  <p>For all four(04) criteria mentioned above, I could smell, touch, and identify during the 1st meeting with Phantom. Then, I started to be interested in Sovereign Wallet’s philosophy and technology, had more discussions with the company founders, and exchanged possible ways of collaboration; as time passed, I realized that I could add more value by being an insider and accepted the founder’s invitation to join the company, and here I have now joined the dream of Sovereign Wallet with a mission to build the internet of sovereign digital currencies and contribute to shaping the future of payment, a more transparent and inclusive financial system.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet has developed <a href="https://scan.metamui.id/dashboard">MetaMUI Blockchain</a>, the world’s first identity-based blockchain, the state-of-the-art fourth-generation blockchain with the main net launched on January 3rd, 2021. Sovereign Wallet’s headquarter (HQ) is located in Seoul, South Korea, and the company has four companies under the name “Sovereign Wallet Network (SWN) Global,” present in Singapore, Sweden, India, and Uzbekistan.</p><p>The founder and CEO of Sovereign Wallet, Phantom Seokgu Yun, is one of the best security experts in the security expert. Before establishing Sovereign Wallet, he provided security software to the South Korean government and big corporations, including eBay Korea, Kakao, Samsung Electronics, Samsung Life Insurances, SK Telecom, LG Telecom, KOSCOM, Yahoo Japan, Rakuten, and many more. He also provided the security software during the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/g20/summits/seoul/">G20 Summit</a> in South Korea in&nbsp;2010.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet’s research partner is the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/rewriting-satoshi-company-and-uni-to-build-crypto-model-addressing-bitcoins-shortcomings">University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering</a>, led by <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Krishnamachari/Bhaskar">Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari</a> and <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Neuman/B">Prof. B. Clifford Neuman</a>. We’ve had a very successful collaboration over the past three years since 2019 and are continuing to achieve our strategic goals.</p><p>The company has six patents applied for and <a href="https://swnglobal.com/patent">18 patents acquired</a>, and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Seokgu-Yun">three academic papers</a> published at IEEE conferences.</p><p>2. Most companies in the blockchain industry mainly focus on developing NFT and Defi platforms, and many investors are interested in that too. What makes Sovereign Wallet focus on CBDC development?</p><p>Having CBDC development as the main focus of the Company’s strategy doesn’t mean we are not involved in developing futuristic solutions that will shape the financial and payment industry.</p><p>First, we are a fintech company with uniquely distinguished advanced technology. We believe we are already representing the 4th generation blockchain, and we are the world’s 1st identity-based blockchain.</p><p>To answer the question, we are not only focusing on CBDC, even though we are convinced that any future development in payments and banking should consider an operational digital currency system. That’s why CBDC deployment is fundamental, the reason why Sovereign Wallet is investing more resources to make our MetaMUI CBDC platform available by the end of this year. So any Central bank can explore and test its advanced features and run pilots on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Another thing that I want to highlight is that the MetaMUI CBDC platform is not limited to digital currency issuance. It is considered an innovation platform enabling a sustainable digital ecosystem of innovations. Some DeFi features are already deployed on top of the MetaMUI platform, such as the National Identity System, e-Government services, and Digital Assets Tokenization which also covers green finance and carbon trading features.</p>“MetaMUI CBDC SSID”&nbsp;App<p>3. Many countries, including Sweden, Canada, France, Korea, etc., are developing their own CBDC platform. What is the reason they focus on the CBDC development so&nbsp;eagerly?</p><p>It is indeed an international movement, where <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cbdc/2022/cbdc-weekly-bis-says-90-central-banks-exploring-digital-currency-call-to-slow-down-digital-rupee-philippines-plans-q4-pilot-of-wholesale-cbdc/">almost 90% of Central banks have entered the CBDC race</a>, either in research, development, or potential pilot implementation.</p><p>To know the reasons behind this movement, we must dive deeper into understanding the current transformations in the global financial system. An aging system with over 100 years of existence is characterized by multiple hits, crises, and serious threats. It is now trying to adapt to unstable circumstances to remain operational. However, the past century witnessed similar attempts to reform/change every time a major crisis hits the financial system: from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">1929 great depression</a> to the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp">Breton Woods Agreement</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock">Nixon shock in 1971</a>, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis">1997 Asian financial crisis</a>, which was followed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008">2008 global financial crisis</a> until the 2020 covid pandemic… to name few — adding to that two particular threats triggered an alarming situation among central bankers, digitalization, and the increasing adaptation of cryptocurrencies globally.</p><p>All the circumstances mentioned above are the main drivers for a global reflection toward finding sustainable remedies to the aging global financial system.</p><p>That’s why we are seeing the central banking community worldwide joining the efforts to seriously consider Central Bank Digital Currencies(CBDCs), which might be one of the valuable solutions to build a better, resilient, sustainable, and futuristic financial system.</p><p>It might be relevant to mention that what we live today in the CBDC era is not completely new. A quick look in history shows that similar initiatives aimed to have a digital form of money that replaces cash: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bancor">BANCOR</a> of 1945, for example, was the 1st attempt to create a digital currency for international transactions. Thousands of cryptocurrencies are trying to replace the existing financial establishment outside the banking and financial system.</p><p>I cannot predict how the war between the two worlds (Cryptocurrencies vs. Sovereign Digital Currencies) will end. Still, I’m convinced that the international financial community is working hard to reform the current financial system and build a better, more inclusive, transparent, and resilient financial system.</p><p>Through the genius invention of its MetaMUI CBDC, Sovereign Wallet is joining the global effort and aiming to contribute to building the Internet of Sovereign Digital Currencies.</p><p>4. Sovereign Wallet opened its subsidiary office in Stockholm, Sweden. Could you share with us the current CBDC market situation in the Nordic region and what is your plan and strategy to expand the CBDC business in the Nordic&nbsp;region?</p><p>First of all, I would instead ask the following question: why specifically Sweden and not other Nordic countries?</p><p>The answer is pretty simple: Sweden is the largest Nordic country and a well-connected economy, and when it comes to financing and banking, the Swedish Central Bank (Sveriges Riksbank, or simply the Riksbank) is the world’s oldest central bank, founded in 1668. When it comes to CBDCs, the Riksbank experience is the most outstanding example so far. <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/payments--cash/e-krona/">The research on CBDC started in 2017, and the e-Krona pilot launched in 2020</a>. However, no decision has been made yet on whether an e-Krona publication- is suitable for the nearest&nbsp;future.</p><p>For Sovereign Wallet, being present in Sweden allows us to interact with the Riksbank and explore possible ways of introducing the MetaMUI CBDC platform, testing its features, and ensuring a continuous enhancement of the platform services.</p><p>Another reason for choosing Sweden, particularly Stockholm, is the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub(BISIH) Nordics. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/16/bis-launches-innovation-hub-with-nordic-central-banks-focusing-on-cbdcs/">The BISIH Nordics was launched in June 2021</a> and gathered all four Nordics Central Banks in one place. This is the perfect opportunity for Sovereign Wallet to bring MetaMUI technology up front and introduce it to the representatives of four Central Banks (the Riksbank, the Norges Bank, the Icelandic Central Bank, and the Danish Nationalbanken).</p><p>Sovereign Wallet had a very fruitful discussion with the BISIH Nordics during the past months. We hope to resume these talks this month and pave the way for a fruitful collaboration between MetaMUI and the BISIH&nbsp;Nordics.</p>SWN Global Sweden, located at the ‘Epicenter Stockholm.’<p>5. China succeeded in commercializing its non-blockchain-based CBDC called “e-CNY.” What is the difference between blockchain-based CBDC and non-blockchain-based CBDC?</p><p>It is evident that the Chinese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_renminbi">e-CNY</a>, also known as the “Digital Yuan,” is a non-blockchain-based form of digital currency issuance. Let’s look into its early development to understand its differentiation from the current CBDCs.- The e-CNY project’s official name is “Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DC/EP)” even the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) made it clear from the beginning that this is an electronic form of payment, somehow similar to digital banking. When exploring the operationality of the e-CNY, we must highlight an import feature as described by the PBOC: <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/china-launches-digital-yuan-app-what-you-need-to-know/">“The e-CNY is a digitized version of China’s legal currency, the renminbi (RMB). It is issued by China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). It is designed mainly for high-frequency, small-scale retail purchases and transactions.”</a></p><p>The statement above underlines that the entire project focuses on enhancing payments and improving digitalization, which in my opinion, is very close to an open banking / digital banking kind of&nbsp;system.</p><p>However, a CBDC description has a much broader explanation of the Central Bank’s role while issuing a digital currency, which closely imitates cash issuance and monetary policy elaborations.</p><p>In short, a CBDC would preferably maintain the classical role of a Central Bank as the country’s sovereign authority that oversees the national monetary policy and offers a digital form of money that covers most cash characteristics.</p><p>To compare with blockchain-based CBDC. MetaMUI technology is completely different! MetaMUI is the world’s first identity-based blockchain. It uses a hybrid system of high-performance digital cash and high-security digital checks. This hybrid architecture allows MetaMUI’s blockchain to be used in global-scale applications, including central banks, digital stock issuance, digital currency exchanges, non-fungible tokens, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>MetaMUI utilizes an indigenous multi-ledger architecture, meaning each digital currency generated on MetaMUI Blockchain will have its blockchain ledger. We also offer a pre-built identity blockchain and digital asset blockchain. Our node system consists of Bank nodes and Mobile&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>The MetaMUI CBDC platform offers the possibility of issuing Central Bank Digital Currencies in the most secure and technologically advanced&nbsp;way.</p><p>6. What are the differences between public blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tezos, Algorand, etc., and the MetaMUI Blockchain?</p><p>We’ve developed solutions significantly ahead of other enterprise blockchains in scalability and compliance, making us the ideal technology choice for a country-wide CBDC implementation.</p><p>MetaMUI is not the only platform offering blockchain-based digital currency issuance. However, our extensive research and advanced development have provided us many advantages over other enterprise blockchain platforms. The main competitors in this field would be R3 Corda, Enterprise Ethereum, Bitt, G+D, Ripple, and Hyperledger projects — including Hyperledger Fabric.</p><p>However, broad-usage enterprise blockchains still run into performance issues. They are not built specifically for financial applications and are neither made to accommodate wide-scale adoption. An Ethereum-based solution or other existing enterprise blockchains would not be sufficiently scalable for countrywide implementation.</p><p>Remember that the <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_transactions_per_day">public Ethereum blockchain only supports up to 1.1~1.2 million daily transactions</a>, and any major scaling increases are currently not foreseen.</p><p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/02/architecture-hyperledger-fabric/">Hyperledger Fabric is benchmarked at up to 3,500 transactions per second(TPS)</a>. However, it does not include any identity integrations, and the peak benchmark numbers are currently only possible in a fully controlled environment. The approach to scale by utilizing channels has some major concerns. We have identified that Hyperledger Fabric is unlikely to scale sufficiently for a real-world CBDC implementation due to the number of channels required to be established and other technical factors.</p><p>In short, no blockchain platform other than MetaMUI can offer identity-based transfers, which are the core of a legally valid CBDC issuance. We also provide far higher scalability thanks to our hybrid model, which sets us far ahead of any other blockchain solution provider for this use&nbsp;case.</p><p>As the other enterprise blockchains are built for broader use cases and are not financial-specific, we are uniquely positioned to be the primary choice for any country that wants to expedite its central bank digital currency issuance and not rely on time-consuming and expensive custom developments to build one from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>7. Lastly, please tell us how you view the future of CBDC and the mid-to-long-term roadmap and vision of Sovereign Wallet.</p><p>Let me start with the Sovereign Wallet roadmap, which covers the MetaMUI expansion strategy for the coming years. We plan to strengthen our presence in Europe and the Nordics region to get MetaMUI technology involved in many digital payments-related projects. We are reaching advanced stages in talks with the BISIH Nordics to take part in two important projects for the Nordic payment ecosystem (Project Aurora and Project Polaris). We multiply our efforts on the digital euro project through a strategic partnership with the Digital Euro Association and other regional stakeholders.</p><p>Another direction that MetaMUI is preparing to head for the end of this year is the GCC region(Gulf Cooperation Council); we have already appointed exclusive agents representing Sovereign Wallet in all GCC regions (KSA, UAE, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain). A subsidiary company is planned to be established in one of the GCC countries. Stay tuned for the good&nbsp;news.</p><p>In summary, we will see MetaMUI achieving interesting milestones during 2023 and contributing significantly to building the Internet of Sovereign Digital Currencies (IoSDC).</p><p>More about&nbsp;us</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

 Rollup Meaning: 
<p>If you are familiar and have been moving for a while in the environment of decentralized technologies, blockchain, crypto, and especially if you are involved in the Ethereum ecosystem and have heard about the recent Merge that the Blockchain did, it is very likely that you have heard about the concept of rollups. But almost certainly also, we said “Oh no, yet another term I have to learn…”. Well, here we are to help you understand it fast, easy and on time so you look like a genius at the meeting with your friends. Here we go:</p>
<blockquote><p>A rollup is a type of scaling solution that works by executing transactions outside of Layer 1 but posting transaction data on Layer 1.</p></blockquote>
 But…Why Rollups? 
<p>First things first. We must understand that blockchains, like Ethereum, can be slow and expensive because the higher the demand, the higher the fee to pay. Having to spend several extra dollars in gas fee, for a single transaction. This in DeFi is a major drawback.</p>
<p>This is where the need for layer 2’s like rollups is born. So, we could say that, rollups process the transactions from layer 1, in another faster blockchain, layer 2. Well, in this system, after processing the information, the transaction data is carried back to layer 1 (mainnet), but at a fraction of the price. In short, this means that we save the waiting time and processing cost of the mainnet. Therefore, and very importantly, users can benefit from the speed and low cost of the rollup, but without giving up the security of the layer 1 blockchain.</p>
 Rollups and the Ethereum scalability solution 
<p>Rollups are one of several scaling systems, which are nothing more than methods to make a slow blockchain faster and cheaper. Other scaling systems are sidechains and stateful channels.</p>
<p>Most scaling products are specifically related to Ethereum, as it is the largest blockchain with smart contracts developed on it. In the recent Merge (successfully completed in September of this year), Ethereum’s main developers sought to improve the speed and costs of the blockchain with a series of updates. These updates will not necessarily diminish the importance of scaling solutions. On the contrary, scaling solutions are likely to complement Ethereum’s updates, so they are not going away.</p>
<p>Read also: <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/ethereum-the-merge/">Ethereum: The Merge is coming</a></p>
 What types of rollups are there? 
<p>We could say that there are mainly two types of rollups, Optimistic and Zero Knowledge (ZK). Both, as we said, decrease transaction costs and waiting time. This works in such a way that, instead of waiting for the processing of each particular transaction in Ethereum (for example), several tens of transactions are recorded in layer 2, and then “rolled up” into a single transaction, which then returns as a packet to layer 1 or main blockchain. As you might guess, by returning like this, the cost of that transaction is divided among many users who have their transaction in that “rolled up” packet.</p>
 
 
 Optimistic Rollups: 
<p>It is called Optimistic because it is optimistically assumed that all transactions contained in the rollup are valid. Therefore, in these types of rollups, users are given a certain number of days to challenge fraudulent transactions.</p>
<p>Because they are all assumed to be correct, processing is faster because the network does not have to waste time confirming things. The disadvantage is that it takes about a week (the time given to dispute the transaction), to officially withdraw your funds from an Optimistic Rollups, as in the well-known Arbirtrum or Optimism.</p> 
 
 ZK-rollups: 
<p>ZK-rollups or Zero-Knowledge Rollups use Zero Knowledge Proof to cryptographically determine if a transaction is valid, using only a minimum of information about that transaction.<br>
This is an off-chain protocol that operates on top of the Ethereum blockchain and is managed by on-chain Ethereum smart contracts.<br>
As we have seen in other articles, Zero Knowledge Proof, or ZKP, is a privacy-preserving, fast and inexpensive method.<br>
Compared to an optimistic rollup, which requires the funds to remain in the network until the dispute resolution or challenge period closes, ZK-rollups allow users to withdraw their funds without so much delay.<br>
We can say then, that ZK rollups have an advantage in terms of speed and security over Optimistic rollups. But not everything is so easy, ZK-rollups are more complex in their application and type of technology.</p> 
 
<p>For now, ZK-rollups are used for specific functions or applications. One of the major use cases of these rollups, and the most seen, is the exchange of non-fungible tokens or the transfer of cryptography between addresses.</p>
<p>Read also: <a href="https://extrimian.io/resources/blog/zero-knowledge-proof-and-self-sovereign-identity/">Zero Knowledge Proof and Self Sovereign Identity</a></p>
<p>But there are many advances we see in this area, and many teams are looking to develop tools linked to ZK-rollups. For example Polygon, Scroll and Matter Labs are working on their zkEVMs, which is a ZK-rollup that works identically to Ethereum’s mainnet. The idea then, is that these rollups can support any kind of applications that users want to develop on that layer 2.</p>
 What are the dangers of rollups? 
<p>We have to take into account some security considerations. And is that, while they take many of the security features of Ethereum, not everything is equal.</p>
<p>First of all, we have to take into account that being tools that are in their initial stage, the networks in which they operate are usually still somewhat centralized as there is a development team that maintains partial control, being able to have certain decisions such as turning on and off the network as they deem necessary.</p>
<p>Smart contracts in a rollup is not as finicky as that of a program developed in Ethereum. It may contain bugs because although there are audits and reviews to improve these bugs, if we rely on an external program to manage the transactions that go through the rollup, we can expect certain risks.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that some rollups also still use centralized “sequencers” to successfully coordinate transactions on the layer 2 chain. While a sequencer cannot forge or alter transactions, it technically has the ability to censor or reorder them for profit. This does not mean that it will happen, but we should know that it is possible in some cases.</p>
 How to use rollups in Ethereum: 
<p>We could say that Optimistic rollups and ZK-rollups work in an almost identical way in their use.<br>
What should happen, is that they can bridge your funds to layer 2, and complete the transactions you need to perform in the rollup (buy and sell cryptocurrencies/NFTs, interact with protocols, move funds between wallets, or any DeFi transaction).</p>
<p>Note that to get started, you must fund your crypto wallet (Metamask, Coinbase, Binance, etc.), with any Ethereum compatible token (ether (ETH) or ERC-20 tokens).<br>
Next, you need to change your wallet to operate on layer 2, so you can bridge your tokens to move them from one network to another. Of course, there is an Ethereum transaction fee to pay to move your funds to a rollup.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the transactions, you can then transfer your funds back to Ethereum. This requires you to convert the rollup funds into ERC-20 tokens that are native to the Ethereum mainnet.</p>
 In conclusion: 
<p>Rollups in general are going, if they didn’t make it yet towards decentralization, in some way or another. It is believed that the rollup market will continue to grow due to its economic, time and security benefits for users.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that yesterday KILT became the first parachain to relocate from Kusama to Polkadot. The stability and bank-level security of Polkadot allow KILT to provide practical, secure decentralized identity solutions for individuals, builders, and large-scale enterprise use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>At 20:15 CEST on Monday 3 October, KILT built its first block on Polkadot following the last block on Kusama and is now running as a Polkadot parachain. This milestone opens up a whole new phase for KILT. It is now production-ready for applications that need a more secure environment, and for large-scale enterprises that require the stability and scalability that only provided by Polkadot provides.</p><p>KILT Coin holders don’t need to do anything differently — all KILT transactions were stopped when the move started and all data, including KILT Coin balances on the KILT blockchain, remain safe and secure. All services built on KILT are unchanged and can be used as&nbsp;before.</p> One Chain, One&nbsp;Coin <p>Following the original plan of “one chain, one coin”, KILT became the first blockchain in the ecosystem to move in its entirety from Kusama to Polkadot. This means that all the KILT Coins and data on KILT/Kusama are now on KILT/Polkadot. There will only ever be one KILT Coin, and all credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and web3names previously issued on KILT are still valid. This was possible thanks to Polkadot’s groundbreaking technology.</p><p>To facilitate the move to Polkadot, the KILT community held a referendum to approve the required runtime changes. The referendum also granted the KILT Council additional rights to facilitate the relocation without restoring the Sudo (super user) key, keeping KILT decentralized throughout the process. This referendum passed with 100% agreement.</p><p>The KILT team did rigorous pre-testing, then the final phases of relocation started under the direction of the KILT Council. Transfers were disabled for the duration of the move. Finally the KILT/Kusama chain was stopped by swapping it with a new paraID on Kusama. This produced the finite, last Kusama&nbsp;block.</p><p>Using the “Solo-to-parachain” pallet developed by Parity Technologies, KILT was then relocated to Polkadot and started producing blocks on October 3. We’re very thankful to the Parity core developers for their support of the KILT team throughout the&nbsp;move.</p><p>For a deep dive into the technical details and phases of the relocation, go to the report on the Polkadot Forum&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/t/how-to-recover-a-parachain/673">here</a>.</p> Path to&nbsp;Polkadot <p>KILT launched as a Kusama parachain in September 2021 as a blockchain identity protocol for generating self-sovereign decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials. On November 10th of the same year, governance moved into the hands of the community of KILT Coin holders and KILT became a fully decentralized blockchain. Since then, KILT has gone from strength to strength. Thanks to the fast iterations possible on Kusama, significant new functionality was integrated into the KILT&nbsp;runtime.</p><p>You can now build your own decentralized digital identity, under your control, with these applications “Built on&nbsp;KILT”:</p>  <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a> — a wallet for KILT Coins and credentials (<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/Create-KILT-Sporran-Identity.pdf">How-to&nbsp;Guide</a>)  <a href="https://stakeboard.kilt.io/">Stakeboard</a> — a staking platform for backing KILT collators with KILT Coins (<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_Stakeboard.pdf">How-to&nbsp;Guide</a>)  <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> — an identity verification service for social media credentials (<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_SocialKYC_Credentials.pdf">How-to&nbsp;Guide</a>)  <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign</a> — a decentralized way to sign any digital file directly in your browser (<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_DIDsign.pdf">How-to&nbsp;Guide</a>)  <a href="https://w3n.id/">web3name</a> — a unique name for your digital identity that can be used across ecosystems and linked with addresses and credentials.

Image: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moofushi_Kandu_fish.jpg">Bruno de Giusti CC-BY-SA-2.5</a> 1. Introduction <p>Bitcoin, Ethereum and others have shown how you can reward those who add value to the ecosystem in a highly automated fashion [1]. The trick is to auto-dispense rewards to those who contribute to a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/can-blockchains-go-rogue-5134300ce790">precisely-defined objective function</a>. This is an efficient, scalable approach to allocate capital towards&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Good news! Data Farming turns this into reality for the Ocean ecosystem, with the “maximize data consume volume” objective function. veOCEAN’s ve-based locking mechanics and protocol revenue to ve holders round this out to make OceanDAO much more automated (beyond&nbsp;grants).</p><p>So, OceanDAO’s been evolving. Where might it further evolve? DAOs of other Web3 projects have chosen to have general governance over protocol parameters and treasury spending. We had been seriously considering growing OceanDAO’s scope similarly. However, something nagged at us. We felt uneasy since we knew heavier governance meant larger attack surface. But, was that all just worrywart theory, or could it actually&nbsp;happen?</p><p>Recent events point to the latter. First, a regulatory agency ruled that members were liable for their DAO’s actions. Second, small groups of 1–3 actors control many large DAOs, such as Coinbase in MakerDAO (capture).</p><p>Furthermore, any governance also keeps Ocean away from its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">network goals</a> to be censorship-resistant and trustless. Finally, the core team spends large time &amp; mental effort every month in making DAO grants happen; this has opportunity cost to other traction initiatives.</p><p>Given the risks and costs, does OceanDAO actually need governance? Let’s explore. First, as of V4, Ocean’s core smart contracts are highly flexible; they offer a vast space to explore business models. Ocean doesn’t need DAO governance for its core functionality. Second, as discussed, veOCEAN and Data Farming provide a means to reward those who add value to the ecosystem without governance or&nbsp;grants.</p><p>Overall, Ocean will be more resilient, more scalable and more capital efficient if it is fully decentralized and autonomous (D&amp;A).</p><p>Therefore in coming months, we will make this&nbsp;happen.</p><p>This means:</p>  We will wind down OceanDAO&nbsp;grants.  We will automate &amp; decentralize the rest of veOCEAN and Data Farming&nbsp;(DF).  OceanDAO grants’ budget will shift fully to Data Farming. There is now 503.4M $OCEAN allocated to DF&nbsp;rewards.  <p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 elaborates on OceanDAO grants wind-down. Section 3 describes how we will make veOCEAN and DF to be D&amp;A. Section 4 concludes.</p> 2. OceanDAO Grants Wind-Down  2.1 Timeline <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-round-22-is-live-91e0187db298">OceanDAO Grants Round 22</a> will complete. This has $65K USD worth of OCEAN available, including $10K to Algovera grants program. Proposals are due in early October, with voting the week&nbsp;after.</p><p>OceanDAO Grants Round 23 will complete. This is $45K USD worth of OCEAN available, including $10K to Algovera grants program. Proposals are due in early November, with voting the week&nbsp;after.</p><p>Then, OceanDAO Grants will&nbsp;stop.</p> 2.2 Funding Redirection <p>We will shift the remaining 3% of the 51% from grants to DF. This increases the total $OCEAN available for DF rewards from 481.8M $OCEAN to 503.4M&nbsp;$OCEAN.</p> 2.3 Grants&nbsp;FAQs <p>Q: Will veOCEAN be used for voting in grants round 22 or&nbsp;23?</p><p>A: No. It’s not worth implementing, given that it would only be used for such a short&nbsp;period.</p><p>Q: Will OceanDAO Core Tech WG continue?</p><p>A: Yes. Its emphasis will be around technical collaboration within the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>Q: Will the monthly 10K $USD to Algovera-curated grants continue?</p><p>A: Yes. It will come directly from OPF to Algovera.</p><p>Q: I really rely on grants! What should I&nbsp;do?</p><p>A: See the next section “Your sustainable Ocean&nbsp;project”</p> 2.4 Your Sustainable Ocean&nbsp;project <p>If you’ve been getting or considering grants via OceanDAO: consider this as us redirecting you to the other ways to earn in the Ocean ecosystem.</p>  Rewards via Ocean Data Farming and veOCEAN. Lock OCEAN into veOCEAN for passive rewards; for even higher rewards, actively allocate your veOCEAN to assets with high data consume volume. The more you lock, the more you earn. The longer you lock for, the more you earn. The higher the consume volume, the more you earn.<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/veocean-is-launching-data-farming-is-resuming-abed779211e3">&nbsp;Details</a>.  Ocean Shipyard program, which gives grants for builders. Shipyard is curated and managed by the Ocean core team.<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">&nbsp;Details</a>.  Sell data or scripts/algorithms. Ocean’s designed to reduce friction on this, and we keep improving it! This could be raw data, scripts to clean data, cleaned data itself, scripts to compute feature vectors, feature vectors themselves, scripts to build AI models, AI models themselves, scripts to run predictions from AI models, or predictions themselves. Each of these can be an asset in&nbsp;Ocean.  Use Ocean data/algorithms to make predictions, to make money. For example, to help in DeFi&nbsp;trading.  Use Ocean in your startup’s stack. You may be a business selling data/algorithms; building a dapp or service; or building your own decentralized protocol. For all of these, Ocean tools can help you ship sooner with more functionality. Then, use the usual startup financing: investors, revenue,&nbsp;etc.   3. Making DF/VE Decentralized &amp; Autonomous  3.1 Review of&nbsp;DF/VE <p>We recently launched veOCEAN, where one locks OCEAN to get veOCEAN. Locking for longer means more veOCEAN, which in turn means more rewards. One can earn more rewards yet by curating data assets that have high data consume volume. veOCEAN holders also get a cut of protocol revenue, which increases with data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).</p><p>These mechanics incentivize growing DCV, and form a strong backbone for Ocean’s sustainability loop.</p> 3.2 D&amp;A Status of&nbsp;DF/VE <p>Here are key components of DF/VE, and their D&amp;A&nbsp;status.</p>  veOCEAN core. The contracts to lock OCEAN into veOCEAN are deployed on Ethereum mainnet. They are already D &amp;&nbsp;A.  Passive rewards. The contracts to compute &amp; dispense passive rewards to veOCEAN holders are deployed on Ethereum mainnet. They are already D &amp;&nbsp;A.  Active rewards. Data Farming is currently run as a python script that reads on-chain data (veOCEAN balances, asset DCV) and computes rewards, off-chain.  Funding rewards. Every week, the Ocean core team manually triggers on-chain actions to fund both passive rewards and active&nbsp;rewards.  <p>The first two components are already&nbsp;D&amp;A.</p><p>Now, for the remaining two. The Ocean core team has made detailed plans to make these D&amp;A as well. This includes (a) Building an exponential-vesting smart contract, including a way to support 10/25/50% multipliers; (b) Minting the remaining 51% OCEAN tokens, to be sent to the vesting wallet (c.) Making DF rewards calculation run on decentralized compute infrastructure.</p><p>We will be executing on these plans in the next few&nbsp;months.</p> 4. Conclusion <p>OceanDAO’s going fully decentralized &amp; autonomous (D&amp;A). In practice, this means winding down OceanDAO grants, and fully automating veOCEAN and Data&nbsp;Farming.</p><p>Once this completes, OceanDAO will be shaped like<a href="https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html"> CurveDAO</a>: ve-based locking mechanics, protocol revenue to ve holders, and rewards to ve holders that drive an objective function.</p> Notes <p>[1] Bitcoin had zero grants. Yet a thriving Bitcoin ecosystem emerged. How? First, Bitcoin has always had a rewards program for those who contribute to its objective function (network security); specifically, it rewards BTC to those who contribute hash rate to maximize security.

<p>What makes Nation State Actors so special compared to other threat actors?</p>
<p>I think it's important to understand the differences between the different threat actor groups, I think is super important for a CISO. Those are usually seen as the following. We have the insiders, on the one hand, the attack comes from the inside. So it's an employee which intentionally, accidentally or abused from the outside helps on an attack. We've seen this in the Ukraine situation. So latest since then, this is a concern. The second group that CISOs are concerned about is the hacktivist, so usually following a special ideology or sympathizing with the specific side in a conflict. And again, this is what we've seen massively during the Ukraine war, for example. The classic group that CISOs are concerned about is the organized crime groups, the professionals. They are usually after the money. They have different maturities, so, for example, from ransomware to sophisticated payment fraud attacks and they're getting better over time and the last group actually is the one which is subject to this exercise. And this is the nation-state level attacks. The nation-state levels are characterized by vast resources they have to use for their attacks potentially. And in worst case, they have lots of patients. So we've seen in nation state-level attacks which are going over more than a year, for example. So they are able to launch very sophisticated attacks. They use their intelligence organizations and there are special cyber forces in the countries. And they have lots of tools and techniques and they have very, very special and sometimes even unique knowledge. So we know that the nation states usually collect the knowledge on zero-day exploits. So these are vulnerabilities which aren't yet publicly known, and they obviously can then be used in an attack once and once they've been published, then they get pitched sooner or later. And that's what we've seen in a couple of nation-state attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the main countries we are concerned about and what are their motives?</p>
<p>So the countries you will most likely hear about most often in the context of nation state cyber attacks are typically North Korea, you hear about China, you hear about Russia and you hear about Iran. And however, if you look at the threat landscape report of the different intelligence organizations globally, then you will find out there are far more names on their respective lists and some of the countries are actually very surprising to us. All well-known countries or even what we would call “on our side”, so to speak. We've seen that many nation states in the last few years were ramping up their cyber capabilities significantly. So I think this is seen as a basic capability of all modern countries to have cyber defense and in some cases even cyber offense operations capabilities. So in some countries, we see a relatively open discussion is being held on if and which offensive actions would be allowed. But I would say in most countries, actually, it's pretty non-transparent. Which cyber operations are being carried out by the nation-state where the citizen actually is living in. And when you look at the different cyber operations carried out, this very much depends on the motives and the priorities of the respective country. So we see in some cases it's just monetary income. Is the motive for North Korea, for example, they are very much interested in money.</p>
<p>In most cases, you see an interest in industry knowledge. So, espionage, for example, the classic country we think about here comes from Asia. It's for example, China. But here again, many, many countries are doing this actually, even ones we would attribute to the “western” side. Others again, have motives on destruction or to reduce the stability of the country. So, for example, attacking critical infrastructure, I think of, for example, about the Stuxnet attack a couple of years back against the nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the best way to defend against a nation-state-backed attack?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mentioned that the nation states actually are able to carry out very sophisticated attacks. However, we have seen, and this applies, for example, for the attacks we've analyzed during the Ukraine war, that many of the attacks comprise of standard techniques, like, for example, phishing or spear phishing emails, so targeted emails or the abuse of known and public available volatilities. Which just need to have patched on internet-facing applications. So, the basic thing which is always advisable is basic hygiene, like awareness, the understanding of phishing emails and not clicking a link, and especially not entering the credentials then on the fake website which opens up. We talk about multi-factor authentication, I think this is a baseline capability. Patching is super important, and we see increasing importance for structural capabilities such as network segmentation, which can help. But we know that the capable nation-state, if they really want to get into an organization, then it's super difficult to have an effective defense against this. I mean, CISOs know for a while already, there’s never 100% security. So regardless of how sophisticated you tailor your organization, your security organization, there may be a more sophisticated attack, which reaches your perimeter, your defense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the Ukraine war cyber threats got increased public attention. What incidents have we seen?</p>
<p>So during the Ukraine war, real nation-state level attacks we've seen primarily among the directly involved countries. So we've seen such attacks in Russia and Ukraine and a little bit in Belarus as well. We have been super vigilant when the NATO application of Sweden and Finland came up, especially for the organizations in the Nordics. But, and this the good news, we've not seen related cyber activities directly attributable to NATO application. Jens Stoltenberg warned very publicly and I think he just repeated it as an earlier sentence, and Biden stressed this as well, he warned Russia indirectly with a sentence that is, A cyber attack against a NATO country may invoke Article 5, which actually says that this is an attack against a NATO ally, which leads to the consequence to the other countries and other NATO allies will help and defend that country accordingly. So on the nation-state side, I would say we've not seen that much. We've seen more, plenty of attacks actually, from hacktivists on both sides. These were primarily distributed denial of service attacks, for example, against organizations still doing business in Russia, was one example. But we've not seen very serious attacks on that side. And in many cases, the attacks cannot be clearly attributed back to a specific threat actor or to the nation-state or to hacktivists fighting with one side.</p>
<p>So I've had calls with a couple of CISOs who had a DDoS attack, and they of course, have a range of IP addresses from where the attacks predominately came, which is then obviously botnets or something like that. But it cannot be clearly attributed back to who is now the one who was paying for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has the Ukraine war the potential to change the cyber threat landscape in the future?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mentioned that more countries are actually investing into their cyber capabilities. Now, especially in the Ukraine situation. Look at the Germans, for example, parts of their significant ramp-up of funding for the armed forces, which will go into cyber capabilities. And we made experiences in the past that it's just a matter of time until these capabilities, tools, techniques or even knowledge on zero days will leak down and may then be used and abused by organized crime groups afterwards. The most famous leak, most likely was the Shadow Brokers leak from I think it was 2016, and the Shadow Brokers is hacking group and they actually made a couple of tools and data about zero-day vulnerabilities publicly available. And it's obvious that this data and these threats came from a group which is called the Equation Group. And we believe that this can be, that they belong to the National Security Agency in the United States, so the NSA. And there's a link again, I mean the nation-state tools do know what they will leak. That means practically, the Ukraine war has the potential to accelerate the evolving landscape even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who should attend the round table discussion and what can attendees expect?</p>
<p>I think the nation-state topic is a super, super interesting topic for everybody who is concerned about security in an organization. Of course, cyber security, the most prominent one. But this goes even into the area of physical security and executive protection. I would say that especially CISOs, (Chief) Security Officers, security experts and other people besides us who are interested in the topic are well advised actually to attend this exercise. I think participants can expect a good discussion on this topic and that we all sharpen our understanding of what we can do and potentially when is good good enough or where even actions crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your expectations in terms of the round table discussions?</p>
<p>I think especially in the last few years, collaboration, intelligence, and experience sharing among the, I call them “the good guys”, became a capability of increasing importance. So I'm always delighted if I have experienced people in a room discussing options for a topic like this one which is not so easy and where a silver bullet is not so obvious or perhaps even not existing.</p>

				 <p>Check out the latest episode of <a href="https://northernblock.io/">Northern Block</a>‘s <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/">SSI Orbit Podcast</a>! In this episode, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathieuglaude/">Mathieu Glaude</a> welcomes our own Darrell O’Donnell to discuss the importance of Trust Registries.</p>
<p>In SSI ecosystems, a Trust Registry is a valuable tool that tells you where to go to get answers to help you make trust-based decisions. They can help answer questions like: do I trust the things involved enough to achieve what I want in any interaction?&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>During the conversation, Darrell discusses the role of Trust Registries in decentralized identity (SSI) ecosystems, how they help establish the authenticity of data and who benefits the most within the Trust Triangle. He also shares his thoughts on adopting Trust Registries and how they will play a significant role within SSI ecosystems.</p>
<p>We want to extend a special thank you to Mathieu Glaude at Northern Block for asking Darrell to be on the show. We are thrilled to continue to promote Trust Registry technology and its incorporation into decentralized identity ecosystems.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — September 26th to October&nbsp;2nd <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! We have brought some of the hottest news from the world of crypto regulations this week, from the Bank of England Governor’s statement on bringing digital assets under the existing financial regulatory framework to Paraguayan lawmakers rejecting the president’s veto of the crypto bill. So, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> BoE Deputy Governor Wants Existing Financial Regulations to Extend to&nbsp;Crypto <a href="https://twitter.com/AFME_EU/status/1575041150029012994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Image Source</a><p>Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said financial regulations should be extended to cryptocurrencies before the industry becomes large enough to potentially threaten broader financial stability during the Operations, Post Trade, Technology, and Innovation Conference in&nbsp;London.</p><blockquote>“Regulators need to begin extending existing standards and regulatory regimes to crypto before, not after it becomes systemically important,” Cunliffe said. “And done carefully, the development of regulatory regimes helps, not hinders, innovation by reducing the risks of confidence destroying crashes and by giving innovators a framework within which to innovate.”</blockquote><p>Despite flagging these risks, Cunliffe also praised the underlying technology, saying that even bigwigs like HSBC are investing and experimenting in it due to its potentially game-changing impact on banking operations.</p> Uzbekistan Green Lights New Legislation to Make VASPs Shell Out Fixed Monthly&nbsp;Fees <a href="https://m.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220527000553">Image Source</a><p>As per the new legislation authored by the National Agency of Perspective Projects (NAPP) under the President of Uzbekistan, crypto firms in Uzbekistan will now have to pay monthly fees to the&nbsp;state.</p><p>For instance, crypto exchanges will be charged the highest tariff of 120 million Uzbekistani soum (worth almost $11,000), while custodial service providers will enjoy the lowest fee at just $135. On the other hand, Crypto stores will pay around $540 per month, individual miners will have to shell out $270 per month, and mining pools will have to pay $2700 per&nbsp;month.</p><p>And any VASPs that fail to comply with this legislation will be penalized, which may range from license suspension to cancelation.</p> US Senators Introduced a Bill to Bring Crypto Companies Under Cybersecurity Framework <p>U.S. senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) have introduced the Cryptocurrency Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act to help crypto companies report cybersecurity threats.</p><p>The bill will provide a voluntary mechanism for crypto companies to report bad actors. It seeks to mitigate losses from crypto-related incidents, including network damage, business interruption, data breaches, and ransomware attacks.</p><p>According to Sen. Blackburn, “some bad actors have used cryptocurrency as a way to hide their illegal practices and avoid accountability.”</p><p>But that is about to change once this bill comes into force, as it “will update existing regulations to address this misuse directly.”</p> Paraguay Lawmakers Reject President’s Veto <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/university-in-paraguay-will-take-tuition-payments-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum/">Image Source</a><p>A total of 33 Paraguayan lawmakers have rejected <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/paraguayan-president-vetoes-virtual-assets-regulation-bill-citing-energy-intensive-nature-of-crypto-mining?utm_campaign=Shyft%20%26%20Veriscope%20News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter">President Mario Abdo Benitez’s veto </a>of a major Bitcoin mining regulation bill.</p><p>Paraguay’s legislature approved the bill in July to create a tax and regulatory framework regulating Bitcoin mining in the South American country. But the president vetoed it, claiming mining uses high amounts of energy but brings relatively small employment benefits.</p><p>According to a release from the country’s Congress, the bill would benefit the Latin American nation by bringing in income through mining taxes, creating “new forms of employment,” and tracking the energy consumption of crypto&nbsp;miners.</p><p>The bill will now be passed to the National Deputy chamber, which will decide to reject or approve the presidential veto. If rejected, the bill will finally be sanctioned.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1575878765363793922?s=20&amp;t=Uwv_evLzaHD-AEmNQ-7Srg">Image Source</a><p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate to the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope.

<p>Da oggi è disponibile il nuovo selfcare InfoCert ID, la pagina personale dedicata a tutti gli utenti SPID InfoCert ID tramite la quale è possibile visualizzare e modificare i dati relativi alla propria Identità Digitale.</p>



<p>Grazie alla nuova interfaccia, moderna, intuitiva e pensata per rendere più semplice anche l’accesso da mobile, gli utenti SPID InfoCert, potranno gestire in tutte le principali funzioni per configurare e modificare le informazioni attinenti la propria identità digitale.</p>



<p>Dal selfcare InfoCert ID è possibile:</p>



  Gestire e modificare i tuoi dati, i documenti di identità e le informazioni di contatto;  Gestire i codici OTP e le modalità di ricezione tramite APP, sms o dispositivo hardware  Consultare la cronologia degli accessi  Sospendere o revocare le proprie credenziali SPID  



<p>Il nuovo selfcare inoltre è già pronto per gestire lo <a href="https://futurodigitale.infocert.it/tecnologie-digitali/spid-identita-digitale/cose-e-come-fare-lo-spid-per-i-minorenni/">SPID minori</a> – disponibile prossimamente – per il quale sarà possibile anche monitorare e gestire all’interno dello stesso pannello di controllo, l’utenza del minorenne o dei minorenni associati alla propria identità digitale.</p>



 Il successo di SPID InfoCert ID 



<p>Nel corso degli ultimi anni sempre più persone hanno attivato la propria identità digitale, sia per usufruire dei servizi online offerti dalle amministrazioni italiane o dai paesi europei che hanno aderito al nodo eIDAS, ma anche per accedere ai servizi delle imprese private che hanno scelto lo SPID come strumento di autenticazione per l’accesso ai propri servizi.</p>



<p>Dalla sua introduzione nel 2015, sono ormai più di <a href="https://avanzamentodigitale.italia.it/it/progetto/spid">32 milioni</a> gli utenti che utilizzano le credenziali SPID, in questo scenario InfoCert si attesta fra i maggiori Service Provider italiani ed europei, vantando un numero elevato di utenti attivi sia che ne facciano un uso da privati cittadini che per le proprie esigenze professionali. Inoltre, a breve sarà anche fra i primi gestori di identità digitale ad erogare lo <a href="https://futurodigitale.infocert.it/tecnologie-digitali/spid-identita-digitale/cose-e-come-fare-lo-spid-per-i-minorenni/">SPID per minorenni</a>, una nuova applicazione del sistema pubblico di identità digitale, la quale dovrebbe essere lanciata entro la fine del 2022.</p>

<p>Behavioral biometrics measures and analyzes unique human traits such as physical movements and patterns while also partaking in certain activities like typing, walking or even how much pressure is used while interacting with technology. Some have termed it a “sister science” to physical biometrics, which measures physical traits like fingerprints. I should know because I began my identity journey writing operating systems for Payflex smartcard readers and developing fingerprint hashing schemes for secure storage and fast recall.<br>
But two decades and some change later, the science of behavioral biometrics has garnered the full attention of the identity management industry. Security vulnerabilities, transaction fraud, forgery, identity theft have left all market sectors scrambling to find a “proper” threat detection solution.</p>
 Why Are Biometrics Important to Authentication? 
<p>Almost all modern cybersecurity frameworks and regulations include, in some form, a call to implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to strengthen identity verification and system access. MFA, as part of a broader <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/identity-management/what-is-iam">Identity and Access Management (IAM) strategy</a>, heightens security around authentication because it requires more from users than just a fragile and stealable password.</p>
<p>MFA schemas will typically require users to provide at least two forms of identification from different categories of authentication:</p>
 
 Knowledge: Something that the user knows or has memorized, such as a password, PIN, or passphrase associated with a question. 
 Ownership: Something that the user owns and should hold possession of. This can include sending a One-Time Password (OTP) to the user’s phone or email address or asking for an OTP from the user’s linked password authentication app. 
 Inherence: Something the user is. This is the category of biometrics of all types. 
 
<p>With the increasing popularity of devices, including biometric scanners (cameras and fingerprint scanners being the most common), biometrics has become a default form of MFA and passwords.</p>
 What Are Behavioral Biometrics? 
<p>Biometrics can short-circuit attempted attacks, mainly phishing hacks, and provide a solid level of security for consumers and enterprises supporting apps and network access for their employees.</p>
<p>Biometrics, as a category, isn’t monolithic. Different types of biometrics refer to different parts of human physiology, addressing their inherent usefulness as an identity verification medium.</p>
<p>The primary categories of biometrics are:</p>
 
 Biological: Traits that are part of human physiology, intractable and usually require some sort of invasive collection method. This can include blood samples and DNA signatures. 
 Morphological: Visible traits that are unique and relatively easy to check for, even if they are somewhat vulnerable to damage. These include facial recognition, fingerprint scans, and iris scans. 
 Behavioral: Patterns of behavior we build over time, often unconsciously, as part of our daily lives. Can include voice patterns, handwriting styles, and gait patterns. 
 
<p>Each of these particular biometrics support authentication to some degree.</p>
<p>Biometrics like DNA signatures are perhaps the most unique and, thus, the most secure, even though they are an extreme way to guarantee security outside the most high-stakes environments.</p>
<p>Morphological traits are the most common forms of biometric authentication, often coupled with <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">biometric passwords</a> for MFA or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a> systems.</p>
<p>Behavioral is a rising conversation in the field. As advances in AI and machine learning fuel accurate interpretations of behaviors beyond what was thought possible, very common traits can be used to analyze a user’s activity and determine authentication and authorization.</p>
 What Are Different Forms of Behavioral Biometrics? 
<p>Throughout the 20th century, experts sought ways to nail down behavioral characteristics that could prove helpful in authentication or identity verification. However, most of these experts never really knew how deep such authentication efforts could go in using esoteric mannerisms as unique markers for individuals.</p>
<p>Some of the more exciting forms of behavioral biometrics used today include:</p>
 Body Movement 
<p>Modern machines have become adept at using physical movements to determine an individual’s identity. Many people aren’t aware that we all have fairly unique shapes and movement patterns across dozens of measurement points. Modern AI can use posture and weight distribution or gait and walking patterns to determine if someone is who they say they are.</p>
 Gesture Recognition 
<p>Researchers have discovered that people often do the smallest things with specific patterns and cadences. Typing on a keyboard, tapping on a screen, moving a mouse cursor, and more all fall under this category.</p>
 Handwriting Recognition 
<p>Unsurprisingly, however, is using handwriting to identify someone. Handwriting experts have been around forever, but handwriting forgers have been around for just as long. An authentication system powered by AI can identify genuine and fake handwriting far beyond the capacity of human investigators.</p>
 User Behavior 
<p>This category may not seem like a biometric. Still, anti-fraud experts have been using browsing and shopping patterns from online consumers to power machine learning algorithms that can pick up on suspicious behavior that could potentially flag theft. While these behaviors are all in the digital world, they are considered biometrics precisely because they are tied to patterns that most don’t even know we display.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Behavioral Biometrics? 
<p>Biometrics are the foundation of modern authentication because they are reliable, secure, and hard to fake. Of course, they aren’t the perfect technology, but they come with several crucial benefits that security experts don’t find elsewhere.</p>
<p>Some benefits of behavioral biometrics include:</p>
 
 Passive Technology: Behavioral biometrics are inherently passive, requiring system observation rather than directed input from the user. Rather than speaking into a microphone or handing over their <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/fingerprint-verification/">fingerprint verification</a> data, users simply do what they do–the more relaxed and normal, the better. 
 Continuous Authentication: Continuous authentication is a relatively new and complex practice, but one with several critical benefits. Rather than rely on a single point of authentication (or several points of authorization), a device can monitor the user and continuously determine whether the same user is present. 
 
<p>This avoids complicated authentication systems while providing liveness testing that prevents, for example, someone else from using a workstation or device without authorization.</p>
 
 Fraud Detection: Behavioral biometrics are critical to massive anti-fraud efforts. Machine learning can help observe shoppers online to see how they engage with a digital storefront, what kind of information they provide, and how they interact with sensitive areas of their accounts. 
 
<p>Furthermore, these anti-fraud efforts are critical for modern chargeback fraud prevention, where people buy items, report stolen cards, and have their bank reverse charges.</p>
 
 Works With Other Biometrics: Because these biometrics are primarily passive, they work rather well with other forms of biometrics. For example, a user may provide <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-iris-biometrics/">iris biometrics</a> to access a sensitive workstation equipped with monitoring tools covering typing behaviors to ensure that no one else takes over if the original, authorized individual walks away. 
 
 Things to Watch out for with Behavioral Biometrics 
<p>First, it is important to note that not all types of behavioral biometrics would be applicable to all use cases. Measuring and iterating on cost of deployment, accuracy and performance, false acceptance and false rejection rates will remain key items to monitor.<br>
Second, not all forms of behavioral biometrics are created equal in their abilities to prevent fraud. Voice biometrics, for example, is relatively easier to spoof and is subject to replay risks. Voice is also subject to enrollment risks when there is background noise to deal with, for example.</p>
 Utilize Biometrics and Advanced Identity Assurance with 1Kosmos 
<p>By using different forms of biometrics, organizations can close security gaps leveraged by hackers, including those associated with passwords or other forms of authentication.</p>
<p>But biometrics isn’t necessarily enough, and many solutions rely too heavily on single biometrics within an MFA approach to protect their data. 1Kosmos relies on advanced biometrics coupled with powerful passwordless protection, a permissionless blockchain identity management system, and NIST-compliant identity proofing and liveness testing capabilities.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can rely on the following features:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/sim-binding-definition/">SIM Binding: </a>The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone. 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-proofing/">Identity Proofing: </a>BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 
<p>Integration: 1Kosmos can ingest behavioral and peripheral risk signals. For example, we have partnered with organizations like Behaviosec and RSA to track user behavior (desktop, mobile and environmental factors). This capability will detect attacks, including session hijacking or credential loss on an access attempt. This combination of technologies improves your overall security posture as you can detect potentially fraudulent activities in real-time and step-up authentication if something out of the band is noted with the most negligible impact on the user.</p>

<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

About Podcast Episode 
<p>A Trust Registry is a solution that lets you know where to reach out to get answers to make your trust decisions.</p>
<p>In any interaction, do I trust things sufficiently enough to accomplish what I want?</p>
<p>For example, how can I:</p>
 
 Trust this Issuer for that Credential? 
 Trust that Verifier? 
 Trust that Wallet App? 
 
 
<p>Some of the key topics covered during this episode with Darrell are:</p>
 
 What are the differences between Verifiable Data Registries and Trust Registries? 
 How can Trust Registries help establish the Authenticity of Data? 
 Does placing too much Governance at the Verifiable Data Registry layer cause scaling issues? 
 Why DNS can become an elegant Root of Trust solution to validate the authenticity of Credential Issuers. 
 Who in the Trust Triangle benefits the most from Trust Registries? 
 Trust Registries vs Machine Readable Governance. 
 About the Trust Registry Specification v1.0 at the TrustOverIP Foundation. 
 How do I trust a Trust Registry? 
 Do Trust Registries create new Centralization points? 
 How will Trust Registries become adopted?

<p>Two signs point to the fact the United States is gearing up to finally take a tougher regulatory stance on data privacy.</p>



 Sign 1: Steady progress on a comprehensive privacy bill 



<p>A new bipartisan bill to rein in Big Tech and give consumers more control over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;is making steady forward progress—certainly, the most progress we’ve seen of any similar bill to date.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/new-bipartisan-federal-data-privacy-bill-in-the-us-but-will-it-pass/">bill</a>,&nbsp;known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/american-data-privacy-and-protection-act-heads-for-us-house-floor/">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a>,&nbsp;has progressed further than any other attempt at a US federal data privacy bill and is looking increasingly likely to pass. As the Institute of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/american-data-privacy-and-protection-act-heads-for-us-house-floor/">reports</a>, “Despite facing a time crunch, a flood of stakeholder feedback and unforeseen Congressional opposition, the proposed American Data Privacy and Protection Act keeps on chugging.”</p>



<p>The bill has now advanced to consideration by the full House. The IAPP says the vote to advance the bill marks the first time a comprehensive privacy bill will go to a full chamber vote in either the House or the Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bill represents a compromise on both sides, with Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., Chair of the Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce, which proposed the bill, saying, “I know almost everyone can probably find something that they wished were different in the bill. On the other hand, I do think we have a band-aid for the American people who are just fed up with the lack of privacy online.”&nbsp;</p>



 Sign 2: The FTC is gearing up for a major ruling on data privacy 



<p>While many agree a federal data privacy law is the end goal and the best outcome, the FTC is meanwhile flagging its serious commitment to “commercial surveillance and data security rulemaking” by releasing a list of questions for lawmakers, privacy advocates, and ordinary citizens. Read the list of questions&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/commercial-surveillance-data-security-rulemaking">here</a>.</p>



<p>Until now the FTC has ruled on data privacy case by case but, as the release of the questions shows, it’s preparing to address the issue more comprehensively in future and is seeking public input.</p>



<p>In releasing the rulemaking questions to tighten the US regulatory environment, FTC Chair Lina Khan&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/11/ftc-sets-the-wheels-in-motion-for-a-major-data-privacy-ruling/">explained</a>&nbsp;the threat of a lack of data privacy:&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>“The data practices of today’s surveillance economy can create and exacerbate deep asymmetries of information — exacerbating, in turn, imbalances of power. And the expanding contexts in which users’ personal data is used — from health care and housing to employment and education — mean that what’s at stake with unlawful collection, use, retention, or disclosure is not just one’s subjective preference for privacy, but one’s access to opportunities in our economy and society, as well as core civil liberties and civil rights.”</p>



<p>FTC Commissioner Slaughter&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/11/ftc-sets-the-wheels-in-motion-for-a-major-data-privacy-ruling/">adds to the reasoning</a>&nbsp;for the rules: “The best time to initiate this lengthy process was years ago, but the second-best time is now. Effective nationwide rules governing the collection and use of data are long overdue. As the nation’s principal consumer-protection agency, we have a responsibility to act.”</p>



<p>We like how&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/11/ftc-sets-the-wheels-in-motion-for-a-major-data-privacy-ruling/">Tech Crunch</a>&nbsp;sums up the situation we’re now in: “The rules being mulled by the FTC may well end up being complementary or even superfluous to federal law, but that is only if by some miracle Congress can pass another major piece of legislation. But if this ends up being the case, consumers will simply be twice as safe.”</p>



<p>“What happens next is a lot of waiting and submitting of documents; the FTC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rulemaking/public-participation-rulemaking-process">put together a FAQ on the rulemaking process here</a>, and on September 8 the agency will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events/2022/09/commercial-surveillance-data-security-anpr-public-forum">host a virtual public forum</a>&nbsp;to discuss the proposal.”</p>



<p>We’ll keep following this story.</p>

<p>Looking to implement zero trust in your organization but don’t know where to start? Keep reading to find the best way to get a zero-trust model up and running.</p>
<p>What is zero trust? Zero trust is a security strategy that requires continual authentication through every step of access in that no user is given implicit trust.</p>
 What Is Zero-Trust Architecture? 
<p>Zero-trust architecture is an approach to security that presupposes that no user, resource, or application is considered inherently trusted by the system. In an age of seamless app integration and simplified user experiences through shared resources, zero trust attempts to close the security gaps introduced by such approaches.</p>
 Why Zero Trust is Important 
<p>This approach is critical when we consider that modern computing is essentially cloud computing–that is, most agencies, enterprises, and end users are engaging in some way with shared cloud-hosted computing resources. This has led to several notorious security issues over the past 5-10 years, and in industries where security is paramount (industrial industries, government services, etc.), those issues must be avoided.<br>
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">Special Publication 800-207</a>, “Zero Trust Architecture,” to address this specific issue. This special publication lists seven core tenets of an accurate zero-trust system:</p>
 
 All data and services are resources. Any component of a digital system, from apps to data and network connections, is considered a resource that can be exploited, corrupted, or stolen. As such, they must all fall under the designation of a resource for security purposes. 
 All communication is secured. All network communications must be secured through perimeter security and encryption, whether external or internal to the organization. 
 Access is on a per-session basis. Access is only granted per resource, with the least privileges needed to complete a given task. 
 Access policies should be dynamic. Policies around user or app access should be determined by the evolving contexts of the system, including time and date, location, versions of applications, client or user identity, behavioral biometrics, and more. 
 Ongoing monitoring should measure the integrity of security. An organization must continually monitor resources to ensure they have not been compromised. No resource is inherently considered trustworthy to avoid threats from APTs and advanced attacks. 
 Authentication and authorization are strictly enforced. An enterprise must use ongoing <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a> and authorization, Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to determine<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/zero-trust-identity/"> identity</a> and re-authenticate and reauthorize users based on ZTA policy. 
 Data gathering and improvements are ongoing projects. The organization must maintain continuous monitoring and data gathering to fuel ongoing improvements to security measures implemented. 
 
<p>With these core principles in mind, several models of zero trust are in use:</p>
 
 Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA): The most common form of zero trust, ZTNA includes perimeter-based security, perimeter authentication and authorization, segmentation of network resources, and secure access from external networks. This does not, however, impact application use or other select areas of security. 
 Zero Trust Application Access (ZTAA): Using zero trust principles, ZTAA assumes that all apps and resources are inherently untrusted and blocks access to and from these resources until proper authentication is provided. 
 Zero Trust Access (ZTA): ZTA combines ZTNA and ZTAA to protect networks and application access points. This is generally considered “end-to-end” zero trust and is the most comprehensive, but can require a fundamental adjustment in how your organization thinks about its IT infrastructure. 
 
 How to Implement Zero-Trust Principles 
<p>One of the most challenging components of a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/zero-trust-security-framework/">zero-trust security framework</a> is its implementation. Such implementation requires that all appropriate systems and networks fall under such principles, a deep, complicated, and thorough standard to meet.</p>
<p>However, there are specific things that your team can do to start implementing such an architecture:</p>
 
 Understand All Attack Surfaces: While this might seem common sense in the world of compliance, it states that pursuing zero-trust architecture means understanding all the potential attack surfaces you maintain. Namely, all resources, network connections, APIs, applications, etc. 
 Implement Ongoing Logging and Monitoring: Ongoing monitoring and audit logging is necessary, not an option. Not only is this practice critical for ensuring that resources are trustworthy (a key and continuous process in zero-trust systems), but it also informs the equally necessary practice of maintaining secure, upgraded, and optimized infrastructure. 
 Implement Strong Encryption for Internal Communications: All communications, from apps to internal and external network communications, must be protected. This means shrinking perimeter guards closer to the resources they protect and encrypt any and all data that moves through protected networks. 
 Use Strict Multi-Factor Authentication and Access Management Controls: Authentication must be strong enough to ensure a user is who they are, which by default means MFA is equipped with something like advanced biometrics or secure delivery of OTPs. 
 
<p>This also means implementing strict least-privilege access controls based on a dynamic set of features, namely role, system and hardware state, software state, and user behavior.</p>
 
 Update All Devices and Applications: All devices must be safely and regularly updated to meet minimum security requirements. More specifically, this means ensuring that security patches are deployed and implemented as soon as possible. 
 Have Strict Governance Policies in Place: Zero trust is not an ad hoc process. Your organization must have clear, documented, and distributed data and IT governance policies that align with zero trust issues. This includes defining a hierarchy of roles, accountability, and responsibilities for all affected positions. 
 
 What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Zero Trust? 
<p>Like any other technology or security approach, zero trust comes with several challenges and benefits that impact how it is used. Each organization may run into unique challenges and benefits, but there are some broad considerations to consider.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of zero trust include:</p>
 
 Security: Approaching IT with zero trust principles is remarkably secure. They do not allow trusted access to resources and require incessant authorization before such access is granted. Likewise, it’s an approach to trust for internal resources that drives users always to ensure that their IT infrastructure isn’t compromised. 
 Compliance: With the release of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order on Cybersecurity</a>, government and infrastructural cybersecurity are quickly undergoing an overhaul of security guidelines–namely, that they all meet zero trust principles. If you’re working with these industries or adjacent industries, zero trust is a genuine concern that you’ll want to meet. 
 Trust: Approaching security via zero trust means that anyone accessing resources is who they say they are once you’ve laid out the proper security and monitoring procedures. 
 
<p>Likewise, there are several challenges to implementing zero-trust architectures:</p>
 
 Complexity: Zero trust is complicated and can touch on every interlocked system in your IT infrastructure. If you’re looking at full ZTA implementation, it could require a complete revision of how you approach IT adoption, organization, and security. 
 Cost: As you approach such a massive overhaul, costs in time and money grow. Once some of the components are in place, there is a leveling off, but the onboarding and maintenance cost is still significant. 
 Flexibility: Zero trust is strict and doesn’t broach any breaks in the trust cycle for scalability or usability. If you want a more streamlined app that doesn’t fit into ZTA, then you simply aren’t using that app and staying in line with its principles.

<p>How digital identity can improve the passenger journey.</p>



 The potential of digital identity wallets in the air travel industry. 



<p>Summer is over and so is the annual travel rush. Every summer, millions of people worldwide hit the airport in searching for sunny beaches and vacation fun. However, travelling during peak season can often be frustrating for passengers. The aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic is still present and impacts the passenger experience from curb to gate, as long lines, missed flights, and lost luggage remain too common. This brings the question; how can we make the travel experience a little less painful?</p>



 The potential of digital identity wallets in the air travel industry. 



<p>Now imagine a world where you can simply breeze through security checkpoints and skip the long and tiresome lines at the airport. Through digital identity wallets, this future is about to become a reality. Whether you are a frequent passenger travelling for business, or a tourist seeking leisure holiday, this revolutionizing technology can smoothen your travel journey and your passenger experience.</p>



 What is the concept of digital identity, and why is it important? 



<p>Until now, we relied on physical id document such as ID cards <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driving licenses to identify</a> ourselves in the real world as well as online. Digital attributes and credentials were solely used online. Digital identity wallets, like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">IDnow Wallet</a>, are about to change that, as they are simultaneously addressing our digital and real-world requirements by bringing physical and digital credentials together.</p>



<p>Digital identity wallets enable you to verify, store, and most importantly reuse verified identity information from your smartphone, in a convenient, secure and legally recognized way. Your sensitive personal information is securely stored and encrypted on your phone and can only be accessed by yourself. Keep control of your data by choosing which information you want to share, with whom and when.</p>



 eiDAS 2.0. and the European digital identity framework. 



<p>With <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS 2.0</a>, the second version of the central European regulation for electronic Identification, authentication and trust Services, the European Commission has introduced a new European digital identity framework. The objective is to create an interoperable ecosystem of digital identity wallets and enable EU citizens to use their digital identity to access public and private services across the EU. eIDAS 2.0 and the underlying trust framework is the foundation for the legal recognition of digital identity wallets, such as the IDnow Wallet, in the EU and beyond.</p>



 What information can you store in your digital identity wallet? 



<p>Digital identity wallets allow you to store anything from your government issued ID card and driver’s license, over biometric information as well as additional attributes, such as a frequent flyer membership card.</p>



<p>After a document or other credential has been verified and stored, the wallet empowers you to reuse the verified identity and share only the necessary information with the relying parties. The IDnow Wallet allows you to reuse the personal data of your identity in multiple scenarios. Use your verified identity to rent a car today or for your hotel check-in tomorrow.</p>



 The potential of digital identity wallets in the air travel industry. 



<p>Think about your own travel journey and the number of times you have to identify yourself: from booking flights, dropping off luggage at the airport, passing security, a small stop at the duty-free store, boarding the plane, to finally sitting at your seat and enjoying some in-flight services, and the list goes on when you land at your destination. Therefore, the air travel industry in particular offers a great potential for leveraging digital identity wallets.</p>



<p>Air travel use cases for digital identity to improve the passenger experience.</p>



<p>As digital identity wallets become more prevalent, the air travel industry has the opportunity to leverage this technology to improve the passenger journey. Below, we outline use cases for digital ID within the travel experience.</p>







  Online Flight Booking<br>When booking a flight online, identify yourself in one click using your identity wallet to automatically fill out required forms and anticipate the joy of a laid-back holiday.<br>  Airport Check-In<br>Using your digital identity wallet will keep your check-in process short and sweet. Save yourself some time by avoiding coming hours prior to departure, or equally enjoy that time at your favorite airport lounge.<br>  Baggage Drop-Off<br>Experience a fast and contactless luggage drop off, as a simple biometric facial recognition can link your baggage receipt to the personal data on your ID and your boarding pass, all of which will be safely stored in your digital identity wallet.<br>  Security Checkpoints &amp; Border Gates<br>Skip the queue and avoid clogged border gates, as the digital identity wallets allows you to breeze through security checkpoints. No more rummaging through your luggage for your passport, just look into the camera to verify your identity and smile as you pass through.<br>  Boarding<br>Once checked in, your digital identity wallet stores your boarding pass as well as your ID credentials. After a simple biometric check, you can cross the gate and reach your seat in all serenity.<br>  In-Flight Services<br>Customize your in-cabin experience during long-haul flights, by indicating your entertainment and dietary preferences to start your holiday relaxation a little earlier than expected.  



 How digital ID can benefit businesses in the travel industry. 



<p>Consequently, there is no doubt that digital ID enhances the passenger’s journey by making it faster and more convenient. Furthermore, digital identity wallets represent a win-win situation for both passengers and carriers. In fact, they enable a higher efficiency though their seamless touchpoints, which not only increases customer satisfaction but also benefiting airlines and airports as less ground personnel are required to process travelers.</p>

 IDnow delivers identity verification and authentication for Adobe Acrobat Sign Digital Identity Gateway&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, September 29, 2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>,&nbsp;a leading identity proofing platform provider in Europe, announces a global collaboration with Adobe Document Cloud, the world’s leading PDF and e-signature tools solution, to make identify verification for validated signatures simpler and more secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Legally compliant signing with a qualified electronic signature (QES) requires users to identify themselves before signing a document. But even for an advanced electronic signature (AES), it can be beneficial to have upstream identification and authentication of the signing party. <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/09/28/adobe-acrobat-sign-raises-bar-trusted-digital-agreements-digital-identity-gateway">Adobe Acrobat Sign Digital Identity Gateway</a>&nbsp;allows organizations to select from a wide variety of&nbsp;<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/uk/document-cloud/digital-identity/dig-csc-idps.html">pre-configured third-party digital identity providers (IDP)</a>&nbsp;and leverage the type of identity verification that best suits their functional, security, or compliance needs. IDP services for user authentication, signer identity verification, and identity federation solutions utilize the standard&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a>&nbsp;authentication protocol to integrate with Acrobat Sign.&nbsp;IDnow is now an Adobe Acrobat Sign Digital Identity Gateway provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity&nbsp;verification&nbsp;via IDnow AutoIdent or VideoIdent for electronic signatures&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Digital Identity gateway, Acrobat Sign users automatically receive notification when a particular type of identity verification is required to access and sign the document. After the user consents, the identification process is passed on to the IdP service. Once the identity check has been successfully completed, the user can access the document and then sign it electronically with their verified identity in a secure and legally compliant manner.</p>



<p>The IDnow integration will enable Adobe Acrobat Sign users to verify their identity using either IDnow AutoIdent or VideoIdent to create legally binding e-signatures as soon as the solution launches. The new authentication capabilities will also be available to customers using Acrobat Sign through native integrations on platforms such as Workday, Salesforce, Microsoft, or Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to IDnow VideoIdent and AutoIdent, Adobe Acrobat Sign users can authenticate via the IDnow Wallet in the future. Users who already have a verified identity stored in their IDnow Wallet will thus be able to skip the identity verification process.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to support Adobe with their new Digital Identity Gateway and to be part of a solution that provides users with a secure and straightforward signature process. In the future, not only Adobe customers will benefit from the cooperation between the two companies&nbsp;–&nbsp;our customers will also be able to use their familiar IDnow solutions via the Acrobat Sign platform. In the future, we plan to intensify the cooperation and expand it in further use cases,” says Johannes Leser, Vice President Trust Services at IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Secure and user-friendly electronic signatures, and thus secure authentication and identity verification of the signing party, are becoming increasingly important in the digital world. This is true worldwide and for all industries. We are therefore pleased to have IDnow as a reliable partner for identity verification through our Digital Identity Gateway,” adds Andrea Valle, Product Management Lead Adobe Acrobat Sign.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">NB Orbit Enterprise Platform</a> contains a collection of technologies and concepts in identity management, distributed and edge computing, distributed ledger technologies and cryptography. These have all been put together following the principles of Privacy, Security and Interoperability.</p>
<p>One of the things that organizations can do through NB Orbit Enterprise Platform is to create schema definitions with attributes. These attributes can be restricted by the data formats they must comply with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until now, we were supporting multiple formats such as Text, Number and Date, as shown below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recently, we’ve added the support for Images as Attributes.</p>
 
 We will demonstrate how the platform allows an image as an attribute in the schema definition process.&nbsp; 
 We will demonstrate the issuance of a verifiable credential that includes an image as an attribute. 
 We will demonstrate how image attributes can be provided as proofs.&nbsp; 
 
 
  
 
<p><br>
How is this done through Aries? To pass images as attributes, we specify the MIME TYPE as JPEG and the value contains a base64url-encoded string that represents a binary BLOB of the image. <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2/README.md">RFC 0453</a> (Issue Credential v2), <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">RFC&nbsp; 0037</a> (Present Proof) and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0454-present-proof-v2/README.md">RFC 0454</a> (Present Proof v2) all support the mime-type and value as a base64url-encoded string.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 28 September, 2022 –&nbsp;Leading digital identity proofing platform provider, IDnow, has announced a UAE collaboration with UBIRCH,&nbsp;a leading German trust platform provider&nbsp;with regional headquarters in Dubai. For the launch of one of the world’s first KYCT (know-your-customer token) solutions, UBIRCH partners with IDnow. The solution proves the identity and ownership of crypto wallet holders and origin of minted assets, such as NFTs (non-fungible tokens).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UAE has one of the highest rates of NFT ownership in the world, with 23 percent of the population owning at least one, which is around double the global average*. Many of the early crypto exchanges did not require a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC check,</a>&nbsp;which has led to a lack of trust in NFTs and a gap between the creator (maker) of an NFT and the buyer. Combined with identity theft, challenges with proving ownership and origins of an asset in a legally binding contract and ensuring digital art can be protected are current market barriers that must be overcome. At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry is rapidly changing and so are the regulation requirements. Therefore, the leading companies in crypto trading worldwide now enforce strong KYC policies, in order to comply with AML and KYC regulations.</p>



<p>Karim Attia, CEO of UBIRCH said,&nbsp;“The UAE is one of the leading countries for adoption of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. To support the popularity and growth of digital assets, our partnership with IDnow will enable us to create the most secure and trusted process for verifying identity and proof of origin, yet. Ultimately, this technology is essential to protect individuals, businesses, brands, creators and the entire financial ecosystem in a decentralized environment.”</p>



<p>Benjamin Haas, Senior Director EMEA of IDnow group said, “Bringing an additional identity layer to digital assets adds trust and credibility to the entire Web3 including crypto exchanges, NFTs and other financial offerings. Secure verification proves the identity of the creator and provides authenticity to the ownership of NFTs. It helps to close the gap between the NFT creator and the buyer, while reassuring the buyer that what they are purchasing is genuine.”</p>



<p>The KYCT technology (<a href="https://www.kyct.xyz/">kyct.xyz</a>) addresses some of the challenges of the crypto and NFT community in ensuring that identity – both digital and legal – and proof of origin are accurate. The two companies join forces through UBIRCH’s trusted backend for proving that an asset belongs to a creator and was anchored at a specific time, and IDnow’s leading identity proofing platform that confirms the customer’s legal identity with the help of an official identification document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While NFTs have been popularized through digital art, the technology can also be applied across a range of sectors, such as the tokenization of digital health records, as digital access-passes and tickets for events, or any occurrence where a tokenized model can be applied to acting parties and digital assets.</p>



<p>UBIRCH was founded in Germany in 2014 and has since expanded its global presence to the UAE, with offices in Dubai and Tel Aviv, Israel. As cybersecurity expert, UBIRCH brings advanced technology that propels digital transformation. UBIRCH is driven by a team of professionals who believe data-driven processes will provide many cross-industry exciting businesses, such as in the manufacturing industry, smart cities, insurance, healthcare, energy supply or logistics segments. UBIRCH is renowned through the contract awarded by the German Ministry of Health to develop, together with a consortium, the digital COVID certificate for the EU for Germany, based on UBIRCH technology.</p>

  Compromised credentials are a top cyber-attack method. Identity-based attacks are on the rise, it is therefore vital that businesses can detect the misuse of enterprise identities to block attackers from getting unfettered insider access to IT systems and data. But that can be challenging in today’s distributed, hybrid, and multi-cloud business IT environment.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Come to meet us in person. Ubisecure are attending Security Leadership Belgium on October the 5th and 6th in Brussels. Come and meet us to find out how Ubisecure can help with your business challenges in cyber security and CIAM. To find out more, take a look at the Ubisecure events page, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/events/" title="<em>www.ubisecure.com/events</em>">www.ubisecure.com/events</a>. See you in Brussels.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Thank you for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. I was thinking, personally, I have been using for accessing many online services, I use many authentication methods, identification services that we have been discussing in this podcast, three years. But one that I have not used is a smart cards. For instance, even though hereby being a citizen of Finland, I have one, but I have not used it before. So that’s one of the things we’re going to discuss today, how to use a smart card for identification. And also, what are the other identification services in Europe and especially from Sweden that is from where our guest today is coming.</p>
<p>Our guest today is Roberth Lundin. He is a Senior Security Consultant at Knowit. For the last years, he has been working with Bankgirot as an IT Security Specialist in which one of his most important duties is to coordinate all security audits using risk-based approach. He also works with SOC SCM systems, Identity Governance and Administration, IGA among all the roles in his vast experience he has seen and contributed to the evolution of eIDs in Sweden, including smart cards.</p>
<p>Hello, Roberth.</p>
<p>Roberth Lundin: Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, Roberth. So, let’s talk about data identity. But first of course, we want to hear a bit more about yourself. So please, you can tell us, yeah, your journey to this world of the that identity.</p>
<p>Roberth: I started in 1989 at a company named Bull. The first project I got was to finish a secure login and file transfer tool for UNIX, which use smart cards, high security smart cards, actually. Then I have been working for the next 20 years at Bull, Integris, Steria with personalisation systems for smart cards, issue system for electronic IDs and so on.</p>
<p>2009, I started work at Cybercom, which is now named Knowit. 2014, I started the first signing service using DIGGs framework, which I still work with part-time and been working for since 2015 to 2018 with electronic medical certificate and signing of them as a security specialist. And then for 2019, I worked at Bankgirot to secure their operations. That’s my background basically, very shortly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. We’re going to talk about smart cards and also the eIDs in Sweden and Europe. But first, I know something interesting is to think of in a broader aspect all the authentication methods and ways of verifying identities. So how can we trust one digital identity among all of the available ones?</p>
<p>Roberth: That’s a very good question. The Europe, basically, the authorities in Europe and everybody else is divided it into four levels. First level, it’s basically Facebook or something like, it’s an ID and password, and you have no control of your background, you basically check your email. Level two, you need to supply some kind of official registry, for example, in Sweden is the Tax Department’s register for example.</p>
<p>Level three is the level which the authority use in Sweden. And here you have one – added one feature. That’s when you get them digitally, you need to have a check with a physical ID card that you are the correct person in some way. And level four, which is basically only smart cards. This is the high security. And there you have also you need both at applying and picking up your electronic identity, you need to do physical ID check. For example, in Sweden, the Tax Department’s smart card you can buy. It’s both an ID card and an electronic ID card.</p>
<p>So basically, you need to put your digital identities in these four categories and base your trust on that. So, if you want to really secure, you will take level three and level four. So, Facebook, can you trust it? No, mm-mm. No. You have to be very careful because somebody can spoof the system very easily.</p>
<p>Oscar: Interesting to see that smart cards is at the top. Of course, you said at the top, the level three and four are the ones that are mostly recommended to be used. And I was thinking why smart card sit at the very top. It might be because of how the identity is stored. What can you say about that, so when trusting a digital identity secure in that storage?</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, that’s the difficult part because I have been working with, I mean, for 33 years now, basically how to store your keys, which you use for your electronic identity. Because machines, for example, where do we store the key which use the certificate, for example, is a web service certificate, it’s usually in the file system. It’s not very safely stored. And then you need to protect the whole system very, very hard. And that can be very tricky if you’re not very good at it.</p>
<p>But if you take a smart card, for example, well, you can’t copy a smart card. That’s very important. A phone, for example, you can make a copy of it, of a mobile phone. Most of them you can actually also break into if you’re very, very skilled, and have a lot of resources. And to smart card, you can’t, because its costs are enormous. It’s theoretically possible. Nobody has done it but if you have a very, very, very specialised equipment, which costs a lot of money, and there is not that many of them in the world, it’s theoretically, you can break one smart card. Is it cost effective? No, it’s not.</p>
<p>Basically, smartcards is the safest way can do it. Phones, it’s ­– as long as you have control over your phone, or don’t install a lot of apps on it, it should be OK. But same for a computer. And that means you need to don’t click on links, and so on. Make sure you have your antivirus and so on. You have a reasonably safe, so you can protect your keys, which is important for your electronic identities.</p>
<p>Take for example, I have the bank ID both mobile and card for Handelsbanken, which one is most safe of these two? Of course, the card. And certain operations in Handelsbanken, you can only do it by card and not by mobile phone. Interesting fact.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I was not aware of that, actually. Yeah. Somehow it surprises me because smart cards are not on our – many people’s minds. So yeah, as you said, it’s the most secure of all of them. So, what makes it more secure than a mobile phone or any other device?</p>
<p>Roberth: It’s because it’s one chip. What they have done is from the beginning, they put everything on one chip. So, in the chip, you have CPU, ROM, RAM, you have a communication channel, and you have security systems on it. That means if you want to break into it, you need basically, you need to go inside the chip. And that’s very difficult. Your smart card you have in your pocket, in your wallet, normally. These two facts is why it’s safe.</p>
<p>If you take your mobile phone, it’s stored in a special area in operating system on the phone. That’s not as safe because it’s possible break into these areas in the phone, by having the right privileges in the system. And another fact is that take for example, a smart card. The smart card takes – I talked with a guy who did the software for the electronic identity application on the smart card, and they spent 18 man-years just in validating it’s safe, 18 man-years, certify that this software is safe. You don’t do that with a phone software, because the same software is used for national identity cards. And they must be safe because the state is issuing them, they want them to be safe.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, quite impressing indeed. Yeah, focusing first of all in Sweden, what are the other identification services available in Sweden right now?</p>
<p>Roberth: It’s a difficult question to answer because every authority needs to procure an identification services from suppliers like Knowit, CGI and so on, which they use as – to help them to log on to their web pages. So, all authorities, all the local municipalities, for examples have these a log on services. So, for example, I used Ellevio, EON and Fastum for examples to pay my bills and was using the same identification services together with mobile bank ID.</p>
<p>So, you don’t you don’t see these services because you go to the web page and say, “I want to use my mobile bank ID,” for example. And here, you have to have a services which is invisible, basically, which helps you log on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. But if we will narrow down to the methods, these are like bank ID, smart cards, so what on others are available in Sweden?</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah. I mean, if you think for as a private persons, you have the biggest is mobile bank ID, Freja eID Plus is contender, you had the Telia for a number of years, which is not very large. If you look at the health care for example, you have the SITHS&nbsp;card, which has 700,000 or 800,000 users, the same the authorities has their own card which you can use to log on to the PC, for example. So, there are a lot of this going on.</p>
<p>Oscar: What most of the users, I mean for the majority of people, what are the main eID for the people should be using?</p>
<p>Roberth: If you’re looking at look at it from my perspective, mobile bank ID has – its dominating, totally. I mean, it has 90 something basically, that everybody else is so small in comparison, I hope the Freja can be a contender. But they need to step up basically. In Sweden, everybody’s using mobile bank ID. And if they don’t using it, well, they will not get as good services from authorities or private companies.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so its methods are requirements for many services, right, to government, and also from some private services.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Tell us now more about smart cards. So how it started and why they are smart cards? I mean they are not only for identity, correct?</p>
<p>Roberth: I started to work with smart cards in 1989. And the first smart cards which were made was made in 1982. And they basically function the same way. Yes, it have upgraded the storage on it, instead of EEPROM, which you can only write once. You have EEROM, you can rewrite at certain memory cells. And you have standardised the cards very, very hard.</p>
<p>So, the standard ISO, standard 7816, 7816, it’s very, very good standard. I mean, it’s a very old standard, basically. And every national ID card you see is using it for example, SITHS&nbsp;card for the health care is using it and the bank ID on card is using it. It’s the same specification in the chip and how it’s handled. So, I have been using for 33 years already.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, quite long. And yeah, you said that the first of these smart cards started in 1982. Yeah, it’s like 40 years already. Yeah.&nbsp; It doesn’t feel, I don’t know, in Finland it’s not very popular. I don’t know if it’s more successful in other countries.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, that has been a problem, because that’s why everybody’s still mobile bank ID type of applications because everybody has a phone. But smart cards you need a card reader. And a couple of years ago, a lot of the PCs had card readers implemented, but nowadays, started removing them, which I think is bad. Because smartcards is a European thing. And the manufacturers is not European basically.</p>
<p>But in Europe, definitely, smart card is here now, it’s going to be something for the future. Because if you look at it, if you want the highest security, you’re going to use a smart card. So certain EU services, you need to have a smart card already today. Or else you can’t use the services.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So, you said that the laptops most recent they are stopping shipping laptops with a with a reader, integrated reader.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, because it has been a trend to remove all the ports on these – in mobile PC.</p>
<p>Oscar: Not only the smart card, yes.</p>
<p>Roberth: No, it’s everything, basically. So, you can be lucky if you have one or two USB ports.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. It’s very rare. Now it’s typically it’s one I think in many laptops today.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, and that’s a problem because then you need an accessory instead. I think is very bad idea.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, but they’re still I mean, if you – you can still today find a laptop that comes with a smart card reader.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, you can do that. Because in Sweden and the rest of Europe, a lot of authorities require it. They don’t buy them else. So, they need some models will have them.</p>
<p>Oscar: I think it’s super clear now that you mentioned the security aspect is what makes a smart card good reason to stay and to take it seriously. Anything else related to smart cards that you can tell us?</p>
<p>Roberth: As I say, in Europe, because you want to have a safe identification methods. I know the Germans for example, say liked the idea of using a smart card to sign the documents you are sending to the authorities, because a smart card with level four trust level, it’s very, very, very hard to fake it. And you have documents – you can see who signed it, you can’t deny it that you signed it, because you’ll have – at the same time where you get to smart card, you have the duty to report it if you lose it. If you have not lose it, you haven’t, then you can’t deny it, it was you who did it.</p>
<p>Then it’s going – I mean you still have a person which stands there – I don’t know the English word for it Målvakt&nbsp;(Goalkeeper) in Swedish. It’s basically, nobody, which takes all the blame. You need to show that you own the company. And then you can’t put somebody dummy in between yourself. It’s very difficult when you have – must personally sign the documents, or else you get the traceability which is very, very difficult to break.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. In that perspective actually, if you just think of your own ID even if it’s not a smart card, so an ID is something that you would not leave it behind, right? You know where it is. And as you said, if you lose that one, you would report it, get a new one. So, with a bigger reason smart card.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, I mean, take for example, if you lose your electronic identities, you’re really, really handicapped in today’s society. So, it’s very important that you protect your electronic identities. Because if you lose them, you’re in a mess.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, you get – what kind of called excluded or disconnected or, yeah, from many services. That’s correct. Tell us what is now the scenario, the landscape of the digital identities in Europe being broadly, so what’s going on today in Europe regarding this?</p>
<p>Roberth: It’s a very mixed bag to start with. But you can say one thing, every country in Europe has some kind of national identities in some way, everyone, because you can’t live without them, you need to have them. The development pace of different countries is very different. Some is very advanced, some are not.</p>
<p>The difficult part here is not actually digital identity. I started – I worked for the Belgium authorities with the BelPIC, which is the Belgium national ID card. This was in – around 20 years ago. It was not the problem to issue the cards because at that time, they had issued 5 or 6 million cards. It’s to have services that used them. And most countries in Europe has problem.</p>
<p>Sweden is a country which has a very, very good number of applications use national ID or similar schemes. Take for example, I spent 10 years to standardise a citizen card in Europe, at the European National Institute for Standards, CEN. It’s actually the standard we use for national ID cards today, the technical standard, because we failed in one aspect, and that was get one card for all countries in Europe because every state wants to control their own identities. We’ve never managed to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>The technical standard is pretty decent, I think, because every national ID, if you take the Swedish national ID Card from the police, it looks the same as other countries in Europe. But one card for every country in Europe? No, is not going to happen. If not EU managed to get major – a decision on all countries to follow the same card which is not going to happen. Too many countries, too many wills. Take for example the Polish, they absolutely refuse to leave control over their own identities from Poland to somebody else in Europe.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds difficult as you said, 20 something countries here, it’s difficult to get that consensus.</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, it’s not there. It’s the pain of not having – I mean, today, we’re talking about being able to use it. And pain for having different systems is not big enough, basically. There must be a problem first.</p>
<p>Oscar: And which other – besides the smart cards, what do you think would be a good solution for Europe?</p>
<p>Roberth: Basically, what the eIDAS regulation from EU actually requires Swedish authorities, for example, to have a page where you have a foreign card, I mean a card from Belgium or Estonia or other countries, which can log on to the Swedish page. So the Swedish authorities are required to have this page, which you can log on with the other country’s identities, but they’re not required to have any services behind at the moment, probably come in the next level of eIDAS regulation.</p>
<p>So, EU is starting to move in the direction of safe electronic identities for all countries. Take, for example, Sweden has been, well, sitting here and doing integration with all authorities and so on – getting service, but we have not looked what the rest of Europe is doing. So, Belgium and Estonia, especially has, well, has services which don’t have in Sweden. And we have a giant problem in Sweden, because in rest of Europe, they talk about qualified certificates. That means the issuer has a legal right if you have malfunction electronic ID or something like the issuing party doesn’t fulfil their expectations, there is a legal requirement for them to pay the third party.</p>
<p>For example, you and I make a transaction, and a third party, for example, my mother and because this transaction was faulty, because of the electronic identities used, and my mother is suffering from it, she has the legal rights to have compensation. This is the basic of qualified certificates. Plus, you have qualified – the standards for it is higher than the current in Sweden. And Sweden has not taken on the qualifying certificates, which the rest of Europe is a basic level, basically. So, we have in Sweden a challenge, we could say.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, in terms of signatures. And which countries you feel that are leading the development of these eIDs in Europe?</p>
<p>Roberth: Yeah, I mean, both Belgium and Estonia has, for example, electronic identities on smart cards for population. And Sweden, well, we have a mobile bank ID but it’s banks. The national ID card we have, yeah, it’s an ID card, but you don’t have any certificates on it. So, you can’t use it on an electronic ID. I don’t know what police is doing, but – or the government.</p>
<p>But then you have to use this Tax Department’s card, which is approximately the same as a national ID except you don’t get the guarantee that which country you come from which you get from the national ID card. Basically, or else they are the same card, basically, because early versions of the national ID card have the chip. So, it’s very easy to put the chip on it. But for some reason police doesn’t want to do that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, interesting to know those details. Of course, as you said, every country is making progress by different speeds, different – yeah, making different decisions, of course. Yeah, thank you for shedding light on the eIDs across Europe. So, I would like to ask you one final question, Roberth. For all business leaders, listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Roberth: They need a strategy for electronic ID. And they need to stop using ID and passwords. You need to have some kind of handling on how you will use your electronic: that means how you identify the users, how you provision the electronic IDs, and what trust level you need to have on your electronic IDs.</p>
<p>Take for example very, very many companies in Sweden use AD from Microsoft, Active Directory from Microsoft. What they require is MFA or two-factors application basically, they need some kind of extra, you can get that for example as well. So, they’re moving in the right direction, but they haven’t really started to ask themselves basic handling of the electronic ID. And they definitely need this strategy because all these internet activities, cyber warfare and all these internet trolls, but especially the state-sponsored hacking groups, it’s not going to get better, it’s going to get worse. So, the ones who don’t have a strategy and know what they’re doing is going to be harshly punished. That’s my message, basically.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I agree. Well, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, again, Roberth. Super interesting conversation and giving a lot of details on the smart cards that we haven’t discussed before in this podcast, super secure, super interesting and sounds that it’s going to be with us for a long time still securing our identifications.</p>
<p>Roberth, please, if some people would like to follow you or get in touch with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Roberth: You can use my email address for now it’s Roberth.Lundin@Knowit.se. It’s probably the best way of getting in touch with me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot again, Roberth, and all the best.</p>

  <p>In the face of increasing cyber-attacks by cybercriminals and nation-states, most organizations are investing in filling in the gaps in their cyber defenses, but as the landmark SolarWinds supply chain breach showed, securing Microsoft Active Directory (AD) is vital, but often overlooked.&nbsp;Join Microsoft identity experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and Semperis as they discuss the critical role of AD and Azure AD in security. Learn why these environments are a common target for attackers, the types of security risks that are often exploited, the challenges to securing a hybrid AD environment, and how to mitigate vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, who brings decades of experience in Microsoft AD, will explain why it is essential to protect Active Directory and Azure AD. He will also look at the need to integrate identity and cybersecurity initiatives across the organization, rather than placing AD security in a silo.&nbsp;Guido Grillenmeier, Chief Technologist at Semperis, will discuss the most common vulnerabilities in AD configurations, the dangers they present, and how to fix them. He will also discuss password policies, elevated privileges, delegated permissions, and weaknesses in Kerberos usage as well as give an overview of the Purple Knight AD assessment tool.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/security-active-directory-azure"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Osman Celik</a></p>Legacy IAM systems can no longer meet the requirements of Digital Transformation. They often have a negative impact on business efficiency and customer experience. Such systems are too costly to maintain and are getting closer to reaching end-of-life. Today, organizations can be expected to manage billions of digital identities with their IAM systems. Organizations possessing legacy IAM systems must modernize their IAM systems and upgrade their capabilities. It is a transition that requires a comprehensive approach. Organizations must not only adapt to today's standards, but also become future-proof while complying with regulations. In this paper, we will consider what are the necessities for modernizing legacy IAM systems and how Curity aligns with them.

  Our anonymous credentials protocol update integrates Circom to enable developers to specify zero-knowledge "predicates" on credential attributes.

<p>TL;DR</p>  Use <a href="https://docs.circom.io/">Circom</a> to specify zero-knowledge "predicates" on credential attributes.  Circom is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) used to express computations for which zk-SNARKs need to be created.  Predicates are written as programs in the Circom language.  The programs are compiled with the Circom compiler and the artifacts are used to create zk-SNARKs.  The proof protocol is <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">LegoGroth16</a>, an adaptation of Groth16 (used by ZCash).  <p>We have updated our anonymous credentials protocol that enables developers to express "predicates" (checks that return true or false) on credential attributes using the <a href="https://docs.circom.io/">Circom</a> language and then prove that these predicates are satisfied in zero-knowledge. This means that credential verifiers can check that certain credential attributes satisfy the required conditions without learning those attributes such as convincing a credential verifier that the holder is (or is not) a resident of certain cities without revealing the city or that the blood group is not AB- without revealing the blood group. In both these examples, the city and blood group were attributes of a credential and the holder convinced some facts about those without revealing them. More examples would be a holder proving that his yearly income is less than $25,000 for availing of social care where their yearly income is calculated from the pay slip of each month (adding each month's income and checking that the sum is less than desired). Similarly, the holder could prove that his yearly income is more than a certain amount to get access to a high-risk, high-reward investment fund.</p> Code and Examples <p>For folks wishing to jump right into the code, the support for Circom in LegoGroth16 is <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16/tree/comm-wit/src/circom">here</a>. It has been integrated into the composite proof system <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/proof_system">here</a>. The Typescript support is added <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/">here</a>. The Circom circuits (.circom) and artifacts (.r1cs, .wasm) are <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16/tree/comm-wit/test-vectors">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/tree/master/tests/circom">here</a>. The .r1cs and .wasm files are generated for BLS12-381 curve and wasm optimizer (wasm-opt -O3) has been run over the .wasm files. Also, we only support Circom 2.</p><p>Here are some examples that demonstrate the use of Circom along with credentials:</p><p>1. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/yearly-income.spec.ts">The yearly income calculated from monthly payslips is less/greater than a certain amount</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/assets-liabilities.spec.ts">2. The sum of assets is greater than the sum of liabilities where assets and liabilities are calculated from several credentials</a></p><p>3. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/blood-group.spec.ts">The blood group is not AB-</a></p><p>4. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/grade.ts">The grade is either A+, A, B+, B, or C but nothing else</a></p><p>5. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/vaccination.spec.ts">Either vaccinated less than 30 days ago OR last checked negative less than 2 days ago</a></p><p>6. <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/blob/master/tests/composite-proofs/msg-js-obj/r1cs/mimc-hash.spec.ts">Certain attribute is the preimage of an MiMC hash</a></p> Motivation <p>Previously, the expressivity of our anonymous credential proving system was limited. The holder could prove things like I have a credential(s), or certain attribute(s) across my credentials are the same or I can verifiably encrypt attribute(s) for traceability. But verifiers could not request proofs for more complicated conditions like the sum of certain attributes should be less/more than a certain value or an average of certain values is less/more than a certain value. These simple arithmetic operations might not always be sufficient and the holder might want to prove the preimage of a hash is the credential attribute, say to be used in the Merkle tree. Moreover, as library developers, we cannot imagine all the possible logic an application can require. One solution to this problem is to use a more powerful tool to express such conditions and that tool is a programming language. We wanted a developer-friendly programming language that could also be used with our proving system. We found Circom, developed by the folks at <a href="https://github.com/iden3">iden3</a>, to be the most popular such language with sufficient documentation and community around it.</p> Developer Workflow <p>1. Express the predicates/arbitrary computation as a Circom program.</p><p>2. Compile the above program to get the constraints (R1CS file) and witness generator (WASM file, takes input wires and calculates all the intermediate wires).</p><p>3. Use the constraints from step 2 to generate a zk-SNARK proving and verification key of LegoGroth16.</p><p>4. Use the R1CS and WASM files from step 2 and the proving key from step 3 to create a LegoGroth16 proof.</p><p>5. Use the verification key from step 3 to verify the LegoGroth16 proof.</p><p>Steps 1-3 are done by the verifier and the result of these steps, i.e. R1CS file, WASM file, proving, and verification key are shared with any potential prover (published or shared P2P). Step 4 is done by the prover and step 5 again by the verifier.</p> Cryptographic Details <p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/anonymous-credentials/">previous post</a>, we use <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">LegoGroth16 protocol</a> for creating ZK-SNARKs. LegoGroth16 is similar to Groth16 (used by ZCash), but in addition to the zero-knowledge proof, it provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">cryptographic commitment</a> (Pedersen) to the private data (credential attributes in our case). This commitment allows us to prove that the private inputs to the proof protocol are the same as the credentials attributes using the Schnorr proof of knowledge protocol. </p><p>At a high level, the approach is to use BBS+ signatures to prove possession of a credential (knowledge of signature) and Circom to express arbitrary logic and use LegoGroth16 to get the proof of the correctness of the Circom program and use the Pedersen commitment to the witnesses in another zk-proof where I prove that the specific attributes signed under BBS+ are equal to the witnesses in the LegoGroth16 proof.</p><p>The Circom tooling however generates a Groth16 proof whereas we needed a LegoGroth16 proof. Fortunately, the Circom compiler outputs the R1CS (description of the computation) file containing the constraints and the WASM file to generate all the values in the circuit given the inputs. We use the R1CS file to do the SNARK setup, i.e. proving and verification key. This is a trusted setup and is done by the verifier. The prover uses the R1CS and WASM files and the proving key to then generate the zk-SNARK proof using our <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/proof_system">composite proof system</a>. Here, the prover can specify which of the Circom program inputs correspond to which of his credential attributes.</p><p>We acknowledge that the verifier can create fake proofs (proof of untrue statements) as he does the trusted setup but in most cases, the verifier has no incentive to cheat itself. When this is a possibility, like in a large public system deployed by a government, care must be taken to destroy the toxic waste (trapdoor) from the trusted setup. Also, because the proofs for the Circom program are created using the trusted setup done by the verifier, these proofs are designated verifier proofs unlike the proofs with BBS+ which are publicly verifiable.</p><p>Finally, we would like developers to try this new feature to build more expressive applications which are private as well. We would love to hear what all use-cases does this tool enable for you. If you need any support writing a Circom program for your use case, please reach out to us through Github.<br></p><p><br></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Just over a month ago, I wrote about the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/multi-cloud-weve-been-waiting-for">partnership between Oracle Cloud and Microsoft Azure</a> that has finally enabled their customers to create “properly multi-cloud” applications without any hidden costs or limitations of earlier architectures. Well, unfortunately, announcements like that aren’t heard often, simply because the very idea of such partnerships goes against cloud service providers’ traditional business interests. This obviously has worked remarkably well for Oracle and Microsoft, but at least to a certain extent because there is no rivalry between them in these areas, where they are traditionally strong. Connecting a business application running on Azure to a database backend on OCI is a win-win situation for both companies, and their customers can reap the benefits of that, too.</p>
 What if multi-cloud is not an option? 
<p>Unfortunately, this approach won’t necessarily be as successful with other potential partners. Take AWS, for example. The company offers a massive range of database services: over 15 purpose-built database engines for different data models and business use cases. Some of them compete directly with Oracle’s core products like the Oracle Database and MySQL. The rivalry between the companies has a long and quite bitter history. I can only imagine that establishing a mutually beneficial partnership here might take a few more years…</p>
<p>However, what are the ordinary customers supposed to do? In my last blog post I casually mentioned that “you can run SAP on AWS or Oracle on Azure,” as if it was somehow an inferior alternative to the real multi-cloud. Yes, it is usually not a fully managed service and is more difficult to set up, maintain, and operate than a native cloud service from the appropriate vendor. However, when no other options are available, this still can be a very sensible solution for many potential use cases. Provided, of course, that the vendor hasn’t cut any corners when migrating their service to the competitor’s cloud and there is some kind of feature parity guarantee between different deployment options.</p>
<p>Some vendors might go even further and design their products in an entirely cloud-agnostic way – those can be deployed to any cloud, and their customers can just choose where their tenant will be spun up. This approach has obvious advantages, but also one big downside: by design, it is created for the lowest common denominator across all supported clouds, not optimized for any particular cloud, and with no support for native services each CSP offers – such as identity, observability, or security, for example. This might work for some scenarios (Kubernetes is an example of a great success) but will fall short in others. I firmly believe that databases belong to the latter – ensuring the highest degree of performance, data protection, and regulatory compliance is not possible without strong optimization and native service integrations for a specific cloud provider.</p>
 What is MySQL HeatWave? 
<p>MySQL HeatWave is a managed database service created by Oracle that extends the standard MySQL engine with support for in-database high-performance transactional workloads, analytics, machine learning, and automation. Simply put, it can transparently <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/new-heatwave-is-coming">make an existing MySQL database 1000x faster</a> without any effort from the customer and avoid ETLs across databases. We’ve already reviewed the service about a year ago, when it was announced publicly, but the company continued to add new features to provide customers with a scalable, robust offering and make optimizations for enhanced performance ever since.</p>
<p>For example, with support for real-time elasticity and compression, MySQL HeatWave is now suitable for even larger (or smaller) data volumes. And auto-reload and auto-recovery capabilities ensure consistent availability even after upgrades or failures. But most importantly, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/mysql-heatwave-on-aws-2022-09-12/">MySQL HeatWave is now also available on AWS</a> in addition to OCI.</p>
 If the mountain will not come to Muhammad… 
<p>How exactly does it work? Well, as an old proverb goes, “If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain”. While many customers of AWS do migrate to OCI to run MySQL HeatWave, for many customers this can be expensive due to high AWS egress fees. To accommodate such customers, the MySQL HeatWave service is offered as a native AWS service. The data plane, control plane, and interactive console are optimized and deployed on AWS infrastructure as a fully managed service supported by the MySQL engineering team. Through the new interactive console, users can issue queries, monitor performance and resource utilization, manage Autopilot, and access their AWS account.</p>
<p>Customers can provision a new MySQL HeatWave instance on AWS with a few clicks with a similar user experience as on OCI before, but at all times, their data and network traffic will be confined to the AWS cloud, with the expected low latency for any application running there as well. Oracle refers to this as a “native experience.” I’m not sure if I can agree with this statement, since HeatWave isn’t (yet?) integrated into the AWS console, and there is no consolidated support and billing like Oracle offers with Azure. However, it works with AWS CloudWatch, S3, PrivateLink and we can expect it to be integrated with a growing number of other native AWS services in the future.</p>
<p>Oracle claims that MySQL HeatWave runs 20x faster than Amazon Redshift (which is AWS’s own managed PostgreSQL service and running on AWS’ own infrastructure). However, as an analyst focused on cybersecurity and data protection, I’m more interested in the fact that HeatWave is a fully self-contained database service – there is no need to move data between different database engines to support analytics or machine-learning workloads. This feature alone has massive <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc71275/database-and-big-data-security">security and compliance benefits</a>. In addition, Oracle has brought advanced security features to MySQL HeatWave on AWS such as data masking, de-identification, asymmetric encryption support, and MySQL firewall, making sensitive data even more secure—all within the database.</p>
<p>The availability of MySQL HeatWave on AWS is great news for everyone dreaming of the future where cloud providers eliminate walls between each other and make their services available wherever customers want them. HeatWave offers users a unique combination of the familiar MySQL experience with Oracle’s latest developments in machine learning, automation, and security. Now all this is available for AWS customers not only without the latency and data egress overhead and fees of a multi-cloud architecture, but also with the ability for customers to tightly integrate with existing AWS services. The HeatWave is spreading; it’s available on OCI, AWS, and will next be available on Azure. With so many cloud choices—as well as an on-premises cloud deployment option with Dedicated Region – what’s not to like?</p>

<p>Anticapture? Capture-Resistance? Uncapturable? </p><p>We’ll get to these in a moment, but first: What is Capture?</p><p>“In politics, regulatory capture … is a form of corruption of authority that occurs when a political entity, policymaker, or regulator is co-opted to serve the commercial, ideological, or political interests of a minor constituency, such as a particular geographic area, industry, profession, or ideological group.” <br>— <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture">Wikipedia, Regulatory capture</a></p><p>More broadly we can think of capture as a type of control or corruption where a small group gains inordinate power over others and their interests. Whether that is capture of a resource, a process, or the flow of communication, a powerful minority takes control of the benefits of something that should be held in common.</p><p>Following we are going to look at a few different forms of capture and methods for avoiding it.</p> Anticapture “The four phases of action in the Anticapture framework. Note how each phase is itself composed of smaller instances of all the phases.” — Spencer Graham, Anticapture<p>The <a href="https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ">Anticapture</a> framework proposed by Spencer Graham outlines governance practices for managing shared resources collectively without a fraction of that collective capturing control of the resources. For this he proposes DAOs as an ideally capture-resistant structure, but in doing so he redefines a DAO as: “a network of agents who share common purpose, and are the only ones who hold the power to execute actions that manage a set of shared resources. The core of Graham’s work is focused on the key stages of governance which he outlines as follows. </p><blockquote>Graham outlines governance practices for managing shared resources collectively without a fraction of that collective capturing control of the resources.</blockquote><p>Anticapture describes four stages of decision making:</p>  Propose: delineate the options on the table  Decide: select the preferred option  Execute: put the selected option into action  Evaluate: analyze the impact of the executed action  <p>Of these, Graham sees the greatest security risk in the Execute stage. If the ability to execute action is captured then the resource is also captured. While he is not completely clear about the mechanics, he presents DAOs as addressing this by decentralizing action and giving the community the ability to act autonomously without outside influence (thus avoiding capture from regulators, for instance). </p><p>Assuming that the final execution of any action in a DAO is carried out by smart contracts, then the design of these contracts themselves and the infrastructures that they are built on are risk vectors for capture.</p> Capture Resistance Across the Web <p>Anticapture speaks to the level of the organization, but what of the infrastructures the organization is built on? </p><p>“For the longest time, word was that the Web would free the world; now, it seems as if most of the world wants to liberate the Web.” - Robin Berjon, <a href="https://berjon.com/capture-resistance/">Capture Resistance</a></p><p>The internet itself is a commons, a shared resource and infrastructure we all rely on, but due to its design we have seen many forms of capture overtake the internet, from data mining to market manipulation. Robin Berjon’s article <a href="https://berjon.com/capture-resistance/">Capture Resistance</a> calls for new design standards to ensure that softwares and the underlying infrastructure of our web protocols do not allow for capture. <br><br>Berjon outlines four main attack vectors:</p>  Capability to observe the behavior of users on another business’s products: <br>Data mining, trackers, etc.  Defaults that project power laterally between markets: <br>Default search engines, browsers, and similar.  Intermediation which happens when an entity has power over relations between other entities: <br>Platforms that act as gatekeepers and extract rent from peer transactions.  Opaque mechanisms used in place of open markets: <br>Lack of clear rulesets that are mutually consented to.  <p>Berjon calls into question the institutions and infrastructures of the web, suggesting the need for explicitly capture-resistant designs. These can be brought about through technical shifts like new security standards as well as through regulatory practices like antitrust laws. Above all he suggests that these infrastructures must be “subject to either exit or voice (or both).” That is to say that users need to be co-governors in the systems they interact with and need to be able to leave those systems for better alternatives when they no longer serve them. </p>The internet is not only digital but also infrastructural and institutional and we need to think about capture across every aspect of the system. <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/IlxX7xnbRF8">Source</a><p>We can see from this how even anti-institutional projects, like many within the blockchain movement, are subject to capture. For instance, PoW and PoS systems open up opportunities for capture by a minority of miners or stakers. Because a large amount of capital is needed to have real influence and make participation profitable, the governance of these systems can quickly become exclusionary. Here what is captured might not be what gets written to the ledger, but the ledger itself, and thus all the associated rents such as gas fees which are set by these parties and which control who has access to the infrastructure are also captured.</p><blockquote>...users need to be co-governors in the systems they interact with and need to be able to leave those systems for better alternatives when they no longer serve them.</blockquote> Uncapturable (or Unenclosable) <p>Anticapture is an organizational response to capture, and Capture Resistance aims to open conversation between regulators and software architects, adding to this we now introduce an architectural response to capture at a foundational layer of communication.</p><p>After all, capture can also happen through the manipulation of the medium of communication itself. This overlaps heavily with Berjon’s concerns as we’ll see, but is also a vulnerability for the Anticapture framework. If you can’t trust the system you are communicating over, then you can’t trust the decisions you make as an organization. </p><blockquote>In order to make an uncapturable form of writing, we developed Holochain as an open source, data integrity engine for building peer-to-peer apps.</blockquote><p>We term any communications medium that avoids capture by its very nature an uncapturable carrier. For instance, the air through which sound travels is uncapturable (so long as no one invents a cone of silence). Conversely, messages sent by intermediary or through writing can be contorted, lost, or otherwise captured in transit, opening up vulnerabilities in the system. Scaling communication through the air is vastly limited; you can only speak so loudly. So creating a form of scalable communication that is uncapturable is key to addressing the forms of capture introduced by large scale systems and societies. In order to make an uncapturable form of writing, we developed Holochain as an open source, data integrity engine for building peer-to-peer apps. The technical details for how Holochain secures the communication architecture will be described for a general audience in forthcoming materials, but in the meantime we refer you to an alpha draft of our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-proto/blob/whitepaper/holochain.pdf">whitepaper</a>. It is also worth noting that our implementation doesn’t require any centralized servers or a shared global ledger and thus avoids the forms of capture that those systems open up, either in governance and security or in regulation. </p><p>Capture here is about more than just the security of communications. Holochain also ensures that users always possess their own data and can take it into new spaces they create or join. This combats the capture of privatization. </p>The anti-enclosure movement has a lot to teach modern activists fighting against the privatization of public goods like the internet. The image is a depiction of commoners storming London’s Richmond Park.<p>We previously termed this architectural intervention an “<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">unenclosable carrier</a>” in reference to the enclosure of the commons, a term originally referring to the privatization of public land which the commoners of England relied on. However, it can also be used to refer to any privatization of public resources, from literal enclosure with fences to the paywalling of publicly funded research or the patenting of plant genomes. More generally enclosure is a form of capture and so we have shifted our terminology to speak about Holochain as an uncapturable carrier in order to recognize how it serves as a base layer architecture that can support a broader capture-resistant framework.</p> Holochain and Capture Resistance <p>The introduction of an uncapturable carrier provides several tools that can help address the four security threats that Berjon describes. Along with several other <a href="https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=8036267">intrinsic privacy benefits</a>, Holochain’s peer-to-peer data structures break cloud services’ monopoly on data and privacy. This brings its own set of challenges, for instance Holochain’s accountability mechanisms force certain data into the public sphere; but unlike blockchains with their global visibility, the required data transparency only extends to the group level. Similarly, defaults and intermediation are at least in part solved by easy forking of both platform and data in what we call walkaway (a new article on this coming soon). And opaque mechanism design is limited by shared, openly accessible, consented-to rulesets that can be audited by anyone who can read source code. Without offering one totalizing solution, these tools work together to create capture resistant ecosystems from the ground up. No organization building on Holochain can capture the market or underlying infrastructure because we make exit easy and thus provide users the opportunity to build-in voice.</p><blockquote>No organization building on Holochain can capture the market or underlying infrastructure because we make exit easy and thus provide users the opportunity to build-in voice.</blockquote> Holochain and Anticapture <p>This brings us back to governance as users need to be able to govern their shared platforms, communities, and resources. Holochain and uncapturable carriers can help support the Anticapture framework in a number of ways. For one, because anyone can host the software and act directly peer-to-peer without a central server or ledger, the community gains a high level of autonomy. Beyond that, having clear, mutually shared rulesets helps to maintain security and ensure clarity through the varied governance stages. Holochain also follows almost the same process as laid out by Anticapture for changing the internal ruleset of a community, with the execute stage being managed by each agent for themselves autonomously from the rest. Finally, because every action within a Holochain app is signed, it is easy to trace any form of capture that does happen, no matter the stage of governance. This means communities can address any exploits that arise and continually become more capture-resistant. We explored several of these concepts further in a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">recent article</a> if you are interested in learning more.</p> Conclusion <p>While there are several definitions and arenas of capture presented above, they all share a concern for the ways small, powerful groups can take control of a resource that should be held in common by the larger group, community, or society. </p><p>There is a tendency to avoid capture in one area by shifting power to someone or something that is tasked with protecting against that capture. However, that opens up a new opportunity for capture by centralizing power in a new place. Thus we need capture-resistant design across all layers, starting with a strong foundation in the medium of communication.</p><p>There is a lot of work still to be done in capture-resistance. We hope this broad overview of capture and capture-resistance frameworks helps you to think through these issues from multiple angles, holding them all in mind to see where they differ, conflict, and benefit each other.</p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/#subscribe">Subscribe</a> to be the first to read our upcoming blog on the power of Walkaway.</p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity development experts <a href="https://tanglelabs.io" title="Blog">Tangle Labs</a> have just released the latest version of their open-source <a href="https://github.com/Tangle-Labs/identity-manager" title="Identity Manager libraries">Identity Manager libraries</a> that provide accessible development tools for businesses and organisations to create anything with Identity. </p>



<p>Making use of the <a href="https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/decentralized_identity" title="IOTA Identity protocols">IOTA Identity protocols</a> that are live on the main network of the <a href="https://iota.org" title="IOTA DLT">IOTA DLT</a>, Identity Manager provides a developer friendly environment with additional features that can get enterprise developers exploring Identity in minutes. Abstracting away from the intricate functionality of identity, the tooling provides full exposure of the features in a simplified manner.</p>



 Get Up &amp; Running With SSI in 15mins! 



 



<p> </p>



 Why Do We Need Identity Manager? 



<p>Self-Sovereign Identity is becoming a clear topic of discussion at the highest levels of international governments and organisations, yet the current technological barriers to entry provide numerous challenges for SMEs, Institutions, and Enterprises, when entering into the space. As an open-source library, Identity Manager provides developers and teams with and accessible developer tool kit with countless additional features that can support enterprise use-cases and real world deployment of Self-Sovereign Identity solutions.</p>



<p>A fundamental part of all Tangle Labs products the Identity Manager was developed to make identity more comprehensive and approachable for more casual developers and teams working with SSI, without the need to dive in too deep. Making use of sane defaults and helper functions to support quick and versatile deployments and application development. The initial development was specifically to help support the work on the SSI powered <a href="https://tixit.live" title="Tixit">Tixit</a> applications, after realising that Identity protocols can be overwhelming for the majority of developers who are not too familiar with its concepts. </p>



<p>By producing an accessible, open-source wrapper library, Tangle Labs provides any business or development team the opportunity to easily explore SSI and to test and prototype solutions that can bring added value to your business. With an increasing interest in the future of identity online, and with SSI being at the forefront of research for major institutions and organisations, Identity Manager provides the opportunity for any business to get ahead of the game in developing novel identity solutions specific to your use-case.</p>



<p> </p>



 



 What is Self-Sovereign Identity? 



<p>In the sharing of digital data, SSI fosters trust. The user has discretion over what information, including personal information, is shared and with whom. For instance, the recipient can rapidly check the legality and authenticity of shared information electronically. For this, cryptographic tools like public-key cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, and distributed ledger technologies are used. This makes it possible for parties who do not naturally trust each other to share verified digital information quickly and with a high level of trust.</p>



<p> </p>



 



 Governments &amp; Businesses Save Money &amp; Time 



<p>Data sharing is now safer, simpler, and more dependable thanks to SSI. This benefits not only consumers but also businesses and government agencies. Companies can more easily abide by the eIDAS2 rule and the European Union’s GDPR thanks to SSI. Additionally, they spend less time and money. The requirement to review documents on paper is no longer necessary, saving billions of euros in administrative expenses, in addition, quicker and better decision-making results in higher customer satisfaction.</p>



<p> </p>



 



The Self-Sovereign Identity Ecosystem using Identity Manager



<p> </p>



 



 How Does Identity Manager Improve Developer Experiences? 



<p>With numerous levels of complexity within the IOTA Identity libraries, getting started can be a daunting task. Where Identity Manager helps is in its abstracting away the complexity of certain features through standard, customisable, defaults, to present developers with a more manageable Typescript environment to promote faster and easier development processes.</p>



<p> </p>



 



 What Value Does Identity Manager Bring to Business? 



<p>With such bodies as the European Commission, British Government, US Government, and other institutions and organisations actively researching and developing SSI based solutions, it is only a matter of time before the use of Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) become common practise. In a world where development is fast paced and in many cases expensive, the Identity Manager provides a serious entry point into the technology without the complexities of extensive development processes and specialist developer requirements. Helping businesses explore the boundaries of the tech with ease and short timeframes.</p>



<p> </p>



 



 How Does Identity Manager Expand Upon the IOTA Identity Protocol? 



<p>Having one of the most complex decentralised identity libraries around, the IOTA Identity protocol can be a challenge to navigate, and whilst it focuses on a number of core principals and feature sets to support extensive versatility in the use and deployment of SSI solutions, there are a few areas out of scope, that have been integrated into the Identity Manager to support real world use cases. </p>



<p> </p>



 



 Additional features include: 



<p>DVID – Domain Verifiable Identity, making use of DNS and inspired by DKIM, DVID allows a verifiable credential to be signed and verified not only through its issuers DID, but also through its issuer’s domain through the use of DNS connected DID. Providing a built in human identifiable verification process.</p>



<p>Storage Interface – Through the addition of a storage interface, Identity Manager can easily allow developers to quickly adapt the technology to any data storage paradigm, allowing for ease of management of your identity and credentials through the built in MongoDB or File System solutions, or through any number of additional data storage options such as Postgress, SQL, Cassandra, etc.</p>



<p>Credential Encryption – There are currently no suggested guidelines for the encryption of data in the IOTA Identity protocols, which has been included in the Identity Manager toolkit. Ensuring an identity is fully supported with encrypted credential storage accessible through ownership DID key access. Supporting users with safe storage of their PII only accessible through your private key.</p>



<p>Backup &amp; Restore – A big concern when it comes to identity is backing up and restoration of data when something goes wrong. You break a phone, your laptop burns out, any number of things can add to the loss of data. Identity Manager supports easy user backup and restoration for peace of mind, allowing identity holders to safely be able to restore identity configurations, credentials, keys, and more.</p>



<p>Typescript Library – Without the need to delve into low level Rust code, the Identity Manager libraries have been developed in Typescript to provide an accessible developer entry point to SSI through fully documented code that offers an easy access point to the technology for any development team.</p>

 How to Get Started.  



<p>You can find the full repo live on <a href="https://github.com/Tangle-Labs/identity-manager" title="Github">Github</a></p>



<p>Identity Manager is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanglelabs/identity-manager" title="">published on NPM</a>&nbsp;and can be easily installed using</p>



 <code>$ yarn add @tanglelabs/identity-manager</code> 



<p>or</p>



 <code>npm install @tanglelabs/identity-manager</code> 



<p>a few examples can be found in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Tangle-Labs/identity-manager/tree/dev/docs/examples">examples folder</a>&nbsp;along with the fully detailed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Tangle-Labs/identity-manager/tree/dev/docs/api-ref.md">API Reference</a></p>



<p>Identity Manager uses IOTA Identity’s Stronghold bindings to securely store your keypair. The manager instance handles everything related to Stronghold and secrets while the <code>IdentityAccount</code> which is returned with loading or creating a DID handles everything related to a DID and credentials.</p>



<p>Here is an example for how to create an identity using IdentityManager.</p>



 <code>import { IdentityManager } from "@tanglelabs/identity-manager";async function run() {&nbsp; // Instantiate a new instance of Identity Manager&nbsp; const manager = IdentityManager.newInstance({&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filepath: process.env.FILEPATH,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password: process.env.PASSWORD,&nbsp; });&nbsp; // Create a did with the alias of `identity-alias`&nbsp; const did = await manager.createDid("identity-alias");}run();
</code> 



 



<blockquote><p>Please note: </p>Identity Manager v0.2.0 is an alpha release and has not undergone any professional audit or security evaluation. It is meant to be used as an entry point into the technology and is released as is. Please use at your own discretion and not in a real world scenario.</blockquote><p>The post <a href="https://tanglelabs.io/identity-manager-self-sovereign-identity-made-simple/">Identity Manager – Self Sovereign Identity made Simple</a> first appeared on <a href="https://tanglelabs.io">TangleLabs</a>.</p>
