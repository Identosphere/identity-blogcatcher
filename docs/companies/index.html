					 <p>The Trinsic Wallet is a <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) digital wallet. People use it to receive, store, and share digital credentials. The Trinsic Wallet was the first <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">SSI digital wallet</a> to prove interoperability and has become one of the most-used SSI wallets globally. Not only is the wallet easy-to-use for end users, but it is extremely functional for developers who are interacting directly with the Trinsic platform since it works seamlessly with <a href="https://trinsic.id/an-introduction-to-trinsics-apis/">Trinsic’s APIs </a>and <a href="https://trinsic.id/an-introduction-to-trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>. The following is a brief overview of what the Trinsic Wallet can do and how your organization can take advantage of it.</p>

					 <p>We all carry around a leather wallet that carries cards inside. The Trinsic Wallet does that same thing for digital cards. These digital cards, or “credentials” could be a passport, driver’s license, health insurance card, etc. But the Trinsic Wallet can store more than just the “digital versions” of the cards in your leather wallet. It can store any kind of personal data in the form of a digital credential. For example, the Trinsic Wallet could carry login credentials, vaccination and test result credentials, licensing credentials, supply chain certifications, and more. These credentials are stored on the device, so no one but the end user has access to them—not even Trinsic as the wallet provider. To learn more about these “verifiable credentials”, check out this <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">blog</a> or refer to our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">documentation</a>.</p>

					 <p>Continuing with the leather wallet analogy, the reason people carry around wallets is so they can use the contents inside them. Usually the contents of our wallet are used to prove things about ourselves to access goods and services. The Trinsic Wallet enables end users to do the same thing, but the process is paperless and more secure for all parties involved.<br><br></p><p>When an organization requests information from an end user, the end user can decide whether to accept or reject the request. If the request is accepted, the wallet will find the relevant data from all of their credentials that is needed to fulfill the request. This means only the information that is needed is shared with the organization and nothing more. For example, the end user might share their birth date from their driver’s license but not their driver’s license number or address. The end user has full control over what kind of information they share and with whom. Best of all, the information that is shared can be instantly authenticated.</p>

					 <p>Finally, the wallet enables end users “to connect” with others. Connections are super-private, securely-encrypted communication channels used between two parties. You can share credentials and messages through this channel with a high degree of trust. Connections are super helpful when parties need to interact frequently, but if the relationship isn’t long-term, <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">connectionless credential exchange</a>&nbsp;is sometimes a faster, more convenient way to interact.</p>

					 <p>The Trinsic Wallet has some advantages that make it unique from some of the other digital wallets out there.<br><br></p>  Based on interoperable, open standards: This gives end users the capability to seamlessly receive and share credentials with any organization that is also using community-driven SSI standards for verifiable credential exchange (i.e., the organizations do not have to be using the Trinsic platform to issue credentials to or request information from the Trinsic Wallet). In fact, the Trinsic Wallet was the first mobile app that met the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-commitment-to-interoperability-ahead-of-iiw/">Aries interoperability profile</a>.  No vendor lock-in: Just like people can change out their leather wallet for a new one whenever they want, the same can be done with the Trinsic Wallet. End users can easily export their credentials from the Trinsic Wallet and import them into another Aries-based digital wallet that supports <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">import/export functionality</a>.  Free: It is free to download and immediately use for iOS and Android.

<p>Should countries develop national strategies for data in order to release its full potential? If so, what should they look&nbsp;like?</p><p>The British Government is currently mulling responses to its consultation about a new UK <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/uk-national-data-strategy-nds-consultation">National Data Strategy</a>. The decisions it arrives at will affect developments for many years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Mydex CIC provided comprehensive answers to questions asked by this consultation. To help promote debate, we’re publishing edited versions of these answers in a series of blogs. (Meanwhile, to see some of the practical work we are doing, <a href="https://medium.com/macmillan-my-data-store-pilot">click here</a> to catch up on progress on the Macmillan My Data Store&nbsp;Pilot.)</p> We need two strategies, not&nbsp;one <p>The first point made by our submission is that we need two national data strategies — one for personal data and one for non-personal data. A national data strategy that talks about ‘data’ in the abstract and fails to distinguish between non-personal data and personal data is a sure fire recipe for confusion and error because they require very different treatments. Any attempt to treat them as if they are one and the same is akin to developing an ‘energy’ strategy that treats electricity and gas as the same because they are both ‘energy’. The results could be explosive and very damaging.</p> Many users, many&nbsp;uses <p>The second, critical point we made is that our society is at a tipping point in data management — one that can either be managed well or&nbsp;badly.</p><p>The consultation paper contained an important insight: a recognition that the “full value [of data] is not being realised because vital information is not getting to where it needs to be.” The big question that follows is ‘what needs to be done to rise to this challenge?’ What follows is a summary of what we&nbsp;said.</p><p>To be successful, the Strategy needs to grasp a nettle. The main reason why vital information is not getting where it needs to be is that our data economy has evolved to be an organisation-centric ‘One User One Use’ (OUOU) system — whereas, thanks to the inner logic of data itself, it needs to operate as a ‘Many Users, Many Uses’ (MUMU) data ecosystem.</p> Characteristics of&nbsp;OUOU <p>The digital economy first evolved with organisations collecting, storing and using the data they needed to pursue their particular purposes. This resulted in a data landscape that is overwhelmingly organisation-centric, with large quantities of data collected and used almost exclusively by large organisations, operating via a series of separate data silos. The inevitable result of this structure is that the uses of this data are restricted to the priorities and purposes of the organisations concerned. It is a ‘one user, one set of uses’&nbsp;system.</p><p>While this approach has unleashed many benefits, it has also created built-in structural limitations and restrictions on what data assets are created, how they are used, by who. Other parties, including citizens, SMEs, charities, researchers and other organisations cannot access the data they want/need. Key stakeholders, particularly citizens, are effectively excluded from taking part in the workings of the digital economy and from directly benefiting from the collection and use of&nbsp;data.</p> Characteristics of&nbsp;MUMU <p>It is in the nature of data that it can be used many times without being ‘used up’. Therefore it can potentially be re-used by many different parties for many different purposes. In this context, the current organisation-centric restrictions on who can access data and what they can use this data for represent a fundamental architectural, structural and infrastructural constraint on the data economy’s ability to evolve and flourish. We need to shift to a Many Users, Many Uses data ecosystem.</p><p>A simple analogy sums up the National Data Strategy’s core challenge. So far, the data chick has grown and evolved inside the protecting nurturing shell of OUOU — an organisation- centric data architecture. To mature and flourish, it now needs to break out of that&nbsp;shell.</p><p>The importance and nature of this <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">shift from OUOU to MUMU</a> is highlighted by the recent <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1N9kVpPWT48YZFFx3uBEU_xcrt20YLaFi">The Future of Citizen Data Systems</a> report by the Government Office for Science, which notes&nbsp;that:</p><blockquote>“Data about people, here referred to as citizen data, is increasing rapidly in volume and variety. The effective use and sharing of such data has the potential to bring huge benefits to the economy and society as a whole: boosting productivity and trade, enabling innovative products, improving public service delivery and informing scientific research.</blockquote><blockquote>“However, the shifting data landscape is challenging for policymakers to navigate. Data collected for one purpose can be used many times over for a range of other ones, and government policy in one area can have unintended impacts elsewhere. Restrictions of data sharing can sometimes mitigate risks of privacy breaches and misuse. However, the linking together of new types of citizen data — across the boundaries of industry, government, and our personal lives — offers some of the greatest opportunities.”</blockquote><p>The big question is how to realise these benefits. The National Strategy for Data needs to recognise that the full benefits of MUMU cannot be realised solely by increasing data sharing between existing organisations. The system itself needs to re-set, to shift from exclusivity (‘organisations only’) to inclusivity (in particular, including citizens whose data it&nbsp;is).</p> Far-reaching reform <p>For this to happen we need far-reaching structural, architectural, infrastructural and institutional reform. Key elements of this reform agenda&nbsp;include:</p>  Structural Add new data actors/stakeholders capable of collecting, storing and sharing data independently of existing ‘data controller’ organisations. This includes enabling citizens to be able to build up their own data assets in their own personal data stores and enabling new data trusts or foundations to access and use data for a broad array of non-commercial purposes, including scientific and medical research. Adding new stakeholders to the workings of the system would turn today’s data landscape of multiple, isolated parallel data silos into an expanding set of linked data nodes in a vibrant data sharing&nbsp;network.  Architectural Recognise the need for increasing differentiation of functions and divisions of labour in data collection, storage and use, particularly the increasing separation of data storage from use. As specialist data storage services (including personal data stores) develop, they can enable multiple different parties to access the same data for a range of different purposes. The need to separate data storage from data use is recognised in t<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/vindicated-cb897fb4e94b">he EU’s new Data Governance Act</a>. The National Data Strategy is the UK’s opportunity to also grasp this nettle. If it fails to do so, it risks lagging behind the EU in the development of a world-leading data driven&nbsp;economy.  <p>The strategy also needs to recognise the need for other specialist support services such as the development of metadata standards to ensure and reassure data users of the nature and quality of the data they are accessing, and data directories to help data users find and access the data they&nbsp;need.</p>  Infrastructural Develop independent, neutral data logistics infrastructure that achieves the above: that enables the right data to flow to and from the right parties in the right formats at the right times. Personal data stores are an essential part of this. We would go a long way to achieving this if every individual was provided with their own personal data store, where they can collect, store and share their own data under their own&nbsp;control.  Institutional Build the institutions capable of making and enforcing the rules, safeguards, standards, processes and incentive structures relevant to the types of data in question. This is needed to ensure safe, fair, trustworthy and efficient data sharing between multiple&nbsp;parties.   A job for Government <p>The creation of MUMU-enabling data sharing infrastructure and institutions extends beyond the remit, boundaries and goals of any particular organisation. It needs Government support and facilitation. In particular, it requires the resolution of collective action dilemmas that arise from the organisation-centric structure of the current&nbsp;system.</p><p>For example, it is in the interests of every user of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">verified attributes</a> (that confirm details about an individual) that organisations holding these attributes enable them to be shared. But it may not be in the immediate interests of each particular organisation holding these attributes to enable such sharing. Result: verified attributes are not shared and all service providers that could use them lose out. Such collective action issues threaten to block progress towards the goal of increased data sharing and&nbsp;use.</p><p>Together, the reforms and developments outlined above point to the creation of a data landscape and ecosystem that is very different to what we see today. In particular they shift the focus of innovation from particular organisations’ uses of data to the structural, architectural, infrastructural and institutional innovations needed to deliver&nbsp;MUMU.</p><p>They also point to a new direction of economic growth — opening up all the opportunities for data use that OUOU systems and structures currently stifle.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">How to unleash the full potential of data?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Conditional Transfer 
<p>Before the transfer is executed on the blockchain, an authorization request will be sent to the issuer (or his processing agent) for the transaction’s release or rejection.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>As you may know, it’s already been possible for an investor holding a position in a T-REX security token to execute a “simple transfer” instruction to another white-listed investor: they simply need to select both the number of tokens to transfer and the counterpart’s wallet. The T-REX system then instantly performs a provision-check on their position, verifies that the counterpart is indeed whitelisted for the token considered and, upon submission and signature, the simple transfer instruction is sent to the blockchain for execution on a peer-to-peer basis.</p>
<p>However, some issuers and asset managers have confirmed to us that they need to assert more control over this type of transfer. Essentially, before the transfer is executed, they need to be able to authorize or reject the transfer between the two investors. This final “go” might be needed for various reasons, including checking pre-emption or veto rights for instance. We at Tokeny have listened to this request and are now introducing “conditional transfers” as part of our product offering.</p>
<p>An investor will initiate a conditional transfer exactly in the same way they initiate a simple transfer and the system will perform the same provision- and eligibility-checks. However, before the transfer is executed on the blockchain, an authorization request will be sent to the issuer (or his processing agent) for the transaction’s release or rejection. In case of rejection, a reason has to be provided and communicated to the investor. This is how it works:</p>

		 
	 
                      
	 
		 
			<p>It is up to the issuer of the T-REX security token to determine whether their token/s will allow for simple or conditional transfers. Investors will obviously only be able to instruct the type of transfers relevant for a specific token.</p>

<p>The documentary The Social Dilemna produced by Netflix focuses on the sordid aspects of our ultra-connected lives and it's bound to be disturbing.</p>
<p>Between the docu-reality that features a contemporary family and inlays by experts, this film dissects the workings of social networks. At a time when Whatsapp is changing its terms and conditions of use, it's always instructive to understand why... The interviewees, some of whom are still working in this field, express themselves on the current consequences of technology (interference in elections and disinformation that is growing exponentially) and draw a dark picture of the future that awaits us if we don't change our habits.</p>
<p>As is often the case in this type of documentary or docu-drama, producers do not skimp on the means to hammer their message. On the program: an anxiety-provoking soundtrack, poignant scenes and hard-hitting statistics that seem to be attributable to social networks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, apart from this debate on the real place of the Internet and social networks in the evils of our time, this film paints a very accurate picture of how technology has shaped the modern world. Here's what we need to remember about The Social Dilemna :</p>
 If it's free, you are the product 
<p>Contrary to the adage, which fortunately is now beginning to erode, free services (search engines, social networks, etc.) are not aligned with the interests of its users. The Social Dilemna, social media platforms are companies that use a three-step business model :</p>
<p>Commitment: the goal is to capture your attention in the application<br>
Who doesn't remember the former Google employee <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_a_handful_of_tech_companies_control_billions_of_minds_every_day">Tristan Harris</a> who became an active activist and an alarm bell about the manipulation of our minds by tech giants.</p>
<p>Growth: the goal is for you to invite your friends and family to join the application.</p>
<p>Advertising: the goal is to offer you advertising in the application.</p>
<p>For a user, these three "acts" provide a better understanding of how different platforms and applications work. Their purpose is to hold our attention as long as possible, to encourage us to invite others and to expose us to advertisements as we use them. On this last point, it is important to note that advertisers do not aim to generate immediate sales. Indeed, as explained in the documentary <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier">Jaron Lanier</a>, a pioneer of virtual reality, social networks have the ability to gradually and imperceptibly change our consumption habits.</p>
<p>Advertisers use this power to modify and predict our future actions, which amounts to influencing our behaviours.<br>
For <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff">Shoshana Zuboff</a>, PhD student and author of <a href="https://www.zulma.fr/livre-lage-du-capitalisme-de-surveillance-572196.html">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</a>, "Internet actors speculate on the future behavior of users" as some companies do on the price of oil. We tend to focus all our attention on the management of personal information. Yet the most valuable asset for these platforms is our behavioral data.</p>
 All our online activity is "dissected" 
<p>The Social Dilemna reminds us that no action taken online goes unnoticed: the giants of the Internet know what we consult and how long we consult it. When we browse online, algorithms study our activity to find out how to capture our attention. These results then allow them to make us stay longer on the sites and applications we use. It is thanks to this that advertisers can understand each person's habits and use them to their advantage.</p>
 When a handful of people decide for us... 
<p>We then imagine that the Internet is controlled by a divine force pulling the strings... no, it is not Gods but a handful of individuals who execute, participate in increasing the number of users, in monetizing their data.</p>
<p>This documentary features Justin Rosenstein, former engineer for Google and Facebook and co-creator of the "Like" button. This initially seemingly innocuous invention, originally designed to increase commitment, is now a global symbol of recognition that, for many users, has a direct impact on their self-esteem. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rosenstein">Justin Rosenstein</a> admits that at the time they had no idea of the consequences that could ensue... It reminds me of another Tristan... Nitot, ex-Mozilla, <a href="https://cozy.io/fr/">Cozy Cloud</a> and Qwant who spoke about the dopamine generated by this famous button in <a href="https://vimeo.com/251654559">one of his famous lectures</a>.</p>
 Internet widens the gap on divisive issues 
<p>On the Internet, the current discourse reflects an increasingly divided society, especially on divisive issues. On this point, the mechanisms (or algorithms) that govern social networking platforms are being singled out. As we have seen above, these platforms seek to capture your attention for as long as possible. To do this, they use algorithms that analyze your behavior when dealing with different types of content. Thanks to the data collected, the service can then offer you new information and publications that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point, the documentary The Social Dilemna takes the example of videos of conspiracy theories and the role played by social media in the rise of their crazy theories, the latest conspiracy theories around the non-re-election of Trump or the Qanon phenomenon in the United States. When a video ends, platforms such as YouTube automatically suggest new content: users are then "hypnotized" by a continuous flow of information going in the same direction. This uninterrupted cycle of suggestions is often managed by an algorithm that will not try to find out if the suggested content is true. However, some platforms, such as Twitter, have deployed fact-checking software to combat this phenomenon. When a publication is considered "dubious" by such a tool, a warning message is displayed. Unfortunately, this is sometimes not enough to stop the problem. Misleading information is everywhere on the Web, so every claim, however far-fetched, is bound to be corroborated somewhere on the Internet. The result? The result is that users on both sides of the web are increasingly distancing themselves from each other and the gap is widening.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that the search bar in browsers takes into account your usage history. For example, Google's auto-suggest feature means that if a user types "flat earth" into the search bar, the suggestions displayed will be influenced by their usage behavior, geographic location, and the data Google has collected about them.</p>
<p>Faced with this reality, some experts interviewed in The Social Dilemna are very pessimistic about future consequences, citing the possibility of civil war - the recent intrusion into the Capitol in Washington proves it.</p>
 But then what to do? 
<p>Not everything is to be thrown away with the bath water. Alternatives are emerging - the influx of Whatsapp users who have just changed their terms and conditions of use (to the benefit of its parent company Facebook) to the Signal messaging service is testimony to this collective awareness. This documentary offers advice on how to limit our addiction to social networks, twist the neck to misinformation and complicate the task of the algorithms that predict our behaviors.</p>
<p>To be less addicted to social networks, the best reflex is to deactivate your notifications, as advised by almost all the experts interviewed in this documentary.</p>
 
 
<p>Use a search engine that does not record your activity, such as <a href="https://www.qwant.com/">Qwant</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duck Duck Go</a>, <a href="https://www.startpage.com/fr/">StartPage</a>...</p>
 
 
<p>Remove the Chrome extensions (which follow your behavior) and prefer the Firefox browser to Google's browser.</p>
 
 
<p>Do not click on recommended videos and click traps. #Resist</p>
 
 
<p>Cross-check the information of an article before sharing it and verify the reliability of its source.</p>
 
 
<p>Limit the amount of time spent on the screens each day (for adults and children alike).</p>
 
 
<p>Put your phone at the entrance of the house in silent mode (when you have finished your work day), unplug it during the night . Until about 15 years ago, we lived without social networks, without solicitations... So it's possible!</p>
 
 
<p>Choose tools that respect your privacy (<a href="https://blog.cozy.io/fr/je-change-mes-habitudes-numeriques-avec-cozy-cloud/">Cozy Cloud is one of them but we are not alone</a> and learn how to better control your data.</p>
 
 
<p>Of course, the ideal would be to delete all its social networks and other thieving applications of our time but let's go like Kaizen and its method of small steps. A habit sets in after 21 days and it's hard to get rid of the convenience offered by these "tools", especially at a time when telecommuting and the fall of the much-lamented "social relationship" is so common.</p>
 It's all about security 
<p>Start watching this documentary (on Netflix, to top it all off!) and listen and/or read other content that is just as rich in information and pedagogy, because the key word is digital education and its excesses.</p>

<p>Dock has decided to extend the token migration until midnight (GMT) on the 31st of March 2021. We are extending the migration window by around 3 weeks to ensure those who haven’t migrated yet have sufficient time to do so. For those who are migrating directly, you can continue to use the Dock <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/token-migration">migration portal</a> and accompanying <a href="https://docs.dock.io/token-migration/migration-tutorial/migration-tutorial">migration tutorial</a>. As we’ll discuss in the next section, Binance will also assist their users with the migration prior to the 31st of March. </p><p>Exchanges</p><p>Current exchanges supporting the newer mainnet token are <a href="https://www.huobi.com/en-us/exchange/dock_btc">Huobi</a>, <a href="https://trade.kucoin.com/DOCK-BTC">Kucoin</a> and <a href="https://www.gate.io/trade/DOCK_USDT">Gate.io</a>. Binance has already <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/758e3d56c5f747fdbf5eeebfd509dc54">confirmed their support</a> and that they will be supporting the mainnet token prior to the migration window closing. Those with DOCK ERC20 tokens currently on Binance can leave them on the exchange at their choosing and they will be migrated by Binance on your behalf. Binance will confirm specific timings in the coming weeks. </p><p>Moving forward </p><p>Those who have been following Dock will know that the Dock mainnet token represents a key part of the network and already provides utility. It acts as an integrated payment mechanism for performing network operations, a way to reward validators who provide their resources to the network by producing blocks and confirming transactions, and as a voting mechanism within Dock’s <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-future-in-decentralized-governance/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=Token_Migration_Extension">decentralized governance</a>. </p><p>As outlined in our recent <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-2021-roadmap/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=Token_Migration_Extension">roadmap post</a>, Q2 2021 (between April and June) will see Dock transition to Proof of Stake and with that we’ll provide the community with one of our most requested features, <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">staking</a>. We’ll also be building a new Dock wallet during the course of this year with our v0.1 release planned for Q3. This will not only facilitate the storage and transacting in DOCK tokens, but it will also be a place to store W3C-compliant verifiable credentials. </p><p>Stay safe out there</p><p>Although we are nearing the end of the migration process it is still important that we all remain vigilant and keep our crypto safe. Extraordinary events like a token migration can represent an opportunity for scammers to part you from your tokens if you don’t take care. Please learn more by reviewing our blog post, “<a href="https://blog.dock.io/10-ways-to-stay-safe-during-the-migration/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=Token_Migration_Extension">10 Ways to Stay Safe During the Migration</a>” for hints and tips.<br></p><p>If you have any questions regarding the token migration, please contact our support team at support@dock.io.</p>

<p>In the past week we’ve been collecting questions and frequently asked items that were brought up in our Telegram channel. The AERGO team is all ears, and we’ve gone through the process of addressing queries that range from technical, the inspiring, the strange, to the burning 🔥 Let’s dive right&nbsp;in!</p><p>Q: Which oracle will be used by AERGO, or will there be just a default for dapps like Chainlink?<br>A: There is currently no official oracle as there has not been a need for one within the use cases of the enterprises that are operating on our chain. Necessary information for each customer is simply uploaded onto the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Q: Are the possible solutions to the high cost of using erc-20 liquidity tokens: alternate protocols like Polkadot or Cardano?<br>A: In the long term, we are looking to utilize and trade our mainnet tokens as a gas solution. Currently we have no plans to use other protocols.</p><p>Q: How will KDAC custodial efforts affect the AERGO token. Will Tokens be used in these solutions? Will Bitgo be using any AERGO products?<br>A: BitGo is not using any AERGO products. We are working to integrate KDAC custody solution with the AERGO platform.</p><p>Q: Have people print stickers and paste them on their city, send you a picture, and the most liked one gets a prize in AERGO. Spread the news of the winner. Give someone 5k AERGO or something for the most creative one. <br>A: We definitely do not want to have our community committing any illegal vandalism type of campaigns in their respective city. I believe there are other ways to spread news about AERGO.<br><br>Q: Partnerships with several youtubers, known and upcoming ones. (It might cost some money but at this point, its a bull market. Spread the word, why are we missing this chance, even if the projects aren't done, spread the NEWS of the upcoming projects and then deliver)<br>A: We are working with our marketing agency to set up interviews and coverage by crypto influencers.</p><p>Q: Where is the updated Roadmap, please provide a concrete answer here.<br>A: We will be publishing our official roadmap within a&nbsp;week.</p><p>Q: Where are you on marketing, are you hiring someone to handle the different channels and keep twitter, reddit, facebook, website constantly updated with new and re-used information?<br>A: We have a great marketing agency that oversees our communication with the community. We will be doing more in the future with our website and create additional transparencies with the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Q: What happened with the Samsung Partnership, any new developments?<br>A: We are in talks, however with large companies such as Samsung, they are not flexible nor quick on decisions. We are leveraging our relationship as best as we can within their guidelines.</p><p>Q: What happened with the Hyundai partnership, any new developments?<br>A: There are many divisions of Hyundai. Hyundai Mobis, a SI company, works with Blocko to service Hyundai Group companies with blockchain solutions. Hyundai Motors is a customer of Blocko that utilizes AERGO Enterprise platform for used car part inventory tracking solution.</p><p>Q: How is the AERGO Hub being received? Any feedback received?<br>A: We have just opened our beta testing program and just started to collect feedback. We will be sharing the feedback with the community soon.</p><p>Q: Would a buyback option be available in the future?<br>A: This is an option that can be considered in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Q: Would you buy ad slots on Coinmarketcap to promote AERGO.<br>A: At AERGO Mainnet launch we did purchase ads on Coinmarketcap website, however the return on investment was not high. We may consider again in the future major events. We do however send regular signals on Blockfolio.</p><p>Q: Can the website be updated with current news and information?<br>A: Current news and information are always posted on the website. We are looking into making it more easily&nbsp;visible.</p><p>Q: How do you feel about doing promotions on Twitter to spread the recognition of this coin, giveaway or something.<br>A: We would be open to ideas. We have done giveaways on AMAs in the past that were promoted on&nbsp;Twitter.</p><p>Q: New listings, we know you mentioned Coinbase, did you apply? What happened there? What about other exchanges, US consumers have no way to buy this coin.<br>A: Exchanges have very strict NDA regarding listings. All we can say at this point is that one of our goals is to list on an US based exchange.</p><p>Q: Thoughts on partnerships with other coins?<br>A: Yes, this is something we are brainstorming. If you have any ideas, we would definitely be open to hearing about them. We do not want to just announce a partnership for the sake of pumping the token price. We would like to do a real partnership where it can scale in the future and sustain a high token&nbsp;price.</p><p>Q: Have partnerships also promote AERGO, as it stands most partnerships just mention Blocko but never AERGO.<br>A: Press releases with Blocko’s customers are very tricky. Most of the high profile customers go through their PR department reviews. Mentioning themselves, and their SI partner is easy, but adding a 3rd party company into press releases is difficult.</p><p>Q: More community involvement and most of all ACTIVE social media handles. (Not a post here and then 2 or 3 weeks later another post)<br>A: We have AERGO Knights that we support to do posts for us, as well as our marketing agency. Time to time, AERGO team members participate in the official channels.</p><p>Q: Are you able to hire a company to handle the social media side who is able to be ACTIVE and constantly remind old users and new users alike of what is being worked on and what has been done already.<br>A: We are actively doing this, but we could do this more frequently.</p><p>Q: The United Nations bought 2.8M LTO coins (similar project to AERGO) and is going to use it for a digital land registry in Afghanistan. That is proof that huge organizations and governments are not afraid of blockchain tech any more. The AERGO team can use it as an argument in negotiations with companies. AERGO was going to do some land registry as well. What is the progress? Will it / does it use AERGO mainnet?<br>A: Every country has different laws regarding certification of documents. Just because one country uses blockchain one way, does not mean another country will adopt their policy. The Korean government does not yet recognize certification through public blockchain, however they do recognize private blockchain usage with certain licenses in place. Blocko was able to install AERGO Enterprise for a Korean land registry to certify land deeds to thwart forged deeds. Until the laws in Korea are changed, which we currently see changes in the right direction, we can only service the customers with their current needs. But, the good news is that Blocko and AERGO are positioned with our customers, should the day public blockchain usage becomes certified.<br><br>Q: AERGO knows that they are partners of Samsung. But do Samsung know that they are partners of AERGO? Is AERGO really a partner of Samsung or is it just a marketing thingy?<br>A: Yes, Samsung knows AERGO is a partner of their Samsung Blockchain Wallet. Contracts were signed to be listed on the wallet. We continue to discuss programs that we can implement to promote both AERGO and their Blockchain wallet.</p><p>Q: Forbes is mentioning Samsung and its Nexledger on the Blockchain 50 list each year. Is there some way we could be mentioned instead/ next to Nexledger in the list?<br>A: I believe the answer is no, as Nexledger is Samsung SDS’&nbsp;product.</p><p>Q: What is the strategy for AERGO in Korea? Won-Beom Kim shared there is one. Why do most Koreans not know about AERGO in its own region?<br>A: We have stepped up our marketing in Korea to the crypto investor community. AERGO is more widely known in the Enterprise segment versus consumer&nbsp;segment.</p><p>Q: Why not do live AMA’s with big youtube influencers like BOXMINING OR IVAN ON TECH&nbsp;?<br>A: We can look into doing AMAs with influencers, however we are mindful of not spending our marketing budget on everything. Influencers are expensive and we need to be strategic with our budgets.<br><br><br>Q: A weekly or bi weekly summary of what’s been worked on will be useful for keeping the community updated on progress. For example A timeline for all the projects that AERGO is working on like ISDB, DTT, CCCV.<br>A: We will consider making a dashboard to show progress of our projects/timelines.</p><p>Q: Where is the updated roadmap?<br>A: It will be published before the end of February.</p><p>Q: Why no marketing is being done?<br>A: Marketing is being done regularly, as we have an agency that helps us with marketing AERGO.</p><p>Q: What happened to the Samsung partnership?<br>A: We have a great relationship and will continue to find joint projects.</p><p>Q: Request to reduce supply to 50m from 500m in the ratio of 10:1 like algorand<br>A: Could you supply a compelling reason for this technically, and not just for token price&nbsp;pumping?</p><p>Q: What is AERGO’s plan to increase community engagement and draw in developers to build on mainnet and drive network effect<br>A: We are hoping to do this with our AERGO Hub product. We will also create programs that incubate compelling developer/projects on AERGO<br><br><br>Q: Are there any plans for community events?<br>A: We are looking into online&nbsp;events.</p><p>Q: What is this year's roadmap? We were told the team is working on releasing it soon<br>A: Roadmap will be published within the month of&nbsp;February</p><p>Q: Have u thought about renewing the brand? New website, Logo etc.?<br>A: We are looking to refresh with easier view of relevant information</p><p>Q: What date will the roadmap be released? The team has been saying we’ll let you know for weeks. It’s been almost 2 months since the new year and halfway into the quarter. We need a date.<br>A: The roadmap will be published in the month of&nbsp;February</p><p>Q: What’s happening with Samsung DeFi partnership? There was meant to be a competition to promote dapps being built on AERGO. What is the update&nbsp;?<br>A: We are currently working on the fine&nbsp;details.</p><p>Q: What do you plan specifically in terms of marketing? Blog on website, reddit, etc.?<br>A: We have published a steady stream of blogs and updates. We have not published on Reddit, however we are looking into assigning someone to this. Also looking frequently into micro promotions.</p><p>Q: Jae Shin mentioned that the team hopes for Korean government to start to recognize crypto currencies as a security. What is the reason for this?<br>A: Currently cryptocurrencies are not recognized in Korea as a form of security. This prevents banks from using crypto as a form of monetary instrument nor a need for custody. As many countries are not recognizing crypto as a security, this holds back many services from using crypto as a replacement for&nbsp;fiat.</p><p>Q: How many tokens are currently staked?<br>A: Currently there are 48 million AERGO tokens staked, which is about 9.6% of circulating supply.</p><p>Q: What separates AERGO from other leading enterprise blockchains and platforms?<br>A: Unlike other Enterprise Blockchains, it has entered the real business market with a partner called BLOCKO and has the ability to expand further. BLOCKO supports easy interworking between Private Blockchain and Public Blockchain through solutions such as AERGO Enterprise Manager.</p><p>Q: Is AERGO/Blocko looking at implementing DeFi? To clarify, I'm aware of the KDAC/Kobit move. I'm talking about yield farming within AERGO, or if AERGO would look at lending, loaning, insurance provision or being an aggregator?<br>A: AERGO/BLOCKO has no plans to directly develop DeFi and issue tokens. However, AERGO is preparing for the DeFi/Dapp Contest and Incubation, and is looking forward to creating a new business based on the AERGO mainnet.<br><br><br>Q: Are there any plans to list AERGO tokens on Uniswap? If yes, what is the status and when can we expect to see AERGO on Uniswap?<br>A&nbsp;: The AERGO Foundation does not provide liquidity directly to Uniswap. The community has listed AERGO pairs. You can check it by looking up the latest contract address (0x91Af0fBB28ABA7E31403Cb457106Ce79397FD4E6 ).</p><p>We appreciate all the questions you have asked the team and understand your concerns. 2021 has plenty in store for all of us, we will be releasing our updated roadmap soon so keep an eye out for that!

<p></p>
 💶 Cozy Banks 
<p>New banks and banking institutions have been added to your banking aggregator, <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Banks</a> (Revolut, N26, Natixis Interépargne (Epargne Salariale), etc.).</p>
<p></p> More than 90 banking institutions available and to be connected to your Cozy<p></p>
<p>The Banks application is also available on iOS and Android.</p>
<p><a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#bank"></a></p>
 🗒 Cozy Notes 
<p>While waiting for the possibility to add images in Notes, our team has implemented commands to enrich your notes with version 1.14.0 which includes :</p>
<p>✨ an improvement of the tables: cell merging , choice of column size, coloring of boxes<br>
✨ adding a date<br>
✨ the addition of blocks for code</p>
 Cozy Drive - web 
<p>✅ Guaranteeing you certified documents</p>
<p></p>Interface of documents certified by your Cozy<p></p>
<p>Your Cozy acts as a **trusted third party and certifies that the document conforms to the one uploaded, that it has not been modified. Each unmodified document appears today in your Drive folder with a marker of the brand (see the CAF example above).</p>
<p>It is a big job within our team and in the future, if for example when you present an invoice as proof of address when you register for your children's nursery or for a mortgage loan, your Cozy will guarantee to your contacts that it is indeed the original document, and that it is trustworthy. This functionality will be enhanced to guarantee you more "certified" documents. This is not currently the case.</p>
<p>✅ Making it easier for you to share folders with Drive and Notes</p>
<p>The collaborative sharing functionality in Drive is continuously improved.<br>
For example, by creating a new folder in your Drive, you can :</p>
 
 create a note (here: 20210216Mathematics courses - with Pythagoras Theorem as subject) 
 add a link to the definition of the Pythagorean theorem from the Wikipedia site. 
 add a link from another site to complete the folder you are going to share. 
 
<p></p> Shared folder interface with bookmarks<p></p>
<p>The Drive application is also available on iOS and Android (and also on apk😎)</p>

<p>Rebuilding our foundational infrastructure</p><p>We need to step into a phase of rebuilding. Rebuilding not towards what we had but towards an increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">antifragile</a> and empathetic society. This transition will require governments, institutions, companies, and associations to rethink and reconstruct the contextual settings [FIGURE 1] in which people operate - society’s platform for the future. It is increasingly clear how the micro molecular violences of late 20th century society e.g. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303796991_Association_between_neighbourhood_air_pollution_concentrations_and_dispensed_medication_for_psychiatric_disorders_in_a_large_longitudinal_cohort_of_Swedish_children_and_adolescents">air pollution</a>, <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-noise-pollution-biggest-health-city.html">noise pollution</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6751071/">light pollution</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759372/">household stresses</a>, <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/coronavirus-threatens-global-surge-malnutrition-jeopardizing-future-extra-10-million-children">nutrient decline</a>, etc. foundationally impact our mental health and wellbeing and thereby limit the collective capacity of our&nbsp;society.</p><p>Remaking our institutional, environmental and cultural contexts will be essential to the development of people’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities. In a time of complexity and uncertainty, these capacities provide foundational infrastructure for our 21st- and 22nd-century society and economy. They are of the highest priority during the nascent rebuilding phase.</p>Figure 1: Overview of the contextual settings that drive mental&nbsp;wealth<p>But how do we work towards rebuilding people’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities when there are increases in <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis">depression rates</a>, <a href="https://ki.se/en/nasp/the-coronavirus-risk-for-increased-suicide-and-self-harm-in-the-society-after-the-pandemic">suicides</a>, <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/4/statement-ed-phumzile-violence-against-women-during-pandemic?gclid=CjwKCAiAsaOBBhA4EiwAo0_AnHQc3UlX2TiO7ktE0pmu8edO0KPJwPrfz-jkreF1WkGz37JRJnPkKxoCbJcQAvD_BwE">domestic violence</a>, and <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/government-society-unemployment-covid19/">unemployment</a>? How do we rebuild public good and the ability to imagine another future when existential hope seems&nbsp;lost?</p><p>Drawing from our experiences across Sweden, Canada, and South Korea, we have identified five vital areas of focus during the rebuilding phase. This blog post examines key lessons that have been&nbsp;learned.</p><p>Five key take-aways</p> 1. Language and metrics for a systemic policy architecture <p>Through conversations and research it has become clear that the taxonomy of mental health is largely associated with treatment, failure to treat and the clinical space of operation. This reality has structurally limited our capacity to systemically perceive and allocate resources to prevention and perhaps more critically thriving. (We define thriving as the substantial improvement of mental health at a societal scale; an achievement equivalent to the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">20th century feat of doubling life expectancy</a>).</p><p>Further, if we are to rebuild a societal-scale and entangled infrastructure, we need to start by describing the same thing, using a shared language. Currently, our taxonomy landscape is not only varied, but also a driver of different objectives. Either it encourages the legitimate need to increase funding for treatment and support services or it encourages the genuine investment in deep prevention and thriving. A plurality of perspectives visible across contexts: New Zealand, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/05/new-zealand-is-publishing-its-first-well-being-budget/">Wellbeing Budget</a>; the World Health Organisation, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response">Mental Health</a>; the UK Government, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/292453/mental-capital-wellbeing-summary.pdf">Mental Capital and Wellbeing</a>; and the Swedish Government, <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2020/01/17-miljarder-for-att-framja-psykisk-halsa/">Psychological Health</a>.</p><p>We believe we currently don’t have the descriptors necessary to make a case to for this entangled infrastructure, thereby operating in a state of ambiguity and challenge, trying to chart a shared way forward. Therefore, our next step needs to be shared language and taxonomy; taking into account the nuanced cultural, historical, and contextual differences and the added complexity they generate.</p><p>In software engineering, <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/importance-of-ubiquitous-language-in-domain-driven">ubiquitous language</a> describes the idea of domain specific languages. While this is not directly comparable, it is possible to learn how shared language among actors in a single domain can enable rigorous and reliable communication between them, unlocking the potential for collective problem-solving. In the absence of existing terminology, we will refer to a shared language for society’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities as mental&nbsp;wealth.</p><p>In addition to providing clarity and direction, shared language can further encourage the design of shared metrics. These metrics help us understand the current mental wealth of a specific context, its evolution over time, and how it compares to other contexts. What is learned from data collection and analysis can inform the development of new policies that consider the entangled challenge of rebuilding our mental&nbsp;wealth.</p><p>There are already some metrics in place for mental health using <a href="https://delphis.org.uk/mental-health/continuum-mental-health/">zoning systems</a>. However, these are based on the individual scale while mental wealth is concerned with the societal scale. Once again, language becomes important. As mental wealth involves multiple actors and domains, we need to be able to make sense at scale, as well as across sectors and departments. Without this common ground, it becomes difficult to write cross-contextual policies. It seems to be that this is one of the reasons why a systemic policy architecture for mental wealth is nowhere to be&nbsp;seen.</p> 2. Investing in an entangled infrastructure <p>We believe that mental wealth can not be seen as a cost. Instead, it needs to be seen as an infrastructure enabled through societal-scale investments. By nature, mental wealth is a systemic problem, driven by multiple factors [FIGURE 2]. Investing in it requires us to move beyond short-return cycles and single-point investments. We need to co-curate portfolios of investments that are able to reach into the future, span across sectors and departments, and unlock innovation.</p>Figure 2: Drivers of mental health and wellbeing and the investment classes required to build mental&nbsp;wealth<p>Building a mental wealth portfolio requires us to focus on improving the contextual settings in which people operate. These settings create the foundation on which society’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities can develop. This could&nbsp;include:</p>  Increasing a community’s <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145305/green-space-is-good-for-mental-health#:~:text=The%20scientists%20found%20that%20citizens,substance%20abuse%20in%20later%20years.">nature-based areas</a>. For example, by introducing <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-aa141acdf227">urban&nbsp;forests</a>.  Reducing nighttime light pollution. For example, by adopting <a href="https://www.darksky.org/light-pollution/light-pollution-solutions/">dark-sky solutions</a>.  Supporting the availability of <a href="https://www.search-institute.org/our-research/youth-development-research/sparks-and-thriving/">sports and other activities</a>. For example, through initiatives like <a href="https://sparksgeneration.com/omoss/">Sparks Generation</a>.  Developing <a href="https://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/87573/E72015.pdf">non-polluting public transport</a> that provide citizens with access to their surroundings, as exemplified by <a href="https://www.drivesweden.net/en/news/mobility-service-watch-new-film">Mobility as a&nbsp;Service</a>.  <p>Each intervention of this type has spillover effects across sectors and departments. They require us to build the capacities and the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-elements-for-a-way-forward-c208787ab6ae">elements</a> that coordinate, measure, transact, pool, and aggregate the co-beneficiary results, their spillover effects, and their beneficiaries [FIGURE 3]. Without the ability to do this, we will struggle to invest in the entangled infrastructure of mental&nbsp;wealth.</p>Figure 3: Co-benefits, spillover effects, and beneficiaries of a community urban&nbsp;forest 3. An accounting framework for the&nbsp;future <p>It is often said that we make what we measure. If this is the case, there is a risk that investment in mental wealth could be under-prioritised as a result of missing metrics. Without them, we lack the data to build a case. More importantly, we are deprived of the ability to account for, drive, and value the co-beneficial results and spillover effects of a mental wealth portfolio.</p><p>For example, healthcare institutions know well how to account for the cost of treatment. They have done so for generations, with balance sheets remaining within health departments. However, when it comes to health budgets and accounting for prevention, it is unclear how they account, individually or collectively, for the costs and values created, especially as these often relate to future risks and the liabilities of not addressing the&nbsp;risks.</p><p>There is, then, a case for introducing an accounting framework that spans across silos and is able to account for the long-term effects of our mental wealth infrastructure, including benefits, risks, and liabilities. Values which might otherwise have <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">disappeared from the public good</a> become the very reason for investment in the first&nbsp;place.</p> 4. Capacity for horizontal collaboration <p>Unless we are able to build distributed capacity to collaborate and drive a co-beneficial thesis, we risk becoming permanently stuck in silos. Today, many of us are trained to optimise one silo at a time; a reality where the boundary of a problem is defined by the name of the department. However, mental wealth is a <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/wicked-problem/about/What-is-a-wicked-problem">wicked problem</a> that ignores and spans boundaries. It is necessary, therefore, that we build the human capacity to (re)organise for an entangled and dynamic&nbsp;system.</p><p>Governments need to be able to collaborate across multiple domains and actors, creating a shared portfolio of interventions to invest in. These should&nbsp;enable:</p>  Horizontal innovation across whole value&nbsp;chains.  Shared understanding of the portfolio created.  A foundation to make collective decisions  Distributed agency to move different interventions forward.  <p>This approach can move us beyond departmental and sectoral divisions and address the reality of a dynamic&nbsp;system.</p>Figure 4: The reinforcing feedback loop between horizontal collaboration and mental&nbsp;wealth<p>Building the human capacity to collaborate horizontally is, at the same time, dependent on our mental wealth. Without developing people’s social and emotional capacity, it becomes difficult to unlock complex collaboration. It is necessary, therefore, to design capacity-building processes that incorporate social and emotional training. Without it, we will struggle to implement co-beneficial solutions where the human is no longer optimised to be a ‘bad robot’ but, rather, a highly cognitive, emotional, and social&nbsp;being.</p><p>Horizontal collaboration further requires the enabling of cross-departmental and sectoral budgeting. The healthcare sector is facing a <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis">treatment crisis</a> and the education sector a <a href="https://en.unesco.org/news/education-not-cost-its-investment-recovery">learning crisis</a>. Asking these sectors to move significant budgets from doctors, nurses, and teachers in order to invest in an urban forest becomes problematic. Even in cases where it could <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-noise-pollution-biggest-health-city.html">prevent more people</a> from showing up at the socially distanced waiting rooms or from drifting away during an online class <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27922536/">owing to a neighbourhood’s poor air quality</a>. Therefore, we need to build the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-elements-for-a-way-forward-c208787ab6ae">elements</a> that allow us to pool funds horizontally. Allowing health and education sectors to use seed funding as a directional tool, inviting other investment-strong departments to follow and provide the societal-scale investments required.</p><p>Once the horizontal budget is on its way, we need to talk about procurement. Procurement is the most common tool for investing in infrastructures, especially in relation to the public sector. It has many upsides and downsides, laid out well by our colleague <a href="https://alastairparvin.medium.com/">Alastair Parvin</a> in ‘<a href="https://alastairparvin.medium.com/after-the-crisis-lets-fix-procurement-428c598fb558">After the Crisis</a>’. The most significant challenge regarding mental wealth is the ability to procure for co-beneficial outcomes across departments. The European Commission refers to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/public-procurement-reform-provides-explicit-rules-public-public-cooperation-0_en">public-public cooperation</a> as an enabler of contracts between departments without having to call for tender. However, it is clear that these corporations are still rare cases and do not allow the involvement of private bodies. This reality prompts the question: How do we increase procurement for co-beneficial outcomes within and beyond the public sector, for the public&nbsp;good?</p><p>We do not have all the answers to this question. However, we have shared initial thoughts about it in our ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">Bridging the Investment</a>’ series and look forward to continuing to unpack how to enable horizontal collaboration for mental&nbsp;wealth.</p> 5. Insuring societal scale innovation <p>Today large investment goes towards treatment related innovation. However, the societal scale innovation required to rebuild an entangled infrastructure goes beyond treatment and sits between sectors and departments. Traditional financing models for grants and public funding struggles to provide the speed or quantity of capital required to bridge this innovation gap. Impact investing also falls short, as risk models cannot price the scale or nature of the societal solutions required. As such, innovation for mental wealth tends to fall outside eligibility criteria.</p><p>Therefore, we ask ourselves: how do we fund at speed the scale of the necessary innovation? The answer may not lie in innovation itself, but in the ability to dynamically match innovation to future and societal scaled liabilities. In an age of complexity and uncertainty, the matching of these liabilities with potential hedges or solutions is a structural issue for innovation financing. It is what is called a settlement risk and unless we bridge the risk between liability holders and innovators we might not be able to ensure the societal scaled innovation required to rebuild our mental&nbsp;wealth.</p>Figure 5: financing ecosystems for multi-actor innovation capacity<p>There are still many questions related to how this could be done. Currently we are exploring the potential of creating financing ecosystems for multi-actor innovation capacity and a contract that can transfer the settlement risk to underwriters. At the centre of such an ecosystem, a Public Interest Trust operates to 1) pool the liabilities of mental illness and 2) aggregate the investment required to fund innovation for mental wealth. The high investment risk would be underwritten by grant and philanthropic funds, rather than being provided by them [FIGURE 5]. Thereby, larger investments can be attracted, creating a financial hedge against the settlement risk. Over time this hedge would be transformed into a natural hedge, as the innovation becomes the insurer of the liabilities.</p><p>Due to their size and density, cities are currently the main liability holders of mental wealth and innovators are the ones providing the solutions able to hedge these risks. Therefore, we see cities (including public, private and civic) and innovators (public, private and amateur) as the main actors in the ecosystem. An ecosystem, which we argue could help us bridge the innovation gap and support the systemic rebuilding of our mental wealth [FIGURE&nbsp;6].</p>Figure 6: Enabling the rebuilding of Psychological Wealth Moving towards rebuilding <p>As we look forward to a society that no longer favours precariousness and starts rebuilding an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile">antifragile</a> foundation for mental wealth, we recognise the need of a “<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-necessity-of-a-boring-revolution-a71b1ae6f956">boring revolution</a>”. A revolution focused on delivering a co-beneficial economy that transitions our contextual settings. A revolution of how we account, how we bridge silos and how we invest in societal infrastructures.</p><p>Our mental wealth is the foundational entangled infrastructure that enables society to build back better. It is an infrastructure in need of a revolution to manifest and without it, we will not be able to create the inclusive societal capacities that unlock the full potential of our 21st-century and 22nd-century reality.</p><p>This is a revolution necessary for the future and of equivalence to the late 19th century/20th century revolution of public health which yielded the 2nd industrial revolution.</p><p>We are grateful having had the chance to explore these questions with passionate people.

  <p>As game creators, we hold a fundamental responsibility to protect and secure any and all data that our players entrust to us. Historically, security in games has not been high on the priority list because games were enjoyed anonymously and offline. But with our society becoming ever more connected, demand for social gaming experiences and online gaming features has increased exponentially. This has led to the development of cloud-based gaming platforms, such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/what-is-playfab">PlayFab</a>, that handle everything from multiplayer server hosting, leaderboard tracking, virtual economy, data/analytics, and much more. Even games that are mostly considered “offline” are seeing increased demand for some connected functionality. As more games are developed in the cloud (or developed with cloud-based platforms) and track an increasingly large amount of user data, security is becoming one of the highest priorities for the games community.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In their 2020 <a href="https://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/soti-security-gaming-you-cant-solo-security-report-2020.pdf">State of the Internet / Security</a> report, Akamai tracked 100 Billion credential stuffing attacks from June 2018 to June 2020 and found that 10 Billion of these attacks were targeted at gamers. It is not just up to the player or the distribution platform to take security seriously. Players expect that the game companies producing the product that they are trusting their data to will also be keeping them secure.</p>

<p>In <a>Identity Security for Games in C# with Unity</a>, we took a look at the extreme basics of storing and authenticating users in a Unity project. That example is a great starting point for the fundamentals, providing a “hello world” concept within the Unity editor. I want to expand upon how the design can change depending on the build target and how to make use of a player’s authorization by passing it into other back-end platforms. To do this, we will be building a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-gettingstarted.html">WebGL</a> application in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> that authenticates player’s and authorizes them to <a href="https://playfab.com/">Azure Playfab</a>; where their player data will be stored. Here is a conceptual overview of what this will look like:</p>

<p></p>

 Prerequisites 

 
   Sign up for a free <a href="https://developer.playfab.com/en-US/sign-up">Azure Playfab account</a>. 
   
    <p>Sign up for a free <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Azure account</a>.</p>
   
   Download and install <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. 
   Create a new Unity project from Unity Hub with the 3D template 
   Download and configure the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/sdks/unity3d/quickstart">Playfab Unity SDK and Editor Extensions</a> 
 

 Build Target and Design 

<p>For this project, I will be targeting <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-gettingstarted.html">Unity WebGL</a>. The build target is important because different platforms will require different means of facilitating user interaction.</p>

<p>In <a>Identity Security for Games in C# with Unity</a>, I described both native and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc">OAuth</a> design concepts. While building out a user interface for authentication natively in the engine might seem like the best approach because of user experience, it is not the preferred approach for security, and it typically adds much more effort for the developer. This is because it requires the developer to build out logic supporting the entire <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/#transaction-state">authentication state machine</a>; securely handling every event, every MFA state, registration, MFA enrollment, user self service (account unlock and password reset), etc.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Prebuilt widgets can simplify the amount of effort in this regard. However, developers would still be asking a player to enter their password into an untrusted UI that the developer is responsible for and typically not able to fully keep secure. This is why OAuth is considered the best practice standard for authorization within the security industry, and utilizing a security platform’s hosted login experience is considered the most secure way to handle authentication. Players will be entering their credentials into a trusted browser window and a trustworthy security platform. Best of all, developers can share the responsibility of keeping the login experience with the security platform, which is much easier and more secure than attempting to do it all themselves.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Ok, great. But how does this relate to the build target? The browser. OAuth relies on a browser to facilitate user authentication, which must validate the user identity before providing authorization. Every platform will have a different, platform-specific way of presenting the user with a browser to interact with. For WebGL, the game is already running in a browser, so a simple pop up is all that is needed. But if the build target were Android, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/multidevice/android/customtabs/">Chrome Custom Tabs</a> would instead be needed to embed the browser into the app. Similarly, if the build target was iOS, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller">Safari View Controller</a> would be needed to embed the browser into the app. For full-screen games on a PC, it would be better to use a <a href="https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/device-code/">device code</a> concept, similar to a TV or IoT device, or even authenticate the player before launching the game client; from an external launcher application interacting with the default browser on the operating system. The browser interaction and design will change for every platform and device. When designing the authentication experience, the build target will heavily influence the rest of the design.</p>

<p>The good news is that once the target is defined and the browser interaction decided, the rest of the code should be similar across all platforms. This is thanks to the shared responsibility with a security platform’s hosted login experience and a standardized authorization specification. The job of the developer is to securely provide a platform-preferred browser experience for the user and direct them to the OAuth authorize endpoint. Once the user has authenticated, the browser is closed, and an auth code is captured in client code to be exchanged for tokens behind the scenes. With tokens in hand, user authorization can be passed to all other backend cloud platforms; providing a centralized, and secure, identity security design that drastically simplifies the implementation effort.</p>

<p>With a build target in mind, lets look at how to code this in Unity.</p>

 Create the Project 

<p>First, if you have not already done so, create a new project from <code>Unity Hub</code> with the <code>3D</code> template.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, configure the Playfab Unity SDK and Editor Extensions using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/sdks/unity3d/quickstart">Unity Quickstart</a> provided by PlayFab.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Create a new scene by clicking File, New Scene and save it in the projects <code>Assets</code> &gt; <code>Scenes</code> folder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Change the project to targetWebGL by, clicking File, Build Settings, WebGL, and then click Switch Platform.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you did not install WebGL when you installed this copy of the editor, you would be prompted to do so now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure that your newly created scene is checked in the <code>Scenes In Build</code> menu, and then close the <code>Build Settings</code> UI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you do not see your scene, click the Add Open Scenes button in the bottom right of the <code>Scenes In Build</code> menu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right-click in the <code>Scene Hierarchy</code> panel and click UI, Button.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will be the button that triggers the authentication request.</p>

<p>Right click the button in the <code>Hierarchy</code> panel,  click Rename and name the button <code>Sign In.</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>Expand the <code>Sign In</code> button in the <code>Hierarchy</code> panel to expose its text object and select it.</p>

<p>Change the text of the button in the <code>Inspector</code> panel to <code>Sign In.</code></p>

<p></p>

 Interact With the Browser 

<p></p>

<p>With the project ready, the next thing needed is a way for the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-interactingwithbrowserscripting.html">WebGL object to interact with the browser</a> HTML that is holding it. This is because the C# in Unity will be called when the user clicks the <code>Sign In</code> button and that C# code needs to instruct the browser to render a popup window for the user to complete authentication.</p>

<p>To do this, a jslib is used to act as the middleman between the C# in Unity and the JavaScript in the WebGL objects parent page.</p>

<p>Open up a preferred text editor, create a new file called <code>OAuth.jslib</code>, and save it in your project’s <code>Assets</code> &gt; <code>Plugins</code> folder.</p>

<p>Add the following to <code>OAuth.jslib</code> and save it.</p>

   <code>mergeInto(LibraryManager.library, 
{
        startAuthentication: function (utf8String) 
        {
                var authRequest = UTF8ToString(utf8String);
                var authorizationRequest = authRequest;
                startAuth(authorizationRequest);
        }
});
</code>   

<p>This code very simply takes an OAuth authorization request URI, passed to it from the calling C# in Unity, and passes it to a corresponding startAuth() function in the parent page’s JavaScript. This <code>startAuth()</code> function will instruct the browser to open a popup and redirect to the OAuth authorization URI passed to it by the C# in Unity. The WebGL object calls the jslib which runs in the browser, allowing it to interact with the code running in the browser where the WebGL object cant.</p>

<p>Next, create the <code>startAuth()</code> function in the JavaScript within the WebGL’s parent page so that the C# can interact with it via the <code>OAuth.jslib</code>. To do this, start by building the WebGL project in Unity, which will generate an <code>index.html</code> that renders the WebGL object.</p>

<p>Click File, Build Settings and then click Build.</p>

<p>Select a preferred output folder and then click Select Folder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the build process is complete, open the output folder and then open the <code>index.html</code> file in a preferred text editor. The contents of <code>index.html</code> may vary depending on if you are on Windows or Mac and depending on what version of the editor you are using. The important thing to note in what Unity generates is that there should be a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element towards the top of the HTML that contains the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;script&gt;
        var unityInstance = UnityLoader.instantiate("unityContainer", "Build/WebGL2.json", {onProgress: UnityProgress});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p><code>unityInstance</code> is the container that holds the WebGL object. This is how the page’s JavaScript will be able to call back to the C# code in Unity using:</p>

   <code>unityInstance.SendMessage(objectName, methodName, value);
</code>   

<p>Find the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags in the HTML and locate the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag. Right before the closing tag, at the end of body, add the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;script&gt;
function startAuth(authorizationRequest) 
{
        window.addEventListener('message', function (e) 
        {
                unityInstance.SendMessage("OAuth2", "getAuthResults", data);
        }, false);

        var childwin;
        const childname = "Authenticate";
        childwin = window.open(authorizationRequest, childname, 'height=300px, width=500px');

        childwin.focus();
};
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is the JavaScript function that the <code>Sign In</code> button in the WebGL object will trigger. The button does this by first calling a function in C# on its click event. That function will then call the <code>OAuth.jslib</code> which will then call this <code>startAuth()</code> function in the page JavaScript. This represents the best way for WebGL to provide browser interaction to the player from within the WebGL object.</p>

   <code>window.addEventListener('message', function (e) 
{
        unityInstance.SendMessage("OAuth2", "getAuthResults", data);
}, false);
</code>   

<p><code>window.addEventListener()</code> creates an event listener that will be called by a child popup window when authentication is complete. The result of authentication will be an <code>Auth Code</code> sent back to the C# in the WebGL object via <code>unityInstance.SendMessage()</code>.</p>

   <code>var childwin;
const childname = "Authenticate";
childwin = window.open(authorizationRequest, childname, 'height=300px, width=500px');
</code>   

<p>With the event listener ready, <code>window.open()</code> is used to create a popup window to the OAuth authorization request URI.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>childwin.focus();</code> ensures that the popup focuses on the user to interact with.</p>

<p>Now that the WebGL’s parent page can initiate the authentication process and wait for a response from the authentication process, the next thing that is needed is a separate <code>callback.html</code> page for the OAuth authorization server to redirect the user back to after authentication. Because the authentication process is happening in the parent pages popup window, the <code>callback.html</code> page will also be rendered after authentication is successful. This will allow the <code>callback.html</code> page to receive the resulting <code>Auth Code</code> and send it back to the parent page via the event listener.</p>

<p>In the same folder as <code>index.html</code> create a new file called <code>callback.html</code> using a preferred text editor. The HTML in this page should be designed based on project needs, but it typically will not be rendered long enough for a player to see it. Add the following and customize the HTML as desired:</p>

   <code> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en-us"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        //Parse query string helper function
        function getParameterByName(name, url = window.location.href) 
        {
                name = name.replace(/[\[\]]/g, '\\$&amp;');
                var regex = new RegExp('[?&amp;]' + name + '(=([^&amp;#]*)|&amp;|#|$)'), results = regex.exec(url);

                if (!results) 
                {
                        return null;
                }

                if (!results[2]) 
                {
                        return '';
                }

                    return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace(/\+/g, ' '));
        }

        //Get auth code from query string
        var code = getParameterByName('code');
        //Get state from query string
        var state = getParameterByName('state');

        window.opener.postMessage(code + "," + state, "*")
     
        try 
        {
                window.close();
        }
        catch (e) { console.log(e) }

        try 
        {
                self.close();
        }
        catch (e) { console.log(e) }       
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p><code>getParameterByName()</code> is a helper function that will parse the <code>Auth Code</code> and OAuth <code>State</code> from the query string.</p>

<p><code>window.opener.postMessage()</code> sends the <code>State</code> and <code>Auth Code</code> to the parent window’s event listener so that it can send them back to a callback function in the WebGL’s C#.</p>

<p>Finally, the popup window is closed, putting the player back on the parent page where the WebGL object is waiting for authentication to complete.</p>

<p>With the browser portion of the project complete, the next step is to create the OAuth code in Unity that will be called by the <code>Sign In</code> button’s on click event.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Now that customizations have been made to <code>index.html</code>, it will need to be backed up and replaced every time the project is built because Unity will overwrite it each time.</p>
</blockquote>

 Adding OAuth 

 Configure an Authorization Server 

<p>Many OAuth authorization solutions exist today. <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> is the industry-leading, best of breed, identity security platform on the market and allows for creating an unlimited number of OAuth Authorization servers quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Okta provides the easy-to-use <a>Okta CLI</a>, which will simplify the registration and setup process. First, <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Install the Okta CLI</a> for your preferred operating system. With the CLI installed, run the following command:</p>

   <code>okta register
</code>   

<p>Follow the instructions to register for a new Okta account. The CLI will handle the Okta configuration automatically. If you already have an Okta account use the following command instead:</p>

   <code>okta login
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: <code>okta login</code> requires a valid <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/create-the-token/">Okta API Token</a> to be entered. This will be stored in the CLI’s <code>okta.yaml</code> file locally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, run the following command to set up an OAuth app.</p>

   <code>okta apps create
</code>   

<p>Give the app a name, and select option 2, <code>Single Page App</code>, for the application type.</p>

<p>The <code>Redirect URI</code> needs to point to where the <code>callback.html</code> page will be hosted. Use the following URI format, replacing <code>appName</code> with a name that will be used later when deploying the Unity project to Azure App Services.</p>

<p><code>https://appName.azurewebsites.net/callback.html</code></p>

<p>The <code>Post Logout Redirect URI</code> will need to point to where the <code>index.html</code> page will be hosted. Use the following URI format, again replacing <code>appName</code> with a name used later when deploying the Unity project to Azure App Services.</p>

<p><code>https://appName.azurewebsites.net/callback.html</code></p>

<p>Finally, select the <code>default</code> authorization server if prompted.</p>

<p>The CLI will create the application and return an <code>Issuer</code> along with a <code>Client ID.</code> Make sure to take note of both which will be used when creating the OAuth script.</p>

<p></p>

 Create the OAuth Script 

<p>In Unity, install <a href="https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity">Newtonsoft.Json for Unity</a> using the instructions outlined in the library repo.</p>

<p>Next, create a new folder in the <code>Assets</code> folder and name it <code>Scripts</code>.</p>

<p>Right Click in the scripts folder, click Create, and then select C# Script. Name the script <code>OAuth</code> and double click to open it in Visual Studio.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Start by referencing the following libraries:</p>

   <code>using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using UnityEngine.Networking;
</code>   

<p>Next, create a new class called <code>OAuth</code> and declare the needed instance variables to hold the client’s OAuth configuration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The instance variables could pull from a preferred configuration solution, or be exposed to the editor for configuration if desired.</p>
</blockquote>

   <code>public class OAuth2 : MonoBehaviour
{
    [DllImport("__Internal")]
    private static extern void startAuthentication(string authRequest);

    // OAuth2 Client Configuration
    private const string clientID = "{clientId}";
    private const string authorizationEndpoint = "/oauth2/default/v1/authorize";
    private const string tokenEndpoint = "/oauth2/default/v1/token";
    private const string userInfoEndpoint = "/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo";
    private const string redirectURI = "https://appName.azurewebsites.net/callback.html";

    private string state;
    private string code_verifier;
}
</code>   

<p>Notice <code>DllImport</code> referencing the <code>startAuthentication()</code> function from the jslib at the start of the class. This is importing the jslib so that it can be called from the script.</p>

<p>The OAuth endpoints to be used are defined in the instance variables and the URI to the <code>callback.html</code>.</p>

<p>Enter the <code>Okta Domain</code> for your Okta org where indicated in the code above. Change <code>appName</code> in the <code>redirectURI</code> variable to match the app name used when configuring the approved redirectURI in Okta. Remember, this app name will be used later when hosting the project on Azure App Services.</p>

<p>Create a new function called <code>Authenticate()</code> to be called by the <code>Sign In</code> button’s on click event.</p>

   <code>public void Authenticate()
{
        // Generates state and PKCE values.
        state = randomDataBase64url(32);
        code_verifier = randomDataBase64url(32);
        string code_challenge = base64urlencodeNoPadding(sha256(code_verifier));
        const string code_challenge_method = "S256";

        // Creates the OAuth 2.0 authorization request.
        string authorizationRequest = string.Format("{0}?response_type=code&amp;scope=openid%20profile&amp;redirect_uri={1}&amp;client_id={2}&amp;state={3}&amp;code_challenge={4}&amp;code_challenge_method={5}",
            authorizationEndpoint,
            System.Uri.EscapeDataString(redirectURI),
            clientID,
            state,
            code_challenge,
            code_challenge_method);

        startAuthentication(authorizationRequest);
} 
</code>   

<p>The first thing that <code>Authenticate()</code> does is prepare the OAuth Authorization request. This is the request sent to the jslib, and then to the JavaScript running in the browser. The player will be redirected to this URI in a browser popup.</p>

<p><a>Authorization Code grant with PKCE</a> is the most secure and preferred OAuth grant to use. Historically, OAuth has required a client secret to be passed in the authorization request from the client. This design worked fine for back-end services that could securely store the client secret but is flawed in the case of SPA-type applications that do not have a back end. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636">Proof Key for Code Exchange</a> (PKCE) was created as a way to remove the need for the client secret altogether. A <code>code_verifier</code> is randomly generated by <code>Authenticate()</code> and then hashed with SHA-256 to create a <code>code_challenge</code>. The code challenge is what replaces the client secret and the code verifier is what will be used to validate the request for tokens after authentication.</p>

<p>Next, <code>Authenticate()</code> builds the authorization request URI with all of the required parameters - including the code challenge, a randomly generated state string, and a redirect uri pointing to the <code>callback.html</code> - and passes it to the jslib <code>startAuthentication()</code> function so that it can be passed to the browser for the popup to navigate to.</p>

<p>Once the popup is displayed, the user authenticates and is redirected back to the <code>callback.html</code> page with an OAuth <code>Auth Code</code> and exact copy of the <code>State</code> string that was included in the authorization request. The <code>callback.html</code> uses <code>window.opener.postMessage(code + "," + state, "*")</code> to send the <code>Auth Code</code> and <code>State</code> back to the parent page holding the WebGL object which triggers the event listener to call <code>unityInstance.SendMessage("OAuth2", "getAuthResults", data);</code>. <code>SendMessage()</code> needs to call a function in the OAuth2 class called <code>getAuthResults()</code>, which will process the authorization results and exchange the auth code for tokens. Add the following code to <code>OAuth.cs</code>:</p>

   <code>public void getAuthResults(string authResult)
{
        string[] s = authResult.Split(',');

        string code = s[0]; // Auth code from javascript
        string incoming_state = s[1]; //state from javascript

        Debug.Log(code);
        Debug.Log(state);

        if (incoming_state != state)
        {
                Debug.Log(String.Format("Received request with invalid state ({0})", incoming_state));
                return;
        }

        performCodeExchange(code, code_verifier, redirectURI);
}
</code>   

<p>This function simply receives the results from the authorization request and parses them. The next step is to exchange the <code>Auth Code</code> for an OAuth <code>Access Token</code> and <code>ID Token.</code></p>

   <code>void performCodeExchange(string code, string code_verifier, string redirectURI)
{
        Debug.Log("Exchanging code for tokens...");

        //Generate token request
        string tokenRequestBody = string.Format("code={0}&amp;redirect_uri={1}&amp;client_id={2}&amp;code_verifier={3}&amp;scope=openid&amp;grant_type=authorization_code",
            code,
            System.Uri.EscapeDataString(redirectURI),
            clientID,
            code_verifier);

        UnityWebRequest uwr = new UnityWebRequest(tokenEndpoint, "POST");
        var contentBytes = new UTF8Encoding().GetBytes(tokenRequestBody);
        uwr.uploadHandler = new UploadHandlerRaw(contentBytes);
        uwr.downloadHandler = new DownloadHandlerBuffer();

        uwr.SetRequestHeader("content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");

        Debug.Log("TOKEN REQUEST BODY: " + tokenRequestBody);

        UnityWebRequestAsyncOperation async = uwr.SendWebRequest();
        async.completed += (AsyncOperation op) =&gt; { GetTokenExchangeResponse(async); };
}
</code>   

<p>A token request is created using the <code>auth code</code> and <code>code verifier</code>. <code>UnityWebRequest()</code> is used to handle the token request, and the response is sent to a function called <code>GetTokenExchangeResponse()</code> once complete. Create <code>GetTokenExchangeResponse()</code> by adding the following code:</p>

   <code>private void GetTokenExchangeResponse(UnityWebRequestAsyncOperation op)
{
        Debug.Log("Got Token Response");
        string responseText = op.webRequest.downloadHandler.text;
        Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; tokenEndpointDecoded = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;&gt;(responseText);
        string access_token = tokenEndpointDecoded["access_token"];
        string idToken = tokenEndpointDecoded["id_token"];

        PlayFabInterface.Instance.LoginWithOpenIdConnect(idToken);
}
</code>   

<p><code>GetTokenExchangeResponse()</code> simply parses the OAuth <code>Access Token</code> and OAuth <code>ID Token</code> from the response to the token request made by <code>performCodeExchange()</code>. The last line of the function sends the OAuth <code>ID Token</code> to <code>PlayFabInterface.Instance.LoginWithOpenIdConnect()</code> so that it can be used to log the player into PlayFab, which is the last step in this project before it can be deployed.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>Authenticate()</code> referenced a few helper functions for generating the code challenge\verifier, encryption, and encoding.</p>

   <code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns URI-safe data with a given input length.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="length"&gt;Input length (nb. output will be longer)&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string randomDataBase64url(uint length)
{
        RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
        byte[] bytes = new byte[length];
        rng.GetBytes(bytes);
        return base64urlencodeNoPadding(bytes);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns the SHA256 hash of the input string.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="inputString"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static byte[] sha256(string inputString)
{
        byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(inputString);
        SHA256Managed sha256 = new SHA256Managed();
        return sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Base64url no-padding encodes the given input buffer.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="buffer"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string base64urlencodeNoPadding(byte[] buffer)
{
        string base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(buffer);

        // Converts base64 to base64url.
        base64 = base64.Replace("+", "-");
        base64 = base64.Replace("/", "_");
        // Strips padding.
        base64 = base64.Replace("=", "");

        return base64;
}
</code>   

 Log Into PlayFab 

 Configure PlayFab OIDC 

<p>Before PlayFab can accept authorization tokens from Okta, a new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/playfab/admin/authentication/createopenidconnection?view=playfab-rest">Open ID Connection</a> will need to be created. This is the connection that will give PlayFab the needed information to validate the player’s ID Token.</p>

<p>Log into your PlayFab portal and click on the title for your project. If you do not have a <code>Studio</code> or <code>Title</code> created, create them now. The studio and title would have been needed for the PlayFab Unity SDK setup.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click the gear next to the title name in the top left and select Title Settings.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the <code>Open ID Connect</code> tab and select New Connection</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the <code>New Connection</code> menu, name the Connection ID <code>Okta</code> and enter the <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Issuer</code> from the app set up by the Okta CLI. <code>Client Secret</code> is not used because of <code>PKCE </code>, so enter any random string into the <code>Client Secret</code> box in PlayFab. Finally, PlayFab is just validating an ID Token from an external authorization server so nonce is not needed here. Check <code>Ignore nonce</code> and click Save Connection.</p>

<p></p>

<p>PlayFab is now able to validate ID Tokens from the OAuth Authorization Server in Okta.</p>

 Create the PlayFab Interface Script 

<p>Now that the player has successfully authenticated, the last step is to authorize the player to PlayFab using the ID token received after authentication.</p>

<p>In Unity, right click in the <code>Assets</code> &gt; <code>Scripts</code> folder and select Create, C# Script. Name the script PlayFabInterface.cs and double click to open the script in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Start the script with the following using statements:</p>

   <code>using UnityEngine;
using PlayFab;
using PlayFab.ClientModels;
</code>   

<p>Next, create a new class called <code>PlayFabInterface</code>:</p>

   <code>public class PlayFabInterface : MonoBehaviour
{
}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>LoginWithOpenIdConnect()</code> function:</p>

   <code>public void LoginWithOpenIdConnect(string _idToken)
{
        Debug.LogError("LoginWithOpenIDConnect Start! Token: " + _idToken);
        var request = new LoginWithOpenIdConnectRequest();
        request.ConnectionId = "Okta";
        request.IdToken = _idToken;
        request.CreateAccount = true;

        PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithOpenIdConnect(request, OIDCLoginSuccess, OIDCLoginFailure, _idToken);
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, handle the results:</p>

   <code>public void OIDCLoginSuccess(LoginResult _result)
{
        Debug.Log("Login With OIDC Success");
}

public void OIDCLoginFailure(PlayFabError _error)
{
        Debug.LogError("Login With OIDC Failure");
        Debug.LogError(_error.GenerateErrorReport());
}
</code>   

<p>The user will now log into PlayFab using their ID Token from the OAuth Authorization Server in Okta.</p>

 Wire It Up 

<p>Now that the authentication logic exists, it just needs to be triggered. The <code>Sign In</code> button created earlier will need to call the <code>Authenticate()</code> function from its on-click event. The <code>OAuth.cs</code> and <code>PlayFabInterface.cs</code> scripts will also need to be added to a game object in the scene.</p>

<p>In Unity, right-click in the scene <code>Hierarchy</code> panel and then click Create Empty. Rename the game object to <code>OAuth.</code></p>

<p></p>

<p>Drag the <code>OAuth.cs</code> and <code>PlayFabInterface.cs</code> scripts from the <code>Scripts</code> folder and onto the empty game object in the <code>Hierarchy</code> panel.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the <code>Hierarchy</code> panel, expand the <code>Canvas</code> object holding your <code>Sign In</code> button, and then select the <code>Sign In</code> button.</p>

<p>In the <code>Inspector</code> panel, find the <code>On Click()</code> box and drag the <code>OAuth</code> game object onto it. Select the function dropdown, click OAuth2, and then click Authenticate().</p>

<p></p>

<p>The button will now call the <code>Authenticate()</code> function in OAuth.cs when the player clicks it.</p>

 Deploy to Azure App Services 

<p>Because of the jslib and browser code’s complexity, this project cannot be run from the editor directly. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/">Azure App Services</a> makes the deployment of the entire project easy.</p>

<p>First, back up your <code>index.html</code> and <code>callback.html</code> files.</p>

<p>In Unity, click File, Build Settings and then click Build to rebuild the project. Select the desired output folder and click Select Folder.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to the output folder selected and overwrite the <code>index.html</code> and <code>callback.html</code> files with the ones you backed up previously.</p>

<p>Open a preferred text editor, create a new file in the output folder called <code>web.config</code>, and add the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;system.webServer&gt;
    &lt;staticContent&gt;
      &lt;mimeMap fileExtension=".unityweb" mimeType ="TYPE/SUBTYPE" /&gt;
    &lt;/staticContent&gt;
  &lt;/system.webServer&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code>   

<p>This web config file will make sure that the WebGL object is properly loaded when hosted.</p>

<p>Next, open Visual Studio and click Continue without code from the startup wizard.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click File, Open, Web Site and select the output folder where the <code>index.html</code> and <code>callback.html</code> are located.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click Build, Publish Web App, and then click Start on the <code>Publish</code> tab. Select <code>Azure</code> and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select <code>Azure App Service</code> and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Create New Azure App Service.</p>

<p>Give the app the name used when setting up the <code>RedirectURI</code> in the Okta CLI where the placeholder was <code>appName.</code> This example used <code>https://webgloauth.azurewebsites.net/</code>, so the app name to use in Azure is <code>WebGLOAuth.</code></p>

<p>Select a valid subscription, click New to create a new resource group, click New to create a new hosting plan, and then click Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>With the new app selected in the publish menu, click Finish.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Before clicking <code>Publish,</code> make sure that the <code>Site URL</code> in the <code>Summary</code> section matches the DNS that was defined in the Okta CLI during the app setup for the callback URI. This example used <code>https://webgloauth.azurewebsites.net/</code> and <code>https://webgloauth.azurewebsites.net/callback.html</code> which matches the <code>Site URL</code> in Visual Studio. This same callback URI also needs to be correctly defined in the instance variables in the <code>OAuth.cs</code> script in Unity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, click Publish to deploy the application to Azure App Services.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once publishing is complete, click the <code>Site URL</code> to navigate to the application and test it out.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Player security is quickly becoming one of the most critical aspects of game development today. More development is being done in the cloud, and more player data is being collected than ever before. While best practice for authentication and authorization is to use OAuth and a trusted security platform’s hosted login experience, the design to do this changes from one target platform to another. For Unity WebGL, you were able to interact with the WebGL’s parent page to render a popup that facilitated user authentication via your trusted cloud security platform, Okta. The resulting auth code was exchanged for tokens that can authorize the player to backend cloud platforms that your project is using; in this case, Azure PlayFab. Finally, you were able to host the project entirely on Azure App Services. The OAuth tokens used with PlayFab can authorize the user to other backend cloud platforms as needed, allowing for a convenient, centralized security design. The method used to facilitate browser interaction for WebGL will change with other target platforms, but the rest of the design would continue to be similar across all platforms.</p>

					 Start simple to scale decentralized identity 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  The market for decentralized identity is growing—and the key to that growth is to start simple, Indicio.tech’s CTO Ken Ebert, tells KuppingerCole Analysts.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>When beginning the journey toward decentralized identity deployment, “The simpler the system you make, the more likely you are to be successful.”</p>
<p>So said Indicio.tech Chief Technology Officer Ken Ebert in a <a href="https://youtu.be/AA-eYwiCXpg">recent presentation</a> to the leading European information security firm KuppingerCole Analysts.</p>
<p>In a simple deployment of decentralized identity, the relationship between credential issuer, credential verifier, and credential holder is already established. Because participants are determined by these relationships, we call this decentralized identity deployment a closed ecosystem. &nbsp;This allows for an iterative implementation in a controlled credential environment versus the chaos that can ensue with a larger scale roll-out.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the implementation of decentralized identity is viewed solely as a purely technology solution, but in reality, the technology solution is just one leg of a three-legged stool:</p>
 
 One leg does consist of the technology solution— the credential issuer, verifier and holder and the ability to write cryptographic messages to a digital ledger and retrieve them.
 
 Another is the business solution, namely, what is the problem that decentralized identity is working to solve? Who are the users and what is the benefit? How does it get funded?
 
 Finally, there is the governance solution, how do users get and use their credentials? How does a digital identity deployment comply with the ever-expanding global regulations on data stewardship? 
 
<p>In the case of a company call center, for example, credentials could be issued to a firm’s customers to speed transactions. If customer service can verify customer credentials in five seconds instead of 30, then that savings can be used to fund the continued adoption of decentralized identity. The technology serves to solve the business problem, and the governance is the closed ecosystem of the firm and its customers.</p>
<p>Not to be overlooked, Ebert says, is the role of marketing, both internal and external to ensure success. This includes at the most basic level communicating to users the pain points that decentralized identity will alleviate and hence its value proposition.</p>
<p>The bigger picture, said Ebert, is that marketing colleagues can help document messaging, synchronize press releases and announcements, and educate across the organization the benefits of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>During the course of an initial decentralized identity roll-out, new and expanded applications of the technology and process improvements will emerge. But again, Ebert stressed that expansion should proceed incrementally. The potential steps here are, going back to our call center example, increasing verifiers, issuers and credential holders to encompass more participants in the firm’s supply chain to decrease friction in performing routine transactions.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is such a transformative technology it’s easy to get lost in building a new world, rather than building something small, fixing one problem at a time, and learning how to expand from that experience. Simple deployments mean you get to fix actual problems in a way that drives buy-in from stakeholders. Try to boil the ocean of decentralized identity, and you risk getting burned.</p>
<p>Indicio.tech is committed to being a resource hub for decentralized identity, providing enterprise-grade open source tools to get our clients, and the community, building solutions today.

<p>As we settle into 2021, we are facing a new outlook. We now know that it is possible to manage most of our lives remotely thanks to digitalisation. The German government has been running a digitalization initiative now for some time, to achieve exactly that and enable citizens to take digital trips to the authorities out of the comfort of their homes. The declared goal is to conduct many public procedures digitally by the end of 2022, as stated by the Online Access Law (Onlinezugangsgesetz).</p>
<p>Digital trip to the authorities – but only with identity verification</p>
<p>Identification plays a key role in conducting all business from home, as applicants will need to prove their identity reliably during any public procedures. The necessary technology is already available; since 2017 the German electronic ID has been issued with the online functionality activated by default. Owners can use two-factor-authentication to identify themselves digitally and nowadays most smartphones are equipped with the required Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology, turning the smartphone into a card reader, to do exactly that. Just recently, the German government announced, that they are also looking into implementation of a digital identity card (the so called smart eID, read more about it <a href="https://www.personalausweisportal.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/Webs/PA/DE/2021/smart-eID-gesetz.html">here</a>), paving the road for e-government further.</p>
<p>A step in the right direction for Financial Services and other industries</p>
<p>Recent news aside, the technological groundwork has already been established and the digitalization initiative by the German government will be a trailblazer for the broader adoption of the electronic Identity Card. While the eID plays an important role for any authority relations, a lot of usage potential lies in other industries, where reliable identification is a core requirement for onboarding new clients. Financial Services, Gaming, Telecommunications and many more might embrace this simplified method of identity verification.</p>

<p>The HYPR Cloud Platform is now certified by two top virtualization leaders, VMware and Citrix, to help organizations take a true passwordless approach to secure today’s distributed workforce and improve productivity.</p>
      
<p>The partner integrations make remote login easier and truly passwordless across Windows and Mac computers running Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). The user experience is simple and flexible:</p>
      
  The user logs into their VDI environment, such as VMware Horizon, or Citrix Storefront, by entering their username.  Then, they’re redirected to authenticate to the HYPR Server via their single sign-on (SSO) provider.  A push notification is sent to their HYPR mobile app, which requests their FIDO-based authentication such as face or fingerprint. Once successful, they gain access to their VDI environment. If available, they also have the option to authenticate with Windows Hello or TouchID embedded on their computer.  
      
This login example redirects HYPR users through VMware’s True SSO.

<p>In today’s security landscape, passwords, even when used alongside traditional MFA, still leave users vulnerable to phishing and credential reuse. It also creates a poor user experience that strains the remote work experience and lowers productivity. By freeing people from passwords and password-based MFA, people can better focus on their work rather than fumbling their way across apps and resources.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>At HYPR, we understand how important VDI is for today’s more distributed global workforces. VDI gives people access to their digital workspaces with minimal management and maintenance by the organization’s IT team. That’s why we teamed up with VMware and Citrix to further bolster the remote experience.</p>
      
<p></p>
      
 HYPR &amp; VMware 
      
<p>True Passwordless MFA is available via the <a href="https://marketplace.cloud.vmware.com/services/details/true-passwordless-mfa-1-1-1?slug=true">VMware Marketplace</a> and integrates with VMware Horizon and Workspace ONE using SAML. Employees authenticate once to their Horizon portal and gain secure access to workstations and published resources. Passwords are not needed.</p>
      

      
<p></p>
      
 HYPR &amp; Citrix 
      
<p>HYPR is also on the <a href="https://citrixready.citrix.com/hypr-corp/true-passwordless-mfa.html">Citrix Ready Marketplace</a> and integrates with Citrix StoreFront on any existing identity provider (IdP) using SAML. The passwordless MFA experience is no different across virtual apps and desktop environments. There are no complex passwords nor one-time passcodes (OTP) to type in. Users simply authenticate once with the HYPR mobile app and gain access to all of their downstream applications.</p>
      

      
<p></p>
      
 Key Takeaways 
      
  HYPR’s certified integration offers remote workers login flexibility across Windows and Mac computers, as well as Android and iOS tablets and mobile devices.&nbsp;  True Passwordless MFA enables organizations to scale their MFA infrastructure along with their growing distributed workforce.  A truly passwordless approach across the enterprise enables organizations to better secure their workforce and increase productivity, wherever work is done.

 How Keyless is advancing biometrics to provide fast, secure, and reliable authentication  Advancements in biometrics have reached a point where the technology can reliably replace passwords, eliminate threats, and enhance the customer experience all at once. It’s time for enterprises to take a multi-modal approach to biometric authentication and identity management.  Biometrics today, a single-modal approach <p>Biometrics are fast, easy, and eliminate our reliance on passwords and PINs, however, despite their growing popularity and benefits, biometrics have their own unique challenges when it comes to widespread adoption, mainly due to reliability and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Most solutions on the market today only offer single-modal biometrics to authenticate users — this could be one of the reasons that that <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202012/biometric-authentication-adoption-slowed-in-uk-by-privacy-and-ux-concerns-nomidio-suggests">adoption of biometrics has been slow</a>, particularly at the enterprise level in industries that would benefit most from the technology in terms of user experience, but require greater assurance that their users or employees are who they claim to&nbsp;be.</p><p>The reliability of single-modal biometric systems plays a part in this. Single-biometric solutions are less likely to withstand advanced spoofing threats and are also less likely to correctly match biometric templates as a user’s physical characteristics change, whether due to the natural aging process or suddenly as a result of an accident or disability. As a result, the reliability of single-modal biometrics is often questioned.</p><p>Multi-modal biometrics offer a breakthrough solution to these challenges — empowering businesses to finally part ways with passwords and other archaic authentication methods.</p> Why multi-modal? <p>Multi-modal solutions that combine physical and behavioral biometrics enable companies to enhance security, without disturbing the user experience.</p>Physical Biometrics vs Behavioural Biometrics What are physical biometrics? <p>The most popular biometric solutions leverage a user’s unique physical traits to authenticate them. Biometric templates are created by mapping a user’s unique physical traits. For example, at Keyless we use Neural Networks, a deep learning technique to extract high-dimensional feature vectors from sequences of images of the user’s&nbsp;face.</p> What are behavioral biometrics? <p>Behavioral biometrics, on the other hand, leverage deep learning to recognize unique patterns in how a user interacts with a device over time. These patterns could be based on how the user taps, swipes, or holds their device. Once patterns have been recognized, they can be transformed into biometric templates that can be used to monitor access to a user’s device in real-time.</p><p><a href="https://justaskthales.com/en/what-are-behavioral-biometrics/">Behavioral biometrics</a> offer enhanced usability as they require no conscious effort from the user, allowing for continuous, frictionless authentication, enabling companies to frequently verify that a user is who they say they are, without disrupting the user. Physical biometrics, on the other hand, are better suited to one-time authentication, as they typically require conscious effort from the&nbsp;user.</p> Frictionless security powered by who the user is, not what they&nbsp;know <p>When it comes to enabling fast, secure authentication, because biometrics are inherently user-friendly, a multi-modal approach to authentication can directly solve the trade-off between convenience and security.</p><p>Multi-modal solutions give companies greater control over managing remote access to their private systems and data. For example, if an employee logs in but then the system recognizes unusual behavior (such as different keystrokes or tapping patterns), then it can log the user&nbsp;out.</p> The Keyless approach to biometric authentication  At Keyless we take a multi-modal approach to biometrics, leveraging both physical and behavioral biometrics to offer a seamless authentication solution that allows companies to reliably identify&nbsp;users. Keyless uses a combination of possession and inherence factors to provide a fast, seamless and secure authentication experience.<p>The Keyless protocol allows for several physical biometric modalities including facial, fingerprint, voice, and iris recognition; as well as behavioral modalities like keystroke and swipe recognition.</p> Using deep learning to ensure high-accuracy <p>To offer behavioral biometrics, we must first learn how users interact with their devices. We do this by feeding deep-learning algorithms unique, user-generated data captured through sensors on the user’s mobile&nbsp;device.</p><p>Each input can be gauged on its reliability in authenticating an individual user. Once it’s considered reliable enough for identifying the user with high accuracy, the feature can be added to the user’s biometric templates.</p> Ensuring privacy compliance <p>Since biometrics are uniquely linked to the individual, it’s important that companies processing biometric data take extra measures to protect it against both new and emerging&nbsp;threats.</p><blockquote>Biometrics have the potential to make authentication dramatically faster, easier, and more secure than traditional passwords, but companies need to be careful about the biometric data they collect. — <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3339565/what-is-biometrics-and-why-collecting-biometric-data-is-risky.html">Maria&nbsp;Korolov</a></blockquote><p>Keyless ensures that the biometric data we capture is never at risk of being stolen, compromised, or lost by combining multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing technologies. The combination of privacy-enhancing technologies, deep-learning, and multi-modal biometrics uniquely addresses the greatest barriers facing the adoption of biometric authentication solutions.</p><p>Read these pieces to gain a better understanding of how we leverage privacy-enhancing technologies to protect biometric data: <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/how-keyless-uses-zero-knowledge-proofs-to-protect-your-private-data-255d936be4fd">Keyless and Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-secure-multiparty-computation-dc3fb9365458">Keyless and Secure Multiparty Computation</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">Keyless and Shamir’s Secret&nbsp;Sharing</a>.</p> Closing the gap between security and convenience <p>Multi-modal biometric solutions enable a high level of security without causing undue disruptions to the authentication experience. Rather, multi-modal solutions can enhance the authentication experience by offering frequent, unconscious authentication that can be used to detect advanced&nbsp;threats.</p><p>By presenting multiple biometric challenges to users, multi-modal solutions protect private systems and data in the rare event of successful spoofing attempts or account takeovers that take place after the point of authentication.</p><p>Thus multimodal biometric solutions can help companies close the gap between security and convenience, allowing for more seamless authentication and identity management experiences that enhance security and privacy compliance, without sacrificing the authentication experience or productivity.</p> Request a Free Demo of&nbsp;Keyless <p>Keyless™ authentication can help deliver secure and seamless digital experiences for your end-users and for your increasingly remote workforce.</p><p>Head to our <a href="http://keyless.io/">website</a> to learn more about our biometric authentication and identity management solutions.</p><p><a href="http://www.keyless.io/">www.keyless.io</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can email us directly at <a href="http://info@keyless.io/">info@keyless.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/tapping-into-the-potential-of-multi-modal-biometrics-cee78f7649f3">Tapping into the potential of multi-modal biometrics</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The mortgage application process should be easier. It should be more accurate. It should involve less risk and less fraud. It shouldn’t be a slog for borrowers or for lenders. It should be as convenient and streamlined as we’ve come to expect from other modernized, digital experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transforming the entire underwriting process is a massive undertaking. And while Finicity already provides solutions across all the primary segments of mortgage lending, today we’re reaching another milestone by streamlining the verification of assets, income, and employment into a one-touch, GSE-accepted experience. I’m excited to introduce <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">Finicity Lend</a>’s Mortgage Verification Service (MVS), the faster, more accurate, more empowering verification experience for both lenders and borrowers.</p>
 What Is MVS? 
<p></p>
<p>Mortgage lending underwent a historic transformation in 2020. Problems that had been minor cracks in the mortgage lending experience became chasms as lenders had to rapidly adapt to physically-distanced workflows. But despite the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuing economic fallout, and record-breaking volume—which, while temporarily obscuring them, does not eliminate the cracks—certainly accelerating the need for a new mortgage experience, that need was already apparent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paper-based mortgage processes take more time—something many lenders are already lacking with today’s high volume—and they’re more prone to fraud. Slower, less streamlined solutions also reduce organizational agility, preventing lenders from keeping pace both when the market is booming and when the market again normalizes. And the high-friction paper-chases are annoying for borrowers that are already acclimated to fast, convenient, digital solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wanted to deliver a mortgage lending experience that exceeds the expectations of today’s borrowers while also enhancing outcomes and agility for lenders and their stakeholders. That’s why we designed MVS to deliver a one-touch, GSE-accepted digital verification of assets, income, and employment. Now you can complete all necessary verifications in one seamless process. It’s a fast, secure, anytime-anywhere experience that gives the borrower control over their financial data while also providing the lender with a real-time, accurate picture of the borrower’s financial health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MVS is powered by Finicity’s open-banking platform. This means that mortgage lenders get access to extended lengths of real-time data, analyzed and categorized thanks to advanced data intelligence. We also assure the most accurate data and keep the consumer at the center of the data-sharing experience with clear transparency and the ability to dispute reports. Access to reliable, real-time, multi-sourced, and even cross-verified data enables the most accurate verifications, setting you on your way to get rep and warranty validation from GSEs and investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because every lending use case and process is unique, we’ve designed MVS to be flexible and accommodate everything from refinancing to new purchases, including both qualified and non-qualified mortgages. We’ve also made it easy for mortgage lenders to integrate MVS into their workflow with several flexible integration options.</p>
<p>All of these features come together to build a consumer-centric lending experience that improves ROI for lenders.</p>
 Why Should Lenders Use MVS? 
<p>MVS is more than a product, it’s a partnership with Finicity that enables lenders to benefit from our open banking platform and our market-leading, secure connections to financial institutions. Through those connections, lenders can get the accurate data necessary to verify assets, income, and employment, and enhance their overall decisioning and underwriting processes. And with <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/updated-fannie-mae-lender-letter-suspends-rep-and-warrant-relief-through-du-expands-ron/">GSEs tightening their rep and warranty relief policies</a> due to COVID-19’s impact on consumer income and employment, lenders will need the most reliable data from the most reliable sources.</p>
<p>MVS enables a digital mortgage experience, allowing lenders to reap the benefits that come from digital streamlining. In fact, validating assets, income, and employment digitally can cut up to <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty">12 days</a> off the origination process. MVS takes digital streamlining even further by completing these verifications with only a single borrower interaction. You can then refresh those verifications at close at no cost and without reengaging the borrower. With MVS, you complete more originations in less time—time that’s crucial for lenders to remain agile in a crazy, high-volume year like this. More time opens room for more originations and more commission.</p>
<p>The convenience of digital verifications and the simple, streamlined consumer permissioning process also enhances the lending experience for borrowers and helps them leave more satisfied and more likely to refer their lender to friends and family. MVS’s seamless and customer-centric digital experience enables lenders to distinguish themselves, especially against digital laggards, and gain a competitive edge.</p>
<p>We’ll also set you up for success with Finicity’s Adoption Best Practices training so you can hit the ground running and start reaping the rewards of a streamlined, digital mortgage process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With MVS, everybody wins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t settle for yesterday’s mortgage lending experience. You deserve better. And so do your borrowers. Use Finicity Lend’s Mortgage Verification Service to build the foundation of your enhanced mortgage lending experience. Find out how to integrate MVS into your mortgage lending process and to learn more about how Finicity provides other mortgage solutions in prequalification, underwriting, funding enablement, secondary quality control, and servicing.</p>

<p>One-touch, GSE-accepted verification of assets, income and employment reduces loan process by up to 12 days</p>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY, Utah – February 25, 2021 – Finicity, a Mastercard company and leading provider of open banking solutions, today announced its one-touch Mortgage Verification Service (MVS), enabling lenders to provide the simple, easy experience that today’s consumers and lenders are looking for in mortgage origination. The solution allows consumers to permission data, quickly and easily, so lenders can verify assets, income and employment in a single interaction with borrowers that takes seconds or minutes instead of days or weeks. The verification is accepted by both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in place of cumbersome manual loan documentation.</p>
<p>While mortgage lending has rapidly moved toward a digital experience, the verification process has largely remained a manual, paper-driven process. By reducing the burden of manual methods of documentation, Finicity may help shave 8-12 days off the origination process for rapid loan closing while also increasing accuracy, improving profitability, and creating a better experience for both lenders and borrowers.</p>
<p>Through Finicity Lend’s Mortgage Verification Service, Finicity’s open banking platform leverages high value data available from financial institutions and payroll processors to provide accurate, real-time insights into a borrower’s current assets, income and employment. The solution offers flexible flows for different mortgage lending use cases — from refinancing to new purchases, qualified to non qualified mortgages.</p>
<p>This innovative service creates a simple, fast, FCRA-compliant verification experience that empowers consumers to digitally permission use of their financial data with one touch, through Finicity Connect, to rapidly validate key financial suitability requirements of a mortgage application. This is perfectly aligned with Finicity’s mission to empower both lenders and consumers while helping consumers benefit more from their own financial data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are streamlining mortgage lending significantly, reducing costs and shortening the time needed for the overall loan origination process,” said Finicity CEO and Co-founder Steve Smith. “With Finicity Lend, our ultimate goals are to help mitigate risk for lenders, create an improved consumer experience, and ultimately increase overall financial inclusion by helping borrowers better prove their creditworthiness.”</p>
 GSE Accepted 
<p>The Finicity Lend Mortgage Verification Service is accepted by both GSEs as a valid demonstration of a borrower’s assets, income and employment. Lenders are able to use Finicity verification reports for automated assessment and receive representation and warranty relief using Freddie Mac Loan Product Advisor® asset and income modeler (AIM).&nbsp; Fannie Mae accepts Finicity mortgage verification reports for automated assessment within Desktop Underwriter® validation service through Day 1 Certainty®.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Freddie Mac has been at the forefront of advancing the digital mortgage experience that today’s borrowers have come to expect,” said Rick Lang, Single-Family Vice President of Strategy and Integration at Freddie Mac. “Our data-driven strategy helps produce safer loans and reduces the paper chase so our clients can speed up underwriting and bring borrowers to the closing table sooner.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At Fannie Mae, we’ve been pioneering the digital technologies that will make the borrowing experience faster and easier for borrowers,” said Chuck Walker, Vice President Digital Alliances and Distribution at Fannie Mae. “Manually providing verification documents is a time-consuming and stressful process, so addressing asset, income and employment verification is central to moving the industry toward the ideal digital mortgage.”</p>
 What the Industry is Saying 
<p>Finicity clients and partners are already weighing in on Finicity’s Mortgage Verification Services (MVS):</p>

<p>Security, privacy, and ease-of-use will be the central concepts of IMPULSE (Identity Management in PUbLic SErvices), a European Horizon 2020 project that kicks off this month. Coordinated by Gradiant, a team of 16 entities from 9 different countries will use Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain to improve online identification processes.</p>



<p> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Impulse_EU">www.twitter.com/Impulse_EU</a></p>



<p>Digital processes are increasingly used by citizens. The current health crisis around the world has limited personal interactions, digitising all kinds of procedures. This brings a number of problems, not only for those unfamiliar with the complex identification systems on the internet, but also for those who are not comfortable providing their personal data online. IMPULSE seeks to be a tool to simplify the digitisation of the European public sector as a result of a comprehensive assessment on how the use of disruptive technologies may impact society from technical, socio-economic, legal, ethical, policy, and standardisation standpoints.

IMPULSE will work on the concept of Electronic Identity (eID) – the way users can identify themselves (and be identified) through the network – and its implications in multiple contexts. The initiative has a budget of around €4 million.

The 16 partners that make up this multidisciplinary consortium will create a tool to meet all the ethical, legal, and social requirements, so that the tool may be adopted for public services in all the countries of the European Union, regardless of their culture and degree of digitisation. IMPULSE will become the clear representation of an efficient, useful, and responsible modernisation by combining Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain to offer a technological advantage over other systems used today.

At the project kick off meeting earlier this week, all partners confirmed their optimism about the results that the initiative will offer and the pace of work that is expected to be maintained throughout the 3-year project thanks to the experience and expertise of those involved.</p>



<blockquote><p>“The digitisation of public administration services is one of the seven flagship initiatives identified in the NextGen Europe programme, which gives an idea of the strategic dimension of IMPULSE. In this context, the project was born with a clear objective of facilitating the access of citizens to these services but without giving up the maximum guarantees of security, something essential if we want to move towards a fully digitised and inclusive society”

</p>Luis Pérez Freire – Gradiant (the Spanish Research and Technology Organisation leading the IMPULSE project)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Digitizing the public services is not just a matter of technical infrastructure, rather a multi-stage question of ethics and justice. There is the non-trivial question of regulating digital technologies in a way that guarantees the full protection of personal data. But it is also important to recall that accessibility and quality of public services are fundamental prerequisites of democratic participation in social life. This links techno-regulation and ethics with politics. And this is the strategic horizon in which IMPULSE will play a ground-breaking role.”

</p>Antonio Carnevale – Senior Researcher at CyberEthics Lab. and the company’s contact point in the project</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“We are proud to participate, together with highly qualified partners, in a project as prestigious and ambitious as IMPULSE. We will strengthen the consortium with our ability to work in multi-disciplinary teams, an ability refined over years of presence at important institutional tables, even at the international level, with public institutions and private technology companies. “During the project, we will be responsible for the management of the entire process of Innovation and we will be involved in the development of the general plan for the dissemination and exploitation, at a pan-European level, of the project results. We will contribute to the project with our long experience in digital identity for the public sector, achieved thanks to the role of Identity Provider for SPID, the Italian Digital Identity Schema. Moreover, in the field of distributed identity based on blockchain technologies, we will support the consortium with the know-how developed thanks to DIZME, a decentralized digital identity platform, conceived by InfoCert, which combines the world of Self Sovereign Identity with eIDAS regulatory compliance. In conclusion, IMPULSE is an important opportunity, even more so if the results will be functional to the identification of new potential areas of application of Digital Identity at the European level and not limited to the public sector.”

</p>Carmine Auletta – Chief Strategy &amp; Innovation Officer at InfoCert</blockquote>



 AI and blockchain for electronic identification processes 



<p>In a world where it is increasingly common to carry out all kinds of processes online, avoiding fraud and deception is only possible with first-class technology. Funded under the call Transformative impact of disruptive technologies in public services (DT- TRANSFORMATIONS-02-2018-2019-2020), IMPULSE will develop a system to respond to the needs of both citizens and public servants in digital processes.</p>



<p>IMPULSE’s innovation focuses on combining two of the most promising technologies available today, that is Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain networks. The project’s goal is to improve the management of digital identity and electronic identification in the public sector. Today we have technology with the potential to overcome these challenges so its application in the field of digital identity will substantially improve the existing electronic identification systems at the time legal, privacy, or social issues requiring further analysis may raise.</p>



<p>Most citizens have an electronic identity card to carry out the authentication processes with the online services offered by the administration; however, its use is cumbersome due in large part to the lack of user-friendly interfaces for the common citizen. To overcome this adversity, IMPULSE will incorporate advanced face biometrics and document validation techniques based on AI to facilitate identification processes and provide the user with a digital onboarding experience that is fully transparent.</p>



<p>In addition, blockchain technology and the use of smart contracts will add trustworthiness in the process, providing mechanisms for users to demonstrate their identity without the need to disclose their personal data to third parties, who are a priori considered to be less reliable. In this way the citizen will maintain total control of their data and will be able to verify at all times the use that is being given to them.</p>



 16 high-profile partners 



<p>The consortium, made up of partners from Spain, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland, Iceland, France and Denmark, is funded by the European Union with €4 million under the Horizon 2020 programme. Partners from Italy will receive a total of €976.625 in funding. The complete list of partners is included below.</p>

<p>Sicurezza, privacy e intuitività saranno i concetti centrali di IMPULSE(Identity Management in PUbLic SErvices), un progetto di ricerca europeo all’interno del programma Horizon 2020 che inizia questo mese. Coordinato da Gradiant, un team di 16 entità da 9 paesi diversi userà l’intelligenza artificiale e la blockchain per migliorare i processi di identificazione online.</p>



<p> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Impulse_EU">www.twitter.com/Impulse_EU</a></p>



<p>I processi digitali sono sempre più utilizzati dai cittadini. L’attuale crisi sanitaria in tutto il mondo ha limitato le interazioni personali, digitalizzando tutte le procedure. Questo porta una serie di problemi, non solo per coloro che non hanno familiarità con i complessi sistemi di identificazione su Internet, ma anche per coloro che non si sentono tranquilli nel fornire i propri dati personali online. IMPULSE vuole essere uno strumento capace di semplificare la digitalizzazione del settore pubblico europeo come risultato di una valutazione completa su come l’uso di tecnologie dirompenti può avere un impatto sulla società da un punto di vista tecnico, socio-economico, legale, etico, politico e di standardizzazione.</p>



<p>IMPULSE lavorerà sul concetto di Identità Elettronica (eID) – il modo in cui gli utenti possono identificarsi (ed essere identificati) attraverso la rete – e le sue implicazioni in molteplici contesti. L’iniziativa prevede un budget di circa 4 milioni di euro.</p>



<p>I 16 partner che compongono questo consorzio multidisciplinare svilupperanno uno strumento in grado di soddisfare tutti i requisiti etici, legali e sociali, tale da poter essere adottato per i servizi pubblici in tutti i paesi dell’Unione Europea, indipendentemente dalla tradizione e sviluppo culturale e dal loro grado di digitalizzazione. IMPULSE costituirà un chiaro esempio di una modernizzazione efficiente, proficua e responsabile, che combina l’intelligenza artificiale e la Blockchain per offrire un vantaggio tecnologico rispetto agli altri sistemi utilizzati oggi.</p>



<p>Al kick off meeting del progetto, che si è tenuto all’inizio di questa settimana, tutti i partner si sono mostrati ottimisti in merito ai risultati che il progetto comporterà e al ritmo di lavoro che dovrebbe essere mantenuto durante i 3 anni del progetto, grazie all’esperienza e alla competenza di coloro che sono coinvolti.</p>



<blockquote><p>“La digitalizzazione dei servizi della pubblica amministrazione è una delle sette iniziative di punta individuate nel programma NextGen Europe, il che dà un’idea della dimensione strategica di IMPULSE. In questo contesto, il progetto è nato con il chiaro obiettivo di facilitare l’accesso dei cittadini a questi servizi, ma senza rinunciare alle massime garanzie di sicurezza, cosa essenziale se vogliamo andare verso una società completamente digitalizzata e inclusiva.”</p>Luis Pérez Freire – Gradiant (’organizzazione spagnola di ricerca e tecnologia alla guida del progetto IMPULSE)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Digitalizzare i servizi pubblici è una questione non solo di infrastruttura tecnica, ma anche di etica e giustizia. Ci si deve porre la domanda – per nulla triviale – del regolare le tecnologie digitali in modo da garantire la piena protezione dei dati personali. Rimane importante ricordare che l’accessibilità e la qualità dei servizi pubblici sono prerequisiti fondamentali per la partecipazione democratica nella vita sociale. Tale considerazione lega la regolamentazione necessaria della tecnologia con l’etica e la politica. E questo è l’orizzonte strategico nel quale IMPULSE giocherà un ruolo chiave.”</p>Antonio Carnevale – Senior Researcher presso CyberEthics Lab e punto di contatto aziendale nel progetto</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Siamo orgogliosi di partecipare, al fianco di partner altamente qualificati, a un progetto così prestigioso e ambizioso qual è IMPULSE. Metteremo a disposizione del consorzio la nostra capacità di lavorare in team multi-disciplinari affinata in anni di presenza a importanti tavoli istituzionali, anche di livello internazionale, con enti pubblici e realtà tecnologiche private. Durante il progetto saremo responsabili della gestione dell’intero processo di Innovazione e interverremo nella predisposizione del piano generale per la diffusione e valorizzazione, a livello paneuropeo, dei risultati progettuali. Contribuiremo ai lavori con la lunga esperienza sull’identità digitale in ambito pubblico, ottenuta grazie al ruolo di gestore accreditato per SPID. E, in tema di identità distribuita basata su tecnologia blockchain, supporteremo il consorzio grazie al know-how acquisito con DIZME, la piattaforma decentralizzata d’identità digitale, ideata da InfoCert, che integra già il mondo della Self Sovereign Identity con la compliance normativa eIDAS. Insomma, IMPULSE è un’importante opportunità, ancor di più se i risultati saranno funzionali all’identificazione di nuovi potenziali ambiti d’applicazione dell’Identità Digitale a livello Europeo e non solo nel settore pubblico.”</p>Carmine Auletta – Chief Strategy &amp; Innovation Officer in InfoCert</blockquote>



 AI e blockchain per i processi di identificazione elettronica 



<p>In un mondo in cui è sempre più comune effettuare tutti i tipi di processi online, evitare frodi e falsificazioni è possibile solo adoperando una tecnologia di eccellenza. Finanziato nell’ambito del bando Transformative impact of disruptive technologies in public services (DT- TRANSFORMATIONS-02-2018-2019-2020), IMPULSE elaborerà un sistema per rispondere alle esigenze sia dei cittadini che dei dipendenti pubblici nei processi digitali.</p>



<p>L’innovazione di IMPULSE si concentra sulla combinazione di due delle tecnologie più promettenti oggi disponibili, vale a dire l’intelligenza artificiale e le Blockchain. L’obiettivo del progetto è migliorare la gestione dell’identità digitale e dell’identificazione elettronica nel settore pubblico. Oggi disponiamo della tecnologia con il potenziale adatto per superare queste sfide: in questo modo la sua applicazione nel campo dell’identità digitale migliorerà sostanzialmente i sistemi di identificazione elettronica esistenti nel momento in cui sorgano questioni legali, di privacy o sociali che richiedono ulteriori analisi.</p>



<p>La maggior parte dei cittadini possiede una carta d’identità elettronica per effettuare i processi di autenticazione con i servizi online offerti dall’amministrazione; ciononostante, l’utilizzo appare macchinoso, soprattutto a causa di interfacce che si rivelano poco user-friendly per il cittadino comune. Per superare questo ostacolo, IMPULSE includerà tecniche avanzate di biometria facciale e di convalida dei documenti basate sull’AI per facilitare i processi di identificazione e fornire all’utente un’esperienza di registrazione digitale perfettamente trasparente.</p>



<p>Inoltre, la tecnologia blockchain e l’uso di smart contracts apporteranno ulteriore affidabilità al processo, attraverso meccanismi che permetteranno agli utenti di dimostrare la loro identità senza la necessità di rivelare i loro dati personali a terzi, a priori considerati meno sicuri. In questo modo il cittadino manterrà il controllo totale dei propri dati e potrà verificare in ogni momento l’uso che ne viene fatto.</p>



 16 partner di alto livello 



<p>Il consorzio, composto da partner provenienti da Spagna, Italia, Austria, Bulgaria, Germania, Finlandia, Islanda, Francia e Danimarca, è finanziato dall’Unione europea con 4 milioni di euro nell’ambito del programma Horizon 2020. I partner italiani riceveranno un totale di 976,625 euro di finanziamento. Di seguito l’elenco completo dei partner.</p>

<p>Rond het financieel advies dat een financieel adviseur uitbrengt speelt het gebruik van klantdata een belangrijke rol. Om te zorgen dat deze data eenduidig vastgelegd kan worden introduceert SIVI de vertaling van het Ockto Data Model naar de SIVI All Finance Datacatalogus (AFD).</p>



<p>Bij financieel advies gaat het zeker niet alleen over verzekeringsgegevens, maar bijvoorbeeld ook om gegevens rond inkomen, pensioen, belasting, hypotheek en lease. Behalve in documenten is deze informatie ook steeds meer als data beschikbaar. Met behulp van Ockto kunnen adviseurs hun klanten verzoeken hun persoonlijke gegevens direct uit de bronsystemen op te halen en met hen te delen.</p>



<p>Steeds meer partijen gebruiken de SIVI All Finance Datacatalogus (AFD) niet alleen voor het verzenden van berichten, maar ook voor het vastleggen van data binnen moderne database structuren. Dit is een belangrijke reden geweest voor de recente introductie van de vernieuwde SIVI AFS-standaard. Binnen het SIVI AFS is het mogelijk het complete klantdossier op gegevensniveau weer te geven. Op deze wijze kunnen softwaretoepassingen deze klantgegevens eenduidig vastleggen en bevragen.</p>



<p>Om deze vastlegging van gegevens binnen het klantdossier in de dagelijkse praktijk te ondersteunen introduceert SIVI nu de vertaling (mapping) van het Ockto Data Model naar de SIVI All Finance Datacatalogus (AFD). Deze Ockto-AFD-mapping maakt het voor software ontwikkelaars makkelijker de data uit het Ockto-bericht te importeren binnen het klantdossier. De Ockto-AFD-mapping is nu eerst beschikbaar in C# code. Later dit jaar zal de Ockto-AFD-mapping ook in de vorm van een API beschikbaar komen. De Ockto-AFD-mapping zal de releases van het Ockto Data Model volgen.</p>



<p>Peter Mols, Directeur SIVI: “De Ockto-AFD-mapping is de eerste in een reeks van mappingen rond o.a. inkomen, pensioen en hypotheken die SIVI zal uitbrengen binnen de vernieuwde SIVI AFS-standaard. Hiermee spelen we in op de toenemende noodzaak om eenduidig klantbeelden vast te leggen. Door het centraal aanbieden van deze mappingen verlagen we de kosten in de keten.”</p>



<p>Paul Janssen, Product Director Ockto: “Ockto sluit graag aan bij de SIVI-standaarden. Deze mapping tussen Ockto en het AFD ondersteunt het eenduidig vastleggen van gegevens binnen het klantdossier en faciliteert het toenemend gebruik van brondata. Onze samenwerking met SIVI sluit goed aan bij ons streven om de afhandeling van klantdata uit bronsystemen voor iedereen makkelijker te maken.”</p>

<p>Why You Should Pay For Apps and How It Can Protect Your Personal Data.</p><p>It’s “Free!” That’s Amazing! Who doesn’t love something that comes with no cost? For small businesses, hobbyists, startups and everyday people, I think it’s fair to say we all get excited when we hear this. In fact, in a world filled with social media, apps and games on our phones, perhaps we even expect it--but what is the hidden cost to you? </p><p>If you have seen <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">The Social Dilemma</a> then you might be familiar with this quote:<br>“If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product” — Daniel Hövermann</p><p>The hard fact here is that these “free” apps (ad-supported products) profit from collecting your data. They also make money from your attention through your clicks, likes and screen time. The real product for sale in all of these cases is your attention and subsequent interactions while logged in.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of how you become the product: In advertising-supported products, ads are presented to you. &nbsp;These advertisements are curated based on cookies you agree to in your web browser as well as other behaviours you exhibit within the app itself. &nbsp;</p><p>Let’s break this down a bit more. You’re scrolling Facebook when you see a “post” for something you were recently shopping for online. This is called an impression and the app/platform gets paid by the advertiser simply for it coming into your view. Now say you click on that ad. Facebook receives another payment for your behaviour, in this instance for your click. This might sound familiar given what we all know about Facebook, but this kind of advertising is rampant in our world. A recent article from the website MLSDev states that currently, “7 out of 10 apps contain embedded advertisements”. This seems innocent at first glance, but who can advertise on these platforms is largely unregulated and monitored primarily by algorithms. Algorithms that many people--including those who work at these companies-- don’t completely understand.</p><p>Using ads to provide free apps for users means that these companies are collecting information about you. This information is collected via your behaviour, views, and interactions. Then, this harvested information is used to infer demographic information about you. This includes but is not limited to where you live, your age, if you have kids etc. All of this is made available simply from behaviours you exhibit online. </p><p>At Fission, we are on a mission to normalize the payment of apps for this very reason and believe that a movement towards paying for apps, even at nominal rates, would bring about greater protection for you, the user. </p><p>What happens when you pay for your app:</p>  Your data becomes more secure and we begin to move towards a more ethical and humane technological future.  Your behaviour and attention are not propagated and sold.  Your privacy is more protected because the profitability of the application you are using is not contingent on your screen time/attention and personal information for targeted advertisements.  Charging for apps can improve the standard of living for app developers outside of North America and Western Europe.<br>a. Example: You publish an app and promote it, developing a user base of 		 &nbsp; &nbsp;500 users. If those 500 users pay $50 for that app, we’re talking about a 		 &nbsp; &nbsp;$25,000 USD salary for that developer. Pretty substantial for an 				 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;independent developer in most parts of the world, especially in developing 	 &nbsp; &nbsp;countries  Payment places value on the work. In an article from Derek Sivers, “Psychology experiments have shown that the more people pay for something, the more they value it.”  Developers should be paid ethically without distributing their user’s data for financial gain to largely unregulated advertisers.  <p>Let’s think about this. Would you be comfortable telling a stranger you met on the street, where you live, how many kids you have, where you went to high school, if you’re married or not? We readily volunteer this information online every day using ad-supported apps, like social media, productivity apps and games. Sounds insane right? </p><p>The future is not as abysmal as it might seem. While technology is bound to proliferate there are ways to prevent this dark picture above. The first step of many is to pay for the applications and software you use. </p><p>At Fission this is a driving focus for us. We believe in the protection and privacy of our users is essential--That’s why we feel so strongly about our mission. By supporting a movement for normalizing the payment of apps, we aim to be part of the solution. We encrypt the data of every end-user--while giving developers the tools to build great apps, and eventually include the ability to easily charge for them.</p><p>For end-users wanting to try out some of these apps, you can start by logging into <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission’s Drive app</a>. It’s free for small amounts of data, and you can pay for a <a href="https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive">premium account on Open Collective</a>, which helps us build more apps and tools for developers.</p><p>For developers, check out some of the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/11/none">App ideas in the forum</a>, or start with the <a href="https://guide.fission.codes">dev guide</a> to build an app of your own.</p><p>References<br><br>The Social Dilemma.

					 <p>Before issuing or verifying any credential, you must create an Organization in Trinsic Studio. When you create an Organization, you are creating a credential issuer and/or verifier. The number of Organizations you can create depends on your Trinsic Studio plan, so check out our <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">pricing page</a> to see how the plans differ.</p>

					 <p>When we say that issuing verifiable credentials using Trinsic Studio takes only minutes, we mean it. The Studio guides you step-by-step on how to create a credential template, so you can control what information is included in a certain type of credential. You can also enable revocation if necessary for your use case. Once a credential template is created, you can start issuing that type of credential to anyone. Trinsic Studio gives you the option to send the credential by connection, email, or QR code/link. Check out this tutorial on <a href="https://trinsic.id/how-to-issue-credentials-in-trinsic-studio/">how to issue credentials in Trinsic Studio</a>.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Verify credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Verifying credentials is just as easy with Trinsic Studio as issuing them. To be able to verify a credential, a verification template must be created. Verification templates specify the exact information an individual needs to share in order for the verification to be successful. Trinsic Studio even gives users the flexibility to define verification templates that utilize <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proof</a> (ZKPs) technology. Once a verification template has been created, you can use Trinsic Studio to send a verification request using by connection, email, or a QR code/link.

					 <p>Connections are used in SSI to create a secure, peer-to-peer communication channel between you and another party. With this connection, you can issuer, verify, and share verifiable credentials without fear of man-in-the-middle attacks. With Trinsic Studio, creating a connection with someone else is as easy as clicking a button to generate a QR code and sending that QR code to the other party for them to scan using an <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">SSI digital wallet</a> (like the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>).

<p>The beauty industry isn’t good at opening up when it comes to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessibaker/2021/02/04/hey-beauty-its-time-to-lift-the-lid-on-ingredients-and-impact/?sh=16bc8e6848b7">ingredients and impact</a>. But the ‘values shopper’ cohort is growing, and brands need to step up to meet their expectations. According to the British Beauty Council’s <a href="https://britishbeautycouncil.com/the-courage-to-change-sustainability-report/">Courage To Change report</a>, 86% of beauty shoppers want information about ingredient supply chains. Brands are falling behind these customer expectations: 1 in 5 customers don’t know how to check a product’s sustainability credentials.</p>
<p>Supply chain transparency is a difficult issue for brands. At Provenance, however, we believe they have a responsibility to open up about impact. And, with customer expectations for transparency growing fast, those who do will benefit. We believe every product should come with accessible, trustworthy information about origin, journey and impact. Through Provenance’s Transparency Framework, we’re helping beauty brands deliver exactly this.&nbsp;</p>
 What’s the Transparency Framework? 
<p>Our <a href="https://www.provenance.org/business/platform">Transparency Framework</a> is an open-source framework that helps companies communicate the impact of their business and supply chains with integrity. The framework is benchmarked to international standards, verifiable through proof and backed up by a council of expert advisors. It allows brands to turn supply chain data into information shoppers can understand, accessible through off-pack and online channels.</p>
<p>As part of the Transparency Framework process, we work with brands to develop a comprehensive understanding of a product’s impact throughout the supply chain. This covers a range of issues relating to a business’s impact, from carbon impact to animal welfare issues. The framework then allows brands to communicate the impact through Proof Points, which connect claims around impact to real data in the supply chain.</p>
 <p>The Transparency Framework is benchmarked to international standards</p> 
 What does it mean for beauty brands? 
 1: Unlock the truth around ingredients 
<p>Beauty shoppers are used to a lack of information around ingredients. When ingredients lists are disclosed, they’re often difficult to understand, making it hard for shoppers to make an informed decision.</p>
<p>Our Transparency Framework is enabling brands to be open with customers about ingredients and their impact on people and the planet. Through Proof Points, brands can clearly communicate proven claims around their ingredients, so that shoppers can compare products based on facts.</p>
<p>The framework in action: Provenance recently worked with an Italian brand who were marketing sunscreen as Coral Reef Safe. Thanks to the Transparency Framework process, they learned that their formulation in fact contained an ingredient not considered to be Coral Reef Safe. The brand immediately stopped making this claim, and are currently taking steps to address the issue.</p>
 <p>With Provenance, beauty brands can make proof-backed claims across a range of impact areas</p> 
 2: Add clarity to clinical claims 
<p>Beauty shoppers are used to brands marketing their products as ‘clinically tested’. But unfortunately, not all claims adhere to a consistent standard, and shoppers are generally left in the dark on the nature of these tests</p>
<p>Through our Transparency Framework, brands can get specific with their ‘clinically tested’ claims. The framework allows brands to share the subject, method and results of the test in question. Shoppers can then access this information online – by clicking on a Provenance Claim Capsule or in-store – by scanning a QR code.</p>
<p>The framework in action: <a href="https://www.cultbeauty.com/mt/en/lumity-day-night-nutritional-suppliments.html">Lumity</a> is a cosmetics brand that sells ‘clinically tested’ Day &amp; Night Nutritional Supplements. With Provenance Proof Points, their customers can see a detailed summary of these clinical tests with just a click. Lumity’s customers can see that “a placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-cell clinical trial was conducted on 50 female subjects, aged 35-65, for 12 weeks.” Crucially, they can also see the positive results: “users saw significant improvements in hair, skin, nails &amp; quality of life.”</p>
 3: Communicate with confidence on product recyclability 
 <p>Beauty brands can add credibility to their recyclability claims with verified Proof Points</p> 
<p><a href="https://britishbeautycouncil.com/the-courage-to-change-sustainability-report/">British Beauty Council research</a> found that unrecyclable packaging is amongconsumers’ top environmental concerns – and little wonder, given that the global cosmetics industry produces more than 120 billion units of packaging every year.</p>
<p>However, it’s a complex issue and many brands struggle to know what they&nbsp;can and can’t claim. Through the Transparency Framework, we’re helping brands develop a comprehensive understanding of the recyclability of their packaging, so that they can communicate confidently around this key consumer issue.</p>
<p>The framework in action: We recently worked with a haircare brand called <a href="https://www.wearecentred.com/">Centred</a>. Through the Transparency Framework, they were able to collate comprehensive packaging information from their supplier for a recyclability Proof Point. In the process, they discovered that parts of their packaging were actually made from recycled plastic. This meant that they weren’t only recyclable, but more than 75% of the product’s packaging was made from recycled materials, which they could communicate to shoppers through an additional Proof Point.</p>
 4: Build trust with third-party proof 
 <p>Sana Jardin’s claim of supporting local communities in their supply chain is verified by NEST</p> 
<p>According to a <a href="https://compareethics.com/building-trust-sustainability">Compare Ethics report</a>, just 1 in 5 shoppers trust brands’ sustainability claims. It’s perhaps understandable thatlarge brands are often guilty of ‘greenhush’, and reluctant to communicate progress for fear of backlash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beauty brands can tackle this problem by working with independent third parties to verify their claims. The Transparency Framework helps brands add weight to claims and build consumer trust by embedding these verifications within the off-pack and online shopping experience. In practice, this lets brands highlight the positive impact they are having in the supply chain, whether that’s by working with communities or reusing byproducts.</p>
<p>The framework in action: The socially conscious fragrance brand <a href="https://sanajardin.com/">Sana Jardin</a> claims to “contribute to development of the community where our hero ingredient is sourced”. Through the Transparency Framework, the brand is able to evidence their actions: the Orange Blossom Project which they helped form has led to a 136% increase in local womens’ wages and the re-purposing of floral waste. Sana Jardin had this claim publicly verified by NEST, a nonprofit focused on responsible handcraft.</p>

Data regulation is being designed from first principles before our very eyes. It draws from notions of individual privacy, and is heavily influenced by world events from national security regulation following 9/11 to a reckoning on data collection in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. Technical considerations are also feeding into regulation, in particular the ability of machine learning technology to help with medical treatment or predict crime using ever larger data&nbsp;sets.</p><p>ONT ID is a framework for decentralized identity, built on the Ontology blockchain and integrated with the Binance Smart Chain. So any user, developer, or project launching STO’s will have access to fully integrate the benefits of ONT ID and with it, decentralized identity, into their existing developments.

<p>Being digital first with a robust digital journey is more than just a competitive advantage for educational institutions – it’s fundamental. The diversity of the user base, IT budget restrictions, along with an absolute need for frictionless flow throughout services calls for a well thought out identity and access management (IAM) solution. Here is how higher education should take advantage of digital transformation with IAM.</p>
 Dynamic identity lifecycle management 
<p>Educational institutes have many different groups with different roles going through their various systems.</p>
 
 Students – from enrolment, to student lifecycle, all the way to becoming an alumnus 
 Staff – regular staff accessing systems based on roles 
 Visitors – visiting lecturers and students, short-term international students, contractors with the need of temporary access rights 
 
<p>Managing these identities without a dynamic identity management solution means time wasted on repetitive operational tasks, can cause serious delays with enrolling new faculty or students, and ultimately leads to a poor user experience. A good identity management solution simplifies creation, migration and storage of these user identities and ensures a frictionless, any-time, any-place journey throughout their identity lifecycle.</p>
 Cut down costs with good user experience 
<p>As well as various user groups, higher education institutes typically have various services. By enabling single sign-on (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-sso/">SSO</a>), users can benefit from simplified login using one identity to all digital services and applications – which would otherwise call for admin-heavy tasks, draining IT support resources. By allowing the end user to manage their own accounts and resolve issues themselves, such as passwords or ID management through self-service, the whole process is even more quick and user-friendly. Giving the power to the end user, institutions are able to reduce operational costs significantly while increasing overall user satisfaction.</p>
 Robust security 
<p>Security issues, such as data breaches, are becoming more common every day. Higher education institutes are processing a lot of personally identifiable information (PII), which calls for solid security measures. Developing a security strategy based on capabilities such as identity verification, multi-factor authentication and delegated authority prevents security threats and helps to deal with security challenges effectively. A good identity management solution makes sure your users are who they say they are and that they have the right access to authorised services.</p>
 Future-proof operations 
<p>Attracting new students and maintaining the quality and growth in use of digital services affordably is a key part of the competition for higher education institutions. As budgets and resources are being constrained unceasingly, the demand for online services is growing fast – especially due to the pandemic. Having a digital-first mindset not only solves budgeting issues by cutting down unnecessary costs, but can make your institution competitive by appealing to tech-savvy students. Enriching educational life online with good identity management and having a truly secure, modern online experience is not a “nice to have”, it’s a must have and makes your digitalisation project sustainably future-proof. Digitalisation can help you to place first in the competition. &nbsp;</p>
 Start your digital transformation 
<p>Higher education institutes are facing many challenges that can be solved with proper IAM solution. (See this blog from Intragen:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.intragen.com/blog/strong-solutions-for-5-iam-challenges-in-higher-education">5 IAM Challenges in Higher Education</a>). Being digital-first has always been a competitive advantage but now it is the key to business success. Ubisecure has almost two decades of experience in delivering proven digital ecosystems and we’ve helped higher education institutions take full advantage of digitalisation through our Identity Platform.</p>

  <p>I’ve been a musician most of my life. I was in bands when I was in junior high up until I joined the Army at 19. I started writing software a few years after getting out of the military and kinda put music to the side. Recently, I’ve started to play in bands again, and something struck me about the dynamics of playing with other musicians and how that prepared me for writing software on a team. I’ve been writing software professionally now for over twenty years. There are many parallels, so I thought I would share some of those lessons hoping that it might help other programmers work more effectively in a team. Writing software, after all, is a team sport.</p>

 

 

 Practice Your Craft 

<p>As a musician, you should practice your parts for the songs you’re playing with the band and also practice getting better on your instrument in general. The better you play your part, the better the team will be, but never forget that your part is just one part of a larger whole. This means practicing and perfecting your part before you get to rehearsals. The more prepared you are when you get to rehearsal, the better the band will sound at rehearsal.</p>

<p>In software, this means continuing to learn about the languages and platforms that you program for. Take time to read that blog post, or watch that tutorial, or read that programming book. You don’t want to let it consume your whole life (work-life balance is extremely important), but you can just carve out one evening a week where you spend time improving your skills for an hour or two without becoming a workaholic.</p>

 Let Go of Mistakes 

<p>When you mess up, learn what you can from the mistake: was it just a typo? Or a more serious deficit in your knowledge? Then, let it go. It’s easy to dwell on mistakes, but that will only force you to make more of them. You don’t want to ignore a mistake completely, but learn what you can and move on. I’ve always thought that the best musicians in the world are the ones who can make a mistake instantly learn, and then forget it. Just keep playing.</p>

<p>This goes for coworkers as well. Your band/teammates will make mistakes as well. Believe me, they know they messed up. Fix it, and move on. They probably already feel bad enough, and you might be surprised at just how far a “That’s okay, you got this” will go to creating a really strong team bond.</p>

 Celebrate Bandmates Successes 

<p>It’s important to celebrate your bandmates’ victories, accomplishments, and those times when they just kill it during a performance. Not only does this form a stronger team bond, but they will undoubtedly return the favor. It may seem like a small thing, but it can really make someone’s day. Everyone wants to feel like that “rock star” from time to time, and band members will remember that feeling of killing it and want to do it all the time. This will also make you want to have more of those moments too. Everyone’s performance will improve, and the band will sound fantastic. There is nothing like being on a team of high-performing players, whether you’re playing a local dive bar or building a large software system.</p>

 Stay On Good Terms 

<p>If you must part ways with a member, do your best to part on good terms. Bad feelings are too heavy to carry around, and that weight affects your performance (on and off stage). Plus, whether you live in LA or Springfield, IL, you’ll likely see those same players around your local scene, and you don’t want anyone running around with bad feelings about you. You might find yourself in a band with them later, and you don’t want things to be awkward or to not even get the gig because of one person.</p>

<p>On the flip side, welcome new members with excitement. Do your best to include them in band activities and make them feel like they’ve ALWAYS been part of this group. Being a new member of the team is stressful and can be isolating. You’ve probably been the new guy before too. The band will sound better and playing music will be more fun.</p>

 No Showboating 

<p>Everyone has a solo once in a while. It won’t always be you. It’s important that all of the members of the band get a chance to show off their talents. When it’s your turn, let ‘er rip! When it’s not your turn, do whatever you can to make sure that you’re playing in a way that helps to highlight just how badass your teammate is. They will do the same for you when it’s your turn to shine. This, again, creates a tighter team bond and makes playing with your team that much more enjoyable. You’re going to be spending a lot of time with these people, do your best to make it a joy to work with them.</p>

<p>Nobody likes a know-it-all anyway. If you’ve ever been on a team where one of the members believes they’re above the team, it can be quite demoralizing to the team and really affect the team’s performance. Don’t be that person. If you really feel like your skills are way above the team you are on (it happens), find another team. Sometimes that is a great signal that it’s time to move on. You might also find other ways to serve the team, like helping them in areas where they are deficient. This can be a little tricky since you don’t want to seem like a know-it-all, but if you see them struggling, you might just say, “Hey! Want some help?” You might even find you have a knack for teaching and find yourself a new career direction!</p>

 Not Every Song Will Be Your Favorite 

<p>I’ve played in a lot of cover bands, some originals bands as well. Not all of the songs we played were fun for me. Maybe my part was boring; maybe I just didn’t like that particular song. It’s fine. It is important to remember that you are doing this for someone else. When you’re putting together a setlist, you try to play songs that the audience will enjoy. Sometimes those are songs you don’t really like.</p>

<p>The same goes for software. Sometimes you might get tasked with the “grunt work.” Maybe it’s a task you don’t really like doing. It’s important in those times to remember the team’s goals. What are we trying to accomplish here? Understanding how an unenjoyable task helps the team make better software can be the key to making those tasks more bearable.</p>

 Your Tips 

<p>Over the years, I’ve met a LOT of developers. There seem to be a lot of you who are musicians. So what did I miss? Any tips along the way you’ve found that made you a better team member or made your work more enjoyable? Please share your tips below in the comments.</p>

 The GiD Report#148 — A Ripple bombshell? Clubhouse and the rise of digital&nbsp;cults <p>This week:</p>  Ripple bombshell  Clubhouse counterpoint  This week in regulations  Stuff happens   1. A “bombshell” in the SEC v. Ripple&nbsp;case? <p>Revealed during the pretrial court hearing: A large exchange approached the SEC in 2019 asking if they could trade/sell XRP. Apparently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHpV0m_bi3c">the SEC didn’t say&nbsp;no</a>.</p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Photo: TechCrunch<p>Elsewhere, Coinbase is now trading at over $100 billion — potentially making it the biggest IPO since Facebook. To the moon.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/coinbase-valued-100-billion-direct-listing-9b43e316-7ff7-4f6a-a1db-4dc2481a93ee.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Share sale: Coinbase last month launched a secondary share sale via Nasdaq Private Markets (f.k.a. Second Market), offering up to 1.8 million shares in weekly&nbsp;batches.</blockquote>  The goal was to help Coinbase determine a reference price for its public offering, which will be done via direct listing instead of&nbsp;IPO.  The initial batch of 75,000 shares was sold on Jan. 29 at $200 per share. That worked out to a valuation of nearly $54 billion, compared to the $8 billion valuation Coinbase received during its prior venture capital round in late&nbsp;2018.  The next two batches were sold at $301 and $303, respectively.  The most recent batch of 127,000 shares was sold Friday at $373, which works out to a valuation of $100.23&nbsp;billion.  <p>And finally, if you haven’t already, check out our latest podcast episode featuring Solana creator Anatoly Yakovenko: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-04-the-future-of-blockchain-with-the-creator-of-solana-4e7944e3ba50">EPISODE 04 — The future of blockchain with the creator of&nbsp;Solana</a></p><p>It’s a super educational listen as Anatoly gives a bit of history on the evolution of blockchain, while providing the origins story behind Solana’s novel solution — proof of&nbsp;history.</p><p>Also:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/diem-stablecoin-prepares-for-liftoff-with-fireblocks-custody-partnership">Diem Stablecoin Prepares for Liftoff With Fireblocks Custody Partnership — CoinDesk</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>— <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/why-silicon-valley-doesnt-get-bitcoin">Why Silicon Valley Doesn’t Get Bitcoin with Dan Held — What Bitcoin&nbsp;Did</a>   2. Last week, we talked about where Clubhouse fits into the evolution of our platforms in the context of this broader cycle. Here’s a counterpoint. <p>From <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/clubhouse-and-the-future-of-cult-driven-social-platforms">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>People are right to be focusing attention on Clubhouse’s meteoric rise. But almost everyone seems to misunderstand what is making the app so successful.</blockquote><blockquote>It isn’t, as people like Ben Thompson suggest, simply another iteration of the old story of lowering the barriers for production and consumption, shortening feedback loops and creating new “white space” for aspiring stars. If you think of it as being like Twitter, Stories or TikTok, you are missing the&nbsp;point.</blockquote><blockquote>The key to Clubhouse’s rapid accession is that its social design makes it an ideal platform for cults at a time when the social internet is rapidly evolving away from organizing around communities and toward cults. Clubhouse’s rise likely signals major strategic shifts that several legacy social platforms are going to have to consider.</blockquote><blockquote>The weakening of digital communities and rise of digital cults that we are seeing is inevitable. A similar pattern played out millennia ago in the physical world, as large cults and autocracies came to dominate small local communities. It is reasonable that the same cycle would repeat at warp speed in the digital&nbsp;space.</blockquote><p>Also:</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-22/clubhouse-chats-are-breached-raising-concerns-over-security">Clubhouse Chats Are Breached, Raising Concerns Over&nbsp;Security</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/reddit-content-removal-2020-b0365610-932c-4c10-b2c6-2d9111fbcf1a.html">Reddit removed 6% of content on its platform in&nbsp;2020</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-audio-clubhouse-twitter-facebook-c58ee759-9645-46d2-943c-1ef67dd70f9c.html">Audio platforms are thriving in the&nbsp;pandemic</a>  <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/mark-zuckerberg-joel-kaplan-facebook-alex-jones">“Mark Changed The Rules”: How Facebook Went Easy On Alex Jones And Other Right-Wing Figures</a>   3.

				  New community effort, Aries Bifold, targets an open source Aries mobile agent interoperable with other Aries projects.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Hyperledger Aries is infrastructure for blockchain-rooted, peer-to-peer interactions. It includes &nbsp;shared cryptographic storage for blockchain clients as well as a communications protocol for allowing off-ledger interactions between those clients. And while mobile agents are a vital piece of the community ecosystem, helping implement verifiable credentials exchange between mobile devices, the community does not yet host an active effort targeting mobile agents.</p>
<p>Indicio is happy to announce an initial code contribution and ongoing development and support for this community effort to produce a production quality mobile agent that implements common protocols within the Aries community. We look forward to collaborating with others in this effort.</p>
<p>Part of the goal of this open community effort is to ensure Aries Bifold’s interoperability with other Aries projects to ensure protocols are built to Hyperledger Aries and Indy standards.</p>
<p>The initial community meeting will occur on Wednesday, February 24, 12:00 PM MST (11am PST, 2:00pm EST, 7:00pm UTC) Meeting information can be found <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Aries+Bifold+User+Group+Meetings">here</a>.</p>
<p>We welcome participation from the multiple organizations, contributors, and maintainers within the Aries community that have expressed interest in this effort and anyone interested in collaborating with the Aries community to create open source mobile agents.</p>
<p>All are welcome! Come join us!</p>

			<p>In many major jurisdictions, blockchain technology is now recognised as a suitable infrastructure for the issuance and transfer of financial securities. There is now a huge opportunity for financial institutions to launch their digital asset marketplaces (DAMs). These players can utilise a network that brings solutions to long-standing efficiency and liquidity problems.</p>

<p>We meet on the third-Thursday-of-the-month for "Demo Days" where the Fission team talks about new releases &amp; product updates, early demos of in-progress work, planned roadmap items followed by an open Q&amp;A. We also invite the community to come and give app demos. This week we invited Jeremy Rustin of the TiddlyWiki project to talk about his product and our plans to integrate Fission’s Webnative SDK with TiddlyWiki. </p> Meet the Team <p>Our distributed team continues to grow with team members spanning from our HQ in Vancouver across three continents. Our newest addition is Courtney in 🇺🇸 North Carolina, United States. </p><p>Courtney (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/courtney">@Courtney</a>) joins us as our Marketing Lead. This was her first week with Fission and her first demo day. Look for more blog posts and email updates from Courtney about what's going on with Fission. </p> Fission and Headless Ghost <p>Fission teammate Helder (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/agentofuser">@agentofuser</a>) shared his work with Headless Ghost and Fission. He showed us how to use the Ghost CMS as a familiar editing interface for content producers and then pulling the content into a Next.JS website via API. Then, the content is compiled into a static website using React and deployed to the Fission platform. Check out the video to hear the details of this process. </p> Filecoin Backup App <p>Next, we heard from Ben (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/benjaminbollen">@benjaminbollen</a>) and Brian (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/bgins">@bgins</a>) about their work with Filecoin. Filecoin is a blockchain specifically used for storing files online without relying on a third-party platform or company. Because Fission is also interested in working in browsers very securely, we decided to work with the Filecoin team on this project. Hear from Ben and Brian about their progress in the Fission Demo Day video. </p> IPFS Cluster Updates <p>Daniel (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/dholms">@dholms</a>) talked to us about his updates to the IPFS Cluster. Fission is built on an Interplanetary File System (or IPFS) which is a global peer-to-peer network. Fission builds encryption on top of the IPFS stack, running IPFS servers to make sure that your data stays online and accessible directly from the browser, all with your security in mind. Daniel shares with us some recent backend infrastructure work he's doing to improve our system performance. </p> Tiddlywiki and Fission <p>Jeremy Rustin (<a href="https://twitter.com/Jermolene">@jermolene</a>) is the creator of Tiddlywiki, a serverless web app that allows users to create a non-linear notebook for recording, organizing and sharing complex information. We're collaborating to build an app that will allow users to use TiddlyWiki on the Fission platform. You can hear from Jeremy directly in the Demo Day video. We’ve also been working out in the open in the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">TiddlyWiki group on the Fission forum</a> so hop over there to see what's going on. </p> Video  Join us next time <p>We're experimenting with <a href="https://lu.ma/">Luma</a> for registering for events.

<p>This is a guest&nbsp;blog.</p><p>In October 2020, Caribou Digital engaged my production company, Nairobi-based <a href="http://www.storyby.design/">Story x Design,</a> to produce a <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">participatory video storytelling project</a> that put 11 people who earn their livelihood from digital platforms at the centre of their own story. We are passionate about innovative storytelling methods and were able to apply our experience in user-generated content and production skills training to design and implement the&nbsp;project.</p><p>This project was a continuation of Caribou Digital’s ongoing work on <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">platform livelihoods</a>. At the onset of COVID-19, Caribou Digital initiated <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/covid-19-and-the-platform-livelihoods-of-young-african-workers-f0b5efa1d9c">a series of conversations</a> with platform workers and sellers in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda about how the pandemic had impacted their lives. This storytelling project brought to life the stories of 11 workers through video&nbsp;diaries.</p><p>My company provided the workers with training on videography skills, equipped them with decent camera phones, and provided ongoing narrative mentorship to empower the participants to tell their stories over a period of two months. Through a series of short self-shot videos, each participant shared their real-life experiences as digital labourers during the pandemic.</p><p>In this blog, we share our methodology, including successes, challenges, and tips for those who are interested in running a similar&nbsp;project.</p> Methodology <p>During the project design phase, we discussed how the participants would submit their footage; we decided that issuing a smartphone would be our best chance for success. It would also be an incentive to participate in the project. The 12 participants were sent a Samsung A21s smartphone, chosen for the quality of its camera and for its price. We locked the phone at the start of the project using <a href="https://preyproject.com/">Prey</a>, software that can remotely control and secure the&nbsp;phone.</p><p>Upon successful completion of the project, each phone was unlocked and ownership was transferred to the participant. A small octopus tripod, a Bluetooth selfie stick, a lapel microphone, and a selfie light were also distributed to each participant. This small production kit was designed to increase the production value of the video recordings and aid skills development.</p><p>For their contribution to the project, each participant received three payments tied to the delivery of a video for each chapter. The payments were a recognition of the time invested by the participants in the project while doing their platform work. In addition to their smartphone kit, they also received internet data bundles for&nbsp;uploads.</p><p>It was important in the project design phase to ensure the project was designed in an ethical and respectful way. We clearly outlined the terms of the engagement through a formal agreement form and gathered the informed consent of each participant for the usage of their image and likeness. This process also allowed the participants an opportunity to voice concerns about how their story would be edited and disseminated. A few participants told us they did not want to film their families and others drew boundaries in terms of time commitment. Knowing this upfront helped us work together with respect and understanding.</p><p>Through an agile approach, we engaged the participants in three ways: via video skills development, one-on-one narrative mentoring, and through a participatory, post-production process.</p><p>Video Skills Training — Using WhatsApp, we ran a series of one-on-one training sessions on how to record video using their phone. The participants were asked to submit video samples before the training that were used as examples to identify common mistakes. Afterwards, they were taught how to stabilize the camera, record clean audio, and capture shots to build a scene. We created a series of training videos and supporting graphics that were shared on WhatsApp, and then re-shared when a participant needed a specific reminder to, for example, turn their radio off while recording a video&nbsp;diary.</p><p>Narrative Mentorship — To support the storytelling outcomes, our mentor Abu “Sensei” Majid worked remotely with each participant to help them identify and express stories important to their lives. Through WhatsApp messaging and Google Duo video sessions, Abu spoke to the participants weekly for two months. This organic dialogue built trust and confidence, while empowering participants to self-direct their own story. Guided by <a href="https://scottdistillery.medium.com/dan-harmon-the-heros-journey-and-the-circle-theory-of-story-b64bb77d6976">Dan Harmon’s popular 8 story circle structure</a>, Abu and I crafted a series of standard narrative prompts for the participants. As we received material back, we adapted the narrative model to the nuances of each person’s evolving&nbsp;story.</p><p>Participatory Post-Production — The participants shared their video diaries and original video footage primarily through Google Drive, <a href="https://wetransfer.com/">WeTransfer</a>, and <a href="https://send-anywhere.com/">Send Anywhere</a>. The upload to cloud platforms was often stalled by unreliable internet access. Our post-production team downloaded the files to review and edit the material, sharing previews and follow-up questions with each participant in real-time. This structure helped the participants maintain ownership of their story without the need for high-level technical skills. Our team found Google Drive challenging as a cloud platform for video editing because it lacked file prioritization functionality and slowed down the back-and-forth feedback&nbsp;loop.</p> Successes <p>Overall, the project succeeded in capturing a variety of otherwise underrepresented voices in a unique and timely way. We produced and published 23 video chapters over the course of two months. That’s 92 minutes of content created remotely by a small production team and first-time self-shooters in quite a short period of time. Some of the specific successes include:</p>  One-on-one Mentoring — The greatest success of the project design was the inclusion of the role of Story Mentor from the very beginning. Abu was the only touchpoint for all the participants, which reduced any confusion and streamlined communication. Abu delivered one-on-one skills training using WhatsApp audio and video, Google Duo App, and occasionally, traditional network carrier phone calls when experiencing internet downtime. In these calls, he provided narrative guidance and contributed to the project management, ensuring the success of the&nbsp;project.  Empowered Voices — Eleven of the 12 participants successfully delivered three video chapters showing a strong level of engagement as self-driven storytellers. Some participants were quick to engage and able to share their story readily. Others were slower to unfold. But as the participants gained technical skills and saw we were treating their story with respect, confidence grew. By the third chapter, Mary Ikigu, 24, politely declined our prompts and self-directed her entire shoot, a significant milestone in our&nbsp;eyes.  Intimate Stories Captured — The stories captured went deeper than conventional reportage or research would permit. Video highlights include a COVID-19-related funeral, a wedding, and a genuine, real-time emotion that help audiences engage more deeply with the participants’ lived experience. For example, Stanley Shiafu, 34, was an on-demand cleaner with Lynk Kenya who lost his work during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/stanley-story-coming-soon/">Watch his three chapters&nbsp;here.</a>   Challenges and how they were&nbsp;overcome <p>We knew the project was ambitious. The 12 participants live in four countries and two time zones. By the nature of their work, they are busy people with mouths to feed and lives to live. This storytelling project, though compensated, was always going to be a big ask. But we learned a lot and, by all accounts, so did the participants. Some of the challenges include the following:</p><p>B-roll — B-roll is footage that is laid over interviews or video diaries. It illustrates the story being told. For example, Dorcas Mutheu, 41, runs a cake business, so visuals of her baking, decorating, and boxing her product were important to show her work. We trained the participants in basic video conventions such as the different purpose of establishing and close-up shots. Also, because we wanted the project to be as collaborative as possible, we resisted being prescriptive about what B-roll participants should be filming. However, it became clear that recording video diaries was fairly easy for most to do and that filming B-roll of their lives was more challenging. Through continual briefings, resending our video instructions, and eventually, sending specific shot lists, we were able to co-create each story in a visually engaging&nbsp;way.</p><p>Deadlines and Incentives — Between the ambitious two-month timeline and the demands of their lives, the engagement of the participants varied over time. We found it was difficult for most of them to upload enough content to meet the tight edit turnaround. We decided we needed to incentivize them to meet their deadline by offering a small cash transfer via mobile money in addition to their agreed instalment fee. This worked really well and about two-thirds of the participants uploaded on&nbsp;time.</p><p>Data Uploads — The upload of video files was challenging for all participants, particularly those in rural areas where internet speeds were slow. Stanley, for example, had to commute to a nearby town to access good upload speeds. Okoli Edwin Chimereze, 20, an e-commerce entrepreneur, had to go to cyber cafés in Lagos to help with faster internet. When it became clear the upload was slowing down the Google Drive production workflow and frustrating the participants, we distributed additional data bundles, some of which needed to be reloaded for each chapter. We also encouraged the use of alternative file transfer websites like WeTransfer and Send Anywhere. However, this meant organizing the files manually, which consumed a lot of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Language Barrier — It became evident that a lot of communication was lost in translation with one participant. She was getting frustrated and unmotivated, so we translated her prompt questions to her mother tongue and hired a translator for one-on-one calls. This made for easier, efficient one-on-one training sessions. Her subsequent video submissions were of greater depth and&nbsp;quality.</p><p>Insecurity — Showing where you live and work was an important part of gathering B-roll. However, this was not always possible or safe. One participant was treated with aggression while filming on the streets of Kampala during a tense political climate. We worked with her to find creative ways to film while reducing her exposure. Also, two of our participants were mugged during the course of the project and had their phones stolen. While we had installed a lock-out software on the phone in the case of such a scenario, we were only briefly able to trace the locations of the two stolen phones. Fortunately, we were able to retrieve the data remotely. We had a contingency budget, so we re-issued the phones to keep the two participants on&nbsp;track.</p> Tips for others considering using this technique <p>This innovative participatory approach is exciting for the participants and engaging for audiences. When used in combination with more traditional research or reportage methods, it has a great deal of potential to unlock surprising insights. However, there are a few things to consider before embarking on your project&nbsp;design.</p>  Set clear expectations. We drew up a clear project agreement and informed consent document, which each participant signed, scanned and sent back to us. However, we didn’t make clear how much time we would expect people to put into the project. The time it takes to produce a video, particularly the B-roll overlay footage often surprises newcomers to video. It would have been helpful to communicate a conservative estimate of the hours the project would require. In hindsight, we estimate each chapter took the participants approximately eight hours to plan, film, and upload. In addition to training and communication time, the average time spent on the project was about 30 hours per participant. For most, the remuneration was fair. However, it still would have been better to estimate and communicate how much time this would actually equate&nbsp;to.  Try to be realistic. Participatory projects like this have a huge payoff in terms of originality and access to the stories that are shared. However, they also take a lot more concerted effort and time. Our two-month timeline was probably too ambitious for the amount of content we co-created. We could have done with a third more months, a third fewer participants, a third more staff, or a third fewer videos. If you’re looking to undertake a similar project, set your goals high and then add a third more resources!  Stay agile. No, really, stay agile. Flexibility and improvisation are central to a participatory approach. The project design was premised on producing and publishing three discrete video chapters per person. For some people, their story naturally unfolded over time and the three-chapter format made sense to track their journey. For example, Peter Maraizu Ogbonna, 35, a taxi driver in Lagos, captured the construction of his new poultry farm side-hustle over the course of two months. For others, such as Onyinyechukwu Anastestia Onyekaba, 24, a software developer also in Lagos, her story was more compellingly told in just one compressed chapter. The decision to vary the number of chapters edited per participant was made in the last days of the project, triggering a furore of re-editing but ultimately making the content more engaging for audiences across a variety of platforms. Also, one participant found the challenge to record B-roll and in-depth video diaries too difficult to manage with his end-of-year work commitments, so we collectively decided to end his involvement in the project without any video output. While disappointing, we had anticipated there would be a level of attrition and were pleased 11 of the 12 participants successfully engaged with the demands of the&nbsp;project.   Conclusion <p>This participatory process has led me to feel deeply connected to 12 people I’ve never met. In fact, because Abu was the only person to speak directly to each person, I’ve never even spoken to them. After a hard year for most people around the world, and a particularly hard year for my production business and the creatives I work with, this project was a deeply healing&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Without even realizing the impact they would have, these 12 participants took on a huge new challenge. They learned new skills. They bravely bared their souls. They said “Yes” at a time when the world was consumed by anxiety. I personally think this is very cool. Not only do they offer important insights into the reality of work on digital platforms, but by sharing their stories, they also validate the struggles of millions like them, surviving and thriving even during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">Watch all the videos&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/a-platform-of-their-own-our-experience-running-a-participatory-video-storytelling-project-e90075e3f69d">A platform of their own: Our experience running a participatory video storytelling project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The Storm before the Calm 
<p>Building things, even Calm™ things, makes noise. George Nakashima’s wooden furniture evokes peace, but its construction still begins with a chainsaw. We mention this because we’re firing up our newest power tool.</p>
<p>We call her Eliza. She is a data-collection robot.</p>
<p>Hang on. An AI? Harvesting my data? Spying on me? Flooding me with spam? This is Urbit, right? Let us tell you about our new friend in basic terms, where MEGACORP might otherwise deploy legalese.</p>
 What Eliza is and isn’t 
<blockquote>
<p>Replicants are like any other machine - they're either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.</p>
<p>Rick Deckard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's start with the benefits. Eliza is a simple chatbot. She was made to collect feedback on Landscape. She asks direct questions about peoples' usage of Urbit, records any responses, and reports them to her managers at Tlon. She'll also provide timely advice and information to ships kind enough to chat with her. She'll begin reaching out to ships via DM in the coming month. If you don't want to, just say no, and you'll never hear from her again.</p>
<p>Finding bugs is critical to Urbit's rapid development, especially in this period of nascency. Most Urbit-related frustrations go unreported; regular folks don't think to open up Github when they experience a minor issue. That's why it's incumbent upon us to design a lower-friction forum for feedback. People who aren't comfortable filing an issue might be willing to talk to a friendly chatbot.</p>
<p>Now, about hazards. By design, there are few. Eliza runs on Tlon's comet, not on your planet. There will be no OTA to install <code>%eliza-bot-store</code> on everyone's ships. Eliza learns things through conversation, not hidden surveillance software. Data she requests, like the text output of our network analytic tool, <code>+tally</code>, must be sent manually. MEGACORP tends to cut this corner; to refine their products, they just track your reactions in real-time.</p>
<p>Since she's <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/b0c1f83287cbf4c85847a9238d9f4be17e1fcb33/pkg/arvo/app/eliza.hoon">open-source</a>, anyone can creatively deploy Eliza. Just write her a dialogue tree. Of course, that also means we can't keep people from misusing Urbit bots. We think automated agents on the Urbit network are inevitable, so let's create a good baseline culture around them. (Much love to Tendiebot, who's serving up stock prices in <code>~tomdys/wall-star-bets</code>.) However, once Urbit is used world-wide, we can't rely on culture alone.</p>
 A New Internet Economics 
<p>The sum of Urbit's architectural design is a new online economics: a way to finance and monetize access to internet infrastructure where people retain maximum equity. Explicitly acquire a low-maintenance, low-cost server. Use it to compute explicit things. Return to life.</p>
<p>We all know the basic MEGACORP business model: offer a free service (to suckers who don't own a server), secretly mine the data they generate on the (addictive) platform, then sell targeted ads to advertisers. This model will not survive Urbit. The ubiquitous personal server changes the economic equation. You used to 'pay' for an experience with your time and data. On Urbit, once you purchase core internet infrastructure, it's yours.</p>
<p>So, can Urbit meaningfully curtail our world's appetite for data? We'll see. Post-enlightenment society runs on instrumental reason, right down to the last byte. Marketers will always want a fresh dataset. However, when the goods are on your Urbit, you can at least demand the respect you deserve. Long term, we expect a transparent market for data, not an opaque "agreement".  An analytics company wants to track everything you see and do on Urbit? They better be paying well.</p>
<p>Eliza doesn't pay respondents. Her collection is a charity to Urbit's developers. (We're also still busy enabling payments on Urbit with the Bitcoin wallet.) However, her presence is not a term of service either. In a few years, by the nth time some smart aleck uses Eliza's chatbot code and conjures 'Zalexa' to attempt an intrusion upon your Calm™, we will see the economics of Urbit's architecture suddenly vivify. Blacklists, reputation systems, and, eventually, even data markets, all Urbit primitives envisioned long ago, will become real. We won't need Zoogle to underwrite a spam filter for the entire internet; the scarcity of Urbit address space, in tandem with a true web-of-trust, handles that.</p>
<p>If Urbit is to be used worldwide, the old system will not go down without a fight. Spammers, spies, and digital robber-barons will hunt for ways to game Urbit. Our passage out of the digital gutter is beginning in earnest, and we are thrilled to put our new architectures to the test.</p>

<p>Government’s paper vaccine certificates would create a catalogue of problems.</p>
<p>The UK Government’s plans to require holidaymakers to ask their GP for a paper vaccine certificate would encourage fraud, create unnecessary work for GPs and patients and would be unlikely to be accepted as attested proof by many more forward-thinking nations, UK experts have warned.</p>
<p>Chris Justice, President of BLOK BioScience, has urged the Government to join the global Good Health Pass Collaborative¹ of health, travel, technology and government organisations looking to create a blueprint for universally accepted digital health credentials that are privacy-protecting, user-controlled and globally interoperable.</p>
<p>Warning that the Government’s preference for paper vaccine certificates risks creating a range of problems for the public, healthcare professionals and law enforcement, while also reducing the UK’s standing on the global stage, Chris gives five reasons why an ethical privacy-focused digital-based health pass should be introduced, based on Self Sovereign ID technology.</p>
 Our personal data is more private and secure 
<p>Right now people don’t know where their Covid-19 health data is being stored or how it could be used in the future. This is a risk as NHS databases could be compromised², paper certificates are easy to lose¹ or people may have concerns over their data being accessed by government or health authorities³.</p>
<p>With a digital health pass built around a Self Sovereign ID, individuals’ test, vaccine and infection data sits exclusively on their device and the raw data is never shared with anyone else. The only communication it needs to give is attested proof that the individual meets the entry criteria of the country or vendor.</p>
 There’s no risk of counterfeit vaccine passports 
<p>There have already been several reported cases of counterfeit test results being presented¹ ⁴ and that is a huge risk when it comes to managing infections being carried from country to country – including into the UK.</p>
<p>While a paper certificate could be easily counterfeited, a digital health pass can combine attested identity and health credentials and allow an individual to prove that they meet a country’s entry criteria and are who they say they are. It is likely that an easy to counterfeit paper certificate will not be sufficient to access many countries.</p>
 They can be ethical and inclusive, if designed appropriately 
<p>The UK vaccine minister has said that vaccine passports are “discriminatory”⁵ but that really doesn’t have to be the case.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that vaccine passports should be designed in a digital-first form for maximum privacy, security and usability but that doesn’t mean that people without access to a smartphone would be excluded. Inclusivity models such as guardianship or providing secure access through a printed QR code just need to be built in – our own BLOK Pass is ID2020 certified⁶ for meeting 41 outcomes-based technical and ethical standards.</p>
 They would reduce bureaucracy and save time and money 
<p>It has been suggested that patients may need to book a GP appointment and pay £30 for a vaccination certificate⁷. Why should they?</p>
<p>This would be a costly inconvenience for both GPs and patients, and the British Medical Association has already said that patients should be given easy online access to their records for this reason⁷.</p>
<p>If people have access to their personal vaccination and testing data and they can use it for personal benefit then they are more likely to opt into vaccination programmes, which has public health advantages.</p>
 Anonymous insights could be a key tool in the battle against Covid 
<p>Imagine a world where experts can access completely anonymous Covid-19 data in real-time as part of a coordinated national programme that allows us to quickly respond to new variants, regional outbreaks and vaccine side-effects – without ever compromising people’s privacy.</p>
<p>This level of insight could be a game-changer in the battle against the virus but we would only ever be able to secure the level of adoption needed if we address people’s concerns about privacy and security, and make it attractive to sign-up for.</p>

  <p>NestJs is a popular Node.js framework that is built with typescript and makes use of object-oriented programming, functional programming, and functional reactive programming. NestJs boasts that it provides a framework for building scalable server-side applications.</p>

<p>NestJs integrates nicely with Okta’s single sign-on provider. Okta makes securing a web service, such as the one you will build, quick and easy.</p>

 Create Your Okta Application with the CLI 

<p>The first thing you will need to do is sign up for an Okta developer account if you don’t already have one. This account is free forever and allows you to start building applications secured with Okta immediately. To do this you will use the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/12/10/introducing-okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>. If you haven’t worked with the CLI yet you can check out the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">full documentation here</a>.</p>

<p>Start by opening the terminal application of your choice. In the terminal, use the command <code>okta register</code>. This command will ask you for your name and email and then create an Okta developer account for you. If you already have an Okta developer account, you can use the <code>okta login</code> command and follow the on-screen instructions to log in to your organization. Once the CLI is set up for your organization, run the command <code>okta apps create</code> and give the application a meaningful name. I named mine <code>library-api</code> but you can name yours whatever you like. Select <code>Single Page App</code> as the application type. Even though you are creating an API in this tutorial, you will be using Postman as the “application” that will consume the API. This can be even more beneficial if you actually create a single-page application later. You’ll be able to use this client ID and issuer in that application.</p>

<p>Since you are going to use Postman to test, enter <code>https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback</code> as your Login Redirect URL. Set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oauth.pstmn.io/</code>. If your organization has multiple authorization servers, you can use <code>default</code> for this tutorial. After the CLI runs, it will return your Issuer and Client ID. Make note of these as you will need them in your application.</p>

 Create Your NestJs Application 

<p>Next, you can create your Nest.js application. If you haven’t installed the nest.js CLI yet then you should do that before beginning. Run the command <code>npm i -g @nestjs/cli@7.5.4</code>. Once that completes, run <code>nest new library-api</code> to create a new application called library-api.</p>

<p>Next, you need to install some dependencies you will need. First, you will want to install <code>dotenv</code> for your environment variables.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@8.2.0
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to install the passport and Okta libraries that will help set up your auth module.</p>

   <code>npm i passport@0.4.1
npm i passport-http-bearer@1.0.1
npm i @nestjs/passport@7.1.5
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@2.0.0
</code>   

<p>Now you can create a new folder in your root directory called <code>.env</code>. Add the following values to it.</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientId}
OKTA_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer}
OKTA_AUDIENCE=api://default
</code>   

<p>Now you can begin the work of setting up your application. Nest uses a few concepts that it’s important to discuss at this point. The first is controllers. Controllers are responsible for handling requests from the client.</p>

<p>Next is providers. The name “providers” is a bit of a catch-all term for services, repositories, factories, and many other types of classes. Providers can be injected into other classes using the <code>@Injectable()</code> decorator.</p>

<p>Finally, there are modules. The role of the module is to organize the application structure. Modules are decorated with the <code>@Module()</code> decorator.</p>

<p>With that work in mind, you can begin to create your auth module. First, create a new folder in your <code>src</code> folder called <code>auth</code>. Add a file to this folder called <code>http.strategy.ts</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import { HttpException, Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
import { Strategy } from 'passport-http-bearer';

import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

@Injectable()
export class HttpStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy) {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {
	super();
  }

  async validate(
	token: string,
	done: (error: HttpException, value: boolean | string) =&gt; any,
  ) {
	try {
  	return await this.authService.validateToken(token);
	} catch (error) {
  	done(error, 'The token is not valid');
	}
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This provider will look for an injected <code>AuthService</code> provider to do the heavy authentication lifting. You can define the <code>AuthService</code> logic in a new file called <code>auth.service.ts</code> in the same folder.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as OktaJwtVerifier from '@okta/jwt-verifier';

import { ConfigService } from '../config/config.service';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  private oktaVerifier: any;
  private audience: string;

  constructor(private readonly config: ConfigService) {
	this.oktaVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  	issuer: config.get('OKTA_ISSUER'),
  	clientId: config.get('OKTA_CLIENTID'),
	});

	this.audience = config.get('OKTA_AUDIENCE');
  }

  async validateToken(token: string): Promise&lt;any&gt; {
	const jwt = await this.oktaVerifier.verifyAccessToken(token, this.audience);
	return jwt;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This implementation of the <code>AuthService</code> using the <code>oktaVerifier</code> to verify an incoming token.</p>

<p>Finally, you can tie these two providers together in one module by adding a file called <code>auth.module.ts</code>.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

import { ConfigModule } from '../config/config.module';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';
import { HttpStrategy } from './http.strategy';

@Module({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  providers: [HttpStrategy, AuthService],
})
export class AuthModule {}
</code>   

<p>The <code>HttpStrategy</code> and <code>AuthService</code> get listed as providers in the <code>AuthModule</code>. You are also importing the <code>ConfigModule</code> but that hasn’t been implemented yet. Go ahead and do that now.</p>

<p>First, add a folder under <code>src</code> called <code>config</code>. Add a new file for <code>config.service.ts</code>. The code for that follows.</p>

   <code>import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
import * as fs from 'fs';

export class ConfigService {
  private readonly envConfig: { [key: string]: string };

  constructor(filePath: string) {
	this.envConfig = dotenv.parse(fs.readFileSync(filePath));
  }

  get(key: string): string {
	return this.envConfig[key];
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The implementation here uses <code>dotenv</code> to read the parameters from the <code>.env</code> file. It exposes a <code>get</code> function that will get the appropriate value from the file.</p>

<p>Next, add a file to the <code>config</code> folder named <code>config.module.ts</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ConfigService } from './config.service';

@Module({
  providers: [
	{
  	provide: ConfigService,
  	useValue: new ConfigService(`${process.env.NODE_ENV || ''}.env`),
	},
  ],
  exports: [ConfigService],
})
export class ConfigModule {}
</code>   

<p>This module takes the <code>ConfigService</code> and packages it as an export. This makes it available for your <code>AuthModule</code> to use.</p>

<p>You can now create your controller. Open the <code>app.service.ts</code> and replace the existing code with the following.</p>

   <code>import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  books = [
	{
  	id: 1,
  	title: 'The Hobbit',
  	author: 'J. R. R. Tolkien',
  	status: 'Checked-in',
	},
	{
  	id: 2,
  	title: 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?',
  	author: 'Philip K. Dick',
  	status: 'Checked-out',
	},
	{
  	id: 3,
  	title: 'Brave New World',
  	author: 'Aldous Huxley',
  	status: 'Checked-out',
	},
  ];

  getAllBooks(): any[] {    
	return this.books;
  }

  getBook(params: any): any {
	return this.books.filter((r) =&gt; r.id == params.id)[0];
  }

  updateBook(book: any): any {
	return book;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>This file provides some stubbed methods for getting and updating books. Next, open <code>app.module.ts</code> and replace the code there with the following.</p>

   <code>import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthModule } from './auth/auth.module';

@Module({
  imports: [AuthModule],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
</code>   

<p>The only change here from the boilerplate code is the addition of the <code>AuthModule</code> as an import. You will use this in a moment.</p>

<p>Finally, open <code>app.controller.ts</code> and replace the code there with the following controller code.</p>

   <code>import { Controller, Get, Post, Param, UseGuards, Body } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Controller('books')
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get()
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  getAllBooks(): any[] {
	const books = this.appService.getAllBooks();
	return books;
  }

  @Get(':id')
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  getBook(@Param() id): any {
	return this.appService.getBook(id);
  }

  @Post()
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard('bearer'))
  updateBook(@Body() book: any): any {
	return this.appService.updateBook(book);
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you are using the AuthGuard to ensure your user is authenticated. You have also defined methods for <code>get/:id</code>, <code>get</code>, and <code>post</code>. In your <code>@Controller()</code> decorator you have named the controller <code>books</code> meaning that your routes will be <code>books/GET</code>, <code>books/:id/GET</code>, and <code>books/POST</code>.</p>

 Testing Your NestJS Application 

<p>You are now ready to test your application. As I said above, I will be using Postman for the instructions below. But you can use Advanced Rest Client or another application to test your Nest.js application. You can even build your own React front end for it.</p>

<p>In your terminal, run the command <code>npm run start</code> to start your application. While that is booting up, open Postman. Start a new request and head to the Authorization tab. Select OAuth 2.0 in the Type dropdown, then in the Current Token section on the right, set your header prefix to bearer. Under the Configure New Token section, select Authorization Code (With PKCE) as the grant type. Next, check the Authorize using browser checkbox. Populate your Auth URL, Access Token URL, and Client ID from your Okta developer’s console as follows:</p>

 
   Auth URL: {yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize 
   Access Token URL: {yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/token 
   Client ID: {yourClientId} 
 

<p>In the Scope field type in openid email profile and in the State field, put any alphanumeric string you wish. Click Get New Access Token and complete the Okta login. Once you have done that, click Use Token the Access Token should be populated automatically in the Current Token section.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the URL bar of your request, type in localhost:3000/books/ and hit Send.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should see the full list of books returned to you. You can further experiment with this by trying the URI <code>localhost:3000/books/1</code> or attempting to post to the <code>books</code> endpoint. You can also remove the access token from the Current Token section and see the <code>401 Unauthorized</code> message.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Nest.JS is an exciting framework that makes writing clean and scalable Node.js applications quick and easy. Combined with the simplicity and security of Okta you will be able to build secure applications in no time.</p>

 Ontology — The ONLY Decentralized Identity Partner for Binance Smart&nbsp;Chain <p>Ontology and Binance have a long history of cooperation and partnership that has generated benefits for both sides, none possibly more important the integration of Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Solution into the Binance Smart Chain. The symbiotic relationship sees Ontology, and ONT ID, as the sole partner for BSC in terms of providing a truly decentralized identity option and KYC user verification.</p><p>The recent explosion of projects landing on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is expected to be accompanied by a meteoric rise in the number of potential investors interested in Security Token Offerings, otherwise known as STO’s. A key variable that is addressed through Ontology’s partnership with BSC is the problem of identifying potential investors, and ensuring their identities are not only protected but also validated through Ontology’s Trust Anchor Gateway and overall Trust Ecosystem.</p> About ONT&nbsp;ID <p>ONT ID is a framework for decentralized identity, built on the Ontology blockchain and integrated with the Binance Smart Chain. So any user, developer, or project launching STO’s will have access to fully integrate the benefits of ONT ID and with it, decentralized identity, into their existing developments. Protected by cryptographic techniques, ONT ID provides any entity with a digital identity that is controlled by the entity through decentralization. The entity in question here can be a variety of things, including but not limited to individuals, organizations, or objets. This makes tasks such as authentication, authorization or performing audits much simpler while protecting the data of the entity being authenticated, authorized, or&nbsp;audited.</p> About ONT&nbsp;TAG <p>Ontology’s Trust Anchor Gateway (TAG) is a decentralization platform based on ONT ID which provides access to security features such as KYC (know your customer) and global authentication services such as Shufti Pro, IdentityMind, and CFCA to name a&nbsp;few.</p> How does this help&nbsp;STO’s? <p>For any security token offering on BSC, the most important aspect is being able to accurately and safely verify the assets held by potential investors, while adding a layer of anonymity and protection to their identity through decentralization. Some pain points in compliance requirements include verifying of qualified investors, cross-border sales of security offerings, and the duration of the qualification validity period for both the United States and the European union. In a normal STO process, the issuance, self compliance, fundraising, and working with technical issues can be both time consuming and difficult. Neither of which is conducive to a successful STO. But by integrating ONT ID and adopting the ONT TAG, any STO on the Binance Smart Chain can identify potential investors much quicker, and nudge them through the checklists smoother. Not to mention that this is a more secure form for investors to participate while having their personal ID protected through the decentralization powered by Ontology — the only partner who offers this service on&nbsp;BSC.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-the-only-decentralized-identity-partner-for-binance-smart-chain-d531efbc569">Ontology — The ONLY Decentralized Identity Partner for Binance Smart Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

They bring a level of convenience to anyone who needs to access applications throughout the day to conduct business effectively and without having to enter credentials each time. So, it is not surprising that Okta, who’s the leader in the market, oftentimes uses the following tagline: “One-click access to all your enterprise apps—in the cloud and behind the firewall.” But, there is another slogan used by Okta that tends to leave me perplexed: “Okta is one trusted platform to secure every identity, from customers to your workforce.”</p>

   The Ugly Face of Yesterday’s CIAM

   The Ugly Face of Yesterday’s CIAM 
<p>We all have multiple different personas. But before we put on our hats as identity “experts” -&nbsp; either as architects, implementers or vendors - let us start by simply being consumers.&nbsp; Consumers of online services for banking, e-commerce, education, entertainment, and more.&nbsp; And by thinking as consumers, we can all tell endless stories of poor user experiences with respect to using those services. Those poor user experiences are essentially putting an invisible barrier to entry to the applications and goods we wanted to consume.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one forgets how someone or something made them feel, and a poor registration, login or password reset journey, at best reduces the likelihood of consumer recommendations, at worst, you simply lose users which ultimately results in lost revenue.</p>
<p>The lack of a “digital fabric” is typically the root cause of those badly performing ecosystems.</p>
 Broad Requirements Drive The Need for an Identity Fabric 
<p>CIAM however is not just about the end-user experience. Obviously, the UI “is THE application” from an end-user point of view, but under the hood, there's an entire catalog of other requirements that are needed to make CIAM a success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Core elements of a good Consumer Identity Fabric are:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Functionality for upholding compliance (think GDPR for EMEA or CCPA for the US amongst others),&nbsp; 
 Multi-device integration,&nbsp; 
 Adaptive and contextual security,&nbsp; 
 Bot-protection&nbsp; 
 Fraud management checks at various different states of the end-user journey.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>Data integration and data access are also important things to consider and are likely to need the creation not only of new software components - either through development or procurement - but also new operational structures and potentially new teams to manage that new landscape.</p>
<p>Put simply, CIAM isn’t just IAM. CIAM is an outside-in view of identity as opposed to the inside-out model for employee IAM. Features are different, but so too are the non-functional requirements. Scale - for storage and throughput - will be considerably higher, as will geographical availability, support for different locales and languages and the ability to elastically respond to changes in service demand. Many of these overall needs would unlikely have been a priority if a CIAM project was not needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new requirements however are driving the need for a more integrated, extensible and accessible set of identity services - likely based on an API/SDK first approach. This is where the “fabric” model of identity comes into play.</p>
 Start With The End in Mind 
<p>So how can we make CIAM a success for the organization?&nbsp; The most simple approach is to “start with the end in mind” and by asking, what the CIAM platform is going to achieve for the business. In the identity world, CIAM is the solution most closely aligned to the organization's business objectives so it needs to be a priority for any organization going through a digital transformation and having their customers and partners in mind. It can open up new revenue streams, alter how business is conducted and provide a foundation for continued growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Stakeholders in the implementation process are numerous –&nbsp;typically the CISO, CMO, a digital leader, and various identity services leads are involved. So having a platform of distributed components that can assist them in their divergent goals is critical to making CIAM effective. By supporting services for a range of stakeholders we are moving towards developing a broader cross-business unit platform that can break down silos. This is exactly what an identity fabric aims to achieve.</p>
 CIAM Lifecycle 
<p>CIAM interactions really follow a cyclical pattern of interaction, from initial registration, through to secure login and contextual access, allowing consent and data management to take place seamlessly across a range of devices at a time of the users choosing. Throughout that lifecycle, we need to look beyond assurance and knowledge levels of those user interactions and should ask ourselves how a target service or application for the end-user can be provided in a way that encourages them to refer, recommend and renew?</p>

			 Eva joined the team six months ago as an intern to complete her graduation internship. 

		 
	 
              
	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Eva Gasyte and I am from Lithuania. Even in my childhood I was interested in banks and the financial world, so as a first step towards my career, I studied finance in Vinius. After this I decided to deepen my knowledge and get a Master’s degree, but I also wanted to gain some international experience, and so in 2019 I moved to Monaco and started studying MSc Finance at the University of Monaco. This month I am finishing my internship at Tokeny and I am about to start my professional career.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>As part of my studies at University of Monaco, I am required to do a 6-month internship. Luckily, I was noticed by Tokeny’s HR manager Radka on Linkedin as she read an article about me published by the university, in which I mentioned I am looking for an internship. She contacted me, and after a few interviews I was offered the internship. This is how Tokeny came into my life.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>The experience was great in a lot of ways. I like the team, my duties and the company’s culture. Tokeny is a remote friendly company, with people working all over the world. I’ve been communicating with most of the team remotely, but I feel very happy that some of those people became my friends, even though I’ve never met them in real life! During the internship I’ve had a very dynamic schedule – every day was unique for me, with different tasks, and therefore I’ve gained a lot of experience in various fields. Our offices here in Monaco are at MonacoTech which provides a very dynamic and innovative environment. The start-up atmosphere there is amazing. It’s a combination of such a challenging place, exciting projects I took care of and great colleagues that helped me to grow even more and gain agility.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I love traveling and discovering new cultures – it amazes me how many breathtaking places are on Earth, one life is not enough to see everything. Even in Monaco – it is one of the tiniest countries in the world and after 2 years I still find places here I’ve never seen before.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My dream is very simple – all I wish is to live a happy life. To succeed in my career, to have a nice family, and that everyone around me is happy as well.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I love animals, and if I could, I would provide home and food for all of them that are abandoned in this world.</p>

   By Miranda Grant and Grace Natabaalo  Platform livelihoods hold great promise for making work more inclusive for young women. At the same time, they also present new expressions of gender differences in opportunity, uptake, earnings, and the ways work intersects with other areas of&nbsp;life.  These tensions are apparent in a participatory video storytelling project carried out by Caribou Digital

<p>By Miranda Grant and Grace Natabaalo</p><p>Platform livelihoods hold great promise for making work more inclusive for young women. At the same time, they also present <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">new expressions of gender differences</a> in opportunity, uptake, earnings, and the ways work intersects with other areas of&nbsp;life.</p><p>These tensions are apparent in a participatory <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">video storytelling project</a> carried out by Caribou Digital and Nairobi-based <a href="http://www.storyby.design">Story x Design</a>, with the support of Mastercard Foundation, in October 2020. The project equipped seven young women based in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda with mobile phones, video training, and mentoring, to enable them to tell us their own experiences of platform work over a period of two&nbsp;months.</p><p>The women — two web developers, a farmer, a carpenter, a motorcycle rider, and two social commerce entrepreneurs — told us how marketplace platforms have enabled them to challenge structural barriers such as access to capital, sexism, freedom of movement, access to ICTs, and personal safety. Some needed very little capital to start. Others could conduct the work from the comfort and safety of their home, which enabled digital platforms to provide an entry point into the world of&nbsp;work.</p><p>Some women also leveraged the fact that they already had a computer, internet access, and the requisite skills to perform their platform work; others pushed themselves to learn skills that enabled them to join a male-dominated profession. While the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted their lives, the women all fought to stay financially afloat and keep their passions alive&nbsp;online.</p><p>Despite these opportunities, the women’s stories also bring to light gender-specific challenges associated with platform livelihoods, like sexism and having to balance unpaid care work at home with platform&nbsp;work.</p> Breaking down gender stereotypes in the workplace Dathive<p>Dathive, 31, known as “Señorita” to her regular customers, is one of only two female motorcycle taxi riders on Uganda’s SafeBoda ride-hailing platform. Before becoming a driver, she has tried numerous other business ventures like running a mobile money business and a fashion boutique. However, none offered the potential profit of boda boda work. Joining this male-dominated sector means that Dathive has not had it easy; she sometimes had to prove that she could transport passengers well regardless of her gender. However, being one of only two female SafeBoda riders does have its&nbsp;perks.</p><p>“When I take a customer, I see that they are really very happy to ride my motorcycle. When we reach [our destination], and we negotiate the money, they give me a tip. We take a selfie, they call their family, their neighbors [and say]…come and see my driver, come and see who’s brought me.” — Dathive, SafeBoda driver,&nbsp;Kampala</p><p>SafeBoda has helped boost Dathive’s profile by popularizing her in the media, she&nbsp;says.</p><p>“I have been on TV, radio, and in the newspapers. SafeBoda did this so that people could get to know me and feel confident when I show up as their rider on the app,” Dathive says. <a href="https://youtu.be/QQdK1hVNVj8">Watch Dathive’s story</a></p><p>Sabina, 29, is also one of a few women in a male-dominated profession. She is a carpenter with Lynk, an on-demand labor platform based in Nairobi, Kenya. Sabina’s move into carpentry was thanks to a partnership between Lynk and BuildHer, a social enterprise that equips women in Kenya with vocational and life&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Sabina’s experience points to the types of training that might be needed to set women up for success with platform work outside of vocational training alone. She told us that the training she received taught her life skills and coping strategies that she could apply beyond her profession as a carpenter. This is worth investigating further if there is a possibility to help more women succeed on platforms by seeing what types of training they&nbsp;need.</p><p>“BuildHer taught me the basics of life skills, the career itself, carpentry and joinery, and how to cope with life.” — Sabina, Lynk carpenter, Nairobi</p>Sabina<p>After completing the training and employment program with BuildHer, Sabina began working full time as a carpenter for Lynk. She spoke of how hard it was initially when she had just joined the platform. “When you come to the workshop, [men’s] first impression is like, ‘Really? Like really, can you make anything?’” Sabina&nbsp;says.</p><p>She adds that Lynk helped to create an environment where she could thrive as a female carpenter. The platform played a critical role in further developing the skills she needed to be able to prove herself through her competence in the profession. The platform work has become Sabina’s passion and only source of income. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/sabina/">Watch Sabina’s&nbsp;story</a></p><p>After graduating from the University of Lagos with a degree in Chemical Engineering, Anastestia (Ann), 24, found it challenging to find a job. As she sent out job applications after job applications, a friend suggested she think more laterally. Having seen the success of some of her friends on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, Ann thought, “Okay, I can do this,&nbsp;too.”</p><p>When Ann realized that she could make good money as a coder, she began to teach herself the basics of coding. She is now part of a small but steadily growing number of female developers in Africa. <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/e358c23f-afe3-49c5-a509-034257688580/e-Conomy-Africa-2020.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=nmuGYF2">Recent statistics</a> show that only one in five developers in Africa is female. She quickly fell in love with the work and loves that she’s making it as a young Nigerian woman in a male-dominated industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/_GUOh_CZ9fI">Watch Ann’s&nbsp;story</a></p> Social commerce: An easy (and free) choice for female entrepreneurs <p>For platform sellers like Gloria, Mary, and Dorcas, social media sites like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and YouTube reduce the barriers to entering the world of platform selling. Women often face these barriers when setting up their own business or engaging in offline work, like a lack of capital and having to balance work with childcare responsibilities.</p><p>Social selling has provided Mary, 24, a young entrepreneurial farmer in Kenya, with the flexibility to earn an income while caring for her young son as a single parent. She already owned a computer and a phone and didn’t need much else to start her own YouTube channel, through which she shares farming best practices and promotes her mushroom and strawberry businesses. She cross-posts these videos on her Facebook page and then moves conversations with interested buyers over to WhatsApp. These channels helped her connect with buyers during the pandemic when the markets were closed. Mary is also looking forward to earning money from her YouTube channel once she reaches the 1000-follower mark, the minimum number of subscribers one must have before their channel is monetized. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/mary/">Watch Mary’s&nbsp;story</a></p><p>For Dorcas, 41, in Nairobi, platforms have helped her overcome the limitations of lupus that keeps her mostly housebound. She started by baking and selling cakes on Facebook and WhatsApp and has since managed to expand her home-based business to include shoes. She relies on her social networks and various Facebook groups as a low-cost means to find customers.</p>Dorcas<p>“90% of my sales are generated from Facebook. And then the few who do not buy, they give exposure. So, you find someone who will refer my page to someone else. So that’s how my business grows.” — Dorcas, social commerce entrepreneur, Nairobi. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/dorcas/">Watch Dorcas’s&nbsp;Story</a></p><p>For Gloria, 30, social commerce represented a flexible way to diversify her income, something that became critical when she lost her job just before the outbreak of COVID-19. While doing her full-time job, Gloria co-founded House of Penda, a Kampala-based company, as a side business selling fashion accessories through Facebook. It became her only source of income during the pandemic. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/kemi/">Watch Gloria’s&nbsp;story</a></p> The tension behind the flexibility of online&nbsp;work <p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">Some studies</a> have discussed the tensions of “flexible” platform work and raised questions regarding the expectations of women that it perpetuates, specifically in handling both full-time obligations in the home along with platform work. An ODI <a href="https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/resource-documents/women_in_the_gig_economy_final_digital.pdf">study</a> found that women gig workers in Kenya and South Africa identified childcare as the biggest challenge to their economic opportunities, along with work–life balance and the decreasing quality of their&nbsp;work.</p>Mary and her&nbsp;son<p>The women engaged in this project confirmed this tension. On the one hand, many of them talked about how platform work has offered a level of flexibility that enables them to choose when, where, and how to work. For Dathive, a single mother of four, for example, the flexibility that comes with her ride-hailing job enables her to head out early in the morning, drop students to school and workers to work, then return home in time to give her children breakfast and get them to school, too. She is glad that the money she makes from SafeBoda is enough to provide her children’s needs.</p><p>Four of the seven women in this project are single mothers. They talked about the challenges of splitting time between work and children on top of the responsibility of being the sole breadwinners for the&nbsp;family.</p><p>Mary, for example, explained how she needed to be online regularly to connect with her customers. She said it consumes a lot of time away from her&nbsp;family.</p><p>On the whole, despite the challenges, the platform experience for these women was positive. Even during the pandemic, they earned some income by doing work they enjoy through platforms.</p><p>However, the many unique challenges women face as they engage in platform-based work should not be overlooked.

<p>By Miranda Grant and Grace Natabaalo</p><p>In October 2020, Caribou Digital and Nairobi-based <a href="http://www.storyby.design">Story x Design</a>, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, embarked on a <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">participatory video storytelling project </a>that put 11 young Africans who earn their livelihood from digital platforms at the center of their own story. For two months, the seven women and four men in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda shared their experiences as platform workers and&nbsp;sellers.</p><p>A key theme that stood out in these stories was the prevalence of “side hustles” — money-earning businesses, gigs, or jobs undertaken in addition to a person’s primary business or employment. With personal needs and families to take care of, along with the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many platform workers and sellers have taken on side hustles in the form of additional platform work or the pursuit of off-platform ventures. Below, we share insights on these side hustles as shared through their video&nbsp;diaries.</p> 1. Hustling across platforms <p>Many platform workers and sellers operate across various digital platforms, also known as multi-homing. As singular platform work often fails to provide enough income, workers and sellers are driven to sign up to multiple platforms. Studies by <a href="https://fair.work/wp-content/uploads/sites/131/2020/12/Fairwork-2020-Annual-Report.pdf">Fairwork</a>, for example, have found that many gig workers still earn below minimum&nbsp;wages.</p><p>In early 2020, David, 28, took up a motorcycle delivery rider gig with Solar Taxi, a ride-hailing and courier company in Accra that uses solar-powered cars, tricycles, and motorbikes. David secured the bike on a hire purchase agreement and has to make monthly payments. To meet his payment target of $7 a week, David tells us he had to sign up to other platforms, including Wote, Bolt Food, and Enrout, on top of riding for Solar Taxi. But even then, David is worried that the money he earns from across these platforms is not enough for him to fulfill his big dreams, one of which is to start a&nbsp;family.</p><blockquote>“I stay online as and when a trip comes. I accept whether on Bolt, on Solar Taxi, or on Enrout. I accept them and then I run,” he&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>In Nairobi, Dorcas, 41, sells cakes and children’s shoes across multiple social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. In Uganda, Gloria, 30, does the same, selling fashion accessories through Facebook and WhatsApp. Although they are already using various platforms to help increase sales, they are both planning to set up their own websites as yet another way to reach more customers.</p><blockquote>“I want to set up a website especially for the cake business. I want to make it big but still, home-based. Because I have been asked by so many people if I can tutor them on how to do just basic cakes. I can go to where they are and then just maybe tutor or even take advantage of online and then just do either Zoom classes or Google class,” Dorcas&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>Even online freelancer Anastestia, 24, who is a software developer and still new to online work, knows that creating a profile on more than one platform pays off. She is toggling Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, and Freelance.com. She sees Upwork as her main hustle as it is where she gets most of her jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/_GUOh_CZ9fI">Watch Anastestia’s story</a></p> 2. “Double-up your side hustle” and move&nbsp;offline <p>Some of the workers also balance on-platform work with off-platform side hustles, using the flexibility platform work offers to run and set up other businesses.</p><p>On top of being a rider for three apps, David is also an independent delivery guy and takes calls from customers off the platforms. However, despite working across multiple platforms and independently, he is still looking for additional means of earning&nbsp;money.</p><blockquote>“There are bigger projects I want to do which this one cannot fund. So, what I will do is to add more avenues to make money so that I can actually see my dreams come true,” David&nbsp;shares.</blockquote><p>Peter, 35, drives for Bolt and Taxify in Nigeria. A few months ago, he invested what money, time, and energy he had left into a 2000-bird poultry farm. If COVID-19 has taught him anything, it’s that you need to have a Plan B. He sees the poultry farm as a more stable investment than his platform&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>“You need to double up your hustle. You need to look for strategies and ways apart from what you’ve been thinking. You need to think a step or two steps ahead just to achieve or get the pursuit of your goals,” Peter&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>In Nigeria, Okoli Edwin, 20, who runs a physical shop selling solar products, tried to expand his business online through Jumia and Jiji at the onset of the pandemic. He assumed there would be a surge in solar panel demand as people would be quarantined and in need of consistent power supply. However, what he had not accounted for was the stretched pocket of buyers in a strained economic year. Okoli said he went online to look for ideas on how to make extra cash and came across forex trading. Now, Okoli takes forex trading classes online and watches the markets through his phone for any potential investments and&nbsp;deals.</p><blockquote>“It got to a time where everything was just crazy — no more resources, we were out of stock, we couldn’t supply the customers. I fell down, really bad because how am I going to feed my family? How am I gonna do a lot of things? And so, I thought to myself, ‘Man, I had to get a side hustle. I had to look for another thing to do,’” Okoli&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>For Gloria, what used to be her digital side hustle has now become her only source of income. In 2019, she and a friend founded House of Penda, a social commerce store that sells fashion accessories through Facebook and WhatsApp. Back then, she still had a full-time job in brand marketing and considered House of Penda as her side business. When the pandemic hit, Gloria lost her job; she has, since then, focused on growing House of Penda. However, as it struggles to make enough money, she is now looking out for branding gigs and also applying for full-time jobs.</p><blockquote>“I told everyone that hey, I’m available for gigs. I’m passionate about brand and communications. Tell someone that you know someone, mention my name, and that you know someone who’s really good at this. That was my strategy, get gigs and hope to God that a job comes along,” Gloria&nbsp;shares.</blockquote> 3. The struggle for those who don’t have a Plan&nbsp;B Stanley<p>Workers who are not able to find or take on side hustles are fully reliant on the work that comes through the platform, leaving them vulnerable when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. Stanley, 35, previously a cleaner on Lynk, an on-demand labor platform in Kenya, relied on the platform as his sole source of income. In fact, as part of an incubation program, Lynk even paid him a monthly stipend and bonuses. However, despite its best efforts, Lynk was forced to halt its cleaning services a month into the pandemic, leaving Stanley with no work and no income. Stanley says this has taught him a lesson — “Have a Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, and even a Plan&nbsp;D.”</p><p>As Muthoni Mwaura’s Kenyan <a href="https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/12985">study found</a>, “The notion of side hustling is particularly important for understanding youth livelihoods in contemporary contexts” because it helps to understand how young people make meaning of themselves and opportunities around them in extreme socioeconomic conditions. Listening to the platform workers and sellers over two months has revealed how having a side hustle — whether working across platforms or juggling on-platform and off-platform work — is key to surviving and thriving across digital platforms.</p><p>However, this also points to the shortcomings of platform work, and should make us question if this work is really dignified. Should people have to frantically piece together so many sources of income to earn a living? Does this make platform work meaningful or fulfilling?</p><p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">Watch all the videos&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-of-young-people-in-africa-the-hustle-is-real-c566b3b3a7f9">Platform livelihoods of young people in Africa: “The hustle is real”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   The Growth of Artificial Intelligence in Identity Governance 

<p>Organizations are facing increasing pressure to provide employees and contractors with the right access to the right applications and systems at the right time. But how can they do this with their existing, manually-driven Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions and processes? How can security and IT professionals address the needs of the new remote workforce and its demands for access to new cloud applications and services? Combined with new machine identity types, accelerated DevOps/Agile development methodologies, and unplanned organizational changes, static IGA solutions and processes need to become more flexible, more dynamic, and more automated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the introduction of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga">artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into IGA</a>, organizations have a clear path to hyper-automating their existing identity governance solution and processes. By applying AI and ML, enterprises can further streamline and automate intelligence across all identity governance use cases, including access requests and approvals, access reviews, and role engineering. Here are a few examples of how AI and ML can<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga"> hyper-automate IGA</a> solutions and processes to help combat your organization’s entitlement creep problems:&nbsp;</p>

  Identify access risks across the entire organization and provide actionable insights to help accelerate the removal of overprivileged access 
	 Identify excessive privileges, orphaned accounts, and provide confidence scoring (example: low, medium, and high) in order to provide the right level of security risk context&nbsp; 
	 Enable micro-certifications, where only a small set of entitlements and roles are approved between annual or biannual certification campaigns 
 <p>While no new technology is 100% foolproof, the introduction of AI and ML capabilities into <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga">identity governance solutions</a> and processes provides organizations with the most promising way to address the silent access challenge known as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/what-entitlement-creep">entitlement creep</a>.</p>

 ForgeRock’s Modern Approach: Autonomous Identity&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">ForgeRock Autonomous Identity</a> provides real-time, continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility. The solution allows organizations to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">accelerate secure workforce access,</a> achieve regulatory compliance, mitigate risks, and reduce costs. By leveraging AI and&nbsp; ML techniques, Autonomous Identity collects and analyzes all identity data to identify security access and risk blind spots. The solution provides organizations with a complete user access landscape view – what good and bad access looks like across the entire enterprise. It provides organizations with wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access by providing enterprise-wide contextual insights, high-risk user access awareness, and remediation recommendations, such as the removal of overprivileged access, excessive permissions, and orphaned accounts.&nbsp;</p>

 How it Works 

<p>ForgeRock Autonomous Identity links users to entitlements at the lowest attribute level. The solution uses profile data to determine the likelihood that an individual will need an entitlement, based on how entitlements are currently distributed across the organization. By applying AI and ML techniques, Autonomous Identity can quickly analyze all your organization’s identity data and identify overprivileged access, excessive permissions, and orphaned accounts. All are key contributors to your organization’s entitlement creep challenges.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

 Why ForgeRock Autonomous Identity? 

<p>Here’s how Autonomous Identity’s unique and highly differentiated capabilities address entitlement creep:&nbsp;</p>

  Global Visibility: By leveraging AI-driven identity analytics, you can collect and analyze identity data (example: accounts, roles, assignments, entitlements, and more) from diverse identity, governance, and infrastructure data sources in order to provide enterprise-wide visibility to all identities and what they have access to, including over privileged user access. This approach provides your security and risk teams with contextual insights into low-, medium-, and high-risk user access at scale. 
	 Data Agnostic: ForgeRock Autonomous Identity works with all identity data types to develop a complete view of the user access landscape. By consuming and analyzing tens of millions of data points quickly, Autonomous Identity can predict and recommend user access rights and highlight potential risks. Total landscape visibility provides highly accurate models based on what good access should and shouldn’t look like, including excessive permissions. Unlike other “black box” identity analytics solutions that are based on static rules, roles, and peer group analysis, Autonomous Identity relies strictly on organizational data to develop an analysis that is free from bias originating from human-derived rules and roles that exist in your existing identity governance solution. 
	 Transparent AI: Unlike other “black box” identity analytics solutions, ForgeRock Autonomous Identity allows you to fully comprehend how and why risk confidence scores are determined. By visually presenting low-, medium-, and high-risk confidence scores together, security and risk professionals can contextually understand what key risk indicators were met and, more importantly, why they were met. For example, why are certain employee and contractor accounts orphaned? This AI-driven approach recommends risk-based identity governance remediation updates based on enterprise-wide confidence scores. 
  Eliminate Entitlement Creep with AI-Driven Identity Analytics 

<p>In today’s new reality, organizations have dynamic business challenges. They need a dynamic solution to help them achieve their business goals and grow the business. By applying AI-driven identity analytics, organizations can hyper-automate their existing identity governance solutions and processes, thereby eliminating entitlement creep. By detecting user access patterns – identity analytics can quickly highlight inappropriate user access. In turn, AI-driven identity analytics can automate the removal of high-confidence and low-risk access rights, lowering the risk of entitlement creep across your organization.&nbsp;</p>

 Elemental Chat — The First Holochain P2P App Released for&nbsp;Hosts  Leadership &amp; Org Update&nbsp;#25 <p>When we first began this project, we shared our vision for an Internet of peer-to-peer web applications that would give users the power to direct their own online experiences. We connected with thousands of people also inspired by the possibility of removing centralising powers built into the infrastructure so that humanity might vastly expand its creative and collaborative potential.</p><p>The launch of Elemental Chat in our Alpha test certainly doesn’t get all that done. But it is a real step towards realising that promise. Elemental Chat running on HoloPorts has no central database. Each person who is running the app signs their messages to their own chain and then automatically posts them to the shared database that is hosted by the other users of the application. This is the start of something. This isn’t simply the seed of an idea. The deep roots of Holochain and Holo have fully sprouted and are now growing and strengthening.</p><p>This rapid recent growth is demonstrated in the timeline of events that led us to the current&nbsp;release.</p>  15-Sept-2020<br> <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/a-big-leap-forward-for-holochain-holo-2efaaa54ed08">We shared publicly about Holochain RSM</a>  15-Oct-2020 <br><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-path-from-rsm-to-beta-1fdca3f581a">We shared our Path to Beta roadmap for Holochain RSM</a>  12-Nov-2020 <br><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/real-p2p-networking-coming-to-holochain-rsm/">We shared about the upcoming Networking features for Holochain RSM in the Dev&nbsp;Pulse</a>  27-Nov-2020 <br><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/networking-has-landed/">We announced also in the Dev Pulse that Networking in RSM had&nbsp;landed</a>  24-Dec-2020 <br><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/closing-the-year-with-elemental-chat-on-holochain-rsm-105f9eede19c">We announced Elemental Chat was released to Pre-release testers</a>  29-Jan-2021 <br><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/testing-testing-testing-and-some-goodies-for-developers/">We shared about rewriting automated test tools for RSM in the Dev&nbsp;Pulse</a>  10-Feb-2021 <br><a href="https://forum.holo.host/">We announced the release of Elemental Chat to&nbsp;Hosts</a>  <p>The speed at which we have been able to move since the launch of Holochain RSM is indicative of how quickly and easily others will also be able to bring new P2P apps to market. So let’s dig into what Elemental Chat is, what it is not and what it lets us do moving&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Elemental Chat is simply a proof of concept application. What we mean by that is that it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of popular messaging apps on the market today. You can create channels and you can send messages. You can also query the application network to see how many nodes are connected and how many people have the application open in a&nbsp;browser.</p><p>What you can’t do is limit what channels you see or follow, or send messages to only one person. You also can’t have reply threads, and in fact, the UI doesn’t even showcase all of the best features in Holochain. In this super-basic testing app, you see everything and can differentiate little which means a less than ideal user experience.</p><p>None of those wonderful user-friendly features are included with Elemental Chat, and that is intentional. We wanted an uncomplicated app with only a few features to avoid spending too much of our time testing and debugging a chat application, when our focus is really to build the underlying infrastructure that comprises the Holo distributed hosting platform.</p> A chat app differentiates Holochain from blockchain <p>Paul explained a few of the reasons why we chose Elemental Chat to release as the first distributed app for Holo quite nicely in the December 24 Dev&nbsp;Pulse:</p><blockquote>“First, we thought it would be more fun to test; second, we knew it would push against all of Holochain’s capabilities in ways that would show up any bugs; and third, we wanted something that would show us where the performance bottlenecks were.”</blockquote><p>But another important reason for us is because chat functionality illustrates the difference and potential of Holochain as compared to blockchain.</p><p>Releasing a chat app — even a toy app like Elemental Chat — demonstrates unequivocally that Holochain is designed for building classes of applications that could never really work on a blockchain. Think about apps where things like scalability, and speedy transactions or interactions are crucial for basic functionality. The vast majority of web apps that we use in our lives simply do not require the global consensus of a blockchain and in fact could be hampered if we try to force them into consensus models. Chat exemplifies this difference to us in the most natural of&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Imagine being at a party with 25 to 100 of your closest friends with people in small groups around a room chatting. Many different conversations are happening in the room simultaneously. You might be able to hear parts of many of them, but you are likely paying attention to one or two of them more than others. Each other person in the room is most likely doing the same — that is they are listening to the conversation they are having — not to the general humm of conversation in the entire space. Because of that, each person has their own unique experience of what is being said. I doubt anyone at that party would say there was something wrong with the way people were communicating. In fact — that very normal in-person multi-sensory type of setting is exactly what many of us have been missing this past year due to the pandemic.</p><p>So let’s talk about how a typical blockchain might try to model the communication at that party. One person (Alice) might say something. Another person (Bob) would need to process it and clarify to everyone else what was said and would record it and ensure that each other person understood it the exact same way. The first person (Alice) could not say something again until the first thing she said was processed by every person in the room. Some sort of order would need to be created for who was speaking because each statement would need to get placed in the correct order and shared with every other person in the room for the conversation to be deemed&nbsp;valid.</p><p>This sounds ludicrous — because it is. Consensus models are irrelevant for many human needs and when it comes to collaboration they are often extremely inefficient. With blockchains that inefficiency is evidenced in multiple ways but perhaps most explicitly by the extreme consumption of energy and creation of waste used to power the networks.</p><p>The reality is many applications only need to do two things really well: enable ease of coordination and reach eventual consistency.</p><p>Let’s take a look now at how Holochain’s natural patterns approach would model that same party. As you speak with a small subset of your friends, your messages are saved to your local chain. Your friends that are participating in your conversation would receive an immediate signal and hear your message. After someone’s message is saved to their local chain it is also saved to the group database or DHT. After a short while, your part of the shared database would get updated with messages from other conversations happening elsewhere in the party — and eventually you’d have access to all the gossip messages from the party. Sounds like a great and memorable party!</p><p>The use of natural patterns to model digital interaction is something that makes Holochain different — it’s why Holochain enables applications that can truly scale and why it’s ideal for collaboration. Holochain ensures agency for each user but does not require imposing a singular perspective.</p> How does Holochain work for currencies? <p>So we can see why Holochain is great for modeling a chat app, but many were expecting us to release the app that will run Holo’s cryptocurrency HoloFuel. People often ask “How can HoloFuel work without consensus?”</p><p>Imagine a bunch of parents in a community create a babysitting time swap system and have a phone app where I can credit you for three hours of babysitting, and my babysitting balance goes down by three hours when I do. Some people have provided more babysitting than they’ve received and they’d show positive balances of hours. Other folks who have received more babysitting than they’ve provided, would have a negative balance of&nbsp;hours.</p><p>If Alice needs to transfer some credits to Bob, do we really need global consensus? Do we need to know the state of every account in the system? No. Only Bob’s and Alice’s accounts are changing from this transaction, and they are the only authorities to make changes to their accounts. They can sign a single identical transaction to each of their chains (a transaction that shows Alice spending credits and Bob receiving them), and when they publish it to the rest of the network, others on the network will validate the transaction to make sure it follows the shared agreements. It is basically that simple. (Well it’s not quite that simple, but for a better understanding of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3yqYhJViCQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">how Holochain works, check out this twelve minute&nbsp;video</a>.)</p><p>This model for currency is more like peer-to-peer accounting of value, where your chain holds the history of your transactions. Not everyone is transacting in hours of babysitting but the principles of the model work exactly the same way when you replace babysitting with distributed cloud hosting as the service, and it will work that way for food, energy, and many other applications as&nbsp;well.</p> What’s Next <p>The release of Elemental Chat for hosts is an important step forward on the journey. For us though, the next infrastructure milestone is the one we’ll be doing backflips about. That is when non-hosts — regular web users — will actually get the experience of creating an account and logging into Elemental Chat that is hosted on a hosts’ HoloPort. We are already beginning the testing cycle for that milestone.</p>Roadmap<p>In the coming weeks, you can count on us to support more and more hosts to connect their ports to the Holo network and to begin chatting in Elemental Chat. We will be assessing how well the performance scales and listening to what folks have to say about&nbsp;it.</p><p>We will most likely make a few small changes to the chat app as we prepare for the wider release to web users. We will continue to evolve the testing framework so that it can be used more generally by hosted apps, not just applications we directly install on&nbsp;HPOS.</p><p>As we shared in the previous article, we are also moving forward on several of the other milestones that come after Hosted Elemental Chat. We may even be releasing the Host Console work simultaneously, but we are not promising that yet. After that, we’ll be focusing on the HoloFuel application.</p>Approx Progress on Upcoming Milestones<p>What isn’t visible from these diagrams, however, is the work on Holochain that is continuing to evolve and which is critical for both Holo and community application developers who are building apps in our ecosystem.</p><p>Holochain has been steadily improving usability of the framework. When we first announced RSM, though it was a vast improvement technically, we hadn’t started releasing to crates, nor stabilized the Holochain development kit (HDK). We have recently shipped a raft of breaking changes to the HDK which should be fairly stable now. We’ve also ‘nixified’ Holochain to make it easier to install and ensure identical installations among collaborators. You can stay current with the latest tested version via <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/">Holochain.love</a>.</p><p>In the coming weeks, there will be additional improvements to Holochain. Following the changeover of the database engine, we’ll be implementing sharding and other key network scaling features before we move on to more security and identity management features. All of these are foundations necessary for the Beta release of&nbsp;Holo.</p><p>So, I will leave you with yet another shout out to all of those who are supporting this amazing work coming into being. Kudos to the dev teams for bringing this release across the finish line. Kudos to the community-facing teams who are supporting hosts getting connected to the network. Kudos to all the app devs in the community pulling for new features and demonstrating how natural patterns work in Holochain. Kudos to all the admins and volunteers who share their knowledge with newcomers to the&nbsp;project.</p><p>In gratitude,<br>Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/title-elemental-chat-the-first-holochain-p2p-app-released-for-hosts-3e9f44bdcaca">Elemental Chat — The First Holochain P2P App Released for Hosts</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>IMPULSE (Identity Management in PUbLic SErvices) is an european project led by Gradiant – Research and Technology Organization (RTO) focused on connectivity, intelligence, and security technologies – and involving 16 entities from 9 different countries, including InfoCert.</p>



<p>The alliance will work on the concept of Electronic Identity (eID) – the way users can identify themselves (and be identified) through the network – and its implications in multiple contexts – through the use of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The current health crisis around the world has limited personal interactions, digitising all kinds of procedures. This brings a number of problems, not only for those unfamiliar with the complex identification systems on the internet, but also for those who are not comfortable providing their personal data over the internet.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in a world where it is increasingly common to carry out all kinds of processes online, avoiding fraud and deception is only possible with first-class technology.</p>



<p>InfoCert and the other 15 partners involved in the project aims to create a tool which combines two of the most promising technologies available today, such as Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain networks, with the aim of improving the management of digital identity and electronic identification in the public sector.</p>



<p>The application of these technologies in the field of digital identity will substantially improve the existing electronic identification systems at the time legal, privacy or social issues requiring further analysis may raise.</p>



<p>IMPULSE will incorporate advanced face biometrics and document validation techniques based on AI to facilitate identification processes and provide the user with a digital onboarding experience that is fully transparent.</p>



<p>In addition, blockchain technology and the use of smart contracts will allow adding trustworthiness in the process, providing mechanisms for users to demonstrate their identity without the need to disclose their personal data to third parties, a priori, not reliable.</p>



<p>The consortium, made up of partners from Spain, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland, Iceland, France and Denmark, is funded by the European Union with €4 million under the Horizon 2020 programme.</p>

It will explain some parts of Polkadot but it won’t get too much into specific details like staking, slashing or other important mechanics in the ecosystem. Check out the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/">official wiki</a> to learn more about Polkadot.</blockquote> Status quo <p>First of all it is important to mention that the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parachains">Parachain</a> functionality is not live yet. This functionality is the last missing piece of the Polkadot <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-io/polkadotpaper/raw/master/PolkaDotPaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> and there is a public <a href="https://polkadot.network/launch-parachains/">rollout plan</a> available that provides an overview about the progress. However, <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/introducing-rococo-polkadots-parachain-testnet-e3e67fc40b56">since August 2020</a> the Parachain functionality is being tested in the official Parachain Testnet Rococo which in V0 only ran with prototype code. In December 2020 <a href="https://medium.com/plasm-network/announcing-plasm-network-parachain-on-rococo-v1-bf49b3f3ca53">Rococo V1 was launched</a> and recently Plasm Network <a href="https://medium.com/plasm-network/announcing-plasm-network-parachain-on-rococo-v1-bf49b3f3ca53">announced to be the first project that joined the Rococo V1 Testnet</a> which surely is a big milestone as the codebase of Rococo V1 will also be used in Kusama and Polkadot. Meanwhile other possible future Parachains like KILT <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/kilts-path-to-parachains-ad3be644db8a">followed and announced their own&nbsp;Roadmap</a>.</p> Kusama vs.&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Although Kusama can be seen as the pre-production environment for Polkadot you should be aware that Kusama might and probably will evolve independently from Polkadot. If your project is in an early stage or you want to experiment with Parachains in a real world environment before moving it into production you will probably prefer Kusama over Polkadot first. You might also be interested in testing specific features in Kusama which aren’t yet available on Polkadot.</p>Source: <a href="https://polkadot.network/">https://polkadot.network/</a> Relay Chain &amp; Parachains <p>The Relay Chain is the central chain of Polkadot.

Other specific work is delegated to the Parachains that serve different purposes. All Parachains that are connected to the Relay Chain share the same security. Polkadot also has a shared state between the Relay Chain and all connected Parachains to ensure the validity of the entire system. Smart Contracts are not supported on the Relay Chain but can be supported by Parachains.</p><blockquote>It’s expected that each Parachain will be as light and application specific as possible and serve a specific use&nbsp;case.</blockquote>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06">https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06</a><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/the-path-of-a-parachain-block-47d05765d7a">The Path of a Parachain Block</a> it is described in detail how a new Parachain Block is produced.</p><p>You may notice the term Parathread in the picture above.

Thus there probably won’t be enough slots available for all projects which is why they need to be obtained in a so-called auction (more on that below). Whereas Parachains get a guaranteed high throughput by bonding DOT tokens, Parathreads follow a <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06">pay as you go model</a> where a fee in DOT is being paid to validators for creating blocks. In some cases this even makes sense if there aren’t many or high frequent state updates expected (e.g. DNS, Oracles).</p>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06">https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06</a><p>Parachains can become Parathreads and vice versa as they share the same technical base.</p> Parachain Slot Auction &amp; Parachain Crowdloans <p>In order to become a Parachain in Kusama or Polkadot a slot must be obtained in a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction">Parachain Slot Auction</a>. Each slot duration is capped to 2 years and divided into 6-month lease periods. Parachains may lease more than one slot over time in order to extend their lease to Polkadot past the 2 year slot duration. Depending on the auction it might be possible that a slot is owned by 4 different Parachains during the 2 year slot duration.</p><blockquote>Parachains don’t need to always inhabit the same slot. As long as a Parachain inhabits any slot it can continue as Parachain.</blockquote><p>Parachain candidates can place bids in unpermissioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_auction">candle auctions</a> that rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_random_function">verifiable random functions</a> (VRFs) where the original mechanism has been slightly modified to be secure on a blockchain. The auction can be divided into two&nbsp;phases:</p>  Opening Phase  Closing Phase  <p>No matter in what phase the auction is, the bids are public. From the first block until the last block during the Closing Phase a winner will be determined randomly and nobody knows which block determines the winner until the Closing Phase is finished.</p><p>Projects will also be able to launch a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crowdloans">Crowdloan Campaign</a> with specific parameters which allows them to loan DOTs from the community to obtain a Parachain slot without having to bond all the required DOTs on their&nbsp;own.</p><p>In the video above core developer Shawn Tabrizi explains both variants very&nbsp;well.</p> Substrate <p>After giving an overview about the Polkadot ecosystem it’s time to introduce Substrate. It is a modular framework that enables you to create purpose-built blockchains by composing custom and/or pre-built components.</p><p>Substrate is the foundation of all blockchains in the Polkadot ecosystem and requires knowledge in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>In the Substrate Developer Hub (link below) you can learn everything that is required to get started developing your own Substrate-based chain.</p><p><a href="https://substrate.dev/">Official Substrate Documentation for Blockchain Developers · Substrate Developer Hub</a></p><p>A few important things to know about Substrate:</p>  The runtime of Substrate is referred to as the “state transition function” which contains the business logic that defines the behavior of the blockchain. You as a developer can define storage items that represent the state of the blockchain and functions that allow users to make changes to the&nbsp;state.  Substrate ships with FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities) which is a set of modules (called Pallets) and support libraries that simplify runtime development. Pallets are individual modules within FRAME that host domain-specific logic.  To enable forkless runtime upgrade capabilities, Substrate uses runtimes that are built as WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode.  <p>To learn more about how to perform a forkless runtime upgrade you can take a look at the <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/upgrade-a-chain/">official tutorial</a>.</p> Pallets vs. Smart Contracts <p>For people heading over from other chains and ecosystems like Ethereum it might be obvious that application specific logic is always written in Smart Contracts which in turn are deployed on the blockchain. But as you already learned the idea of the Polkadot ecosystem is to have different Parachains that are as light and as application specific as possible.</p><p>There are basically 3 possibilities to add custom logic to a Substrated-based blockchain:</p>  Write custom Pallets and include it in the runtime<br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/create-a-pallet/">https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/create-a-pallet/</a><br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/recipes/pallets-intro.html">https://substrate.dev/recipes/pallets-intro.html</a>  Include the <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/smart-contracts/contracts-pallet">Contracts Pallet</a> in the runtime and write contracts in ink! (Rust based eDSL)<br>- <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs/">https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs</a><br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/">https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop</a>  Include Frontier (Pallets that serve as Ethereum compatibility layer) to the runtime and write contracts in Solidity<br>- <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier">https://github.com/paritytech/frontier</a><br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/frontier-workshop/#/">https://substrate.dev/frontier-workshop</a>  <blockquote>Custom Pallets are the best choice if you are building a greenfield project that serves a specific purpose and needs to run its own&nbsp;network.</blockquote><p>Substrate already provides a lot of Pallets which you can combine together as needed, including your custom Pallet(s) in order to build a lightweight and unique runtime for your application specific blockchain:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/v3.0.0/frame">Default Pallets of Substrate</a> (Note: The link points to the v3.0.0 version of Substrate which was released a few days ago. Most tutorials are still based on&nbsp;v2.0.0)  <a href="https://github.com/danforbes/pallet-nft">NFT Pallet</a> (There is also a WIP reference implementation that showcases CryptoKitties on Substrate)  <p>I also discovered a <a href="https://marketplace-staging.substrate.dev/">Substrate Marketplace</a> where you are able to find different Pallets (at least the default ones) which you can include into your&nbsp;runtime.</p><p>If you aim to write contracts in ink! or port a Solidity based application from Ethereum over to a Substrate-based Parachain you don’t necessarily need to launch your own Parachain as there already exist projects that plan to launch a Parachain and include the required Pallets in their&nbsp;runtime:</p>  <a href="https://edgewa.re/">Edgeware</a> (ink! based contracts)  <a href="https://moonbeam.network/">Moonbeam</a> (Solidity contracts)  <blockquote>Note: To check out how Moonbeam works you can clone the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/moonbeam-playground">https://github.com/51nodes/moonbeam-playground</a></blockquote> Polkadot compatibility with&nbsp;Cumulus <p>When you have written (and hopefully tested&nbsp;;-)) your custom Pallets you need to make sure that you build a Polkadot compatible runtime that exposes an interface for validating its state transition and provides interfaces to send and receive messages of other Parachains.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-cumulus">Cumulus</a> is an extension to Substrate that makes it easy to transform any Substrate-built runtime into a Polkadot-compatible Parachain. It is still in development, but the idea is that it should be simple to take a Substrate chain and add the Parachain code by importing the crates and adding a single line of code. You can also dive deeper into that topic and learn more about the mechanics of Polkadot by reading the <a href="https://w3f.github.io/parachain-implementers-guide/index.html">Parachain Implementers Guide</a>.</p><p>If you have built your own Parachain and want to join the official Rococo Testnet you have to follow <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-parachains-rococo#rococo-v1-parachain-requirements">this guide</a>. The auction mechanism mentioned above is not active yet and Rococo is currently controlled by the development leads at Parity Technologies. For joining the network you have to run at least 1 Collator for your Parachain and 1 Validator node for&nbsp;Rococo.</p><blockquote>Note: Learn how to setup a local Polkadot network based on Rococo by following the Readme of our repository: <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/polkadot-local-rococo">https://github.com/51nodes/polkadot-local-rococo</a></blockquote> Final Thoughts <p>Substrate has a clean design and makes it very easy to build an application specific blockchain for everyone familiar with Rust. If you decide to run your own Parachain (or Parathread) you should also think about how to incentivise other players to run a Collator node in your network — for example by introducing your own network&nbsp;token.</p><p>Although Parachains are not live on Kusama and Polkadot yet we can already see many projects that aim to become a Parachain as soon as possible. It will be interesting to watch the battle of those projects to secure their exclusive Parachain slot on Kusama and Polkadot. Personally I am very interested to see how the auction mechanism works and which projects will secure their Parachain slot via a Crowdloan Campaign.</p><p>I am also looking forward to play around with the interoperability features that Polkadot provides when the implementation is mature&nbsp;enough.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> based in Stuttgart is a provider of Crypto Economy solutions.</p><p>51nodes is member of the <a href="https://www.parity.io/announcing-substrate-delivery-partners/">Substrate Delivery Partners</a> program and supports companies and other organizations in realizing their blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/kusama-polkadot-build-an-application-specific-blockchain-and-launch-a-parachain-524ff4560acf">Kusama &amp; Polkadot: Build an application specific Blockchain and launch a Parachain!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Join the growing list of forward-thinking companies and organizations across the globe who are actively building the future of digital identity. This is your chance to be a part of the newest and most dynamic network in decentralized identity technology, open for innovative developers and companies eager to bring their solutions to market.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>At Indicio, we’ve seen a rapid rise in demand for robust, stable, and professionally maintained networks to support decentralized identity solutions. It’s not a surprise: decentralized identity’s moment has arrived. That’s why we’ve been hard at work creating Hyperledger Indy networks upon which developers all over the world are building, testing, and launching their solutions. Powering these networks are Node Operators— companies and teams from around the world and from various industries who are designing and launching decentralized identity solutions.</p>
<p>What is a Node Operator?<br>At the heart of a decentralized identity ecosystem lies the distributed ledger— a distributed database made up of multiple copies of a ledger, hosted by various nodes. In practice at Indicio.tech, this means companies and organizations, together as a community, volunteer to run a copy of the ledger on a server that is under their authority. On the Indicio Network, we call these “Node Operators.” Together, these copies make up a verifiable data registry, from which credential issuers and verifiers can prove important information.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				  Set your solutions up for success by becoming a Node Operator 
<p></p>
<p>Be where the action is happening<br>We’re creating a community of doers, made up of companies worldwide who are creating digital identity solutions for use cases of all kinds, including banking, education, supply chain, travel, and humanitarian efforts. As a node operator, you’ll be on the frontline of the innovation, playing a leading role in this world-changing digital transformation.</p>
<p>Get access to resources<br>Node Operators are eligible to receive a complementary business support package for their first year in the program, including architectural guidance, best practice checks, an account-dedicated Slack channel, and a dedicated network engineer monitoring your environment and assisting you with your needs. We also help our node operators prepare their presentations and marketing materials for webinars and informational events.</p>
<p>Learn by doing<br>There’s no better way to get trained on how a decentralized identity ecosystem works than to play a critical role in the ecosystem itself. Supporting one of the nodes on the network gets your team a front-row view of how a network functions from the inside. We’ve seen firsthand how operating a node speeds up a company’s ability to develop and deploy their own solutions.</p>
<p>Take part in community events<br>Indicio hosts community events, such as monthly Node Operator sync-ups and spotlights, giving our Node Operators a platform to showcase, demonstrate, and discuss their solutions. We help keep our node operators up-to-speed by discussing new open source tools, improvements, network updates, and standards progress, as well as help them identify business opportunities. </p>
<p>Make identity simpler<br>The decentralized identity world can be daunting for newcomers and veterans alike. There are myriads of working groups, governance bodies, standards organizations, and cross-industry initiatives. While these all play a vital role in the development and adoption of the technology, they can often lead to “information overload” and distract your team from developing a refined, commercial-ready product. We’re here to help our Node Operators make sense of the tools and information available to them in the community, saving them valuable time, money, and resources. We don’t just talk the talk. We understand business demands and work closely with Node Operators to get to market fast. </p>
<p>Concerned running a node might be too challenging? </p>
<p>Our “Node Operator as Service” option can take care of your network needs, leaving you free to focus on building your identity solution and participate in the Node Operator community. Indicio can host your node on a service of your choice, maintaining it with business-critical updates.</p>

<p>Fission is working with Jeremy Ruston, creator of TiddlyWiki, to build a TiddlyWiki on Fission app and make the Webnative SDK available as a plugin to save and load TW content across browsers.</p><p>We’ve been working out in the open in the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">TiddlyWiki group on the Fission forum</a> for a couple of weeks, so now it’s time to welcome more people to join us.</p><p>The goal is to make it so that TiddlyWiki can easily run as an app on the Fission publishing platform. Individual users will be able to sign up and launch a new TiddlyWiki or upload their own. Then, they will have everything saved and portable automatically from any browser, including mobile, that's logged into their Fission account.</p><p></p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/introducing-flag-cat-tiddlywiki-on-fission-mascot/1578">TiddlyWiki on Fission Flag Cat</a>. Stay tuned for more images and stickers!<p>Fission’s webnative javascript libraries and app publishing platform are open source and built on open standards. We’re designing the system to be portable and easy-to-personalize for anyone--not just professional developers--so that they can launch a business around apps, themes, or other creative software experiments.</p><p>We want to work with TiddlyWiki creators who are making custom <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Editions.html">Editions</a>. The TiddlyWiki launcher that we’re working on with Jeremy can include any community Editions that people want to include, and we’ll be opening up the Github repo shortly for that.</p><p>And if you’re a creator that wants to build a business around a TiddlyWiki Edition on Fission, with your own supported app that 100s or 1000s of users can launch with a click and have their own custom domain, we’d love to talk. Our upcoming App Cloning feature is designed for this, and we’ll showcase this ability in the community-supported TiddlyWiki on Fission app so that you can see how it works.</p><p>We’re totally inspired by the TiddlyWiki community, and want to see what else we can build together. We're on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywiki">TiddlyWiki Google Group</a>, and please come by and chat with us in the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">forum</a> or <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Fission's Discord chat</a> if you have questions. If you're a developer, you can follow <a href="https://guide.fission.codes">Fission's guide</a> to set up your developer account and get started.</p><p>Please join us at tomorrow’s <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/fission-demo-day-february-2021/1442">Fission February 2021 Demo Day</a> if you’d like to find out more and talk live with Jeremy and the Fission team.</p><a href="https://lu.ma/event/evt-nHhXeNbXYwW4DW1">

Clubhouse is the end of a chapter, not the beginning of a new&nbsp;one. Photo: William&nbsp;Krause<p>Clubhouse is the belle of the ball right now. This is a pandemic story. This is a content creation story. And sure, COVID was a clear catalyst, but it was probably only a matter of time audio joined text and video in reaching this logical destination.</p><p>Facebook, Twitter, Mark Cuban, and I’m sure countless others have already gotten the&nbsp;memo.</p><p>As Ben Thompson notes, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouses-inevitability/">Clubhouse was “inevitable</a>”:</p><blockquote>Clubhouse, meanwhile, Silicon Valley’s hottest consumer startup, feels like the opposite case: in retrospect its emergence feels like it was inevitable — if anything, the question is what took so long for audio to follow the same path as text, images, and&nbsp;video.</blockquote><p>Also:</p><blockquote>The most obvious difference between Clubhouse and podcasts is how much dramatically easier it is to both create a conversation and to listen to one. This step change is very much inline with the shift from blogging to Twitter, from website publishing to Instagram, or from YouTube to&nbsp;TikTok.</blockquote><blockquote>Secondly, like those successful networks, Clubhouse centralizes creation and consumption into a tight feedback loop. In fact, conversation consumers can, by raising their hand and being recognized by the moderator, become creators in a matter of&nbsp;seconds.</blockquote><p>In other words, it’s not that Clubhouse ushers in a new chapter of anything — well, aside from the democratization, which itself is arguably a game changer. Rather, it represents the natural conclusion of the last cycle, in part due to audio’s stunted evolution during the period, now supercharged in a locked down&nbsp;world.</p><p>One telling&nbsp;fact:</p><p>This is a well-worn story, but one story it isn’t? It’s not yet a monetization story. It’s unclear how you seamlessly insert algorithmic ads into real-life conversations.</p><p>According to Ben, tipping is a potential path forward that’s been discussed, a path Twitter is looking to also&nbsp;take.</p><p>And so the rapid ascent Clubhouse has enjoyed is easy to understand, but it will run into similar challenges — perhaps greater — than all the other analogs from this past&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>All of which speaks to the need of Trusted Engagement.</p><p>That’s the story here, and like the pitter patter on Clubhouse, that story is being told in real-time.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a> — <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-ceo-floats-user-tipping-213724463.html">Twitter CEO Floats User Tipping, Exclusive Content&nbsp;Features</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a>— <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations">Mark Cuban is co-founding a podcast app where hosts can talk to fans live and monetize their conversations</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-wins-deal-for-creator-economy-startup-stir-at-100-million-valuation">Andreessen Horowitz Wins Deal for Creator Economy Startup Stir at $100 Million Valuation</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/attention-economy-after-trump-bfa0ef27-b10d-432a-a40a-6bb642424709.html">After Trump, the attention economy&nbsp;deflates</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-wechats-struggle-to-slow-down-tiktok-owner-bytedance">Inside WeChat’s Struggle to Slow Down TikTok Owner ByteDance</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouses-inevitability/">Clubhouse’s Inevitability</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a> — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/fan-subs">Fan Subscriptions | Facebook for&nbsp;Creators</a>  Via kiwipete — <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/brave-browser-the-passive-income-king-a5d78da848c3">Brave Browser, The Passive Income&nbsp;King?</a>   2. A reminder of Clubhouse’s old chapter challenges: <p><a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/clubhouse-china">Stanford</a>:</p><blockquote>The Stanford Internet Observatory has confirmed that Agora, a Shanghai-based provider of real-time engagement software, supplies back-end infrastructure to the Clubhouse App. This relationship had previously been widely suspected but not publicly confirmed. Further, SIO has determined that a user’s unique Clubhouse ID number and chatroom ID are transmitted in plaintext, and Agora would likely have access to users’ raw audio, potentially providing access to the Chinese government. In at least one instance, SIO observed room metadata being relayed to servers we believe to be hosted in the PRC, and audio to servers managed by Chinese entities and distributed around the world via Anycast. It is also likely possible to connect Clubhouse IDs with user profiles.</blockquote> 3.

It would also block Apple from making developers use its payment system for in-app purchases and subscriptions.</blockquote><blockquote>In Virginia, a digital privacy bill that’s supported by some tech trade groups and companies like IBM is set to pass and be signed into law. It would make Virginia the second state to pass a major data privacy bill, after California’s 2018&nbsp;law.</blockquote> 5.

					 <p>We <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/">launched</a> our newest API—the Provider API—last year as the first product built specifically for <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) providers. Providers are the organizations that bring together issuers, holders, and verifiers into a single ecosystem, generally under a single use case or family of use cases. They establish the rules around who is able to participate in their ecosystem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In verifiable credential exchange, as shown in the graphic below, instead of verifiers having to establish a relationship with every single issuer in an ecosystem in order to perform verifications, the verifiers establish a single relationship with the provider.

					 <p>A familiar example of a provider is Mastercard, and within the Mastercard ecosystem, banks are the credential issuers (in this case the credential is a Mastercard credit card), consumers are the holders, and merchants are the credential verifiers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Provider API makes it possible for providers to create credential issuers and verifiers programmatically instead of one at a time. With the Provider API, any organization can literally become a SSI provider for their ecosystem. When the Provider API was first released, one of our users created 13,000 verifiers in a singles script! Unlike the Credentials API and the Wallet API below, the Provider API is a paid feature on our platform.</p>

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Ben Cronin, Managing Director at UBO Service. 
<p>In episode 39 of LTADI, Oscar talks to Ben about UBO Service and the challenges it solves around verifying Ultimate Beneficiary Owners, how UBO Service is leveraging Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) for KYC and enhanced CDD, and the Global LEI Foundation’s validation agent (VA) framework.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was very obvious to us that adding the LEI to that identification piece was very powerful because you’re really identifying and verifying the entity to a very high standard. By using data that we get from official government registries – adding that to an LEI just makes complete perfect sense to us.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Serial entrepreneur Ben Cronin founded GBR (Global Business Register) in 2008. GBR morphed into <a href="https://www.kyckr.com/">Kyckr</a> over the following years and Kyckr listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange in 2016, providing commercially proven products for the authentication of businesses globally.

  <p>Today, we are going to build a simple web application that implements a to-do list. The backend will be written in Go. It will use the Go Gin Web Framework which implements a high-performance HTTP server. The front end will use the Vue.js JavaScript framework to implement a single page application (SPA). We will secure it using Okta OAuth 2.0 authentication. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>PS: The code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-go-gin-vue-example">GitHub</a> if you’d like to check it out.</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Go, Gin, and Vue Application 

<p>First things first, if you don’t already have Go installed on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, create a project directory where all of our future code will live:</p>

   <code>mkdir ~/okta-go-gin-vue-example
cd ~/okta-go-gin-vue-example
</code>   

<p>A Go workspace is required. This is a directory in which all Go libraries live. It is usually <code>~/go</code>, but can be any directory as long as the environment variable <code>GOPATH</code> points to it.</p>

<p>Next, install the Gin package into the Go workspace using this command:</p>

   <code>go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
</code>   

<p>If you haven’t already got Node.js and npm installed, you’ll need them to use Vue.js. To install Node.js and npm, go to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Downloading and installing Node.js and npm</a> and install them.</p>

<p>Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can now install Vue.js with this command:</p>

   <code>npm install --global @vue/cli
</code>   

 How to Build a Simple Go/Gin Application 

<p>We will start by creating a simple Gin application. Create a file called <code>simple.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, "Welcome to Go and Gin!")
    })
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s explain what this code does. The <code>import</code> statement loads the Gin package from the Go workspace. The <code>main()</code> function is the program entry point. First, a default Gin server is created with the <code>r := gin.Default()</code> statement. The <code>r.GET()</code> function is used to register code with Gin that will be called when a matching HTTP GET request is called. It takes two parameters: the URI to match (<code>/</code>), and a callback function that takes a Gin context struct as a parameter. The <code>String</code> function is called on the context (<code>c</code>), passing it the response status and the response body. Finally, the <code>Run</code> function is called to start the server listening on port 8080 by default.</p>

<p>Next, run the server.</p>

   <code>go run simple.go
</code>   

<p>You will get some warnings when you run the command above, which you can ignore for now.</p>

<p>Now, we can test the server using <code>curl</code>.</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>You should see the <code>Welcome to Go and Gin!</code> welcome message.</p>

 How to Build a RESTful Application 

<p>First of all, we will build the RESTful backend server. We will later add a Vue.js frontend and add Okta authentication.</p>

<p>We are going to make a Go module called <code>golang-gin-vue</code> which is the same name as the working directory. This will create a file called <code>go.mod</code> which defines the module and the version of Go.</p>

   <code>go mod init okta-go-gin-vue-example
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>main.go</code> containing the following Go code.</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

var todos []string

func Lists(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"list": todos})
}

func main() {
    todos = append(todos, "Write the application")
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/api/lists", Lists)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>This contains some enhancements from the previous program.</p>

<p>A slice called <code>todos</code> has been created to contain the todo items.</p>

<p>The function <code>Lists</code> processes GET requests and returns a JSON object containing the items.</p>

<p>The <code>net/http</code> package has been imported so that we can use the more readable <code>http.StatusOK</code> as a status code rather than the opaque number <code>200</code>.</p>

<p>The function <code>c.JSON()</code> serializes the structure into a JSON string in the response body. It also sets the <code>Content-Type</code> header to <code>application/json</code>.</p>

<p>The function <code>gin.H</code> is used to create JSON objects.</p>

<p>The <code>GET</code> function now calls the <code>Lists</code> function when the request URI is <code>/api/lists</code>.</p>

<p>Now we can run the server. The first time it is run Go will have to resolve the Gin library and add it to <code>go.mod</code>.</p>

   <code>go run main.go
</code>   

<p>We can test that it’s working using this curl command in another terminal window</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080/api/lists
</code>   

<p>You should get a response that looks like this:</p>

   <code>{"list":["Write the application"]}
</code>   

 What Is a Path Parameter and How Do I Implement It in Gin? 

<p>A path parameter is a URI with a variable part. Any part of a URI can be a path parameter. In our example, we can get individual entries using URIs such as <code>/api/lists/0</code>, <code>/api/lists/1</code> etc.</p>

<p>The implementation is quite simple. The variable part of the URI is prefixed with a colon when the URI to function mapping is defined.</p>

   <code>r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)
</code>   

<p>The implementation of this is shown in the <code>ListItem()</code> function below:</p>

   <code>func ListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    errormessage := "Index out of range"
    indexstring := c.Param("index")
    if index, err := strconv.Atoi(indexstring); err == nil &amp;&amp; index &lt; len(todos) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"item": todos[index]})
    } else {
        if err != nil {
            errormessage = "Number expected: " + indexstring
        }
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": errormessage})
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The name specified in the URI after the colon can be extracted using the <code>Params</code> function in the Gin context.</p>

<p>Update your code in <code>main.go</code> to add <code>strconv</code> to the imports, include the <code>ListItem</code> function, and add the <code>r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)</code> statement to the <code>main()</code> function so that <code>main.go</code> looks like this:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
    "strconv"
)

var todos []string

func Lists(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"list": todos})
}

func ListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    errormessage := "Index out of range"
    indexstring := c.Param("index")
    if index, err := strconv.Atoi(indexstring); err == nil &amp;&amp; index &lt; len(todos) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"item": todos[index]})
    } else {
        if err != nil {
            errormessage = "Number expected: " + indexstring
        }
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": errormessage})
    }
}

func main() {
    todos = append(todos, "Write the application")
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/api/lists", Lists)
    r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>The server can be tested running the <code>go run main.go</code> command and then using <code>curl</code>. Verify that the error handling works using invalid URIs.</p>

   <code>curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists/0
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists/1
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists/foo
</code>   

<p>Notice that the last two commands will display different error messages.</p>

 How Do I Handle a POST Request Using Gin? 

<p>A POST request simply requires using <code>POST</code> in place of <code>GET</code>.</p>

<p>Add the following statement to the <code>main()</code> function in <code>main.go</code></p>

   <code>r.POST("/api/lists", AddListItem)
</code>   

<p>The POST handler uses a <code>PostForm</code> method to extract the parameters, add the code below to <code>main.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func AddListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    item := c.PostForm("item")
    todos = append(todos, item)
    c.String(http.StatusCreated, c.FullPath()+"/"+strconv.Itoa(len(todos)-1))
}
</code>   

<p><code>main.go</code> should look like this now:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
    "strconv"
)

var todos []string

func Lists(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"list": todos})
}

func ListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    errormessage := "Index out of range"
    indexstring := c.Param("index")
    if index, err := strconv.Atoi(indexstring); err == nil &amp;&amp; index &lt; len(todos) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"item": todos[index]})
    } else {
        if err != nil {
            errormessage = "Number expected: " + indexstring
        }
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": errormessage})
    }
}

func AddListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    item := c.PostForm("item")
    todos = append(todos, item)
    c.String(http.StatusCreated, c.FullPath()+"/"+strconv.Itoa(len(todos)-1))
}

func main() {
    todos = append(todos, "Write the application")
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/api/lists", Lists)
    r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)
    r.POST("/api/lists", AddListItem)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>It is important to note that a REST POST request creates a resource on the server and assigns it a URI. The proper response to a POST is a status of 201 Created and the response body should contain the URI of the new resource.</p>

<p>The server can be tested using <code>curl</code>. Restart the server using <code>go run main.go</code> and then use the <code>curl</code> commands below to test it out:</p>

   <code>curl -i -X POST -d "item=Build Vue frontend" http://localhost:8080/api/lists
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists
</code>   

 How to Build a Simple Vue Application 

<p>A number of files need to be created to build a Vue application. The Vue client (Vue CLI) can create the necessary files for us. Let’s use the Vue CLI to create an application called <code>todo-vue</code>.</p>

   <code>vue create todo-vue
</code>   

<p>The creation process will ask a number of questions. Use the arrow keys to select the option required then hit the enter key.</p>

 
   It may ask if you want to use a faster registry: answer Y. 
   Please pick a preset: use the arrow keys to select Manually select features. 
   Check the features needed for your project: Babel, which is a JavaScript compiler, and Linter / Formatter should be selected. 
   Choose a version of Vue.js that you want to start the project with (Use arrow keys): select 2.x. 
   Pick a linter / formatter config: select ESLint with error prevention only. This will check for and catch common errors but will not enforce strict rules. 
   Pick additional lint features: select Lint on save. This will check for errors when files are saved in the project. 
   Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? Select In dedicated config files. Several small files are better than one big file. 
   Save this as a preset for future projects? select type N. 
   Pick the package manager to use when installing dependencies: select Use NPM 
 

<p>The Vue CLI will then create the project. This includes downloading components which can take some time.</p>

<p>Let’s see what got created in the new directory <code>todo-vue</code>. We will explain the content of the files in more detail as we build the application:</p>

<p>The directory <code>node_modules</code> contains the Node.js modules which are needed by Vue.</p>

<p>The file <code>README.md</code> contains instructions on building and running the Vue application.</p>

<p>The file <code>package.json</code> describes the Vue package and its dependencies.</p>

<p>The template for the application is <code>public/index.html</code> it contains <code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> which gets replaced by the Vue content.</p>

<p>The <code>src</code> directory contains the core Vue application. The entry point for the application is in <code>src/main.js</code> which replaces the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in the HTML page with the content.  The file <code>src/App.vue</code> contains the top-level Vue component. There is one component <code>src/components/HelloWorld.vue</code> which can be deleted as it is not required.</p>

<p>We will now simplify the file <code>src/App.vue</code>to have the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  name: 'App',
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>Let’s talk about what this does. The template element contains the HTML which will replace the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in the HTML file. The script element exports the application and gives it a name. The style element is self-explanatory and can be modified any way you want to.
We can now run a built-in development server to test the application.</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run serve
</code>   

<p>This will build the application and start listening on port 8080 by default. You can access the page by pointing a web browser at http://localhost:8080. If you are curious, the port number can be changed by setting the environment variable <code>PORT</code> to another value.</p>

 How to Add the To-Do List to the Application 

<p>First, we are going to add a placeholder for the actual to-do list. We need to modify <code>App.vue</code>. The style element will be omitted in the example as it doesn’t change.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
const appData = {
  todolist: "More to do"
}
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return appData;
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>So, what has changed? The template has been modified to add the list. The `` gets replaced with the contents of a variable called <code>todolist</code>.</p>

<p>There have been two changes to the script element. An object called <code>appData</code> has been added which defines the variable <code>todolist</code> used in the template and gives it a default value. The default application now has a function called <code>data()</code> which returns the <code>appData</code> object.</p>

<p>Now, run the application and point a web browser at it. You should see the text “more to do” on the page.</p>

 How to Combine the Web Servers 

<p>When a Vue application is ready to use it can be converted into a static website. Run the command below to do that:</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
</code>   

<p>This creates a directory called <code>dist</code> containing the static content.</p>

<p>Then, we change the Go server to deliver the static content. We will serve the <code>todo-vue/dist</code> directory as the root URI <code>/</code>. Modify <code>main.go</code> and add <code>"github.com/gin-contrib/static"</code> to the imports and add the following line to the <code>main()</code> function, after the <code>r := gin.Default()</code> line:</p>

   <code>r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./todo-vue/dist", false)))
</code>   

<p>Run the Go server with <code>go run main.go</code> and point a browser at http://localhost:8080 to see the Vue generated web page.</p>

 How to Make the Vue App Call the Server 

<p>The Axios JavaScript package is required to call the server. Make sure it is installed locally.</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm install --save axios
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to modify <code>src/App.vue</code> to make the Ajax call and render it.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li v-for="item in todolist" v-bind:key="item"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import axios from "axios";
const appData = {
  todolist: ["More to do"]
}
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return appData;
  },
  mounted: function() {
    this.getList();
  },
  methods: {
    getList: getList
  }
}
function getList() {
  axios.get("/api/lists").then( res =&gt; {
    appData.todolist = res.data.list
  });
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the changes. At the start of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, the Axios package is imported. At the end of the script the function <code>getList()</code> is defined. It makes an Axios <code>get()</code> call to the API. The response is a JSON object which gets transformed into a JavaScript object. The JSON object contains an object called <code>list</code> which is an array of item strings. The response is in <code>res.data</code> and <code>res.data.list</code> extracts the array of item strings that are assigned to the <code>todolist</code> variable.</p>

<p>In the <code>export</code> the <code>methods</code> object exports the <code>getList()</code> function as a JavaScript function with the same name which is visible to the application. The <code>mounted</code> entry defines a function that is called when the page has loaded. It calls <code>getList()</code> to get the list of items.</p>

<p>In the template, there is now an unordered list. The <code>v-for</code> attribute iterates over the array of strings contained in <code>todolist</code> creating a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element for each entry. The <code>v-bind:key</code> attribute makes the <code>item</code> variable from the <code>v-for</code> attribute a template variable.</p>

<p>Rebuild the Vue project, then start the server using these commands:</p>
   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
cd ..
go run main.go
</code>   

<p>Then, load the web page. A single item from the API should be displayed.</p>

 How to Make a POST Request from Form Data 

<p>We are going to add a form that enables a new item to be added to the list.</p>

<p>First, add a form inside the  <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag, just above the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> line in <code>App.vue</code>.</p>

   <code>    &lt;form method="POST" @submit.prevent="sendItem()"&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" size="50" v-model="todoitem" placeholder="Enter new item"/&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>The form contains a text input box and a submit button. The <code>v-model</code> attribute associates the text input with a variable called <code>todoitem</code>. The function <code>sendItem()</code> is called when the submit button is clicked. The <code>@submit.prevent</code> attribute prevents the page from being reloaded when the form is submitted.</p>

<p>Next, create the <code>sendItem()</code> function at the bottom of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the <code>App.vue</code> file:</p>

   <code>async function sendItem() {
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  params.append('item', this.todoitem);
  await axios.post("/api/lists", params);
  getList()
}
</code>   

<p>The function is made asynchronous so that it is non-blocking. The POST parameters are set using a <code>URLSearchParams</code> object. There is a single parameter called <code>item</code> and its value is the value of the text input passed into the variable <code>this.todoitem</code> which was defined by the <code>v-model</code> attribute on the text input. The POST request is made by calling <code>axios.post()</code>. The <code>await</code> makes the function wait until the POST response arrives. Finally, the <code>getList()</code> function is called to get the updated list.```</p>

<p>You will also need to add the <code>sendItem</code> function to the list of methods that are exposed to Vue. Update the <code>methods</code> section of the <code>export default</code> part of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag so that it looks like this:</p>

   <code>  methods: {
    getList: getList,
    sendItem: sendItem,
  }
</code>   

<p>Here is how your <code>Vue.app</code> file should look:</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form method="POST" @submit.prevent="sendItem()"&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" size="50" v-model="todoitem" placeholder="Enter new item"/&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li v-for="item in todolist" v-bind:key="item"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import axios from "axios";
const appData = {
  todolist: []
}
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return appData;
  },
  mounted: function() {
    this.getList();
  },
  methods: {
    getList: getList,
    sendItem: sendItem,
  }
}
function getList() {
  axios.get("/api/lists").then( res =&gt; {
    appData.todolist = res.data.list
  });
}

async function sendItem() {
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  params.append('item', this.todoitem);
  await axios.post("/api/lists", params);
  getList()
}

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>To test the changes: Build the Vue application and start the server using these commands:</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
cd ..
go run main.go
</code>   

<p>Then load the web page. Enter a new item and submit the form. The updated list should be displayed.</p>

 How to Add Okta Authentication to the Application 

<p>To add authentication to the Vue application, we first need to install two packages.</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm install @okta/okta-auth-js
npm install @okta/okta-signin-widget
</code>   

<p>To use Okta authentication you need to have a free [Okta Developer account] (https://developer.okta.com). Once you’ve done this, sign in to the developer console and select Applications &gt; Add Application. Then select Single-Page App and hit Next. The next page is filled in with default values, most of which are sufficient for this application and don’t need to be changed. Add the URL <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to the allowed Login Redirect URLs. Hit Done.</p>

<p>There are two pieces of information that you need to obtain from the Okta Developer Console. These are your Okta domain name and your client id. These values need to be passed into the Vue application. As these values are effectively secrets, they must not be hardcoded in the application. The way around this is to create environment variables in a file called <code>.env</code> in the <code>todo-vue</code> directory containing these values. Also add <code>.env</code> to the <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>

   <code>VUE_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID=my-client-id
VUE_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN=my-okta-domain.okta.com
</code>   

<p>PS: The environment variable names must start with <code>VUE_APP_</code> otherwise they will not be visible in the application.</p>

 How to Add Okta Authentication to the Vue Client 

<p>We are going to use the Okta authentication widget to log the user in. A successful login will create an access token that can be used to verify that the user is logged in.</p>

<p>First of all we will add a container for the login form to the template in <code>src/App.vue</code>, add the code below just above the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag:</p>

   <code>&lt;div id="widget-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to add the login code to the script section of <code>src/App.vue</code>, starting with importing the <code>OktaSignIn</code> object inside the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</p>

   <code>import OktaSignIn from "@okta/okta-signin-widget";
import "@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-sign-in.min.css";
</code>   

<p>Next, just below the import lines, modify the <code>appData</code> constant so that it can hold a token:</p>

   <code>const appData = {
    todolist: ["More to do"],
    token: ''
}
</code>   

<p>Next, update the contents of the <code>mounted: function()</code> with the code below. This code creates the widget and extracts the token.</p>

   <code>    mounted: function () {
        var signIn = new OktaSignIn({
            el: "#widget-container",
            baseUrl: "https://" + process.env.VUE_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN,
            clientId: process.env.VUE_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
            redirectUri: window.location.origin,
            authParams: {
                issuer:
                    "https://" + process.env.VUE_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN + "/oauth2/default",
                responseType: ["token", "id_token"],
                display: "page",
            },
        });
        signIn.showSignInToGetTokens({
            scopes: ['openid', 'profile']
        }).then(function(tokens){
            appData.token = tokens.accessToken.accessToken;
            axios.defaults.headers.common["Authorization"] =
                "Bearer " + appData.token;
            signIn.hide();
        });
        getList();
    },
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the code to understand what is happening. First of all, we construct an <code>OktaSignIn</code> object. It takes a dictionary as a parameter. The <code>el</code> defines the ID of the template element in which the login form will be displayed. The <code>baseUrl</code> and <code>clientId</code> are extracted from the secrets in the <code>.env</code> file. The <code>redirectUri</code> is set to the current page. This will cause the current page to be reloaded on a successful login with the required access token passed in the URL.</p>

<p>The <code>renderEl</code> method causes the login widget to be displayed.</p>

<p>The <code>.then()</code> function is called  on  a successful login. The access token is extracted and then set as an Authorization header in the Axios default headers. This means that the header will be sent on subsequent Axios requests. The sign-in widget is hidden once the token has been obtained.</p>

<p>We are going to validate the token on the server and return an error response if it fails. We need to modify the <code>sendItem()</code> function in <code>App.vue</code> to handle the error.</p>

   <code>async function sendItem() {
    const params = new URLSearchParams();
    params.append('item', this.todoitem);
    await axios.post("/api/lists", params)
    .then(function() {
        getList();
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        appData.todolist = [ error.message ];
    })
}
</code>   

<p>Build the Vue application, start the server and load the web page:</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
cd ..
go run main.go
</code>   

<p>The login form should be displayed. Log in using your Okta Developer Console credentials.</p>

 How to Validate an Access Token in Go 

<p>The access token which the client obtained is what is known as a JSON Web Token (JWT). To verify the token we will use an Okta JWT verifier. The Go package needs to be installed.</p>

   <code>go get -u github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang
</code>   

<p>First, add an import to <code>main.go</code> to load the Okta JWT verifier package.</p>

   <code>jwtverifier "github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang"
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>verify()</code> function to <code>main.go</code>.</p>

   <code>var toValidate = map[string]string{
        "aud": "api://default",
        "cid": os.Getenv("OKTA_CLIENT_ID"),
}

func verify(c *gin.Context) bool {
    status := true
    token := c.Request.Header.Get("Authorization")
    if strings.HasPrefix(token, "Bearer ") {
        token = strings.TrimPrefix(token, "Bearer ")
        verifierSetup := jwtverifier.JwtVerifier{
            Issuer:           "https://" + os.Getenv("OKTA_DOMAIN") + "/oauth2/default",
            ClaimsToValidate: toValidate,
        }
        verifier := verifierSetup.New()
        _, err := verifier.VerifyAccessToken(token)
        if err != nil {
            c.String(http.StatusForbidden, err.Error())
            print(err.Error())
            status = false
        }
    } else {
        c.String(http.StatusUnauthorized, "Unauthorized")
        status = false
    }
    return status
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>toValidate</code> map defines the values of the audience and client ID claims for the verifier. The <code>verify()</code> function looks for an Authorization header containing a bearer token. If the token is found then the verifier is called to verify the token. If the token is verified successfully the function returns true. If the token is not found then a 401 Unauthorized response is sent and the function returns false. If the token is found but does not verify, then a 403 Forbidden response is sent and the function returns false.</p>

<p>Finally modify the <code>AddListItem</code> function to call <code>verify()</code>.</p>

   <code>func AddListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    if verify(c) {
        item := c.PostForm("item")
        todos = append(todos, item)
        c.String(http.StatusCreated, c.FullPath()+"/"+strconv.Itoa(len(todos)-1))
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Build the Vue application—start the server and load the web page. Add a To-Do item and submit the form. You should get an error response. Login and resubmit the To-Do item to verify that token verification works.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The Gin package for Golang makes it very easy to create a web server. It is particularly easy to build a RESTful web server as there is a function for each of the request methods. A user-defined function is called whenever a request is received. Gin can also serve static content from a specified directory.</p>

<p>The Vue.js JavaScript framework makes it easy to build web front ends that generate dynamic content. The Vue client can create the basic directory structure and the files required for a Vue application. The files are validated for correct syntax which helps avoid hard to diagnose JavaScript errors. Vue provides a server that can be used to test development code. Building the code in production mode creates static content that can be delivered by any web server.</p>

<p>The Okta authentication widget makes the verification process very easy to implement. The OAuth 2.0 authentication process is quite complex. The widget hides the complexity securely. Once the access token has been obtained it can be sent to the API server in a header. The JWT verification process is very simple using the Okta Go JWT verifier.</p>

The proposed European <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-european-data-governance-data-governance-act">Data Governance Act</a> is another progressive indication that the EU is seeking to develop a more equitable digital economy. However, where we go from here depends on how the European Union is able to use the Data Governance Act to strike a balance between the existing tech giants and data platforms alongside an entirely new range of services designed to enable the collection, protection and exchange of data.




 




Currently, a handful of global players enjoy a virtual monopoly on the exploitation of data. Unlocking these data silos and regulating for data mobility and interoperability will provide the vital infrastructure required for meeting the challenges of the next century, including timely and informed decision making.




 




At <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> we believe that enabling citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data will ultimately lead to greater trust and personalisation, resulting in a more prosperous society. However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation such as the Data Governance Act and the digital tools to transform our connected society.




 




We believe this will lead to significant benefits to including personalised health and education, increased financial literacy and better financial decisions, more informed consumer choices which also contribute to protecting our environment.




 




Meeco is endorsing the Data Governance Act as a founding member of <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org">Data Sovereignty Now</a>; a coalition of leading Europe-based technology companies, research institutions and not-for-profit organisations. We are working together to ensure that the control of data remains in the hands of the people and organisations that generate it in order to play a key role in not only securing the rights of individuals over their data, but also providing significant stimulus for the digital economy.




 




Meeco is also a member of <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> and was amongst the first 16 organisations to be awarded the <a href="https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/">MyData </a><a href="https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/">Operator</a> designation in 2020. We join in the goal towards developing interconnected and human-centric data intermediaries to meet the personalisation and equity challenges of open digital society.




 




We welcome the regulation as a needed common ground for clarifying the role of data intermediaries, building trust in these intermediaries and setting the direction for data governance, including the emergence of digital human rights.




 




In this context we offer the following suggestions:




 




1. Explicitly include individuals as active participants in the definitions: define the key roles in data sharing (Art. 2 Definitions) so that data rights holders (data subject) and technical data holders (controller or processor) can be separated and acknowledge the type of data sharing where individuals are active participants in the transactions.




 




2. Clarify the scope of the data sharing services (Art. 9 (2)) and extend it to include services that empower the data subject beyond compliance.




 




3. Foster the growth of intermediaries, which offer new technologies and have the greatest likelihood of success in Europe if supported by the Data Governance Act.




 




4. Open silos and implement soft infrastructure such as standards &amp; open APIs to accelerate uptake and interoperability between data sharing services.




 




5. Foster eco-systems and demonstrate the value through practical use-cases. The EU data sharing ecosystem is formative; therefore, it is imperative to demonstrate utility and benchmark best practices that contribute to a more sustainable, healthy, resilient and safe digital society.




 




6. Create a level playing field for sustainable data sharing by providing funding to pioneers at the forefront of developing data eco-systems, this includes start-ups, scale-ups alongside established enterprises.




 




Included is a Meeco <a href="https://www.meeco.me/data">white paper</a> detailing practical use-cases aligned to our response, including the barriers the Data Governance Act can address to make data work for all.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>At first glance, account recovery might seem like a simple topic: just write a reset password function, send a challenge code, and you're done!</p><p>But, Fission’s commitment to prioritizing user control makes things a little more complicated. When the user is in control, how do we help them get back into their data if they get locked out? The main relevant factors are:</p>  We’ve designed our account system around portable account identifiers, called Decentralized IDs (DIDs)  Your account holds encryption keys that keep your private content encrypted and private only to you — even the Fission platform doesn’t have access and can’t see your content.  We wanted an account recovery system that was as trust-minimized as possible. Meaning, you don’t have to trust us, and you would require as few third-party systems as possible to help you out if you lose account access.  <blockquote>Oh, and one more thing: we wanted to do all of this without passwords.</blockquote><p>At Fission, being password-free is the default. Instead, we use technology built into modern browsers — including mobile browsers — that generates and keeps a private encryption key safely stored. This is called the Web Crypto API.</p><p>By the way, if you haven’t tried this yet, head over to the default <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission Drive app</a> and create a new Fission account. Notice that it asks you for a unique username and an email address, but it doesn’t ask you for a password.</p><p>To use your account on other devices — like your desktop browser, tablet, or phone — you get access by creating a key on your new device and linking it to another device that already has permission.</p><p>Now, the private keys built into the browsers on all your devices have permission to access your account and all of your encrypted, personal data — all without setting up or having to remember a password.</p><p>Apple is known for providing users with end-to-end encryption that keeps everyone, including Apple, out of any personal information. Fission is taking the same approach.</p> What about lost devices? <p>But what happens if you lose all your devices? Can you still get access to the encrypted content stored and synced online by your Fission account? Right now, the answer is no! We don’t have a copy of your key — and the Web Crypto API built into browsers is designed in such a way that we can’t get a copy for security reasons. If you lose access to all your devices, how can you recover your encrypted content? This is where Account Recovery comes in.</p><p>One of the design goals we have with Fission is to support a broad number of default use cases — we think this stuff should just work for everyone. We do rely on the most cutting edge browser standards, but we choose these standards based on the real world support available in all major browsers, including mobile browsers.</p> Using a single-device as a base case <p>Let’s consider the base case scenario of a person having just one mobile computing device — owning and using a single phone — meaning that losing that one mobile device means you’ve lost everything.</p><p>This is the common base case we need to keep in mind.</p><p>It’s crucial to remember that the typical software developer or early adopter is much easier to support: at least one mobile device and one desktop/laptop device. The private key stored on a desktop is much more likely to stick around for a really long time.</p><p>In fact, in some of our user research interviews, developers told us that the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">private key they used to securely connect to GitHub</a> was often on their machine for 5 years. Basically, the entire lifetime of owning the machine before they got a new computer and set up a new key!</p><p>But since that isn’t the deal for our single mobile device base case, we have to plan for account recovery process with just a single device to make the system accessible and recoverable by the largest number of users.</p> Splitting up keys <p>Our basic principle involves making backup keys and splitting them into pieces. We then store some of those pieces on the Fission platform linked to the user account.</p><p>The other half is stored “offline” by the user, as recovery codes.</p><p>When the offline recovery codes are combined with the pieces on Fission, it creates the complete key that can access the person’s account.</p><p>Because of our commitment to privacy, Fission never has access to the whole key.</p><blockquote>If someone breaks into Fission's database, there are no passwords and no secret keys to leak.</blockquote> Where should I store recovery codes? <p>On Apple iOS devices, basic iCloud file storage is built into the operating system — just like Fission accounts have the Web Native File System included. We’ll recommend that users download the recovery codes and store them in their Safari iCloud downloads folder — or somewhere else on their iCloud files.</p><p>On Android, the defaults are a lot more varied. Many Android phones have Google services built in by default, so we’ll recommend this as a similar approach to using iCloud in our iOS example.</p><p>Advanced users can store this file anywhere they feel comfortable - be it in Apple Notes with a password, printed out on paper, stored in their 1Password account, or even sent as a “Note to Self” in their Signal messenger app.</p>Signal's <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043272451-Note-to-Self">Note to Self feature</a><p>And in the future, based on the feedback, we may allow advanced security-conscious users to forgo the use of recovery codes entirely, allowing them to self-manage backup keys.</p> Get involved <p>You can check out the in-progress diagrams and notes of our <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432">Account Recovery design process</a> in the forum.</p><p>We’re not done with our design. We are still working at the level of security, systems, and cryptographic principles, as well as streamlining the user experience and the flows for users.</p><p>The code is being developed out in the open in the <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/dashboard">Dashboard code repository</a>.

  IDunion (formerly SSI for Germany) has completed the competition phase of the innovation competition “Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten” and is applying to the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (BMWi) for the next phase of the innovation competition.  The use of decentralised, self-sovereign identities for natural persons, companies and things is to be tested in over 35 use cases from a wide range of sectors.  The project involves 26 well-known public and private partners.  More information can be found on our website idunion.org.  



<p>Frankfurt am Main, 24 November 2020 – IDunion (formerly “SSI for Germany”) creates an ecosystem for decentralised, self-sovereign identities for natural persons, companies, institutions and things. In a partnership of renowned public and private institutions, a distributed identity network will be established, which will be managed by a European cooperative. The partners develop software applications and components, which leverage the the IDunion network and enable the allocation, storage and exchange of verified identity information. The use of open source software and standardised data formats will create a vendor-neutral solution and transparency as well as promote interoperability between providers, networks and traditional identity solutions.</p>



<p>A distributed test network is currently operated by 12 partners and will be available as a production environment for numerous use cases also outside the consortium from 2021. A detailed legal governance structure for the network has been developed with the support of the law firm Jones Day. In addition, extensive reports were prepared on legal topics, including the GDPR and eIDAS regulations, as well as on security aspects and a freedom-to-operate analysis.</p>



<p>In addition, various software applications were developed for both citizens and companies and tested in extensive user acceptance tests. Currently, identity wallets from the Main Incubator GmbH (Lissi Wallet) and esatus AG (esatus Wallet) are already available for end users to download. All partners are currently evaluating or implementing applications or use-cases for the further integration of the IDunion network into their existing systems.</p>



<p>The use cases touch on a variety of areas and target a variety of stakeholders including citizens, (public) institutions, companies and things. The over 35 use cases are divided into seven clusters: education, e-commerce/mobility, e-government, e-health, finance, identity &amp; access management (IAM) and </p>



<p>industry/IoT. The consortium is open for further partners or use cases and is happy to provide all necessary software components for further pilots. You can find more information on our website at: <a href="http://www.idunion.org"> www.idunion.org</a>.

<p>The Cambria project is an exploration of how to manage changing data formats and schemas in a decentralized piece of software.

			 Security Tokens Get the Green Light in Luxembourg 
<p>Last week, Luxembourg’s regulator, the CSSF, adopted a bill that explicitly recognised the possibility of using distributed ledger technology for the dematerialisation of securities. See the market spotlight below for the panel I spoke on with the CSSF and some other friends.</p>
<p>The regulation is moving quickly across Europe: Tokenized securities now fall under the same rules and regulations as traditional financial instruments in many other European countries including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK.</p>
 What will this new bill in Luxembourg mean for tokenized securities? 
<p>The Bill is a continuation of the law passed in 1 March 2019. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after it was introduced we saw a surge in demand from financial institutions in the region. Curiosity was sparked in Luxembourg and in wider European markets. Most importantly, it gave market actors the confidence they needed to start utilising the technology operationally. In the coming months, we expect the same to happen across the industry due to this recent regulatory development.</p>
 How can market actors adopt the technology? 
<p>For market actors to adopt the technology and benefit from the automation and transferability improvements, they need to do so in a compliant manner. Control and regulation still need to be applied. Therefore, proven and open-source security token standards like the T-REX protocol are essential as they allow assets to be represented on the blockchain compliantly. They enable agents appointed by the issuer to exercise control over assets and ensure the securities can only be held by eligible investors.</p>
 What do we expect to happen in the year ahead? 
<p>We believe the regulation will give even more confidence to the financial services sector in Luxembourg and beyond. So far, Luxembourg has been one of the most proactive jurisdictions in Europe with its first law in 2019. However, this needed to be developed and last week’s law will bring more clarity and more confidence to asset owners. Real estate closed-end funds are currently the asset class that benefits the most from this new form of securities and we expect this to accelerate in 2021.</p>
<p>Due to the progression in regulation we are experiencing a spate of interest and projects from the fund industry. Our customers, WeInvest, Finimmo and Digibrixx have already begun building their projects, with more on the way.</p>

<p>Il World Science Report dell’Unesco ha definito la carriera professionale femminile un tubo forato in riferimento al fatto che, dopo la laurea, non tutte le donne proseguono il proprio percorso nel mondo del lavoro.</p>



<p>A livello mondiale la percentuale di donne impegnate in attività di ricerca non supera il 29%, mentre in Italia:</p>



<blockquote><p>La percentuale di donne ricercatrici varia molto in funzione della disciplina: in biologia, medicina, e in generale nelle scienze della vita i numeri sono molto incoraggianti. […] Gli ultimi dati sui livelli di istruzione registrano un numero maggiore di donne laureate (22,4%) rispetto agli uomini (16,8%). […] La percentuale di ricercatrici invece cala se si considerano solo le materie STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths), in modo particolare scienze matematiche, informatiche, fisiche, ingegneria ma anche scienze economiche e statistiche. In questi campi le donne hanno maggiori difficoltà nel continuare la via della ricerca scientifica dopo aver conseguito il dottorato o anche un assegno post doc.</p>Lucia Votano – dirigente di Ricerca emerita Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare</blockquote>



<p>Considerando questo contesto, InfoCert ha aderito con entusiasmo al progetto Sistema Scuola Impresa di ELIS: un progetto formativo rivolto agli studenti delle scuole italiane con un’attenzione specifica alle ragazze per il loro accesso alle professioni nei settori a prevalenza maschile.</p>



<p>Il progetto ha l’obiettivo di presentare a docenti e studenti dei modelli in cui potersi rispecchiare e in cui riconoscere talenti inespressi e percorsi possibili. Le Role Model individuate dal progetto, sono professioniste aziendali dimostratesi capaci di incidere nel contesto in cui operano con entusiasmo e determinazione.</p>



<p>3 dipendenti InfoCert laureate in materie scientifiche sono state selezionate per prendere parte al progetto in qualità di Role Model.</p>



<p>Alla fine di una serie di incontri di formazione, queste incontrarono gli studenti delle scuole italiane in una nuova edizione del programma, che nella precedente ha raggiunto oltre 18.600 studenti sul territorio italiano, il 97% dei quali consiglierebbe ad altri studenti di fare la stessa esperienza.</p>

It was great. Here is a round up from Jolocom. It is highly recommended.</p><blockquote><p>The paper <a href="https://inatba.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-INATBA-Decentralised-Identity-001.pdf">Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?</a>. Answering the paper’s core question of what’s at stake, it gives three essential scenarios:</p>  <p>Ideal – full convergence of SSI technology with interoperability by default.</p>  <p>Functional – partial convergence resulting in detached ecosystems.</p>  <p>Dysfunctional – no convergence and isolated, locked-in ecosystems.</p>  </blockquote><p></p> Blogs  <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/a-unified-theory-of-decentralization-151d6f39e38">A Unified Theory of Decentralization</a> <blockquote><p>The good news is that centralization isn’t the only source of convenience.

 Valuations in our sector are rocking — with no signs of slowing&nbsp;down. <p>Best-in-class, scalable technology solutions that exceed customer expectations are in high&nbsp;demand.</p> Precis <p>2020 saw a rush of adoption and evolution in eCommerce and online presence, not created by but fuelled in pace by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>By sector we are referring to technology, and fast-growing subsectors digital identity and verification needs and facilitations, the financial technology space, and all eCommerce interactions in this next internet era. Fintechs are consistently part of challenger banking now, or neobanking, upending the oligopolistic traditional financial services practice. This sector is bringing along fast-moving partners and symbiotic cutting-edge solutions that meet and drive customer expectations and behaviour. For clear reasons, the need for safe and trusted digital tools is quickly spreading to all arenas, including verified identity.</p> Safe Harbour <p>Tom Kennedy has been remunerated by KABN Systems NA in the past twenty-four months. He holds a long position in KABN (CSE:KABN) at the time of publication.</p><p>His research is intended for the sophisticated investor to assess market developments and company performance and make insights. His comments are in no way intended as a solicitation to trade in any securities. All comments are subject to Risks and Uncertainties outside of the control of the&nbsp;author.</p><p>Please see the Disclosure Statements at the end of document.</p> The US and Canadian tech sectors are in favour right now, sped up by the&nbsp;pandemic <p>In Canada and the US, and in fact across the globe, technology is a sector in significant favour and flux, and is attracting a lot of interest right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Dozens of new companies over the past few months have found private investor groups in multiple seed rounds, and many are hitting the public markets via IPOs and RTOs for more exposure and access to capital. The M&amp;A cycle is seeing a lot of activity too. Incumbent players are moving fast on new developments to bolster their product offerings and keep up with the customer and market demands. Financial investors are searching for the next unicorn, or more likely a puzzle piece positioned to be gobbled up at handsome valuations by leveraging vertical integrations or amalgamating user bases into their&nbsp;own.</p><p>Internet deals in the US led the way in Q4/20, with almost double the dealflow Healthcare saw in second place. While we do not expect this pace to continue its linear growth, we do expect that 1) Canada typically lags the US markets, and 2) the horse has already left the barn. While KABN’s timing appears to have been excellent, execution demand will only increase as these players are expected to demonstrate they are worth premium valuations.</p><p>Figure 1: Q4/20 was all about internet&nbsp;deals</p>Source: PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree™ Report Q4&nbsp;2020. The stock market is supportive of valuations <p>The stock market is very useful for valuation as buyers and sellers commit to pricing every day trading is open. Over the past two years, we have seen a cyclical shift away from certain sectors like commodities, consumer goods, and traditional financial services towards technology.</p><p>There are many ways to illustrate this point. We compare the Dow Jones industrial Average, a metric of the broad US markets, against the Technology subsector, over the past two years, in Figure&nbsp;2:</p><p>Figure 2: Tech Stocks are just beginning to outperform</p>Source: Investing.com; Tom&nbsp;Kennedy. The pandemic didn’t create this upcoming Tech Boom — but it didn’t&nbsp;hurt <p>While the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had huge exogenous impacts on markets and consumer habits, we contend it did not create this evolution. That said, it has clearly sped things&nbsp;up.</p><p>One anecdotal way to explain adoption is that inevitably the customer is likely to embrace a more convenient, safer, cheaper, or better alternative brought on by technology eventually. The exact timing however is often difficult to pinpoint. During the pandemic, many people chose to or were strongly encouraged to purchase food online. This may be an activity they had never engaged in before and might not even have the technology. So they end up buying groceries that arrive at their door in good time and good order, or a prepared meal, and they enjoy it, and are now committed online shoppers. According to 451 Research, a boutique eCommerce research firm in the US, eCommerce spending rose by 23% year over year in 2020 over 2019. These kinds of numbers represent rapid adoption that will not reverse to pre-COVID levels.</p><p>We would note the broader market has also done very well during the pandemic, which is helpful to enhancing access to capital for any subsector.</p><p>A different way to look at the relative performance of tech versus the broader market is seen comparing the value of $1 invested (all figures USD for this point) on 23 March, 2020 to 22 January, 2021. That dollar would be worth $1.95 now, relative to $1.67 for a buck in the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>This represents an alpha, or relative outperformance, of the tech subsector, at 16.8% over that timeframe which is approximately 10 months of data. A couple of caveats are that we have chosen the US market for more robust data but further believe the US market is an excellent proxy for Canada. That said we have not normalized for the exchange rate, but there are so many things from elections to interest rate movements and virtually infinite economic minutiae that affect all durations of currency fluctuation. In addition, Canada typically lags the US, particularly in market developments. This element enhances our point if true and furthermore contributes to the benefits of obtaining a wider US investment audience both from a valuation and adoption perspective.</p><p>Figure 3: Value of $1 invested at pandemic market&nbsp;bottom</p>Source: Investing.com; Tom&nbsp;Kennedy. The Customer will ultimately drive adoption — and that’s where we believe KABN can&nbsp;excel <p>Global professional services firm Accenture surveyed 47,000 customers on their digital banking practices in their Accenture 2020 Global Banking Consumer Study. Our interpretation is that the customers can be segmented logically by range of adoption, from Traditionalists to Pioneers, and they are rapidly adopting digital interactions with a focus on humanized elements (“Congratulations, your loan is approved!”) with security and online threats being a major theme. Note that ‘humanized’ and ‘personalized’ are two different important factors. Humanized means counteracting the user feeling their requests are being served by a computer program, while personalized refers to a customized experience with their online interactions that feels tailored to their needs, attitudes, and utility rather than fees seemingly for a beige product suite with few alternatives. Well, guess what incumbents: there are fast-moving disruptors with better and better mousetraps.</p><p>Trust in interactions has also fallen precipitously as seen in by the survey’s results, led by bank institutions and insurance, but broadly across all major categories. Trust in banking fell to 37% in 2020 (from 51% of customers trusting their bank in 2018), Insurers fell to 32% (40% — 2018) and Online Payments to 21% (from 30% Trust in&nbsp;2018).</p><p>KABN is uniquely placed to play a role in all these personalized, customer-centric interactions. The customer stands to gain online safety and confidence, the customer owns and can transparently monetize their own identity, and Liquid Avatar stands to be a customized key, wallet, and armour to open empowered and expanded online presence and functionality.</p> Two recent transactions — the announced sales of Kount and SoFi — indicate takeout valuation goalposts <p>Two relevant transactions were announced thus far in 2021. The first was Kount, which announced an acquisition for US$640 MM in cash by Equifax (EFX:NYSE). The second was the acquisition of fintech startup SoFi for US$8.65 BB by one of Social Capital’s special purpose acquisition corporations.</p><p>So to valuation: in each of these cases, the takeout premiums were impressive, and de-emphasize revenues in favour of what SoFi refers to as “WINNER TAKES MOST.” We know what this means. My thesis is that the firms with best-in-class products that are in a position to respond to the massive growth in online eCommerce are going to share a huge pie, not take the whole thing. And the value they are in a position to create is driving buyers to pay up for years of as-yet unrealized performance.</p><p>Take <a href="https://kount.com/">Kount</a>, a leading provider of anti-fraud solutions to thousands of North American&nbsp;brands.</p><p>They have two significant assets, one being a robust proprietary data library and the other being a “secret shopper” type process whereby they test your company’s system for fraud protection. Kount then operates as a high end security consulting firm with bespoke solutions for clients’ eCommerce suites.</p><p>This drove a valuation we estimate at &gt;13x trailing twelve months’ (TTM) revenue, a number that obviously demonstrates the value of their non-revenue performance. They appear cash flow breakeven for at least another full year, as Equifax speaks to the value they will add in over two years of future performance as part of the basis of their purchase price. Equifax constantly runs the risk of becoming a dinosaur every passing day and needs the shot in the arm that is found in new and promising technology. That said, they have the liquidity to acquire new products and teams rather than build them in-house so they can quickly leverage for their existing customers and cross-sell for internal use and customer acquisition alike. Equifax is no stranger to security challenges across their own customers, being dealt a blow in 2017 over a security breach that exposed over 150 million customers’ private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Social Capital’s offer to acquire <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a> represents a significant going-public premium. SoFi is widely recognized as a central market disruptor in financial services right now. This transaction represents an acquisition by a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, not dissimilar to an RTO (reverse takeover) method of going public. This is effectively a financial transaction with a lofty premium in spite of the lack of any synergies or strategic development other than going&nbsp;public.</p><p>SoFi is a fintech pioneer that is disrupting the banks, being vastly more customer friendly and customer focused, and offering a far lower cost model given the internet infrastructure rather than bricks and mortar banking. The valuation being paid by venture capital firm Social Capital implies 13.6x 2025E forecast Adjusted Net Income on figures released by Social Capital. To provide a nearer term perspective, this implies a valuation of 13.9x 2020E Adjusted Net&nbsp;Revenue.</p><p>This means the buyer has already pre-paid for five full years of success culminating in projected results to be announced around now in 2026, at a 50%+ percent premium to current banking institutions’ one-year forward earnings. In the case of SoFi, the SPAC shell saw its value soar, meaning investors see more room above and beyond the premium’s baked in accomplishments. We would also note there are normal considerable growth milestones yet to be accomplished by SoFi that their growth relies upon, notably the receipt of a federal banking&nbsp;license.</p> Summary <p>In summation, we believe the market is entering a new period of non-standard valuations for best-in-class technology that delivers on customer expectations. We expect this will continue all through 2021 and into the foreseeable future.</p><p>We will leave with a parting thought: Merriam-Webster Dictionary has added the word “crowdfunding” for 2021. Things are developing so fast even the dictionary is trying to stay relevant.</p><p>KABN is potentially well-positioned to thrive in this fast-paced environment.</p><p>© 2021 Thomas Kennedy.

<p>Hundreds of millions of cards have been stolen from online retailers, banks and payments companies before being sold for cryptocurrency on dozens of online marketplaces. According to Elliptic’s analysis, the founder of one of the most popular carding marketplaces, Joker’s Stash, has retired having amassed a fortune of over $1 billion.</p> 
<p>Every time you make a purchase with a credit or debit card, your card details are transmitted and stored in computer systems. Many of the major hacks of retailers and other companies are motivated by getting hold of these card credentials.</p> 
<p>Stolen cards have value because they can be used to purchase high-value items or gift cards, which can then be resold for cash. This process is known as “carding”, and has become a key part of the cybercriminal’s playbook. Carding is very profitable in its own right, but it is also used to help launder and cash-out cryptocurrency obtained through other types of cybercrime.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Joker’s Stash - the King of Carding</p> 
<p>Over the past six years, Joker’s Stash rose to become the largest online seller of stolen credit cards and identity data. It is an example of a carding AVC (automated vending cart), which allows large volumes of cards to be sorted, filtered and purchased for Bitcoin with immediate delivery. In the image below you can see these cards categorised and searchable by country, bank, expiry date and other attributes. The going price for a single card on Joker’s Stash ranges from $1 to $150, with those at the upper end coming complete with the cardholder’s name, address and social security number.</p>

 What We’re Building in 2021, and&nbsp;Why  Summary <p>This post describes <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean’s</a> 2021 product roadmap. It reflects our shift from achieving early product-market fit (0 →1), to that of traction (1 →N). The roadmap includes fixing gas costs via multiple chains, Data Farming to further incentivize data consumption, fine-grained permissions, and streaming data services. There will be continued improvements in the core Ocean developer tools, Ocean Market, and OceanDAO.</p>Ocean 2021 Roadmap&nbsp;Summary Outline <p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. We describe Ocean’s maturation from targeting product-market fit (0→1) towards traction (1→N). We then describe how we think about traction, then drill down in further and further detail from key performance indicators, to traction hypotheses, and finally to the 2021 product roadmap by quarter. Let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> From 0→ 1 (The&nbsp;Past) <p>From Ocean’s inception until the end of 2020, the focus for Ocean was getting product-market fit (“0 → 1”) around <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">unlocking data</a> [1]. In early 2020, we published our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">2020 roadmap</a>, and by the end of 2020 we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-in-2020-c5297e73584f">had met&nbsp;it</a>.</p><p>Let’s review the major items. In fall 2020, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v3-is-now-live-b47c0e73f52a">released</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">Ocean V3</a>. It was a huge release for us. It included two products to publish / buy / consume / stake on datasets / services:</p>  <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market webapp</a> — for data publishers, consumers, and&nbsp;stakers  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean developer tools</a> — core software libraries &amp; contracts for developers to integrate with other apps or build wholly new&nbsp;apps  <p>In Dec 2020, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">released</a>:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">OceanDAO</a> — a community-curated grants DAO for growth &amp; long-term sustainability.  <p>The reception to all three products has been enthusiastic. There are tens of teams building on Ocean core software, Ocean Market has hundreds of datasets with more than €5M TVL [2], and OceanDAO has a steady cadence of monthly funding cycles to teams which promise positive value. There’s also steady chat in Telegram and Discord channels surrounding all three products, and a vibrant weekly videochat town&nbsp;hall.</p><p>The most important outcome was: People started to treat data as an&nbsp;asset.</p><p>We’d designed for this, by wrapping each dataset as an ERC20 token (datatoken), for use in DeFi. MetaMask became a data wallet, and Balancer a data DEX. People launched new data assets as Initial Data Offerings. People bought data assets not just to consume, but also to speculate. People staked on data AMM pools, not just to curate but also to provide liquidity. The perennial question “how do you price data?” got answered definitively: the market prices the data. Trading volume is over 100 times the consume volume; this is a good thing because trading and liquidity are preconditions for markets to form. We just witnessed the birth of the open Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p> To 1→ N (The&nbsp;Future) <p>In short, Ocean has a first toehold in product-market fit (“0→1”). Data is being treated as an asset; this is the foundation going forward. Many users are able to get real value from Ocean’s core product offerings. There’s still room to improve each of these products, for more users. Let’s focus on “more users”. The overall goal is ubiquity — we want Ocean to be used everywhere as key IT infrastructure for the planet, side-by-side with DNS, Bitcoin, and other emerging blockchains and protocols. To achieve ubiquity, we need sustained growth over long periods of time. The label ”traction” encapsulates the goal of growth over time. Therefore the focus for Ocean from 2021 onwards is traction (“1→ N”). Importantly, $OCEAN is <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">engineered</a> to grow as traction&nbsp;grows.</p><p>We’ve already started on the traction path, by having rapid iterations with users, to get feedback and translate that into improvements in each of the products (and all the planning, design, construction, etc that happens in between). For example, Ocean Market has seen remarkable evolution in just the few months it’s been live, due to these rapid cycles — from bug fixes to handling fraudulent actors to better-aligning incentives of publishers with&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>That’s a near-term approach to improve traction. We can structure this more rigorously for longer time&nbsp;periods.</p> Ocean Traction&nbsp;Strategy <p>Here’s our traction strategy (inspired by the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369">Traction</a>):</p>  Have target key performance indicators (KPIs)  Have hypotheses of how to grow those&nbsp;KPIs  Try the most promising hypotheses, and observe how they&nbsp;do  Double down on the hypotheses that do the best and prune the&nbsp;rest.  Once those experience diminishing returns, repeat the process with new hypotheses  <p>The next three sections outline (i) the KPIs, (ii) hypotheses, and (iii) specific plans respectively.</p> 2021 KPIs <p>In Dec 2020 and early Jan 2021, the Ocean core team met several times for planning 2021. Traction was the name of the&nbsp;game.</p><p>The following traction-oriented KPIs emerged. We aim to grow each of these indicators.</p><p>Data consumer/provider traction</p>  Value of data consumed in USD. This is particularly important — it’s a good indicator of value being created in this new data&nbsp;economy  Number of datasets / services&nbsp;offered  <p>Staking &amp; DeFi traction:</p>  Total Value Locked of OCEAN &amp; datatokens  Number of DeFi protocols with OCEAN &amp; datatokens as first-class citizens  <p>Developer &amp; community traction:</p>  Number of active high-quality dapps using&nbsp;Ocean  Number of GitHub contributors, external maintainers &amp; support, active ambassadors  Number of community members, and content&nbsp;creators  Value of monthly grants distributed by OceanDAO, while retaining quality  <p>Enterprise/government traction:</p>  Number of engagements. Specifically, for a dedicated handful of partners, maximize their success towards real-world production deployment   2021 Traction Hypotheses <p>With these KPIs in hand, we brainstormed on hypotheses of ways to drive them. (And of course we also included many ideas from the past too.) There were many great ideas! We then filtered to our favorites. Here’s the distillation of that, grouped according to three pillars: (I) Bottom-up, (II) Top-down, and (III) DeFi. Let’s elaborate on each&nbsp;pillar.</p><p>I. Bottom-up: Ocean Market users, developers, startups. Main activities:</p>  Drive growth of Ocean Market. Improve user experience (UX), including reducing gas costs. Further optimize incentive structure. Add virality. Help data publishers, consumers, and liquidity providers make money. Provide arbitrage opportunities.  Help people build with Ocean libraries. Improve developer experience (DX). Help teams make&nbsp;money.  Fund teams for building, outreach, unlocking data. Via OceanDAO (community-curated grants), Shipyard (core-team curated grants), and Data Economy Challenge (prizes). It’s especially important to grow OceanDAO, since it will decentralize Ocean further and position Ocean for long-term sustainability. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Details&nbsp;here</a>.  Integrations. Integrate more datatoken / service types: streaming data, oracles, etc. Deploy on more chains: Eth → many (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">details here</a>). Integrate to more crypto apps: wallets, DEXes, DAOs, and more. Integrate to existing AI tools like scikit-learn, Anaconda, TensorFlow, OpenMined, and&nbsp;OpenML.  <p>II. Top-down: enterprises, governments. Main activities:</p>  Business development and services support, starting with POCs but leading to live deployments on massive scale. Help enterprises turn their data into value, including data “on their books” rather than as a liability. Help governments implement data policies with the help of&nbsp;Ocean.  Service partners. Growing a network of service partners to support these enterprise and government activities (to offload reliance on core&nbsp;team).  <p>III. DeFi. Main activities:</p>  Data Farming. It’s similar to liquidity mining but emphasizes consuming data (versus pure speculation). <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Details&nbsp;here</a>.  Work closely with DeFi projects. For each, get OCEAN as a first-class citizen, then follow up with datatokens. Conduct many experiments, from stablecoins to insurance, and double-down on what works&nbsp;best.  Data DeFi “snowballs”. Incentivize DeFi applications that make more money with more data, leading to a positive feedback loop on Ocean DeFi usage (“snowball effect”). This includes arb bots, trading systems, and yield farming tools that use AI for decision&nbsp;making.  <p>These traction pillars complement each other. All three have real-world use cases. All three involve users that have data, and want data. Bottom-up has low latency in feedback (hours or days), enabling rapid improvements in the products. Its exponential nature promises huge impact over the long term. Top-down demonstrates use cases on large brand names, typically has large numbers attached, and the added credibility helps influence policymaking around data. While top-down may not scale as well, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">doing non-scalable things</a> can really help traction in early days. DeFi has some of the best aspects of the others: like bottom-up it’s low latency and exponential in nature, and like top-down it has large numbers attached. And, it’s&nbsp;fun.</p> 2021 Ocean Product Roadmap, by&nbsp;Quarter <p>With the traction-oriented KPIs and traction hypotheses in hand, the Ocean core teams for product, ecosystem, etc did extensive planning. We reconciled this with the needs of our enterprise collaborators.</p><p>Below is what we arrived at, for our 2021 plans, organized quarterly. These plans support the three traction pillars, and in turn (we hope) help to drive the KPIs. We also reserve the right to change our plans based on learnings in the rapidly evolving crypto environment.</p><p>The plans focus on Ocean products; dovetailing this there are extensive activities in ecosystem, enterprise, and communications towards the 2021 traction&nbsp;goals.</p> Q1/2021 Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q1/2021. The highlight is fixing gas costs, and Compute-to-Data in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p>  Fix gas costs. Gas costs on Ethereum mainnet have become exceedingly high <a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1358110993495318528">and may not abate</a>. We are addressing this by deploying Ocean contracts and running Ocean Market on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">&gt;1 chains</a>. <a href="https://www.purestake.com/news/moonbeam-and-ocean-protocol-partner-to-bring-a-new-data-economy-to-the-polkadot-ecosystem/">Moonbeam</a> and other chains are in the works. Each chain will include an OCEAN bridge to Ethereum mainnet. At least one will be ready by end of&nbsp;Q1.  Ocean Market: has <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a>. This enables buying &amp; selling of private data from Ocean Market webapp&nbsp;itself.  Ocean Market: allow more than one pool for each datatoken. This helps migrating from one pool to another, and is a first step towards Ocean Market linking to other AMM pools, order book based exchanges, and&nbsp;more.  Ocean Market: fewer bugs, faster. This includes continued bug fixes, use TheGraph for Total Value Locked (<a href="https://messari.io/article/how-to-interpret-total-value-locked-tvl-in-defi">TVL</a>), and&nbsp;more.  OceanDAO: streamline flow to reduce friction for people creating proposals and voting. Grow the amount of funding, while <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/On-ROI">ensuring quality projects</a>.  Ecosystem, enterprise and communications activities that dovetail the products. This includes experiments in DeFi initiatives using OCEAN or datatokens.   Q2/2021 Targets <p>We have the following goals for Q2/2021. The highlights are the first deployment of Data Farming, an OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Ocean Market, and supporting more than one datatoken type.</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a>: first deployment. This program incentivizes data consume volume. We will start by allocating a modest amount of OCEAN, then allocate more in each cycle as data consume volume grows. As we learn, we will refine the&nbsp;program.  OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Ocean Market. Having prices and liquidity set (optionally) in a stablecoin reduces variance due to fluctuations in OCEAN. A stablecoin backed by OCEAN, like <a href="https://medium.com/opendao/ocean-opendao-uma-a-new-stablecoin-269241dd8c5d">$OceanO by OpenDAO</a>, helps align interests between Ocean Market users and the broader Ocean community.  Architecture for more than one datatoken type. This refactor includes smart contract changes and a security audit. It allows us to move metadata to the ERC20 contract itself, which we will also do. The added flexibility will make possible a variety of datatoken types, including more fine-grained permissions, fee rate flexibility, and&nbsp;more.  Multi-chain: improve support by deploying to more chains, and enabling Ocean Market users to see data assets across several chains at once. Over time (not necessarily this quarter) support bridges for datatokens and cross-chain liquidity by leveraging developments in cross-chain technology.  OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.   Q3/2021 Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2021. The highlights are ramping up Data Farming, fine-grained permissions, and supporting more data services.</p>  Ramp up Data Farming. We will build on the learnings from Q2 to further scale up the OCEAN allocated, to further catalyze data consume&nbsp;volume.  3rd Party Markets: fine-grained permissions using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role-Based Access Control</a> (RBAC) while retaining datatoken ERC20 mental model. Helps marketplace instances to control which actors can publish assets in that marketplace instance, view assets, and consume data assets. This is for 3rd party markets; Ocean Market will remain as open-ended as possible.  Data Services: support two more data services as data assets. Possibilities include WebSockets (streaming data), Chainlink, TheGraph, Streamr, GraphQL streaming data, and more; we will prioritize as we&nbsp;go.  Multi-chain, OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.  <p>Q4/2021 Targets</p><p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q4/2021. The highlights are better staking and helping the community to monetize&nbsp;better.</p>  Better staking. People can stake OCEAN in data pools without having to buy the data asset in the process. This will use Balancer V2. In general, it will better align the incentives of publishers, consumers, and liquidity providers / stakers / curators.  Help community monetize. For people running their own marketplaces (as dedicated apps, or in wallets, etc), enable potential for fees in publishing, swapping, staking, and consuming, with flexibility on setting the&nbsp;fees.  Market: trustless &amp; convenient urls, to retain Ocean Market’s current convenience while removing its having brief custody of&nbsp;urls.  Data Farming, Data Services, Multi-chain, OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.   Conclusion <p>Up until the end of 2020, our goal was to get initial product-market fit for Ocean (0→1). Now that we have a foothold on that, our focus going forward is traction (1→N). This article presented our KPIs, our hypotheses of how to achieve those, and finally specific product plans towards implementing hypotheses.</p> Appendix: Roadmap with Dependencies <p>The following image illustrates the roadmap presented above, but adding dependency information.

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) Level 2</a> specification is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a> at the W3C. "Level 2" essentially means major version number 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The version 2.1 of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20201208/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20201208.html">Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> specification is a Release Draft at the FIDO Alliance. This means the spec is in a public review period before final publication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new draft versions are on their way to becoming the next wave of FIDO functionality (as of the writing of this blog, we support Level 1 of WebAuthn and CTAP version 2.0). We think you might want to hear about what we think is especially fun about WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enterprise Attestation (EA) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enterprise Attestation is a new feature coming as part of WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1 that enables binding of an authenticator to an account using a persistent identifier, similar to a smart card today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO privacy standards require that "a FIDO device does not have a global identifier within a particular website" and "a FIDO device must not have a global identifier visible across websites". EA is designed to be used exclusively in enterprise-like environments where a trust relationship exists between devices and/or browsers and the relying party via management and/or policy. If EA is requested by a Relying Partying (RP) and the OS/browser is operating outside an enterprise context (personal browser profile, unmanaged device, etc), the browser is expected to prompt the user for consent and provide a clear warning about the potential for tracking via the persistent identifier being shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authenticators can be configured to support Vendor-facilitated and/or Platform-managed Enterprise Attestation. Vendor-facilitated EA involves an authenticator vendor hardcoding a list of Relying Party IDs (RP IDs) into the authenticator firmware as part of manufacturing. This list is immutable (aka non-updateable). An enterprise attestation is only provided to RPs in that list. Platform-managed EA involves an RP ID list delivered via enterprise policy (ex: managed browser policy, mobile application management (MAM), mobile device management (MDM) and is enforced by the platform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Authenticator Credential Management and Bio Enrollment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credential Management is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows management of discoverable credentials (aka resident keys) on an authenticator. Management can occur via a browser, an OS settings panel, an app or a CLI tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of how the Credential Management capability is baked into Chrome 88 on macOS (chrome://settings/securityKeys). Here I can manage my PIN, view discoverable credentials, add and remove fingerprints (assuming the authenticator has a fingerprint reader!) and factory reset my authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking on "Sign-in data" shows the discoverable credentials on the authenticator and allows me to remove them. This security key has an Azure AD account and an identity for use with <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/">SSH</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bio Enrollment allows the browser, client, or OS to aid in configuring biometrics on authenticators that support them. This security key has one finger enrolled. I can either remove the existing finger or add more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of authenticator credential management via a CLI tool, <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/">ykman</a> from Yubico.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Set Minimum PIN Length and Force Change PIN 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CTAP 2.1 allows an RP to require a minimum PIN length on the authenticator. If the existing PIN does not meet the RP’s requirements, a change PIN flow can be initiated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An authenticator can also be configured with a one-time use PIN that must be changed on first use. This is an additional layer of protection when an authenticator is pre-provisioned by an administrator and then needs to be sent to an end user. The temporary PIN can be communicated to the end user out of band. We see this being used in conjunction with Enterprise Attestation to create a strong relationship between an authenticator and a user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Always Require User Verification (AlwaysUV) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AlwaysUV is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows the user to configure their authenticator to always prompt for user verification (PIN, biometric, etc), even when the Relying Party does not ask for it. This adds an extra layer of protection by ensuring all credentials on the authenticator require the same verification method.</p>

 Virtual Authenticator DevTool 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one is not tied to updates of either specification but we love it and wanted to share! Chrome and Edge (version 87+) now include a virtual authenticator as part of DevTools. It started as a Chromium extension back in 2019 and is now native! Oh, and the <a href="https://github.com/google/virtual-authenticators-tab">code is on Github</a>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great tool for testing, debugging and learning! Try it with one of the awesome WebAuthn test sites: <a href="https://webauthnsample.azurewebsites.net/">Microsoft WebAuthn Sample App</a>, <a href="https://webauthn.io/">WebAuthn.io</a>, <a href="https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration">Yubico WebAuthn Demo</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access the tool, open Developer Tools ( <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">F12 or Option + Command</a><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">+ I</a> ), click the Menu icon on the top right (…) then More tools and WebAuthn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling the virtual authenticator environment will allow you to create a new authenticator by picking a protocol (CTAP2 or U2F), transport (USB, Bluetooth, NFC or internal), resident key (discoverable) and user verification support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As new credentials are created, you’ll see them listed and the sign count will increase as the credential is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consumers can leverage their financial data to improve their financial health, gain access to financial services, and enhance control over their finances. In order to benefit from these financial outcomes, consumers provide access to their financial data to end users through data access providers. If data access providers truly want to empower consumers, they must protect that data and ensure that control of the data remains firmly in the hands of the consumer. And a commitment to protect data in word only isn’t enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data access providers that share financial data they have assembled for the purpose of lending, insurance, and employment, must adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Operating as a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA) is the best way to ensure a consumer-first lending approach that both protects and empowers borrowers. Anything less is just words.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this in greater detail.&nbsp;</p>
 The FCRA and Financial Data Sharing 
<p><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/report-basics/fair-credit-reporting-act-fcra/">The Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> protects consumers by establishing and protecting the right for individuals to dispute inaccurate data in consumer reports and get those errors fixed. In order to maintain transparency and ensure accuracy, the Act also requires that consumers have access at any time to any personal financial data provided for credit or insurance eligibility decisioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While FCRA has historically applied to credit bureaus and certain specialty CRAs, like tenant screening and medical information companies, the Act has a broad scope of coverage and is not limited to traditional credit reporting or a narrow set of CRAs. Third-party data access providers that power financial data permissioning between lenders and consumers use a different type of data sharing model for which FCRA compliance provides an equally critical component of protecting consumers when they access credit and other financial services.</p>
<p>As it stands, the FCRA applies to consumer reports that<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-reporting-agency.asp"> CRAs</a> provide to third parties for certain permissible purposes described in the FCRA, such as determining a consumer’s eligibility for credit or insurance. Consumer reports can only be provided and used for these permissible purposes. If data access providers, also known as data aggregators or data agents, are assembling a consumer’s financial data and sharing it for the purpose of credit or insurance decisioning, shouldn’t those providers be considered CRAs, and shouldn’t the FCRA apply to their data sharing?</p>
<p>In order to protect and empower consumers, we think so.</p>
 Empowering Consumers with Compliant Data Sharing 
<p>FCRA compliance is the only sure way to guarantee fairness, accuracy, and transparency when data access providers assemble consumer financial data and provide it to lenders or insurers to make credit or insurance decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A current regulatory interpretation of the FCRA suggests that an organization does not become a CRA when it forwards financial data to a third party at a consumer’s request because they are simply engaging in “permission-based sharing” on behalf of the consumer. Finicity believes this interpretation of the FCRA was meant to address different circumstances, such as where a mortgage broker forwards a consumer’s application and credit report to prospective mortgage lenders at the consumer’s request. This and other “conduit”-like functions fall outside the FCRA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not believe, however, that this interpretation was intended to cover situations where a data access provider or other party “assembles” consumer data to provide to financial data users. Such a broad reading of the “permission-based sharing” interpretation would run counter to the purpose of the Act and undermine the protections the FCRA was created to uphold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can’t data access providers simply promise protections to consumers? Such assurances are of course important, but can vary from provider to provider. Consumers are best served when all data access providers are held to a common standard of consumer protection. Operating as a CRA requires that data access providers adhere to the FCRA and provide specific dispute and disclosure processes that enable consumers to access and view their data, dispute any errors, and understand how their data is being used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a data access provider is delivering consumer data it has assembled to creditors for use in credit decisioning, and is not functioning as a CRA, it is not adhering to the FCRA and not protecting consumers as well as it could.</p>
<p>With open banking and digital financial services continuing to pick up speed, it’s more crucial than ever that the industry demonstrate that the consumer-permissioned data sharing process is conducted fairly, accurately, and with transparency for the consumer. Those positive outcomes follow when a data access provider, in appropriate circumstances, is functioning as a CRA and is legally required to adhere to the FCRA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only when such protections are in place can consumers reliably enjoy the empowerment and improved financial outcomes they deserve. And the financial services industry can similarly benefit from the growth and innovation that comes from the increased acceptance of leveraging consumer-permissioned financial data for the benefit of consumers.

<p>Finicity releases detailed analysis affirming that data aggregators should be deemed CRAs and subject to FCRA requirements</p>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY, Utah – February 11, 2021 – Finicity, a Mastercard company and leading provider of open banking solutions, has produced a detailed whitepaper with analysis showing why the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) should apply to providers of data aggregation services (“data agents”) in certain circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCRA protects consumers by establishing and protecting the right for individuals to dispute inaccurate data in consumer reports and get those errors fixed. The growth of consumer-permissioned data sharing in lending, insurance, and employment means that FCRA compliance will become a critical component of consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As Open Banking puts consumers in control of their financial data and gives lenders a more complete view of consumers’ creditworthiness, it’s critical that the sharing of financial data is conducted fairly, accurately, and with the utmost transparency,” said Steve Smith, Co-founder and CEO of Finicity. “Leveraging the protections of the FCRA will provide a vital regulatory framework that gives everyone in the financial ecosystem confidence in all of these areas, as well as manageable, familiar compliance standards for the data agents behind growing aggregation capabilities for underwriting use cases.”</p>
<p>Lenders have increasingly relied on new forms of financial data, such as information about a consumer’s bank account transactions, which can enable better, more effective credit-decisioning for lenders. This data supplements the traditional credit score to expand the lenders’ view of a borrower’s financial health, and ultimately stands to increase financial inclusion. Not only does this financial data give lenders a more thorough credit review process, it also empowers consumers with control over their own financial data, which they can grant or revoke access to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the emergence of third-party data aggregators and their ability to provide financial data for the purposes of credit decisioning, FCRA compliance is essential to protecting the consumer,” said Chi Chi Wu, Staff Attorney with the National Consumer Law Center.</p>
<p>Finicity believes this new credit process also necessitates that it function in concert with fair reporting principles: data should be accurate, consumers should have access to their own data, and they should know when and how their data is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December 2019, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the federal banking agencies released an Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting. In the Interagency Statement, the agencies recognized the consumer benefits of considering cash flow data in credit decisions and noted how consumers “can expressly permission access to their cash flow data”—through data agents—to enhance transparency and consumer control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFPB is expected to propose new rules around consumer-authorized access to financial data in early 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity is releasing a detailed white paper “FCRA and Data Agents” with analysis of the mechanics and benefits of FCRA compliance for data aggregators. The full white paper can be downloaded at:&nbsp; <a href="https://info.finicity.com/fcra-data-agents/">https://info.finicity.com/fcra-data-agents/</a></p>

					 <p>Since launching the first production-grade platform for <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, we’ve seen over 1,000 innovators from all over the world build solutions leveraging the verifiable credential standard. These innovators collectively have deployed production verifiable credentials to over 80,000 people across five continents. These teams trust Trinsic to maintain a robust platform upon which they can depend. Today we’re announcing two new resources to support these and future production deployments: an API status page and a community Slack channel. </p>

					 <p>Dependability, or being as secure, scalable, and available as we can be, and transparency, or being open with our partners about our platform’s capabilities and limits, are two of our core values. The best way we know to demonstrate our dependability in a transparent way is to host a public API Status page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A status page has been a highly-requested feature for some time. You can find the new status page at: <a href="http://status.trinsic.id">status.trinsic.id</a>. We began testing the status page a few months ago using several tools that interact with various different API endpoints across our multiple APIs. This ensures that each kind of endpoint (for example, endpoints that access wallet storage and ones that write to the ledger) is sufficiently covered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>View historical uptime: Using the status page, you can see the last 90 days of uptime of all our externally-facing services. You can also inspect individual incidents and view incident reports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be notified of incidents: By clicking the “subscribe” button in the upper-left of the screen, you can have any downtime or incidents trigger a notification to your email or Slack workspace.</p>

Privileged accounts have traditionally been given to administrators to access critical data and applications. But, changing business practices, hybrid IT, cloud and other aspects of digital transformation has meant that users of privileged accounts have become more numerous and widespread. One area in sharp focus is DevOps support which has become essential to many organizations looking to become more responsive and innovative. Application developers and other agile teams increasingly need privileged access to essential tools, and several PAM vendors are responding to this demand.</p>

Before we dive into explaining this amazing opportunity, we don’t want to waste your time. So,&nbsp;if you don’t have Australian&nbsp;citizenship or&nbsp;permanent residency,&nbsp;or if you are representing a&nbsp;recruitment agency or an&nbsp;offshore/provider, then this&nbsp;is not for you. We understand you may be an awesome candidate, or have access to great candidates, but we will not consider such applications at this time.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a Graduate or Junior UX/UI Designer for our Australian team, where you can help shape the API-of-Me.




 




What is the <a href="https://dev.meeco.me/">API-of-Me</a> you might ask?




 




It is an emerging platform that enables the collection, protection and exchange of personal data. Our main objective is to provide a suite of developer tools and APIs to companies and organisations to allow them to build privacy first solutions




 




We are passionate about building a new economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organizations enter a win-win relationship and build a new, more meaningful relationship. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more.




 




Don’t hesitate to apply, no matter what your background is. We would like to build a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia and Belgium, and collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, each with a unique personal data story.




 About the&nbsp;Role 




This is an exciting opportunity to start your UX career with a technology start-up working to improve the world! Meeco is a growing team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK and we are looking for a junior UX/UI designer to join our Adelaide based design team.




 




This role is ideally suited to someone who doesn’t necessarily have commercial experience in the UX field, but is excited and passionate about user experience and how design can help humanise technology.




 




You will be working closely with our Chief of Design, and you will be involved in the full design process. The following will help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 





  Help to gather and evaluate user requirements  Conduct UX research  Brainstorm and workshop design solutions  Contribute to developing user personas, customer journey maps, storyboards and user flows  Contribute to wireframing and high-fidelity designs  Contribute to creating design-based prototypes  





 




We use a variety of industry standard tools including Figma. It is not a requirement that you have experience in using any of these tools, but a willingness to learn and self-directed education is required.




 





 About You 





 




We are looking for someone who is either studying or has recently finished a course in UX or similar fields. You will have worked on at least two UX projects that you are proud of and be willing to present them and explain your decisions (these can be personal projects or student projects).




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the center, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical or design solutions.




 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have great mentors to show you the ropes. An open mind, a desire to learn and being able to incorporate constructive feedback is essential.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most.




 




The following is our wish-list. It is not necessary that you have all this experience, butthe more you have or can pick up quickly will increase your chances of success in the role:




 





  Be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in UX/UI, either through your study or personal projects  Experienced in using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Affinity or Adobe design suite  You have experience in using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Affinity or Adobe design suite  Keeping up to date with the latest UI/UX design and usability trends and techniques  Understand what a design system is  Understand and have experience with web development technologies such as Javascript and CSS  





 




This is a job where we&nbsp;support&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;However, we do have an office in Adelaide. Given the mentoring aspects of the role, we would like you to be in the office at least three days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.&nbsp;




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and be self directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed.&nbsp;We love you asking for help!




 





 What We Offer 




We pay a competitive start-up&nbsp;package&nbsp;based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 





 What We Have Achieved 




We&nbsp;are&nbsp;early&nbsp;pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.&nbsp;




 




Funding; our founder bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community. &nbsp;&nbsp;Search for Meeco on-line and you will see our consistent focus in helping build a global personal data economy.

<p>Credible v0.1 pushed to <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/credible">GitHub</a> with its core functionality enabled, <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">documentation</a>, and is moving towards stability for white-labeling.</p><p>Today, Spruce is open-sourcing under the Apache 2.0 license an early developer release of Credible (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/credible">GitHub repository here</a>), a native mobile wallet for W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers built on <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter">Flutter</a>. We were able to package the DIDKit library written in Rust into a Flutter application running on both Android and iOS, using C bindings and <a href="https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop">Dart’s FFI</a> capabilities. A special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/brickpop/flutter-rust-ffi">brickpop/flutter-ffi-rust</a> for paving the way in the use of this technique, which inspired our own implementation’s architecture.</p>DIDKit’s Architecture<p>We hope you enjoy this release, and if you would like an invitation to the iOS TestFlight or Android Play Beta store builds of Credible, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/hqgP9f">enter your email</a> to receive an invite&nbsp;soon.</p> Who this is&nbsp;for <p>We believe that there will be no “one size fits all” credential wallet because the user experience must be appropriately tailored to each use case. Workflows involving trusted information tend to be extremely sensitive to context, with vast differences in the kinds of information used, methods of verification, and user interfaces from situation to situation. For example, the following use cases will demand completely different interfaces:</p>  A hospital wants to allow its qualified medical staff and pharmacists to digitally sign and verify prescriptions, respectively.  A trading desk wants to set position limits based on a trader’s digital authorizations issued by the&nbsp;firm.  A user wishes to demonstrate their history of transactions with a merchant, granting them special status and benefits at another venue through a commercial partnership.  <p>Comparing just these three, there’s a lot of variety that no single user experience can truly satisfy. They all share a need to make important data verifiable and portable, but the difference in their user experiences shows how unlikely it is for one overarching “wallet interface” to rule them&nbsp;all.</p><p>Instead, we are striving to build a solid, general-purpose technological foundation suitable to be tailored for specific use cases and workflows. This is the wallet counterpart to the rich, growing toolkit supplied by DIDKit, the two pillars of a reference architecture for creating trusted interactions at&nbsp;scale.</p> Credible’s core technologies: VCs and&nbsp;DIDs <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> are a cryptographically-signed, contextualized, and highly portable data format used to represent beliefs about reality, such as someone’s educational certifications, employment history, and licenses. They can also be used to represent beliefs about non-person entities (NPEs) such as code repositories, IoT devices, and data sets. Credible brings the ability to receive with, safely store in, and present VCs from your smartphone, making them truly&nbsp;yours.</p><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a kind of URI that can be universally resolvable across the Internet, public blockchains, and other data sources. They are used in conjunction with a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a> to establish public key-based control authority of a “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-controller">DID controller</a>” and enable service discovery of “service endpoints.” People may manage several DIDs each to keep different aspects of their life separate and private. DIDs may also be managed by non-person entities, such as software agents, industrial equipment, and computer servers. Credible currently supports the use of a single DID from your smartphone, with multi-DID support on the&nbsp;roadmap.</p><p>VCs and DIDs may be used together in powerful patterns, built from the fundamental issuance, storage, verification, and revocation workflow. DIDs can be used to cryptographically sign VCs, and because most DIDs can be resolved to their public keys, anyone can then verify the produced VC as authentic and tamper-proof, thereby increasing their trust of the information inside. Credible currently supports the use of DIDs to request, store, verify, and present VCs. Future versions of Credible will also allow for issuance and revocation.</p><p>Credible ships out of the box with support for the <a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">Tezos DID method</a>, which we have jointly authored with the Tezos ecosystem. The development of this DID method, as described in our <a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/didkit-v0-1-is-live-d0ea6638dbc9">DIDKit release post</a>, will be able to take full advantage of future <a href="https://www.tezosagora.org/period/40">protocol upgrades</a> on the Tezos public blockchain to provide best in class decentralized identity-specific support across the whole stack, down to the VM bytecode. We especially look forward to the use of <a href="https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/sapling-integration-in-tezos-tech-preview.html#:~:text=Shielded%20transactions&amp;text=In%20a%20shielded%20transaction%20the,to%20as%20the%20shielded%20pool.">shielded transactions</a> to increase privacy while retaining the availability of DID resolution, and the use of <a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/tickets-on-tezos-part-1-a7cad8cc71cd">tickets</a> to allow for sophisticated on-chain permissioning while exercising DID document&nbsp;control.</p><p>Currently, the only server interactions that Credible will make are through URLs scanned from QR codes.

<p>As the first covid-related health pass certified by ID2020, we’re proud to offer our support to this initiative to create an interoperable blueprint for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=identitysolutions&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6765232832974487552">#identitysolutions</a>&nbsp;and restore our economies and lives.</p>
<p>Starting today, BLOK BioScience – as part of the BLOK Solutions family – will work towards building widely accepted, secure, privacy-first standards for health passes, in the good company of a growing number of leading global organisations.</p>
<p>Of the initiative, our CTO Areiel Wolanow says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several companies – including our own – have brought already health passport solutions to market, and many more are in the process of doing so.&nbsp;At the same time, most of the world’s countries are trying to figure out what they need from a health passport, or if they want one at all.&nbsp;With both requirements and solutions in such a state of flux – and likely to remain so – the key to having solutions that remain viable and actually help manage this pandemic is for those solutions to be interoperable.&nbsp;Most of the health passport solutions currently on the market claim to be interoperable — as long as you accept their own solution as the base framework for any such collaboration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we really like about ID2020’s Good Health Pass is that it enables true interoperability, setting a basis for collaboration that is truly independent of any one solution while enforcing preservation of the values that led us to build a solution in the first place.&nbsp;We are very happy to endorse Good Health Pass, and commit its adoption to our product roadmap.</p></blockquote>

 Original Good Health Pass Collaborative release 
<p>Today,&nbsp;<a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a>&nbsp;announced the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;along with more than 25 leading individual companies and organizations in the technology, health, and travel sectors — including the&nbsp;Airports Council International (ACI),&nbsp;Commons Project Foundation,&nbsp;COVID-19 Credentials Initiative,&nbsp;Evernym,&nbsp;Hyperledger,&nbsp;IBM,&nbsp;International Chamber of Commerce (ICC),&nbsp;Linux Foundation Public Health,&nbsp;Lumedic,&nbsp;Mastercard,&nbsp;Trust Over IP Foundation, and others.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Good Health Pass Collaborative&nbsp;is an open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative to create a blueprint for interoperable digital health pass systems that will help restore global travel and restart the global economy.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every segment of the global economy, but none as profoundly as<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/industries-most-and-least-impacted-by-covid19-from-a-probability-of-default-perspective-september-2020-update">&nbsp;travel and tourism</a>. Last year, airlines lost an estimated<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-24-01/">&nbsp;$118.5 billion USD</a>&nbsp;with related impacts across the economy in excess of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unwto.org/impact-assessment-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-on-international-tourism">$2 trillion USD</a>.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the announcement, the Collaborative also released its first white paper, entitled,&nbsp;<a href="https://goodhealthpass.org/good_health_pass-a_safe_path_to_global_reopening">Good Health Pass: A Safe Path to Global Reopening</a>.</p>
 Collaboration Among a New Ecosystem of Players 
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s one thing the world agrees on — we need to address the health concerns today to support a return to normalcy,” said&nbsp;Ajay Bhalla, President of Cyber &amp; Intelligence at Mastercard. “Delivering a global, interoperable health pass system can only happen if we come together in a way that meets the needs of everyone involved. This Collaborative will be critical in helping to define how we connect the pieces that will bring travel back safely, spark job creation and jumpstart the world’s economic engine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various efforts are currently underway to develop digital health credentials systems — both vaccination and test certificates — for international travel. Yet, despite this race to market, it is unlikely that a single solution will be implemented universally — or even across the entire travel industry. Thus, it is critical that solutions are designed from the onset to be interoperable — both with one another and across institutional and geographic borders.</p>
<p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is not intended to supplant existing efforts but rather to help weave them together, fill gaps where they may exist, and facilitate collaboration among a new ecosystem of stakeholders, many of whom have never worked together before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Fragmentation is a risk we simply cannot ignore,” said&nbsp;ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener. “To be valuable to users, credentials need to be accepted at check-in, upon arrival by border control agencies, and more. We can get there — even with multiple systems — as long as solutions adhere to open standards and participate in a common governance framework. But without these, fragmentation is inevitable, and travelers — and the economy — will continue to suffer needlessly as a result.”</p>
</blockquote>
 Global Travel &amp; Digital Health Credentials 
<p>COVID-19 test results are already required for entry at some airports and at international borders. But existing paper-based certificates are easy to lose, unnecessarily expose sensitive personal information, and are prone to fraud and counterfeiting.</p>
<p>By contrast, digital health credentials can be printed (e.g., as a QR code) or stored on an individual’s mobile phone. They enhance user privacy and “bind” an individual’s identity to their test result or vaccination certificate, thus enabling real-time, fraud-resistant digital verification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our health data consists of the most sensitive personal information, deserving of the strongest privacy,” said&nbsp;Dr. Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security By Design Centre. “Release of our health data must be under our personal control. The Good Health Pass does just that: With Privacy by Design embedded throughout, you control the release of your digital health data, and to whom; all de-identified and decentralized. Privacy and functionality: Win/Win!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;World Health Organization&nbsp;recently convened the&nbsp;Smart Vaccination Certificate Consortium&nbsp;to establish standards for vaccination certificates, but no analogous effort currently exists for test certificates. Given that it is expected to take years for vaccines to be universally available globally, widespread testing will remain an essential public health tool — and one that must continue alongside vaccination to ensure a safe and equitable return to public life.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Good Health Pass Collaborative&nbsp;has defined four primary requirements that digital health credential systems for international travel must satisfy:</p>
 
 Cross-border:&nbsp;Solutions must work at airports, airlines, ports-of-call, and borders worldwide and comply with international and local regulations. 
 Cross-industry:&nbsp;Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. 
 Secure &amp; privacy-protecting:&nbsp;Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. Solutions must comply with all relevant security, privacy, and data protection regulations and must be able to bind the presenter of the credential to the credential itself at the required level of assurance. 
 Frictionless:&nbsp;Solutions must seamlessly integrate into testing and travel processes, thus enhancing and streamlining the experience for individuals and airlines alike. Solutions must not add new material costs for travelers. Optimally, validation processes will be contactless to maintain or enhance hygiene. 
 
<p>The Collaborative welcomes the participation of policymakers and representatives of government agencies; companies in the health, technology, and travel sectors; and civil society organizations who share a commitment to safely restoring international travel and economic activity while simultaneously ensuring that equity, privacy, and other civil liberties are protected.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This year is especially crucial to our national sustainability efforts, with big decisions to be made in the wake of Covid-19 and COP26 approaching in November. So it was particularly important for business, government, investors and NGOs to come together at this year’s <a href="https://event.edie.net/forum/">Edie Sustainability Leaders Forum</a> – to share insight and help drive the collective fight for a sustainable future. Below are the key themes that I saw emerge over the last three days.</p>
 1. Sustainability is not a bolt-on 
<p>Time and again this week, experts denounced the approach of treating sustainability strategy as separate to core company strategy. James Bidwell (<a href="https://thisisreset.com/">Re_Set</a>, <a href="https://www.springwise.com/">Springwise</a>) reminded us on Wednesday afternoon of that time when e-commerce was in a separate bucket. His message was plain: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Sustainability is the new digital, and businesses that embed sustainability and diversity in their business models are the ones that will win in the future.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Dan Botterill (Founder &amp; CEO, <a href="https://www.rio.ai/">Rio AI</a>) expressed similar sentiment at a panel on the future of reporting: “sustainability reporting isn’t going to be called that – it’s just going to be called reporting.”</p>
<p>The same idea returned on Thursday morning, when Edie’s Luke Nicholls asked whether the ultimate goal of sustainability professionals is to make themselves redundant. In response, Chris Cook (<a href="https://www.icipensionfund.org.uk/">ICI Pension Fund</a>) encouraged sustainability professionals to ask themselves, “how can this business continue to do the right thing when I’m no longer at the table?”</p>
 2. Shoppers want to know about the impact of products, not brands 
<p>As citizens, we want to be the hero of our own sustainability story. This week provided a reminder that brands shouldn’t put themselves at the centre of their sustainability narrative. In a fascinating CSR campaigns workshop on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.wearefuterra.com/">Futerra’s</a> Solitaire Townsend and Hannah Phang explained how this is especially the case with Gen Z, who are more interested in the product in their hand than the company that made it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that <a href="https://www.edie.net/library/Supply-chain-emissions--The-next-frontier-of-sustainable-business-leadership/6982">90% of a product’s emissions can come from the supply chain</a>, it’s unsurprising that company-level impact is a secondary priority to shoppers. The consensus was that you need to be talking about sustainability at product-level, which is exactly what we help brands with here at Provenance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brands should also decentre themselves from sustainability communications by talking about customers, employees and supply chain actors. In time, people will associate your brand with any progress made. This is also an approach which minimises the risk of greenwashing.</p>
 3. Business must tell the simple truth on sustainability 
<p>This week’s speakers reminded brand leaders of the importance of moving away from green ‘spin’ towards warts-and-all honesty – which is exactly what we’re helping brands do here at Provenance.</p>
<p>In Wednesday’s panel on sustainability reporting, Dan Neale (<a href="https://www.worldbenchmarkingalliance.org/">World Benchmarking Alliance</a>) spoke of how “the traditional world of CSR comms is driven by messaging, rather than what we need to see, which is boring, chunky data – it’s disclosures and reporting, it’s not ‘reports’.” As he put it, “the gloss is dross. What we need is ease of access.”</p>
 <p>Image: Ecologi’s Crista Buznea called for simplicity around carbon targets.</p> 
<p>In a workshop on effective CSR campaigns, there was also a fascinating discussion about how ‘born again’ corporate brands are adopting the honest, human tone of voice normally associated with ‘born good’ challenger brands. These legacy brands are increasingly becoming more honest, vulnerable and becoming advocates for change.</p>
<p>I also heard a number of calls for simplicity when it comes to sustainability communications. On Wednesday, Rebecca Burgess, Chief Executive of <a href="https://www.citytosea.org.uk/">City to Sea</a>, argued convincingly that people are already overwhelmed; she encouraged change campaigners to “take the hype away” and ask “what’s the action that’s needed?”. <a href="https://ecologi.com/">Ecologi’s</a>&nbsp;Crista Buznea similarly called for simpler messaging around environmental goals: “We really need to debunk this whole net zero terminology and the complexity around it – the focus needs to be on action and making it very clear and accessible to all.”</p>
 4. Togetherness is key 
<p>‘Togetherness’ emerged as another big theme at this week’s conference. Thursday morning’s plenary session provided a reminder of the importance of intersectionality in the very white ‘world’ of sustainability, and challenged us to bring new voices to the fore.</p>
<p>‘Togetherness’ was also discussed in terms of collaboration between brands and their supply chain actors. “We’re all each other’s keeper,” said Richard Griffiths MP, as he argued that better supplier collaboration can help us bring change faster. His thoughts were echoed by Tor Burrows (<a href="https://www.grosvenor.com/">Grosvenor</a>); she advised brands to both “choose suppliers that share your ethos/commitments,” or else to “show suppliers that there is customer demand for sustainable products.”</p>
 5. We have reason for both optimism and urgency 
<p>In the opening keynote, Tom Rivett-Carnac (<a href="https://globaloptimism.com/">Global Optimism</a>) set out the case for us to adopt a “stubborn optimism” in the face of the reality that is coming at us. He explained that this wasn’t blind hope – it was about “accepting that genuine failure is possible” and “acknowledging that real success is also possible”. This call to arms saw Solitaire Townsend take on a new job title – tired of laying out the problems to skeptics, she is now embracing optimism in her new job title ‘Chief Solutionist’.</p>
<p>Jonathan Porritt (<a href="https://www.forumforthefuture.org/">Forum for the Future</a>) acknowledged some progress in the form of the government’s ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030. But his keynote on Thursday focused more on the need for urgency. He described today’s model of capitalism as “essentially suicidal”, reminding us that every year, $4-6 trillion of taxpayer money goes towards activities that are undermining or destroying life on earth.</p>
<p>By his calculations, the lag effects on scientific, governmental, corporate and consumer progress mean we’re at least 10 years off the pace. He criticised the focus on 2050 – “a wonderfully convenient date” – and called on brands to adopt an emergency response. “Whatever you’ve settled for as your net zero target, bring it forward. And make it happen.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a sobering conclusion, but incredibly motivating. One thing is clear to me: this must be a year of solutions. At Provenance, we want to meet this need for urgency by helping brands navigate their impact and communicate progress honestly.</p>

Against this backdrop, data privacy and data management remains one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today.</p><p>Ontology focuses on the development of public blockchain technology, while building a decentralized digital identity protocol (ONT ID) and decentralized data exchange protocol (DDXF) on top, using the blockchain’s distributed ledger to help users properly manage these identities. On the Ontology platform, users have a decentralized way to manage their data and apply different data selectively to different scenarios. You can choose who to share your data with and set up separate data profiles for different people and organizations.

  Introduction 
<p>Cozy is a versatile open-source personal cloud used to gather your personal data in a safe place. You can <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/tutorials/app/">develop</a> any client-side application to manipulate existing data types, called <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/cozy-doctypes/">doctypes</a>, or simply create your <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-client/schema/">own</a>.<br>
As a result, many types of data can be stored in a single database instance. It is then crucial to be able to efficiently query data so the user can smoothly retrieve it.</p>
<p>Over the years, we witnessed many different use-cases of data manipulation at <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a> and gained some experience about scalability issues and common traps developers might fall in when dealing with databases.</p>
<p>This article aims to give a short overview of the most common mistakes we saw (and - let’s admit it - sometimes made!) about data indexing and querying. The concepts we discuss here are rather generic and can be applied to many database engines, both SQL and No-SQL. In the following, our examples primarily assume a <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> database, as this is the one used in Cozy, but we provide pointers to the equivalent concepts for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, which are some of the best known database engines, respectively in SQL and document-oriented No-SQL.</p>
<p>Our example uses <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client">cozy-client</a>, a Javascript library that provides an API to simplify the interaction with the  Cozy <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack">backend</a>, for authentication, realtime, offline, etc. And most importantly, it provides interfaces to query the database and deal with the indexes.</p>
 Indexes: the what and the why 
<p>Index: why?</p>
<p>Indexing data is useful as soon as your database grows and data cannot be retrieved in a reasonable time through full-scan queries, i.e. by scanning the whole database.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you don’t want to query all you data at once: you use filters to restrict the selected data. It is typically done through a <code>where</code> clause in SQL, a <code>find</code> method in MongoDB or a <code>selector</code> in CouchDB.<br>
You might also want to retrieve data in a particular order, by sorting it, or selecting only certain fields to be returned.</p>
<p>While it is possible to do such tasks on the client side, they are generally delegated to the database server to ensure scalability. After all this is its job!<br>
However, there is no magic here: you cannot expect a database to automatically deal with large amount of data in a perfectly suitable way for your needs.<br>
This is where indexes takes place: they are used to tell the database how to organize data in such a way that your queries can be efficiently run, even though the database contains millions of elements.</p>
<p>ℹ️ Index is obvisouly not the only thing to keep in mind when dealing with databases, but we focus exclusively on it for this article, for the sake of conciseness.</p>
<p>Index: what?</p>
<p>An index is a way to organize documents in order to retrieve them faster.<br>
To give a simple and non-database comparison, a recipe book might have an index listing all the recipes by their name with their page number. If the reader is looking for a particular recipe, this index avoids him to scan the full book to find it.</p>
<p>The principle is the same for database indexes: we want to avoid scanning the whole book (which can be a table, a collection, etc) each time we are looking for specific data: even though computers are way faster than humans to scan data, this task can be very time-consuming when dealing with thousands or millions of documents.</p>
<p>In more formal terms, time complexity of a query run on a database with <code>n</code> documents will be <code>O(n)</code> without index, as it requires to scan all documents sequentially.<br>
There are many types of indexes in the litterature. One of the most common index structure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-Tree</a>: it is the default in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/indexes-types.html">PostgreSQL</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/">MongoDB</a>. This index structure performs in <code>O(log n)</code> in average, which guarantees a very fast access time even in large</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a practical point of view, B-trees, therefore, guarantee an access time of less than 10 ms even for extremely large datasets.<br>
—Dr. Rudolf Bayer, inventor of the B-tree</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In CouchDB, the indexes are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+ Trees</a>, a structure derived from the B-Trees.<br>
The indexed data are document fields. When indexed, it is called keys, and are organized as a tree, with the documents stored in the leafs nodes. So, finding a particular document means browsing the tree, from the root to the leaf.<br>
The keys are organized by their value: if we suppose a node with two keys <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code> and three children, the leftmost child node must have all its keys inferior to <code>k1</code>, the righmost child’s keys superior to <code>k2</code>, and the middle child’s keys between <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code>.</p>
<p>In the Figure below, borrowed from the <a href="https://guide.couchdb.org/editions/1/en/btree.html">CouchDB guide</a>, you see that each node has three keys, but in the CouchDB implementation, a B+ Tree node can actually store more than 1600 keys.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This design is very efficient for range queries: in the example above, a query looking for documents having an indexed field between 1 and 3 will browse the tree to find the first document position (with a key of 1) and then get the next two contiguous documents.</p>
<p>ℹ️ In  the following, we refer about “B-Tree”, that can indifferently be applied to B-Tree or B+ Tree: the main concepts remain the same in both cases and their differences are not relevant in this discussion.</p>
<p>Traps with indexes</p>
<p>Indexing data is not as easy as it might look. There is not one way to index, which must depend on you data model and the queries you need to run for your application. But, as you will see in this article, keeping in mind how the indexes - here the B-Tree - work in background helps a lot!</p>
<p>ℹ️ Each database engine has its own way to index data with its own specificities. Therefore, we do not focus on the indexing itself but rather on the common traps that you might encounter when designing indexes for an application, which can be applied to most of the databases, as long as a B-Tree is involved.</p>
 Pagination 
<p>When there is too much data to handle at once on the client side, it is good to implement pagination. This consists of splitting a <code>Q</code> query into several <code>Qi</code> sub-queries so the client can progressively retrieve data and update the UI accordingly.</p>
<p>ℹ️ From a UX perspective, there are different strategies to implement pagination. Typically if you data is rendered as a list, you can either have a ‘Load more’ button at the bottom or automatically detect the need to fetch more data when the user is at the end of the list.</p>
<p>We focus here on how to split <code>Q</code> and the consequences on the performances.</p>
<p>A simple way to do it consists of combining a <code>limit</code> and <code>skip</code> parameters to the query.</p>
<p>💡 Those parameters are available in <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html">CouchDB</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.skip/">MongoDB</a> or <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/queries-limit.html">PostgreSQL</a> (in SQL, <code>skip</code> is called <code>offset</code>).</p>
<p>Let’s assume <code>Q</code> retrieves 1000 documents. You can implement pagination by running <code>Q</code> 10 times by setting a <code>limit</code> to 100 and <code>skip</code>  the number of already retrieved documents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>⚠️ This pagination method does not scale and can be very bad for performances! Let’s see why.</p>
<p>This method actually breaks the B-Tree indexing logic: there is no way to efficiently skip a fixed number of data in such a tree, so skipping documents consists of normally running the <code>Q</code> query and then splitting the results starting from the <code>skip</code> number of documents, until the <code>limit</code>.<br>
Thus, instead of taking benefit from the tree traversal to efficiently start each <code>Qi</code>, the <code>skip</code> forces the query to start each query from the first document of the tree, and perform a sequential scan from there.</p>
<p>In the schema below are represented the scanned documents for <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, <code>Q3</code>, assuming a <code>limit=2</code> to simplify the drawing.<br>
<code>Q1</code> needs to scan 2 docs, <code>Q2</code> 4 docs and <code>Q3</code> 6 docs.<br>
The boxes in grey are the documents scanned by <code>Qi</code>  and the boxes in green the documents actually returned. We can see that each <code>Qi</code> with <code>i &gt; 1</code> needs to scan useless documents, this behaviour being worse for each new query.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fortunately, there are simple and efficient ways to perform pagination.</p>
<p>In CouchDB, you can use <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html#pagination">bookmarks</a>, that you can see as a tree pointer to indicate where to start the query. This is simply a string returned by each  <code>Qi</code> that you can pass as a parameter for the next query:</p>
<p></p>
<p>By doing so, each <code>Qi</code>  starts at the end of the previous query, avoiding unecessary scan:</p>
<p></p>
<p>💡 This bookmark system does not exist in MongoDB or PostgreSQL. However, you can still benefit from efficient pagination by using the last document key returned by the previous query. As the tree is organized by keys, <code>Qi</code>  will be correctly positioned in the tree, that is, at the end of the previous query. See this <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">article</a> for more details about a SQL approach and this article for a <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@arpitbhayani/fast-and-efficient-pagination-in-mongodb-9095flbqr#approach-2-using-id-and-limit">MongoDB</a> approach.</p>
 Non-contiguous rows 
<p>When designing indexes, it might help to keep in mind how the B-Tree are structured, notably when dealing with multi-fields indexes.<br>
Indeed, if you need to query several fields of a same index, you might perform sub-optimal queries if you are not careful.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example to illustrate how such situation could occur. <code>Q</code> is a query for a To-do application that retrieves tasks by their creation date and category, respectively <code>created_at</code> and <code>category</code>.</p>
<p>To do this, you first create an index on those two fields, in this order. Then, you perform a query, for instance to get all the tasks made in 2020 in the "work" category. With <code>cozy-client</code>, this can be expressed like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is represented a sample of the scanned index data: it starts from <code>2019-01-01</code> and stops at <code>2020-01-01</code> as the the data is sorted by its first row, the <code>created_at</code>.<br>
Then, for each scanned row of this interval, the entry is returned if it has a "work" category. The returned rows for the query are represented in green.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The problem here is that you might scan unnecessary rows: in the example above, you can see a “sport” task made the 2019-01-03. It is not a big deal if the "work” category represents the majority of the tasks, but it is a pity if there are only a few of them. Imagine you have 1000 tasks for this year, with only one being in a "work” category: you’ll have to scan the 1000 tasks to only find one element, so 99.9% of the scanning is actually unnecessary.</p>
<p>In order to make this query efficient, you need to make an index that will organize data in contiguous rows.</p>
<p>Let’s take back our example, but this time by changing the index order: you first index  <code>category</code> and then <code>created_at</code>.</p>
<p>The index data is now organized as follow:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, the very same query can be efficiently processed: the "work” category is first evaluated in the B+ Tree, which return all the relevant rows, sorted by <code>created_at</code>. Then, the range is easily found now that all the rows are contiguous and only the returned rows are scanned.</p>
<p>💡 When creating an index, carefully think about how your data will be organized and which query will need to perfom. The performances can dramatically vary depending on your design, with several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>💡 When dealing with a query with both equality and range, you should first index the equality field. If you are interested about this, you can learn more <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/searching-for-ranges/greater-less-between-tuning-sql-access-filter-predicates">here</a> for a SQL approach.</p>
<p>However, it is not always possible to keep this design: you might need a more advanced concept called partial index.</p>
 Partial index 
<p>In the previous section, we saw that a query should be able to be run on contiguous rows in an index to maximize performances. However, this is not always possible when dealing with more complex queries.</p>
<p>We introduce here partial indexes. They are used to express predicates that will be evaluated at the indexing time. Data is then indexed only if it matches the predicates.</p>
<p>This can actually be useful in several situations:</p>
 
 Queries without contiguous rows 
 Queries with existence predicates 
 Queries with constant values 
 
<p>Let’s dig in these cases and see how it can be useful!</p>
<p>Queries without contiguous rows<br>
Let us consider a query looking for tasks created after 2019, that are NOT in the “work” category:</p>
<p></p>
<p>⚠️ The rows cannot be contiguous in the index because of the negative predicate, <code>$neq</code> (for not-equal). The index will have to scan all the rows to find those without the “work” category and filter out the ones without the correct date range.</p>
<p>By using a partial index with the negative predicate, this query becomes efficient as only the tasks without a “work” category will be indexed, by the <code>created_at</code> field.</p>
<p>The query is now:</p>
<p></p>
<p>💡 Note it is no longer necessary to index the <code>category</code> field: therefore, the index will be smaller, more efficient and will take less place on disk.</p>
<p>Queries with existence predicates<br>
The <code>category</code> field might be optionnal in your To-do application. In this case, it might be useful to check its existence:</p>
<p></p>
<p>⚠️ This query will typically return nothing in CouchDB. This is because a document will be indexed only if the indexed fields exists in the document. So a task without a set <code>category</code> will never be indexed.</p>
<p>A partial index solves the issue, as it will simply evaluate the existence of the field on indexing time:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Queries with constant values</p>
<p>You might need to retrieve documents based on a field value that you know will never change. For instance, you might have a <code>status</code>  field that is set to “ARCHIVED” when the task is archived.<br>
To retrieve these tasks, you can directly use a partial index:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this case, a partial index is useful to reduce the index size as you avoid to index the <code>status</code> field.</p>
<p>💡 Lightweight indexes take less space on disk and are more efficient both for lookups and updates, so this optimization could be worth it if you have a lot of data to handle.</p>
<p>💡 Partial indexes are useful to keep contiguous rows in indexes, to use existence predicates and to decrease indexes size. Depending on your use-cases and data volumetry, you could benefit a lot from partial indexes!</p>
<p>💡 In SQL, you can create partial index simply by specifying a <code>WHERE</code> clause in the index definition. See how to do it with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/indexes-partial.html">PostgreSQL</a>. In <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-partial/">MongoDB,</a> the principle and syntax is quite similar to <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html#find-partial-indexes">CouchDB</a>.</p>
 Cozy Contacts: a real-world use-case 
<p>Theory is great, but let us illustrate what we discussed by a concrete example and how the performances dramatically improved in our <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-contacts">Contact</a> application, thanks to partial indexes.</p>
<p>In Cozy, there are several ways to import contacts: you can typically import them directly from a vcard file or use the <a href="https://github.com/konnectors/cozy-konnector-google">Google konnector</a> to automatically synchronize contacts with your google account. And, because Cozy is an open-source platform, anyone can come up with a new way to import contacts, potentially with their own contact format.<br>
Because of this, we implemented an asynchronous <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/apps/#services">service</a> that periodically checks when new contacts are added, and migrate them in the expected format for the Cozy Contacts app.</p>
<p>However, because this service is asynchronous, we cannot expect to have all contacts migrated when the user opens the application. So, we ended up with two queries run to retrieve contacts:</p>
 
 A query to retrieve migrated contacts (<code>Q1</code>) 
 A query to retrieve non-migrated contacts (<code>Q2</code>) 
 
<p>Both those queries were checking the existence of a special document field for each contact to know if the contact is migrated or not. However, as we previously discussed, a missing field cannot be indexed in CouchDB. Therefore, <code>Q2</code> was actually making a full-scan index to evaluate the non-existence of this field. As a result, this query was taking a lot of time to complete, as soon as the user had a lot of contacts.<br>
And the worst part is that <code>Q2</code> actually returns nothing most of the time, as the contacts are migrated only once!</p>
<p>So, <code>Q2</code> was an excellent candidate for partial indexes: we implemented <code>Q2.1</code> that finds contacts with the missing field through the partial index: this way, the document is still indexed when the field is not here. You can find its actual implementation <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-contacts/blob/f562ff661bf3957d6af807d520886c117f580c0d/src/helpers/queries.js#L70-L99">here</a>.</p>
<p>The diagram below show the performance impact by comparing the execution time of the three queries in the most common scenario: <code>Q1</code> returns 1000 contacts while <code>Q2</code> and <code>Q2.1</code> returns nothing.<br>
<code>Q2</code> complexity is <code>O(n)</code> with <code>n</code>  the total number of contacts, while both <code>Q1</code> and <code>Q2.1</code> are <code>O(log n)</code>. Note <code>Q2.1</code> does not even appear in the diagram because it only takes few ms to perform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, using a partial index improved the overall queries performances by a factor 2 for 1K contacts, and by a factor 8 for 10K contacts. Neat!</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We hope this little index tour gave you some insights about performances and data indexing.<br>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>The recent SolarWinds incident has shed a light on an area of cybersecurity that is not frequently in focus. Better said, it is “again has shed a light”, if we remember the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-heartbleed-bug-in-openssl-probably-the-most-serious-security-flaw-in-years" title="Hearbleed incident">Heartbleed incident</a> that happened back in 2014. Back then, my colleague Alexei Balaganski wrote in a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/lessons-learned-from-the-heartbleed-incident" title="blog post">blog post</a> that “software developers (both commercial and OSS) […] should not rely blindly on third-party libraries, but treat them as a part of critical infrastructure”.</p>
<p>What we need is a defined approach and consequent enforcement of what, in a slightly awkward manner, is called C-SCRM or Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management. This concept includes enforcing software security from the very beginning of its development cycle. It is not only about cloud services and COTS (commercial of the shelf) software but applies to any type of software that is procured or self-developed, including software in things and devices as well.</p>
<p>Consequently, we must extend the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/zero-trust-nowhere-near-the-end-of-the-story-yet" title="Zero Trust paradigm">Zero Trust paradigm</a> beyond networks, security systems, and identities and apply it to all types of software. Don’t trust software, period.</p>
 What does Zero Trust stand for? 
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/zero-trust-as-a-concept-for-trust-and-security" title="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</a> has been defined over 10 years ago as a concept that focused on removing implicit trust from network architectures and enforcing strict identity verification and access controls for every user or device. “Trust but verify” might be a popular saying, but the motto of Zero Trust has always been “Don’t trust. Verify”. This is the quintessence of the Zero Trust approach that has <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero_trust_paradigm" title="evolved since then">evolved since then</a> to other areas of security, beyond the network, including identity and device security.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a paradigm, not a tool. It helps in architecting cybersecurity infrastructures and in defining concepts for operations. Given that security needs to be verified and enforced in multiple places – as the concept states – it involves a range of technologies to implement such a Zero Trust paradigm in an IT infrastructure.</p>
 What happened in the SolarWinds incident? 
<p>The <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/understanding_solarwinds" title="SolarWinds incident">SolarWinds incident</a> was an attack that became public in December 2020 but had been running at least for several months beforehand. The installers for SolarWinds’ Orion monitoring platform had been backdoored. Unfortunately, that software is (or has been) running in many organizations, including major cloud data centers. Several other software vendors like Microsoft and FireEye have reported that they’ve been breached through the use of SolarWinds products.</p>
<p>What this attack demonstrated is that even large software vendors with strong cybersecurity background can be compromised due to the inherent software and cybersecurity supply chain risks. Unfortunately, most organizations trust the software they procure and use, instead of verifying its security. And, unfortunately, verification is not easy to do and has its limits. But it can be done, it must be done, and it results in increased security. However, some products you can purchase might go as far as explicitly demand that customers disable their antimalware tools before installing them. This is the complete opposite of the idea of Zero Trust.</p>
 What is Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management? 
<p>Before looking at the specifics of software security (secure software, securing software), this leads to the broader theme of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/resch/cscrm-is-essential-for-digital-business" title="C-SCRM">C-SCRM</a>. This discipline applies the broader Supply Chain Risk Management to software and IT services and addresses the inherent cybersecurity risks. This is not only about using SaaS services or COTS software, but also about software in connected devices and things such as sensors, machines, control devices, etc.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Risk Management looks at the risks regarding both the reliability of supply chains and risks and damages derived from suppliers, from misconduct (e.g. child labor) to quality issues.</p>
<p>C-SCRM tries to assess and mitigate the risks that come from IT, particularly software, specifically regarding the availability of IT and – as the name implies – security.</p>
 What does C-SCRM include? 
<p>Going into detail would be beyond the scope of this post. However, you may want to listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve2_2020_06_02_schuetze2" title="this talk">this talk</a> of my colleague Christopher Schuetze on the necessary components of an effective C-SCRM approach.</p>
 How to apply Zero Trust on Software Procurement 
<p>In essence, we can’t trust software, in whichever form we receive and use it without validating its integrity and security first. Software security must be consequently enforced and verified, including measures such as</p>
 
 Secure design and coding practices: While concepts like “secure by design” are being discussed for many years, they are still not implemented everywhere. Now is the latest time to start working on it. This also includes modern software testing principles. 
 Software composition analysis: Any reused code such as open-source libraries must be constantly tracked. Where is it used? Which version is in use? Are there known vulnerabilities and patches for them? Which coding practices are in use by the suppliers of this code? 
 Static and dynamic code analysis: There is a range of tools for static and dynamic code security, which can be used to identify security issues in code. These practices should be extended to areas like API design as well. 
 Organizational controls: This all must become part of the ISMS (Information Security Management System), with defined and enforced controls. 
 Security analytics: Last not least, security analytics can help to identify anomalies in software. While operational analytics has been a part of DevOps for years, it should be expanded to cover security telemetry and forensics as well – such integrated platforms are already available. 
 
<p>A good summary of this is provided by my colleagues Matthias Reinwarth and Alexei Balaganski in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/post_solarwinds_security" title="episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast">episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast</a>.</p>
 How to check for Software Security 
<p>To quote Alexei Balaganski again, from <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/lessons-learned-from-the-heartbleed-incident" title="what he wrote backin 2014">what he wrote back in 2014</a> as a recommendation following the Heartbleed incident:</p>
<p>“One of those approaches, unfortunately neglected by many software vendors, is hardening applications using static code analysis. Surely, antimalware tools, firewalls and other network security tools are an important part of any security strategy, but one has to understand that all of them are inherently reactive. The only truly proactive approach to application security is making applications themselves more reliable.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, code analysis tools […] don’t get much hype in media, but there have been amazing advances in this area since the years when I’ve personally been involved in large software development projects. “</p>
<p>There is a lot of solutions available to improve code security and mitigate risks in the software supply chain. It is about using these the right way, integrated into a holistic C-SCRM approach. You’ll find further information in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/post_solarwinds_security" title="episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast">episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast</a> on post-SolarWinds software security strategies.</p>
 The extended Zero Trust approach: Don’t blindly trust software 
<p>Zero Trust must be extended and cover software security, for software in any form (embedded, COTS, as-a-service) and regardless of whether it’s home-grown or externally procured. “Don’t trust. Verify” – this is as essential for software as for identity, devices, or networks.</p>

  <p>Tip: This tutorial is part of our series on integrating Okta with popular infrastructure as a code solution. If you’re not into Chef, check out our <a>Ansible</a>, <a>Puppet</a>, and <a>Terraform</a> tutorials.</p>

<p>Chef cookbooks are a great way to manage infrastructure at scale. However, like other configuration management tools, Chef works best when cookbooks don’t change often. This is easy to accomplish in typical server setup and configuration tasks like install Nginx and tweak conf file. However, it can get tricky with server managing server accounts and credentials as people join or leave your ops team and as you need to rotate server keys.</p>

<p>To tackle identity in servers with automation, Ops teams usually take two approaches: push SSH keys for every user or integrate servers with an LDAP or AD.</p>

<p>Pushing SSH Keys for every admin on every server has significant security implications and requires a lot of effort when an admin leaves the company or when keys need to be rotated. And that can go bad as soon as someone accidentally shares a secret key.</p>

<p>Integrating a large server infrastructure with LDAP or AD – usually done using PAM modules – requires a lot of work. LDAP and AD are monolithic – built to run on the intranet – and not good when you have servers in multiple places, requiring site-to-site VPNs, among other hoops. Do you want to run an HA middleware service blocking your ability to scale in the cloud? This is a pain point no Ops Engineer wants.</p>

<p>However, there’s a third approach: integrate Cloud SSO to secure servers. In this tutorial, we will do that by seamlessly injecting Okta into your Chef Infrastructure as Code to effectively <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/07/shift-identity-left-secure-devops-automation-with-okta/">Shift Identity Left</a>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: To follow this tutorial, you need to have an Advanced Server Access (ASA) team provisioned from your Okta Org. If you don’t have an existing ASA team, you can sign up for free <a href="https://app.scaleft.com/p/signupV2">here</a>, which requires an Okta Administrator to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/setup/getting-started.htm">configure</a>.</p>

 Create a project and get an enrollment token in ASA 

<p>In Okta ASA, projects work as a collection of servers that share the same access and authorization controls. In a project, you define which users and groups from Okta can access your servers, when they can do so, and what they are allowed to do in the server (i.e. run only certain commands). Any changes in your project (users, group assignments, authorization) are periodically updated in your servers (providing idempotency for identity and access management).</p>

<p>Servers enroll in your project to apply the same security configuration using an ASA agent with a project enrollment token. The ASA agent periodically checks for updates in Okta to update the server configuration.</p>

<p>To get your servers running with Okta, let’s create a project and get an enrollment token:</p>

 
   Access Okta ASA as Administrator. 
   Click Projects and then select or create a new project. 
   Click Enrollment &gt; Create Enrollment Token. 
   Enter a name (i.e. <code>chef-token</code>) and click Submit. 
   Copy the enrollment token: 
 

<p></p>

 Download and configure cookbook 

<p>In your terminal, navigate to your chef home and clone our sample cookbook:</p>

   <code>cd $CHEF_REPO/cookbooks
git clone https://github.com/okta-server-asa/asa-chef-example.git
cd asa-chef-example
</code>   

<p>Optionally, review the cookbook contents:</p>

 
   The <code>recipes/install-asa.rb</code> is the default recipe of the cookbook. It:
     
       Installs the ASA server agent using the appropriate package for your distro (<code>node['platform_family']</code>) 
       Defines the name of your server in ASA (canonical name) 
       Enrolls your server into the ASA project using the enrollment token you got in the previous section 
       Starts the ASA server agent 
     
   
   The <code>recipes/uninstall-asa.rb</code> uninstalls the ASA server agent from your machine. 
   The <code>kitchen.yml</code> provides specs for testing this sample cookbook in Chef’s Kitchen (with VirtualBox and Vagrant). 
   The <code>test/integration/default/default_test.rb</code> provides specs for validating the sample cookbook. 
   The <code>attributes/default.rb</code> file stores the enrollment token for registration in ASA. 
 

<p>Edit the <code>attributes/default.rb</code> file, replacing <code>ENROLLMENT_TOKEN</code> with the token from ASA:</p>

   <code>default['asa_enrollment_token'] = 'ENROLLMENT_TOKEN'
</code>   

<p>To confirm your configuration has no typos, enter <code>cookstyle attributes/default.rb</code>:</p>

   <code># cookstyle attributes/default.rb
Inspecting 1 file
1 file inspected, no offenses detected
</code>   

 Test cookbook 

<p>Now that we have the cookbook set, let’s see it in action. To do this, I’ll use <a href="https://kitchen.ci/">Chef Test Kitchen</a> as a harness environment, and apply the cookbook to multiple Virtual Machines.</p>

<p>Tip: The sample cookbook has a script (<code>kitchen.yml</code>) that sets our test environment automatically using VirtualBox VMs managed with Vagrant.</p>

 Launch test kitchen 

<p>In your environment with Chef workstation, install VirtualBox and Hashicorp Vagrant. (If you have a mac and homebrew, you can run the commands):</p>

   <code>brew install virtualbox --cask
brew install vagrant --cask
</code>   

<p>Enter <code>VBoxManage list bridgedifs | grep Name</code> to get your computer network interface name that will be used by the test VMs (ideally, a network interface with the internet. In my case, its en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort):</p>

   <code># VBoxManage list bridgedifs | grep Name
Name:            en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)
Name:            bridge0
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-bridge0
Name:            llw0
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-llw0
Name:            en12: USB 10/100/1000 LAN
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-en12
</code>   

<p>Edit and save the <code>kitchen.yml</code> file:</p>

 
   In lines 25-29, define the list of servers/VMs you want to test. You can remove a specific server or distro by adding a comment (<code>#+ space</code>). Example: <code># - name: centos-7</code>. 
   In line 35, paste the network interface name that will be used to bridge network connections. For example: <code>- ["public_network", { bridge: "en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)" }]</code> 
 

<p>To set up your kitchen, enter: <code>kitchen create</code></p>

<p>Chef Test Kitchen will download and launch all VMs in VirtualBox. This may take some time.</p>

<p>To confirm your kitchen is running, enter: <code>kitchen list</code></p>

<p>The list will show you the VMs with the last action Created:</p>

   <code># kitchen list
Instance                    Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action  Last Error
asa-chef-ubuntu-1804        Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
asa-chef-centos-7           Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
asa-chef-debian-107         Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
asa-chef-opensuse-leap-152  Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
asa-chef-oracle-82          Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
</code>   

 Run cookbook in the test kitchen 

<p>To install and enroll your servers on ASA, enter <code>kitchen converge</code>.</p>

<p>Chef will execute the cookbook and enroll all your servers in ASA.</p>

<p>In ASA, you will see your server enrolled in your project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>To confirm the recipe worked, enter <code>kitchen verify</code>:</p>

   <code>-----&gt; Verifying &lt;asa-chef-oracle-82&gt;...
       Loaded tests from {:path=&gt;".asa-chef-example.test.integration.default"} 

Profile: tests from {:path=&gt;"/asa-chef-example/test/integration/default"} (tests from {:path=&gt;"asa-chef-example.test.integration.default"})

     ✔  is expected to be running

Test Summary: 3 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
       Finished verifying &lt;asa-chef-oracle-82&gt; (0m1.09s).
</code>   

<p>At this moment, your servers are enrolled in ASA. That means you can access your servers with users and groups from Okta associated with your project.</p>

 Test access to servers with Okta 

<p>Now that all servers are enrolled in Okta, let’s access the servers as a user:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/sft.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610060131465000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1omaR8RXzvDBwm3OddiJVk">Install the ASA agent in your workstation</a> (required to access servers as a user): <code>brew install okta-advanced-server-access --cask</code></p>

<p>To set up the ASA agent, enter <code>sft enroll</code> and follow the instructions in the screen.</p>

<p>To see your servers, enter <code>sft list-servers</code>.</p>

   <code># sft list-servers
Waiting on browser...
Browser step completed successfully.
HOSTNAME                    OS_TYPE  PROJECT_NAME         ACCESS_ADDRESS

asa-chef-oracle-82          linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.105
</code>   

<p>To ssh into your server, enter <code>sft ssh &lt;name-of-your-server&gt;</code>:</p>

   <code># sft ssh asa-chef-ubuntu-1804
/home/frederico_hakamine #  
</code>   

<p>Note: Wait… what Okta ASA does for the login?</p>

 
   Okta ASA secures access to Linux and Windows servers in SSH and RDP connections using the server agent (the same one that enrolled the server in your project earlier). 
   The ASA server agent, in addition to subscribing your server to a project, also works alongside native OS features such as sudo, users, and openssh to control access during runtime and to capture any login events for audit inspection. 
   Because the agent is light and does not require firewalls and monolith LDAP or privileged access servers, it can be easily distributed across any infrastructure (IaaS, VM, or physical) and embedded in your DevOps tools. 
   To grant users access to servers, ASA operates a programmable Certificate Authority service as part of its SaaS, that issues ephemeral SSH Client Certificates for each authenticated and authorized request. The keys are issued only after ensuring both user and his/her device complies with the organization’s security policies. 
   The use of ephemeral keys provides many benefits. It eliminates the use of static keys and credentials for server access, ensures that both users and machines are audited before any new ssh connection, simplifies access revocation, eliminates the risk of “super account overuse”, and simplifies access audit. 
 

 What’s next? 

<p>After testing the cookbook on your Chef Kitchen, you can use it in your Chef Infra. To do so, tweak the cookbook (i.e. store the enrollment token on chef-vault or a data-bag), upload (<code>knife upload asa-chef-example</code>), and add the cookbook to specific roles and environments within your infrastructure:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can also turn on additional features in Okta ASA, such as setup sudo grants, time-based access, use of bastion hosts, and SSH session capture just to name a few. All these features reduce the load on your cookbooks and allow provide consistent account configuration across multiple servers.</p>

Before we dive into explaining this amazing opportunity, we don’t want to waste your time. So,&nbsp;if you don’t have Australian&nbsp;citizenship or&nbsp;permanent residency,&nbsp;or if you are representing a&nbsp;recruitment agency or an&nbsp;offshore/provider, then this&nbsp;is not for you. We understand you may be an awesome candidate, or have access to great candidates, but we will not consider such applications at this time.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Lead&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;team, where you can help shape the API-of-Me.




 




What is the <a href="https://dev.meeco.me/">API-of-Me</a> you might ask?




 




It is an emerging platform that enables the collection, protection and exchange of personal data. Our main objective is to provide a suite of developer tools and APIs to companies and organizations to allow them to build privacy first solutions.




 




A&nbsp;secure data enclave that allows&nbsp;people&nbsp;to keep their data safe and share information with&nbsp;the people and organisations they trust.&nbsp;We are passionate about building a new economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organizations enter a win-win relationship by building mutual trust in how data is collected, protected and shared.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a>&nbsp;to learn more.




 




Don’t hesitate to apply, no matter what your background is. We would like to build a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia and Belgium, and collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, each with a unique personal data story.




 About the&nbsp;Role 




We are a global team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK.&nbsp;The platform team currently consists of 17,&nbsp;responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and documenting several services that, all together, form the backbone of our platform.




 




Currently our technology stack consists mainly of several Ruby on Rails, Elixir and Java components for the backend services.&nbsp;For&nbsp;frontend,&nbsp;we primarily&nbsp;use&nbsp;Javascript and Dart for smartphone and&nbsp;decentralised applications, based upon blockchain&nbsp;and distributed ledger&nbsp;technology.




 




We’re a company that embraces innovation, so it is likely that&nbsp;our&nbsp;technology stack will&nbsp;continue to evolve and&nbsp;change. We are not averse to adding other technologies if the need arises for specific services.




 




We take pride in building software that is easy to understand, clean, well-structured and properly tested. We have formed our own opinions on how to write good code that are a result of programming for more than two decades. Sometimes, we have even found ourselves going against the popular vote on several topics.




 





  We favour the explicit over the implicit  We treat frameworks as tools and not as an unquestionable authority  We embrace the relational database and its possibilities and as such treat it as a first order citizen.   





 




The following&nbsp;will&nbsp;help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 





  Being a technical leader; mentoring, triaging problems, offering a guiding hand  Coming up with a detailed plan on how to approach high-level requirements including tasks and&nbsp;estimations  Supporting the team to allocate and distribute the work according to individual capabilites  Designing and implementing&nbsp;new services&nbsp;with business logic called from&nbsp;existing &amp; new&nbsp;endpoints  Investigating bug reports that inevitably occur, helping a colleague identify problems  Reviewing and approving Pull Requests  Implementing data integrations to&nbsp;enable end-users access public&nbsp;and&nbsp;private&nbsp;data, this might include open banking,&nbsp;social, health, wearable, weather, travel or IoT&nbsp;data  Working&nbsp;with the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;Standards&nbsp;for&nbsp;implementations for distributed ledger&nbsp;implementations including Verifiable Credentials, Distributed Identity including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>  Working on leading-edge payments solutions including micro-payments and tokens  Contributing to a more transparent, open and trust-based personal data eco-system.    





 About You 




We are looking for someone who has a deep understanding of how to write RESTful resources exposed as APIs, cares about clean code (a lot) and is ready to learn (a lot). It is a big plus if you have experience writing these web-based applications in Ruby on Rails and/or in building decentralized applications in blockchain technologies.




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the center, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical solutions. Google won’t help you as much in this case as it requires a combination of existing tech and emerging solutions. One class of technology that we are exploring and see great potential is in the distributed ledger space. A good understanding and professional experience building decentralised applications or dealing with DLT is a big plus.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most.




 




In addition to established experience as a developer, we expect that you have&nbsp;at least&nbsp;2+&nbsp;years experience in steering a team. using an agile methodology, be it scrum or a derivative.




 




You&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;support&nbsp;our executive team (Technology, Product, Design and Commercial&nbsp;Officers) in&nbsp;writing&nbsp;up&nbsp;technical proposals, along with translating Meeco’s technical&nbsp;vision&nbsp;into practical goals that support the&nbsp;commercialisation of&nbsp;our&nbsp;products.&nbsp;




 




The&nbsp;following is our crazy wish-list. It is not&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;that you have all this experience, but the more proven competencies you have will increase your chances of success in the role:




 





  You have taken lead on directing and implementing solutions to complex, unbounded (technical) problems based on limited scope&nbsp;  You have a track record of setting direction for teammates  You know how to take steps in improving the quality of existing and future software  You are comfortable communicating your ideas both verbally as well as written. We love to create diagrams to describe future systems.  You have used more than one programming language to build software, which can&nbsp;of course include&nbsp;hobby&nbsp;and passion&nbsp;projects  We have a soft spot for functional programming, so maybe you have too  We build both&nbsp;backend&nbsp;and frontend&nbsp;applications, so&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;any relevant frontend programming experience, especially with JavaScript, TypeScript and/or Angularjs&nbsp;would be awesome  You have used languages with built-in concurrency models like Go, Erlang, or Elixir  If you have a language you love, tell us about it!  You have a good understanding of what goes on in a RDBMS, especially Postgresql. You are familiar with devops&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Azure&nbsp;would be a bonus.&nbsp;  You know how to use Docker and Kubernetes.  





 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have a team to show you the ropes. A good set of solid programming skills, natural leadership and to care about our mission is&nbsp;all you need.




 




You might have a&nbsp;computer science or related degree,&nbsp;or you might not. This is not what we are about. We care about what you know now and how you are improving yourself every day.




 




This is a job where we&nbsp;support&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;However, we do have an office at Stone &amp; Chalk at Docklands in Melbourne. Given the leadership and mentoring aspects of the role,– we would like you to be in the office at least three days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.&nbsp;




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and self directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed.&nbsp;We love you asking for help!




 What We Offer 




We pay a competitive start-up&nbsp;package&nbsp;based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 What We Have Achieved

 The GiD Report#146 — The Elon effect and the need for Trusted Communities <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-145-ripples-sec-response-and-signal-s-moderation-problem-4a51b3402a06">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Elon ❤&nbsp;Bitcoin  Podcast highlights  This week in Big&nbsp;Tech  The need for Trusted Communities  Chart of the week (Big Tech&nbsp;profits)  Stuff happens   1. The news everyone is talking about — Elon Musk goes big into Bitcoin (with&nbsp;Tesla). <p>From <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">their SEC filing</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a>)</p><blockquote>Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon&nbsp;receipt.</blockquote>Photo: Pewdiepie/YouTube<p>So not only are corporations and institutions leaning into Bitcoin and crypto, you’ll be able to buy a Tesla with&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>It’s another giant leap toward mainstream adoption.</p><p>My Wall Street had some thoughts on how such moves might impact potential regulation:</p><blockquote>I think the most bullish thing is to have at least one large public American company with significant holdings as the government undertakes writing regulations. It’s super bullish to have the government writing regs knowing that they don’t want to crush the market value of significant corporate holdings. It’s different if they think they’re just crushing drug dealers and money launderers.</blockquote><p>Makes sense.</p> 2. This week in Big Tech — podcast highlights edition. <p>Greg Kidd on breaking up Facebook, Lina Khan, and the best thing about&nbsp;America:</p> 3.

Dynamics in groups often mirror those of peer-to-peer messaging apps: People share, spread, and receive information directly to and from their closest contacts, whom they typically see as reliable sources. To make things easier for those looking to stoke political division, groups provide a menu of potential targets organized by issue and even location; bad actors can create fake profiles or personas tailored to the interests of the audiences they intend to infiltrate. This allows them to seed their own content in a group and also to repurpose its content for use on other platforms.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-groups-are-destroying-america/">Facebook Groups Are Destroying America</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knew-calls-for-violence-plagued-groups-now-plans-overhaul-11612131374">Facebook Knew Calls for Violence Plagued ‘Groups,’ Now Plans&nbsp;Overhaul</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/technology/how-to-fix-facebook-groups.html">NYTimes: How to fix Facebook&nbsp;Groups</a>  <p>Discord has its own trust&nbsp;issues:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/discord-scammers-lure-users-to-fake-exchange-with-promise-of-free-bitcoin">Discord Scammers Lure Users to Fake Exchange With Promise of Free Bitcoin — CoinDesk</a>   5.

					 <p>Situations constantly evolve from internal execution, stakeholder interactions, external collaboration, and more. I’ve seen first-hand toxic cultures that drive talented people away and supportive cultures that retain incredible talent despite all odds. I’ve seen how cultures can lead to transformative innovation and stagnant inaction. I’ve seen individuals change because of the culture they’re immersed in, and I’ve seen individuals change the cultures they’re a part of for the better. Ultimately, an organization’s culture determines its destiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At Trinsic, we’re addressing one of society’s hardest problems—establishing trust. It’s easy in person to prove who we are on, but digitally it’s impossible. That creates a trust deficit that costs our economy billions of dollars. We believe that as trust increases, the world and its useful services will be more accessible to people who need them. In order to tackle this, we need brilliant, passionate people and a culture where those people will thrive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At Trinsic, that culture is one of ownership, building, and friendship.</p>

					 <p>Owners are different than renters, borrowers, or hired guns¹. Owners are motivated intrinsically to make things happen and to solve problems. Ownership opens the mind to new possibilities, causes people to learn and grow faster than they otherwise could, and is extremely fulfilling. But it’s also challenging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Owners know what they’re in charge of and are accountable for their work. Owners are ambitious and motivated by the mission. Owners seek to win together with their colleagues for the good of the mission, not to get credit for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at Trinsic has equity in the company. That means everyone is literally an owner and is incentivized to act in the best interest of the firm as a whole. Everyone, from the founders to new interns, has meaningful decision-making authority over their domains of ownership which are transparent to everyone.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Building 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Builders are skillful craftspeople who take intentional care to create. We build for the long-term in an iterative, step-by-step fashion. We all take skillful, thoughtful action toward creating long-lasting results. We are calculated, action-oriented do-ers and keep our eye single to the mission as we build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at Trinsic is an individual contributor. There will never be roles which are strictly management (at least, not for a very long time); engineering leaders will never stop writing code, and business leaders will never stop developing the business. Decisions are made quickly, and people are never blocked from taking action.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Friendship 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Friends are enjoyable to work with, and at Trinsic we’re friends with one another. We are eager to befriend new kinds of people because we believe humanity is beautiful, and different people and perspectives will make us better. Friends are inclusive, honest, ethical, and supportive. Friends are trustworthy and communicate clearly about work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at Trinsic is encouraged to develop relationships with others on the team. As a remote team, we are intentional about developing these relationships in work and play. Deceit, harassment, intimidation, and other inappropriate behaviors are intolerable. We care about and root for each other, both professionally and personally.</p>

					 <p>Startups can be likened to other kinds of difficult journeys. There are obstacles and challenges along the way to a worthwhile outcome. Some kinds of journeys are challenging but predictable.

<p>M-TRIBES integrates IDnow AutoIdent into its M-TOOLS technology platform in order to enable companies, in the areas of car sharing, car rental, urban mobility (including free-floating sharing of scooters, e-scooters, e-bikes) or fleet management, to use digital identification of users. The digital identification component verifies users in the smartphone app or web application to ensure that they are who they say they are and authorizes the use of the service. IDnow AutoIdent can be used to confirm the customers age or validity of ID or driver’s license documents in a legally compliant manner. IDnow is a leader in digital identity verification with artificial intelligence (AI) trained with millions of data points to securely verify potentially 7 billion customers from 193 different countries. Through the collaboration, M-TRIBES ensures that the identity management component of the software platform can be deployed to customers in the international mobility industry.</p>
<p>“More and more business processes in the mobility and transport sector are taking place digitally. Innovative, customer-oriented mobility concepts and services require simple and reliable handling that guarantees security for all parties. This is the only way to implement future projects economically, securely and for high customer satisfaction at the same time. Digital identification plays a central role in this context. We are very much looking forward to the partnership with M-TRIBES and believe that the interlocking of leading, highly specialized technologies creates future viability for modern concepts,” explains Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>
<p>“Access to best-in-class software enables transportation companies around the world to become digital champions. The seamless integration of IDnow’s AI-based identity verification into our M-TOOLS technology platform is a key building block to increase operational efficiency and improve the customer experience across a wide range of mobility offerings,” said Patrick Arle, CEO &amp; Founder of M-TRIBES. “Partnering with IDnow is another step in our strategy to integrate state of the art digital tools and capabilities into our technology platform.”</p>
<p>The solution is used, by mobility service providers such as EWE Go GmbH, a subsidiary of the energy provider EWE AG. “We were in need of a solution for the legally required process of identification that runs digitally, quickly and reliably. We have achieved this with the integration of IDnow / M-TRIBES. The service, not only delights our on-site users, but also our own operations team,” says Lukas Schneider, Business Development Manager at EWE Go GmbH.</p>

<p>Employers and consumers have embraced digital in the wake of the global pandemic.

Underpinning it all is digital identity, which ensures secure and more personalized, streamlined user experiences.<br> <br> But in this world, identity is far more intricate and risky than the little card in your pocket or the family name you inherited.

Ping Identity’s CEO, Andre Durand, recently joined me for an episode of <a>Hello User</a>, our podcast on how identity creates our world.

  <p>Congratulations to Jeff Bezos and the entire Amazon team on their incredible accomplishment of building the most highly valued company on the planet and revolutionizing the face of retail as we once knew it. I am confident that Jeff will successfully tackle even more interesting challenges and projects during the next phase of his career.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His announcement last week prompted me to reflect on Amazon’s pioneering work in the areas of ecommerce, cloud computing, supply chain and logistics. Who could have predicted an online bookstore would fundamentally change the world of retail by transforming the role of technology in our daily lives and that identity would play such an integral part?</p>

<p>I believe there is another, even more important reason why Amazon has become so successful.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the company adopted a radical approach to building exceptional digital experiences. Amazon set the standard for making it easy to shop online and create an experience where identity becomes nearly invisible. Thanks to Amazon, our expectation of a standard digital ecommerce experience is to click “buy” and find a Prime box on our doorstep the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a consumer, I appreciate that Amazon recognizes me whenever I log in, regardless of where I am or what device I’m using. They’ve removed so much of the friction inherent in the identity experience and purchasing processes that Amazon has become the first - and usually only – place I shop online. I rarely have to log into Amazon, and I can’t remember the last time I had to reset my password - a frustration I seem to encounter too often on other sites. The effortless experience at Amazon hasn’t meant I’ve had to compromise my security or privacy. The company has proven you don’t have to choose one or the other. For example, they recognize if I’m shopping from a friend’s mobile phone. To ensure it's me, Amazon completes a few quick security checks, and I’m back to making my purchases. That proactive outreach gives me peace of mind and allows Amazon to safeguard its customers.</p>

<p>So what can we all learn from Amazon? And how does identity play a role in delivering Amazon-like experiences?</p>

<p>At ForgeRock we don’t think anyone should have to settle. Our aim is to enable digital experiences that make <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">access smarter</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">more secure and more personalized</a>.&nbsp;Whether you’re at work, at home or on the go, getting stuff done online shouldn’t be a hassle. I envision a world where you never login again. That’s not a distant reality. The technology exists today to create online experiences that feel natural and let you get stuff done without passwords or usernames. Instead we’ll be identified by new and safer credentials, such as behavioral biometrics and other <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">passwordless authentication</a> methods. </p>

<p>There are two Jeff Bezos quotes I turn to often for inspiration when I need a reminder about why the ForgeRock Identity Platform matters:&nbsp;</p>

  “We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.”&nbsp; 
	 “The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you.” 
 <p>We’re dedicated to helping all organizations replicate Amazon-like experiences. I see it happening already with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/our-customers">customers</a> like the BBC, Allianz, Geico and so many others. At ForgeRock, we’re going to keep innovating and pushing the industry forward to ensure that Amazon is just one of many places where your digital identity gives you an easy button to getting things done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We're exploring a number of "Headless" combinations at Fission. The first one is with the Ghost Content Management System (CMS). We use Ghost to run this blog and want to start using it to integrate with and power our home page, so it's a great place for us to start.</p><p>The basic pattern of "Headless" is that your authors and editors login to a server based system with all the authoring and editing tools they are used to, but then the "head" – the usual template system and user facing website – isn't used. Instead, a modern front end framework is custom designed and built to take the published content of the CMS and host it. This fits great with the Fission app publishing platform.</p><p>After we've got the basics of a headless publishing workflow setup with Fission, we'll move on to using our Webnative framework to add personalization at the edge, but that will come in later posts.</p><p>Aside from Ghost, we're also looking at <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-wordpress/1448">Headless WordPress</a> and <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-drupal/1513">Headless Drupal</a>. Let us know in the forum if you've got other Headless projects that you'd like to combine with Fission!</p> Build a Next.js Blog powered by Headless Ghost and Fission <p>Follow the tutorial below to get started with your own Headless Ghost, or <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost">visit it on Github for the README version</a>.</p><p>You want to have a modern static website/app built with React, deployed to a CDN (even a <a href="https://ipfs.io/">distributed</a> one), and loading super fast for visitors and search engines.</p>
<p>You want to avoid the headaches and costs of managing and securing servers for traditional content management systems (CMSs) like Ghost and WordPress.</p>
<p>That's what static site generators (like Next.js, Gatsby, and <a href="https://staticgen.com/">others</a>) are for, right?</p>
<p>But, you don't want to have to retrain every writer and content creator on your team to use Markdown and Git. Ghost and WordPress are familiar, pretty, and usable. They have been iterated over years to be approachable by almost anyone.</p>
<p>What do you do? That's right you cut the CMS' head off 🔪</p>
<p>More politely, you decouple the interface used for authoring content from the systems used for rendering and distributing it.</p>
<p>With CMS and website decoupled, you can protect the CMS inside an intranet without exposing it to outside danger, or even use it as a desktop word processor running only on your machine, as I'll show you in this tutorial.</p>
<p>To make things easier we've made a template Next.js website that connects to Ghost and pulls content from it. Follow along and try it out. Feedback welcome :)</p>

 <a>🙏&nbsp;&nbsp;Show your support</a> 
 
 
<p>This starter template is based on the official <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript">blog-starter-typescript</a> from <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a>.</p>
<p>We changed it only enough to make it possible to fetch and publish blog posts from the Ghost CMS, while keeping the ability to write Markdown files in the git repo. It's a purely additive change.</p>
<p>There's also a GitHub Action to build and publish the static website to Fission. It works automatically on pushes to the git repo, and can be triggered manually after updating the content on Ghost. (The default Ghost webhook isn't customizable to trigger a GitHub Action, but that can be added as a plugin.)</p>
<p>The Markdown blog posts are stored in <code>/_posts</code> as files with frontmatter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.</p>
<p>The Ghost blog posts are fetched using Ghost's Content API library.</p>
 ✨&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started 
<p>Let's start by making this starter yours:</p>
 
 
<p>Click Use this template at the <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost">starter page on GitHub</a></p>
<p>That will make a copy of the starter into a new repo under your account with a fresh git history. You can pick a different name for it too; in that case replace <code>nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost</code> with your chosen name below.</p>
 
 
<p>Clone the repo (replace with your own URL):</p>
 <code>git clone git@github.com:fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost.git
</code> 
 
 
<p>cd into the repo:</p>
 <code>cd nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost
</code> 
 
 
<p>Install dependencies</p>
 <code>yarn
</code> 
 
 
<p>All command-line instructions and directory paths from now on assume the current directory is the root of the cloned repo.</p>
 👻&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting Up Ghost 
 Public or Local Ghost? 
<p>Running a local Ghost instance is good for testing. But also, if you have no need for a Ghost instance running all the time out on the internet (for example, if you are the only author) you can do this for your production website, using Ghost locally for its nice interface if you prefer that to editing Markdown files. No servers to secure, no bills to pay.</p>
 Setting Up Local Ghost 
<p>If you have a Ghost instance running already somewhere, move on to the next step. If you don't, you can set one up on your own machine with Docker.</p>
<p>To create a local Ghost instance with Docker, run the following at the root of your repo:</p>
 <code>yarn ghost-local-create
</code> 
<p>Ghost data will be stored at <code>./ghost</code>, which is in <code>.gitignore</code> by default. In a private repo you can choose to commit that too and have your Ghost content versioned and available whenever you need it.</p>
<p>There are other scripts like <code>ghost-local-start</code>, <code>ghost-local-stop</code>, and <code>ghost-local-remove</code> which you might find handy to manage the Docker container.</p>
<p>After Docker downloads and sets up Ghost, it will be accessible on your browser at <a href="http://localhost:3001">http://localhost:3001</a>.</p>
<p>Next you need to create an admin account on your newly-created Ghost. To do that, visit the admin interface at <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost">http://localhost:3001/ghost</a> and follow the wizard.</p>
 Exposing the Ghost Content API 
<p>I'll use <code>http://localhost:3001</code> for the examples, but you can replace that with your Ghost URL if you have an instance already running somewhere else.</p>
 
 Go to the admin interface at <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost">http://localhost:3001/ghost</a> 
 On the left-hand sidebar, click on "Integrations" 
 On the Integrations screen, click on <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost/#/settings/integrations/new/">+Add custom integration</a> 
 Give it a name, like <code>nextjs</code>, and click "Create" then "Save" 
 
<p>Now the important part:</p>
 
 On the same screen, you'll find two fields we need: Content API Key and API URL 
 Copy those into a new <code>.env.local</code> file, like this: 
 
 <code># .env.local
# replace values with your own
GHOST_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
GHOST_API_KEY=2a9356e4a5214c883ba886e58e
</code> 
<p>⚠️ This file is ignored by git by default. Don't commit <code>env.local</code> to git unless you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>Alright! Ghost part's done.</p>
 💻&nbsp;&nbsp;Running Next.js Locally 
<p>Next.js is the missing static website head to our headless Ghost. Let's stitch them together! This should be enough:</p>
 <code>yarn dev
</code> 
<p>Your blog should be up and running at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>! (If anything unexpected happens, please post an <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost/issues/new">issue</a>.)</p>
<p>Now you can change the Next.js website code and the content on Ghost, and iterate quickly on them in the browser.</p>
<p>Note: live-reload works for Next.js code and Markdown files; to see changes to Ghost content you need to refresh the page.</p>
 🌐&nbsp;&nbsp;Deploying to Fission 
<p>When you're ready to publish, the first step is exporting your website to a set of static files:</p>
 <code>yarn build
</code> 
<p>That should create a directory at <code>./out</code> with all your ready-to-publish files.</p>
<p>Next we use the Fission CLI to send that out onto the internets.</p>
 🔰&nbsp;&nbsp;Fission CLI Install and Sign Up 
<p>To install the Fission command-line interface using brew, run:</p>
 <code>brew tap fission-suite/fission
brew install fission-cli
</code> 
<p>For more ways of installing the Fission CLI, please check the <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/installation">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't have a Fission account, you can create one without leaving the command-line by running:</p>
 <code>fission setup
</code> 
 🌱&nbsp;&nbsp;Register New Fission App 
<p>You can pick a subdomain or let Fission choose a random one for you.</p>
<p>To host the Next.js website at a random subdomain on <code>.fission.app</code>, run:</p>
 <code>fission app register
</code> 
<p>To choose your own subdomain, use the <code>--name</code> option like this:</p>
 <code>fission app register --name my-beautiful-subdomain
</code> 
<p>That will create a <code>fission.yaml</code> file. This one is safe to commit to git, and you should do that if you want to use the GitHub Action to build and deploy the website for you. Make sure there is a line saying <code>build: ./out</code> in it. That's the directory where Next.js puts the exported website files.</p>
 🚀 &nbsp;&nbsp;Aand... Launch! 
<p>One last step:</p>
 <code>fission app publish
</code> 
<p>And you're done! Your website should be up at a random URL returned to you by the Fission CLI or at <code>my-beautiful-subdomain.fission.app</code> if you used the <code>--name</code> option. Yay!</p>
 🤖&nbsp;&nbsp;(Semi-)Automatic Deployment with the GitHub Action 
<p>If you don't want to run the build locally and deploy to Fission every time you make a change to the Next.js code or Markdown files (who does?), this starter comes with a GitHub Action that automates that for you.</p>
<p>To get it working you need to set up 3 secrets for your repo. To do that, go to the "Settings" &gt; "Secrets" screen on your GitHub repo, then create a "New repository secret" for each of these:</p>
 
 <code>GHOST_API_URL</code> 
 <code>GHOST_API_KEY</code> 
 <code>FISSION_KEY</code> 
 
<p>The values for the <code>GHOST_API_</code> fields are the same ones you used for the <code>.env.local</code> file above.</p>
<p>The <code>FISSION_KEY</code> was created and stored locally for you by the Fission CLI when you set it up. Here's how you get it:</p>
 <code>cat ~/.config/fission/key/machine_id.ed25519 | base64
</code> 
<p>With all 3 secrets set up, you can trigger the <code>deploy</code> action manually by clicking on "Run workflow" &gt; "Run workflow", or see it in action after your next <code>git push</code>.</p>
 
<p>Note:</p>
<p>⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;To fetch the content from Ghost, the GitHub Action must be able to access the URL entered in the <code>GHOST_API_URL</code> secret.</p>
<p>If you are running a local Ghost instance on your machine, <code>http://localhost:3001</code> won't be visible to the outside.</p>
<p>A simple way of exposing your local Ghost instance to a publicly-accessible URL is by using one of the <a href="https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling">open source alternatives to ngrok</a> or <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> itself.</p>
<p>With ngrok you do something like this:</p>
 <code>ngrok http 3001
</code> 
<p>⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;This is great for testing, but not secure. Look into using <code>https</code> if you're going to rely on this and don't want your Ghost API key and data to leak.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Why "(semi-)" automatic then? 🤔</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glad you asked. The GitHub Action can detect when you push to the GitHub repo because there's a built-in "on push" event that can be used to trigger it.</p>
<p>But when you create a new post on Ghost or update an existing one, GitHub needs a way of finding out about it so it can run the deploy action. There's no <code>git push</code> event happening, so the trigger is usually a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event">webhook</a> (i.e. a POST request you send to a GitHub API URL.)</p>
<p>🙂&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, Ghost comes with the built-in ability to send webhooks when content changes happen.</p>
<p>🙃&nbsp;&nbsp;Unluckily, though, Ghost doesn't let you customize the payload that goes in the webhook requests it sends, and GitHub requires a certain field to be present telling it which <code>ref</code> (usually a branch) you are referring to.</p>
<p>Bottom line: after changing things on Ghost, you need to trigger a build manually.</p>
<p>You can do that via the GitHub interface ("Actions" &gt; "Continuous Deployment" &gt; "Run workflow" &gt; "Run workflow"), or by running the handy script we added to this starter:</p>
 <code>GITHUB_USER=your-username GITHUB_REPO=your-repo GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token trigger-github-deploy-action.sh
</code> 
<p>Here's how you can get an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">auth token</a>.</p>
<p>This situation is definitely not ideal, and can be solved with Ghost plugins, but we wanted to stick to the basic install.</p>

<p>One of Jolocom’s founding principles is its mission to forward the establishment and maintenance of standards in our industry. As such, we are very happy to have our team member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaichristianwagner/">Kai Wagner</a>, serving as an active board member of <a href="https://inatba.org/">INATBA</a> (the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications) as well as being the co-chair of the organization’s Identity Working Group.</p>



<p>It was in this role that Kai chaired a recent INATBA event, a roundtable discussion based on the organization’s position paper, <a href="https://inatba.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-INATBA-Decentralised-Identity-001.pdf">Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?</a>, published in late 2020. Joining Kai were four fellow stakeholders, each with their own view on where decentralized identity is at present and how it should take shape over the months and years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sitting around the virtual table with Kai were <a href="https://twitter.com/thekaryl?lang=en">Karyl Fowler</a>, CEO of Transmute, a software company working within the sector and active member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation’s (DIF) steering committee. Also from the US came <a href="https://twitter.com/aniltj?lang=en">Anil John</a>, technical director of the US government’s Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Silicon Valley Innovation Programme.</p>



<p>Joining them was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/loretta-anania-2765898/">Dr. Loretta Anania</a>, scientific officer at the European Commission’s DG Connect who, through funding, helped get INATBA off the ground and was there in her capacity as project officer of eSSIF-Labs. And finally, from Belgium came <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielduseuil/">Daniël Du Seuil</a>, convener of the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework and the national Belgian self-sovereign identity (SSI) project leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, written over the course of a year by six key authors, was produced by INATBA with the aim of defining the expectations for an open and innovative market in decentralized identity. It analyzes the current state of SSI developments and opens up discussion of the next steps, taking a clear stance on how INATBA would like to see development continue, making demands of the key stakeholder groups and setting goals for the future of SSI.</p>



<p>Answering the paper’s core question of what’s at stake, it gives three essential scenarios:</p>



  Ideal – full convergence of SSI technology with interoperability by default.  Functional – partial convergence resulting in detached ecosystems.  Dysfunctional – no convergence and isolated, locked-in ecosystems.  



<p>With an awareness that the INATBA paper’s ideal position might be seen by some as “utopian”, Kai then went round the table to gauge the participants’ initial responses to it.</p>



<p>Responding first was Karyl, who agreed wholeheartedly with the INATBA position both from her perspective as a member of DIF and as a business person. Without achieving interoperability, she said, we “risk implementing a solution that further locks individuals out of mobility – socially and otherwise – as well as locks businesses out of future business agility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karyl added: “We don’t want to implement innovation that takes two steps back.”</p>



<p>Anil, having told the audience of his earlier doubts that blockchain was the universal panacea some of its champions believed it to be, went on to say, “I tend not to buy into the techno-utopianism of self-sovereign identity.” Despite this, Anil also said, “I do believe in personal agency and control.”</p>



<p>This, he explained, was the starting point for work he was funding to try to create a competitive ecosystem of services, noting, “As a US government agency, we have often been walked into a corner by vendors and told this is the only magic thing that will solve your problem.”</p>



<p>“We are not interested in being locked into another platform. If you want to go down that path, you need to ensure that there exists a competitive ecosystem of service providers that actually interoperate at a base level on the security and privacy side. That is the motivation for us.”</p>



<p>With 30 years of experience funding Internet research for the European Commission and time spent at MIT before that, Loretta explained that this, the funding of research, was core to her perspective on prioritizing investments. Specifically, with eSSIF-Lab she is supporting the strategic planning for the next generation Internet and laying the foundations for the proposed new European digital ID. To do this, Loretta said, we need to discover “how to put more trust in the network, a more decentralized trust framework and more permissionless autonomy to safeguard accountability and cherish&nbsp; free speech on the Internet.”</p>



<p>“Open is easy to say and hard to do,” she added. However, with the European Commission’s plan to make the next decade one of twin transition, putting green and digital into everything it does, Loretta noted that, although this will be difficult, it is also a beginning and that, especially when standards are being set, “It’s important to be there,&nbsp; involved at the beginning.”</p>



<p>Daniël, coming from a perspective of wanting to empower citizens, made it clear he thought the INATBA paper addressed important questions about the evolution of the technology and its adoption. “It’s not that easy,” he said. Both public and private sectors need to know the best ways to migrate from the current centralized to new, decentralized systems.</p>



<p>SSI, he argued, could be the answer to what the new call for a European digital ID is looking for. If the European digital ID is all about empowerment, privacy and new models of data sovereignty, it needs to be technology neutral. In the end, Daniël noted, the question is always the same: How can we empower the citizens?</p>



<p>With Kai tying up the common threads between the panelists’ first responses, he noted a clear difference between the US and European approaches. While in Europe the exploration and funding of research into digital identity technology and SSI came from a perspective of data sovereignty for citizens, in the US there was a broader requirement. Here, there was a desire for no system lock-in for all types of exchanges – such as the provenance of goods and information as well those of private identities. As such there was a difference in the motivation behind the funding of projects on either side of the Atlantic. However, as these were essentially similar if not the same problem, how could we ensure that the solutions that emerge were compatible?</p>



<p>Here, Loretta was quick to come in, arguing that use cases were key, both in making sure that we’re not trying to solve problems that don’t exist and that we are solving those that do. But, she went on to say, Loretta didn’t believe that the core problem was seamless compatibility, rather it was one of waste. And that the answer is data minimization. “The internet of waste is about unsustainable pollution, consuming resources at a time when the green transition is our biggest problem.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think that it’s an impossible task,” she said. But, for now, we should look to the use cases, “start small and use the best possible solution.”</p>



<p>In his experience, said Anil, “Everybody talks interoperability but seems to have a different idea of what it is.” He went on to argue that true interoperability requires two things. Firstly, that there are standards and specifications baked into the implementation of the technology, which is proven by publicly open, interoperable test suites that are developed and available to make sure that anything is conforming to the standards. And secondly, you need to do end-to-end matrix testing between implementations. Only then can you ensure both conformity to standards and genuine interoperability at product and vendor level. These two principles were something that all the participants generally agreed with.</p>



<p>In the light of this, Anil explained that the Department of Homeland Security had decided that interoperability test suites themselves could not be developed and owned by the companies being funded by them and carrying out the research. They should be owned and available independently – under the WC3 umbrella. “It makes sense for global collaborations,” he argued, “to work for the common benefit of our citizens.”</p>



<p>Agreeing, Karyl also put forward her belief that the way business owners or individuals come to the conclusion that interoperability is important is very use case-dependent. It’s easier to see in public sector applications. “We have to acknowledge that for each of these use cases, there are existing standards,” she said, addressing the fact that switching technologies is a costly affair and not one that businesses can take on lightly. “In many cases, what we’ve found is that a lot of these processes are not standard across regions or even within industry itself… Technology is not a silver bullet. If we implement it on a process that is fundamentally not serving the way that we’re interacting in the 21st century, we’ve just created more problems.”</p>



<p>Returning to the issue of standards, Daniël suggested that we need to think both of domain standards and technology ones. With a new technology, he argued, you need stability. You don’t need lots of new initiatives all the time and, at the moment, the technology is not mature enough to say that interoperability can be arranged in one way or another. We all know what the end goal is, Daniël said, but getting there isn’t going to be easy.</p>



<p>At this point, Kai took the opportunity to put a final question to the panelists. “If we actually want to get closer to some kind of proper interoperability,” he asked, “what is the kind of interaction we want to enable, irrespective of the use case, that should then serve as a basis for further work?”</p>



<p>A passionate Anil leapt in to answer this, saying that the hardest part when it comes to interoperability is following what he called the three Ps: “Pipes, payloads and policies.”</p>



<p>Pipes, he said, are the protocols you need to agree on. Payload is the data format of what’s moving through the pipes. Everything else is the policy construct that you put in place to make sure that everybody’s talking about the same thing.</p>



<p>He also argued, in agreement with Karyl’s earlier comments, that “rip and replace is not a strategy or path to success,” saying you can’t expect any sector to tear up its existing infrastructure just because something “bright and shiny” turns up. Technologists need to understand where people are and meet them there, providing something that reuses the technology those people have already spent a lot of time and money setting up. What we need to do is “provide connectivity to the new.”</p>



<p>Karyl addressed matters from the perspective of an American seeing how things are progressing in the EU, and recognized how productive having the public sector buying into the need for interoperability and standards was. This, she said, was liberating as it would redefine what was pre-competitive and where a business’s value lay. As a business, working with your competition rather than against it could only be productive as you could tackle problems together rather than in parallel. It was liberating for innovation.</p>



<p>However, Karyl also recognized that regulation and policy are, in use cases, the things that will define what is pre-competitive. It will look different when considering education, or global trade, or identity – be it an individual’s, an enterprise’s or an organization’s.</p>



<p>Agreeing with Anil, Loretta said that, in the EU, “We build on what works.” In her experience, standardization takes decades. “Do not underestimate,” she said, “the amount of effort that the EU had to put in to get a passport that’s recognized in one country to be also recognized in all the others.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, standards were not the right place to start, Loretta argued. “I don’t start with standards,” she explained. “I start with people who have good ideas, who are innovative.”</p>



<p>“I totally agree that standardization is a long process,” said Daniël, going on to argue that for him, interoperability is next to security in its importance. However, regulation is also essential as openness will not come easily. “It’s not something that emerges naturally,” he noted.</p>



<p>With that, and the clock running out, Kai called for the panellists closing thoughts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadly, Anil had already had to leave the table. Karyl meanwhile suggested that eventually interoperability and the development of standards are key to driving adoption. Without that, she argued, we would be locking businesses out of a more agile future and locking individuals into limited mobility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coherence with common standards will come, thought Loretta, and that ultimately people will vote with their feet. However, reiterating her earlier point, it will take time, she said. “But I’m patient.”</p>



<p>Striking an optimistic final note, Daniel said he thought that this is an interesting time. Right now, both industry and the public sector are interested in decentralized identity and what it can offer them. Now, he argued, we need to prove that this technology really works.

   Unpacking the Realities of Identity Assurance Level (IAL) and Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) to Make Compliance Easier&nbsp; 

<p>No matter how much security and interoperability it brings, the thought of ‘compliance’ always brings a resigned sigh. Yet, from the U.S. Federal Government (Fed) to state and local governments and educational institutions (SLED), complying with guidelines and standards is a must not only for security but for interoperability and cost reduction.</p>

<p>Digital identity is at the heart of addressing many government specifications and guidelines. In this post, we’ll unpack two assurance levels, identity assurance level (IAL) and authenticator assurance level (AAL), within the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST’s SP 800-63-3</a> Digital Identity Guidelines. For more detailed information on implementing IAL and AAL using ForgeRock Intelligent Access, read <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-nist">ForgeRock and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s begin.</p>

<p>In the current revision (revision 3) of SP 800-63, NIST replaces the idea of a single level of assurance (LOA) with three different types of assurance, each with three levels:</p>

  Identity assurance level (IAL) 1-3 
	 Authenticator assurance level (AAL) 1-3 
	 Federation assurance level (FAL) 1-3 (I’ll write about FAL at a later date) 
 <p>Each assurance type is so specific that NIST provides an 80+ page special publication to each, 800-63A, 800-63B, 800-63C, respectively.</p>

<p>Why are there three levels of assurance for each assurance type? Simply put, the levels of assurance are directly related to the potential damage caused if data is compromised.</p>

  Assurance level 1 covers less sensitive data such as publicly available information. 
	 Assurance level 2 considers sensitive data such as for official use only, or personal data. 
	 Assurance level 3 includes highly sensitive data such as financial data, or personnel data. 
 <p>Before we dig in further, let’s clear up the relationship between identity proofing and authenticators, as this distinction is important. Identity proofing is required during account creation and, in some cases, periodically throughout the lifecycle of the identity. Once a claimant’s identity has been proved, and while still in the account creation process, the claimant registers the authenticators (such as username and password, biometrics, etc.) These authenticators are used to access the account in the future. In general, an applicant proves his identity once but repeatedly authenticates.</p>

<p>Back to the task at hand: IAL and AAL.</p>

<p>Identity Assurance Levels (IAL) as Described in NIST SP 800-63A Enrollment and&nbsp;Identity Proofing</p>

<p>To achieve an identity assurance level, an applicant proves he, she, or it (e.g., a computer or a thing) has a real-life identity. This proofing process extends from self-asserted proof in IAL1 to highly scrutinized physical evidence in IAL3, where proofing requires the physical presence of both the applicant and a trained and authorized representative of the authorizing agency.</p>

<p>By far, most agencies seek IAL2 proofing of an applicant and use trusted sources to help prove someone is who they say they are. Examples of trusted sources include issuers of smartcards (such as CAC and PIV), driver’s licenses, student IDs, teachers union credentials, and first responder credentials.</p>

<p>Other than self-asserted proof, IAL proofing sometimes involves a third party that specializes in identity proofing, such as PII matching, biometric analytics, credit verification, demographic matching, etc. This may sound complicated, yet agencies find a quick path to IAL compliance at any assurance level using ForgeRock’s Intelligent Access toolset combined with third-party identity proofing technologies from our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">partner network</a>. Details are provided in the paper <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-nist">ForgeRock and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3</a>.</p>

<p>Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL) as Described in NIST SP 800-63B Authentication and Lifecycle Management</p>

<p>SP 800-63B covers ‘authenticators’, or the mechanisms used to access an account. Authenticators are as simple as username/password or as complex as a multifactor cryptographic challenge-response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also covered within SP 800-63B are ‘authentication factors’, which include: something you know (password, PIN, etc.), something you have (a one-time password fob, etc.), and something you are (such as biometrics like your thumbprint, iris, or face pattern).</p>

<p>Authenticator assurance levels determine how confident we are that the claimant possesses and controls the authenticators tied to their account. There are three AAL assurance levels. Each assurance level requires one or more distinct authentication factors.</p>

  AAL1 is the lowest assurance level and only requires a single authentication factor and an authenticator such as a simple username and password. AAL1 is used to access publicly available information like commissary prices, open courses, or public services. 
	 AAL2 is more stringent than AAL1 in that it requires two distinct authentication factors, such as a username and password (something you know) and a one-time-password pushed to a device (something you have). AAL2 is used to secure accounts with access to sensitive information such as personal data, agency internal but not classified data, the claimant’s student or financial data, etc.&nbsp; 
	 AAL3, the highest assurance level, extends AAL2 by requiring:&nbsp; 
   Hardware-based authenticators 
	 An authenticator that provides impersonation resistance (such as biometrics) 
	 Proof a cryptographic key is in the claimant’s possession.&nbsp; 
 <p>AAL3 is used to secure an agency's most sensitive data, such as a facility security officer’s duties, a university registrar, or any other function that requires access to the most sensitive information held by an agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To support authenticators, both hardware and software, government and publicly funded non-federal organizations require a flexible, yet robust, identity platform to orchestrate all AAL compliance levels. This is where ForgeRock comes in.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>, government and publicly funded non-federal organizations leverage <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports">industry-leading authentication and identity features</a> in conjunction with hundreds of pre-integrated identity proofing and authenticator options made available through our partners in our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">expansive Trust Network</a>. Because of ForgeRock’s comprehensive functionality, you can build an authentication journey that meets or exceeds all 800-63A and B compliance requirements. Additionally, if you require<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/federation"> federated single sign on</a>, there are ForgeRock modules to help you quickly achieve any 800-63C assurance level. In short, you can orchestrate all 800-63-3 assurance levels (IAL1-3, AAL1-3, FAL1-3).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more details on how ForgeRock can help you achieve NIST’s SP 800-63-3 specifications, read <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-nist">ForgeRock and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3</a>. And stay tuned for additional blog posts on this topic.</p>

<p>Once you’re logged in to your Okta account, you can follow along with the rest of this blog post to learn how to use rockstar!</p>
 CSV Export for Okta Users, Groups, and Apps 

<p>While Okta can import users from a CSV, it doesn’t have the ability to export them in that same way.</p>

<p>The ability to export data from Okta is one of the most used capabilities in rockstar. While there are several other methods of exporting data from Okta, rockstar has some unique capabilities that set it apart from other solutions.</p>

<p>To export data from Okta in a CSV format, you’ll need to navigate to the location in the Okta that has the data you want to export. For example, to export the users from Okta, do the following:</p>

 
   From the Directory menu, select People 
   In the hovering rockstar menu, click “Export Users” 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should now see a window that looks like the one below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this window, you can select the columns that you want to have exported to CSV. For example, in the image above, the columns “User Id”, “Status”, etc are selected to be exported.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can filter the things that Okta will export to CSV using a query filter. Because the query box is just a thin wrapper around the Okta API, it requires a specific format in order to do the searches - i.e. <code>q=</code>, or <code>filter=status</code> … etc.</p>

<p>To export all of your users from Okta, just leave the query box blank.</p>

<p>Once you are ready to export users from Okta, click the “Export” button. When you’ve done this, rockstar will start exporting data from Okta, taking care to respect the concurrent and per-minute rate limits that Okta sets on the APIs that rockstar uses for exporting data.</p>

<p>Once your export is completed, you should see a downloaded file in Chrome with a name that looks like <code>Exported Users YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS.csv</code></p>

<p>Note that rockstar is able to export more than just users, groups, and apps from Okta. Rockstar can also export other types of data like group members, group rules, directory users, apps, app users, app groups, app notes, network zones, YubiKeys, mappings, admins, and more.</p>

 Exporting Apps 

<p>For another example of exporting data from Okta using rockstar; here is how you can use rockstar to export a list of your Okta apps. This is useful when you want to have a holistic view of what apps are currently being used, what type of sign-on Method they’re using (SAML, OIDC, SWA, etc), and whether the app is active. On a deeper level, you can see what the template of the user name is.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Having an overview of the apps in your Okta tenant allows for easy auditing and management.  Because the file is exported in .CSV format, you can manipulate it to make it easy for you to read and use.</p>

 SAML Debugger 

<p>If a SAML application isn’t working as expected, the typical approach is to use a tool like “SAML Tracer” to decode the SAML Assertion that Okta is sending to another application. However, there are two issues with using SAML Tracer to debug SAML:</p>

 
   The extension requires that you give it permission to inspect data from every website you visit 
   Once you have a decoded SAML Assertion from SAML Tracer, it can be tricky to find the parts of the SAML Assertion that matter. 
 

<p>Rockstar addresses both of those concerns:</p>

 
   It only requests permission from Okta-related domains (okta.com, oktapreview.com, etc) 
   The SAML Assertion that rockstar displays comes with helpfully highlighted sections, as seen above 
 

<p>To use the SAML debugging capabilities in rockstar, visit the end user dashboard, and in the rockstar menu, select “Show SSO”. Doing this will add a “Show SSO” link below your apps. To see the SAML assertion that a SAML app would generate, click on the “Show SSO” link for that app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you click on the “Show SSO” link, rockstar will fetch a SAML assertion for that app from Okta and then display it in a window, helpfully highlighting the most important parts of the assertion. It will look like this:</p>

<p></p>

 Exploring the Okta API 

<p>Learning a RESTful API like the Okta API can be daunting, especially if you haven’t spent time with a RESTful API before. The usual way to learn an API is to use a tool like Postman, or maybe even open a terminal on your computer and use a command-line tool like <code>curl</code>.  However, doing either of those things requires setting up your environment, putting in variables, your API keys, client secret, client id, etc. And for someone starting out, that is a very intimidating thing to do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, because tools like Postman and <code>curl</code> depend on an API key, that API key will expire after 30 days of non-use. This means that you’ll often find yourself needing to regenerate an API key, usually when you’re in a hurry and would rather be doing something else.</p>

<p>By using rockstar, you can quickly start exploring the Okta API. This is because rockstar will make use of your existing Okta session. Because of that, you’ll never need to worry about generating an API key, or having an API key expire.</p>

<p>Inside of rockstar, you get a list of dropdown commands that will allow you to see what type of GET commands are available for you to choose from. Then, you will be able to see the response directly below; all within the Chrome window.</p>

<p>To open the API explorer, simply click on the “API Explorer” link in the rockstar window. This will open a window that gives you a simplified interface to make API requests to Okta. If you haven’t yet memorized every single Okta API endpoint, rockstar helpfully lists the most commonly used endpoints for you!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Here are some examples of using rockstar to explore the Okta API:</p>

 Getting a list of users 

<p>To get a list of users, open the API Explorer, click on the URL endpoint box, select <code>/api/v1/users</code> from the menu, then click the Send button. You should see a list of users, like in the screenshot below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you might have noticed, every Okta API endpoint returns data in the JSON format, but for some kinds of data, JSON can be unwieldy to look at visually. Because of that, when possible, rockstar will helpfully format some JSON data into a table, while still returning the JSON underneath as well. You can see the original JSON response by clicking on the “JSON” link in the output:</p>

<p></p>

 Getting information on a single user 

<p>To get detailed information on a particular user, navigate to that user in the Okta interface, and then click the “Show User” link in rockstar</p>

<p></p>

<p>Clicking that link will provide you with the API response for that user, which contains a detailed list of attributes for that particular user.</p>

<p></p>

 Getting group membership for a user 

<p>To make an API request that fetches the group membership information for a user, navigate to a user in the Okta interface, click the “API Explorer” link in rockstar, then select the <code>/api/v1/users/${userId}/groups</code> URL. You will now see a list of groups that your user is a member of:</p>

<p></p>

 Easier assignment of admin privileges to users 
<p>In Okta, assignment of admin privileges is a multi-step process, requiring you to open the Security menu, select Administrators, click the “Add Administrator” button, enter in the user you want to grant privileges to, select which privileges you want to grant the user, then clicking the “Add Administrator” button. I’m feeling exhausted just typing all of that!</p>

<p>With rockstar, we address this by directly granting the user administrator privileges directly from within the user’s individual profile page!</p>

<p>To do this, navigate to the user you want to grant administrator privileges to, then in rockstar click the “Administrator Roles” link:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Assuming that you are logged into Okta as an administrator, you will be presented with a list of admin privileges that you could be assigning to this user. Click on any of the links to grant the user that particular administrator privilege. For example, to grant a user “Read Only Administrator” privileges, click on the “Grant Read Only Administrator” link.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In addition to granting permissions, rockstar also allows you to instantly revoke admin privileges; reducing the need to dive deep into the Admin console.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Simpler and quicker workflows make rockstar a very handy tool to have when administering a large set of users in Okta. Reducing the need to deep dive into the product menus is continuing to prove to be a beneficial feature for Okta admins out there.</p>

 How do you get it? 

<p>Now that you have an idea of some of the things that you can do with rockstar, it’s time for you to install it and try it out for yourself! Here’s how:</p>

 
   Visit the <a href="https://gabrielsroka.github.io/rockstar/">home page for rockstar</a>. 
   Click on the “rockstar” link that will send you to the Chrome Web Store

<p>By Li Jun, Founder of Ontology &amp; <a href="https://protocol.sagamarket.io/">SAGA Protocol</a>. Originally posted in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/data-regulation-in-2021%3A-more-small-steps-or-a-giant-leap-2021-02-04">NASDAQ</a>.</p><p>We are living through an activist period of data regulation that will dictate how our economies function for generations to come. Most industries have precedents for regulation that go back centuries, in the case of banking, pharmaceutical, and industrial relations, or at least decades in the case of environmental regulation and telecoms. Even antitrust, that other great set of regulatory concerns facing big technology companies, seems to be based on theories that were formulated around the turn of the twentieth century.</p><p>Data regulation is being designed from first principles before our very eyes. It draws from notions of individual privacy, and is heavily influenced by world events from national security regulation following 9/11 to a reckoning on data collection in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. Technical considerations are also feeding into regulation, in particular the ability of machine learning technology to help with medical treatment or predict crime using ever larger data&nbsp;sets.</p><p>Where previously data regulation has been a knee-jerk response to high-profile events, both the tech and government sectors have matured enough to move beyond hard cases making bad law. The introduction of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 set a new, unprecedented global standard for data protection, while the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) came into play on New Year’s Day last year. This brought data regulation much closer to what we see in Europe, and with California the home of US tech, this arguably amounts to de facto regulation of the whole country. Similar laws have also been passed in countries such as Canada, New Zealand, China, and South Africa, bringing with them a new global age of data regulation.</p><p>With 2020 firmly in the rearview mirror, how will the industry evolve over the next 12 months to meet growing needs? This could be the year where data privacy legislation finally gets road tested and we are provided some case law by which to assess their effects. In 2020 the pandemic put a dampener on enforcing non-compliance GDPR penalties, as many prominent UK fines that had been announced were postponed and reduced. British Airways had to <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/british-airways-fined-20m-over-gdpr-breach">pay £20 million</a> of a fine originally set at £183 million, while Marriott Hotels <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlypage/2020/10/30/marriott-hit-with-184-million-gdpr-fine-over-massive-2018-data-breach/">had to pay £18.4 million</a> out of £100 million. The economic hardship played a big role, as both companies operated in sectors that were decimated by the pandemic, but regulators will not want to be seen as a soft touch. We can expect the honeymoon to end and an increase in fines issued during 2021, as European regulators establish themselves again and their international equivalents flex their muscles for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>While much of the conversation around data regulation focuses on privacy, data localization is another trend we can expect to see more of this year. This refers to a legal requirement that data be stored within specific regional or national borders, forcing multinationals to create local storage facilities to house data sourced from a given country. In 2020 this issue became international news when the Trump administration threatened to force the sale of TikTok’s US business in the name of data localization, or data sovereignty. For the government to interfere with a private company to this extent caused some to talk about a new Cold War, fought with proxy companies rather than proxy states. In the process, it elevated data localization to an urgent consideration for data lawyers and lobbyists. This issue is not going away, and international governments are likely to mirror the US approach and demand special treatment for their citizens’ data. This is also expected to put considerable pressure on international tech companies dealing with non-democratic regimes.</p><p>In the wake of the extended trade negotiations surrounding the UK’s decision to leave the EU, and the growing consternation between the US and China, it will be no surprise to see data sovereignty become an issue for nationalist politicians. Just as trade restrictions are touted in order to protect jobs, data restrictions will be suggested to protect citizen information and intellectual property. Countries that have created artificial intelligence companies in particular will become more inclined to see data as an asset that is important for economic success and national security. A growing interplay between individual privacy and nationalism with economic and national security components will define the politics and regulation of data in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Finally, empowering the growing data-driven economy by connecting data in a decentralized way will be key if the industry is to evolve. We are beginning to see emerging technologies such as blockchain adopted in data sharing and this too will have a major impact on regulation. Most recently in Britain, two hospitals are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-blockchain/british-hospitals-use-blockchain-to-track-covid-19-vaccines-idUSL4N2JQ3FD">using a distributed ledger</a> to keep tabs on the storage of Covid-19 vaccines and the distribution of doses. As real-life use cases become increasingly common, this could be the catalyst for further regulation, most likely driven by the EU or US. President Biden’s pick to lead the SEC has previously stated that <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/a-cryptocurrency-a-security-depends">cryptocurrencies are under regulated</a>, and the first mover in 2021 could shape global regulation, just as GDPR did for privacy. Technology and data are defining our economy and culture, and they will in turn be defined by how they are regulated. 2021 may be the year where we finally see how this plays&nbsp;out.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/data-regulation-in-2021-more-small-steps-or-a-giant-leap-f62f018e91ea">Data Regulation In 2021: More Small Steps Or A Giant Leap?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>Selon une étude menée par Sucuri, 90% des CMS piratés en 2019 étaient des sites WordPress. Dans la majorité des cas, le piratage était dû à une mauvaise gestion des accès administrateurs.</p>
<p>À la suite d’un piratage, les conséquences peuvent être dramatique… Sécuriser efficacement son site web sans non plus devenir «&nbsp;parano&nbsp;» est donc essentiel.&nbsp;D’autant plus au travers du contexte sanitaire actuel, où le nombre d’entreprises évoluant vers la digitalisation augmente de jour en jour. Ce phénomène induit par conséquent une croissance considérable des risques de piratage.</p>
<p>L’objectif de ce Webinar est tout d’abord de vous faire prendre conscience des risques encourus à cause de quelques maladresses, et de vous montrer comment sécuriser simplement votre site web afin de garder une longueur-d’avance sur les cyber-attaquants.</p>

<p>Coinspeaker: Many companies and initiatives had spotted the potential for blockchain to solve real-world challenges. But like anything of value, it takes time to build, test, and iterate. Jelurida, the Swiss software firm behind the Ardor platform, has a team that’s been around in blockchain and systems development long enough to become very familiar with this cycle. Two of Jelurida’s co-founders were involved with the Nxt blockchain, which launched in 2013. Jelurida took over the operation of Nxt, which still runs today, in 2016. However, Ardor has been the firm’s flagship platform since its launch in January 2018. All tech innovations aside, what’s impressive about Ardor is the fact that over the three years since it launched, it’s become a go-to platform for projects looking to apply the features of blockchain to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>Julian Hayes from Veneto Privacy shares some tips and tricks for businesses considering organisational controls around data protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why are organisational controls so important? 
<p>Organisational controls are often an underestimated part of data protection compliance but critically important in order for organisations to demonstrate compliance.</p>
<p>It’s really important that your organisation is set up with a framework around data protection and security. Beyond legal obligations, it makes good business sense, allows for proper control and utilisation of data, and can even help streamline process costs.</p>
<p>With a few simple process measures, some enthusiasm and the right tools, organisations can still thrive with their data processing activities safe in the knowledge that structures are there to keep them on the right track.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Data management programme 
<p>A data management programme is a living project with continuous cycles enabling organisational activities that support good data privacy practices. Standard components of a good programme would feature:</p>
 
 Data Protection Training &amp; Communications plan for the year. 
 Data Privacy Management Group, managing data retention, security and access controls and Data Protection Impact Assessment reviews. These assessments require expert knowledge in data protection and security in order to establish the legal basis for the processing, what security measures are required, establishing whether a balancing test of legitimate interest is required and having oversight of the full extent of the processing. 
 Data Curation, ensuring data integrity, utility and interoperability within the organisation and its other data processes. 
 Data Governance, an integral part for the programme with key decision makers appointed where high-level decisions are made on data protection and security risks. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Privacy Culture 
<p>It’s always good to capitalise interest in data protection from colleagues within your organisation and let them assist you with your data protection programme objectives, with meetups, information sharing and privacy representation for their departments. At Veneto Privacy, we’ve implemented formal and informal data privacy working groups and have seen first-hand that this privacy culture can grow compliance maturity for organisations making the Data Protection function, with the support of these advocates as a more integrated and trusted unit.</p>
<p>In setting up a Data Privacy working group, it’s always good to set out clear objectives for all stakeholders and what their responsibilities are in their participation. Some items the group can help the Data Protection function manage include:&nbsp;Product &amp; Service plans for the forthcoming quarter; reconciling the Register of Data Processing (Article 30 GDRP) for data processing activities in their business unit; co-ordinating on investigations or regulatory enquiries; and of course cascading changes in the data protection landscape that may impact on the business. These advocates can be the eyes and ears of data protection for you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Training and Knowledge 
<p>Your business can have the best internal processes for reporting data protection breaches, but these are worthless when staff have not been trained to be able to react or even identify a data breach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Data Governance 
<p>Who does the buck stop with?&nbsp; Who is responsible for the management and ownership of data? Without a governance structure and clear accountability within defined roles (CTO, CEO etc.) your organisation cannot say it has implemented ‘organisational measures’ under Article 32 of the GDPR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Does our business need a Data Protection Officer? 
<p>Yes, if your organisation processes large amounts of personally identifiable data or the processing involves large scale systematic processing of such data. Importantly, the Data Protection Officer needs to have independence in some decision-making processes and should not be conflicted when it comes to determining privacy risks.</p>
<p>Further, organisations based outside of the EU that offer services within the union must by law appoint an EU Representative based within the territory, who can be contacted by consumers and data protection authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Policies 
<p>Having policies in place internally that support both security and data protection are critically important for organisational compliance, and even more important is that these are communicated to all levels of the organisation, whether it’s big or small. Policies allow colleagues to understand the ‘dos and don’ts’ when it comes to handling data and are the go-to resources to identifying an escalation path when they come across an issue.</p>
<p>Basic policy structures usually comprise of the following items:</p>
 
 Information Security Policy –&nbsp;Setting out minimum security requirements for handling data in the organisation and often including a data classification procedure based on the information’s sensitivity. 
 Data Protection Management Policy – Establishing what steps need be made in protecting personally identifiable data, where a Data Protection Impact Assessment may be required, how to contact the Data Protection Officer and defined ownership of data within the organisation. 
 Data Breach Management Policy – This is a critical policy which ideally would be co-owned with your Information Security team in order to have a solid policy established that enables identification of alleged data breaches, triage, deep-dive investigation and whether notification to the authorities of impacted parties is required.

  <p>Tip: This tutorial is part of our series on how to integrate Okta with popular Infrastructure as a Code solution. If you’re not into Ansible, check out our <a>Puppet</a> and <a>Terraform</a> tutorials.</p>

<p>I love using Ansible to deploy and manage configuration at scale. However, like any other configuration management solution, Ansible works best when playbooks don’t change often. This is easy to accomplish when you manage only server artifacts and binaries, but it can get tricky if your playbooks manage user accounts and credentials that will change quite often as people join, change roles, or leave your team.</p>

<p>To overcome this, admins would typically look at distributing SSH keys or using some sort of 3rd party LDAP/AD for login.</p>

<p>Distributing SSH Keys has major maintenance implications since it requires a lot of work anytime you need to rotate keys. If you use SSH keys for user logins, the recommendation is to rotate keys often – to reduce risks in case the keys are compromised – plus every time an admin leaves the company.</p>

<p>Integrating your infra to an AD/LDAP server – usually using a PAM module – may be even more challenging, since this type of server is usually monolithic and hosted on-prem. Getting a robust integration here is a tall order. From site-to-site VPNs (making your AD available everywhere) to adding additional servers (keeping compatibility across a variety of server distros), this is the kind of pain no Ops Engineer would like to sign up for.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will overcome both issues by seamlessly injecting Okta into your Ansible Infrastructure as Code to effectively <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/07/shift-identity-left-secure-devops-automation-with-okta/">Shift Identity Left</a>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: To follow this tutorial, you need to have an Advanced Server Access (ASA) team provisioned from your Okta Org. If you don’t have an existing ASA team, you can sign up for free <a href="https://app.scaleft.com/p/signupV2">here</a>, which requires an Okta Administrator to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/setup/getting-started.htm">configure</a>.</p>

 Create a project and get an enrollment token in ASA 

<p>In Okta ASA, projects work as a collection of servers that share the same access and authorization controls. In a project, you define which users and groups from Okta can access your servers, when they can do so, and what they are allowed to do in the server (i.e. run only certain commands). Any changes in your project (users, group assignments, authorization) are periodically updated in your servers (providing idempotency for identity and access management).</p>

<p>Servers enroll in your project to apply the same security configuration using an ASA agent with a project enrollment token. The ASA agent periodically checks for updates in Okta to update the server configuration.</p>

<p>To get your servers running with Okta, let’s create a project and get an enrollment token:</p>

 
   Access Okta ASA as Administrator. 
   Click Projects and then select or create a new project. 
   Click Enrollment &gt; Create Enrollment Token. 
   Enter a name (i.e. <code>ansible-token</code>) and click Submit. 
   Copy the enrollment token: 
 

<p></p>

 Download and configure playbook 

<p>Clone our sample playbook <code>git clone https://github.com/okta-server-asa/asa-ansible-example.git</code></p>

<p>Optionally, review the <code>asa-playbook.yml</code> contents.</p>

<p>The playbook installs the Okta ASA server agent binaries. It supports multiple Linux distros using the server distro family to identify the ideal installation tasks:</p>

   <code>  tasks:     
    #INSTALL
    - name: Install Debian
      include_tasks: asa-samples/install-debian.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
    
    - name: Install RedHat
      include_tasks: asa-samples/install-redhat.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
    
    - name: Install Suse
      include_tasks: asa-samples/install-suse.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Suse"
</code>   

<p>After installing the agent binaries, the playbook:</p>

 
   Defines the name of your server in ASA (canonical name) 
   Enrolls your server into the ASA project using the enrollment token you got in the previous section 
   Starts the ASA server agent 
 

<p>Edit the <code>asa-ansible-example/asa-playbook.yml</code>. On line 3, replace <code>&lt;hosts&gt;</code> with the hosts you want to enroll in ASA:</p>

   <code>-
  name: Install SFT
  hosts: &lt;hosts&gt;
</code>   

<p>If you have SUSE Linux servers, install the Ansible Galaxy module for zypper: <code>ansible-galaxy install community.general.zypper</code></p>

 Test playbook 

<p>Now that we have the playbook set, let’s see it in action. To do this, I’ll apply the playbook on a few servers to see how it works.</p>

<p>Enroll servers using the ansible-playbook command <code>ansible-playbook asa-playbook.yml -i &lt;inventory&gt; --extra-vars "asa_enrollment_token=&lt;token&gt;"</code>.</p>

<p>Replace:</p>

 
   <code>&lt;inventory&gt;</code>: with your inventory file (or any list of servers) 
   <code>&lt;token&gt;</code>: with the enrollment token from ASA 
 

<p>Ansible will run and register your servers, and return the following:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In ASA, you will see the servers enrolled in your project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this moment, your servers are enrolled in ASA. That means you can access your servers with users and groups from Okta associated with your project.</p>

 Test access to servers with Okta 

<p>Now that all servers are enrolled in Okta, let’s access the servers as a user:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/sft.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610060131465000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1omaR8RXzvDBwm3OddiJVk">Install the ASA agent in your workstation</a> (required to access servers as a user): <code>brew install okta-advanced-server-access --cask</code></p>

<p>To set up the ASA agent, enter <code>sft enroll</code> and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>To see your servers, enter <code>sft list-servers</code>.</p>

   <code># sft list-servers
Waiting on browser...
Browser step completed successfully.
HOSTNAME                    OS_TYPE  PROJECT_NAME         ACCESS_ADDRESS

asa-ansible5-ubuntu         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.106
</code>   

<p>To ssh into your server, enter <code>sft ssh &lt;name-of-your-server&gt;</code>:</p>

   <code># sft ssh asa-ansible4-ubuntu
/home/frederico_hakamine #  
</code>   

 Wait, I have questions 

<p>What is Okta ASA doing?</p>

 
   Okta ASA secures access to Linux and Windows servers in SSH and RDP connections using the server agent (the same one that enrolled the server in your project earlier). 
   The ASA server agent, in addition to subscribing your server to a project, also works alongside native OS features such as sudo, users, and openssh to control access during runtime and to capture any login events for audit inspection. 
   Because the agent is light and does not require firewalls and monolithic LDAP or privileged access servers, it can be easily distributed across any infrastructure (IaaS, VM, or physical) and embedded in your DevOps tools. 
   To grant users access to servers, ASA operates a programmable Certificate Authority service as part of its SaaS, that issues ephemeral SSH Client Certificates for each authenticated and authorized request. The keys are issued only after ensuring both user and his/her device complies with the organization’s security policies. 
   The use of ephemeral keys provides many benefits. It eliminates the use of static keys and credentials for server access, ensures that both users and machines are audited before any new ssh connection, simplifies access revocation, eliminates the risk of “super account overuse”, and simplifies access audit. 
 

<p>Can I use this playbook with other Ansible provisioning modules?</p>

<p>Yes. You can use this sample with any other module available in <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index.html">Ansible</a> or the Ansible Galaxy. This includes provisioning modules to IaaS providers and Hypervisors, such as <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws">AWS</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/vmware">VMWare</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/google/cloud">GCP</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/openstack/cloud">OpenStack</a>, and <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/azure/azcollection">Azure</a>. To do this, use the inventory plugins available with these modules to capture the inventory of servers and tags to apply the playbook.</p>

 What’s next? 

<p>After testing the playbook on some hosts, you expand it to more servers. To do so, tweak the playbook. You can, for example, store the enrollment token in <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/vault.html">Ansible’s vault</a>, and also secure access to the Ansible controller with ASA using the same playbook. – i.e. update your <code>asa-playbook.yml</code>, changing the hosts to <code>local</code>, and then run the playbook pointing to local:</p>

<p><code>ansible-playbook  -c local -i localhost asa-playbook.yml --extra-vars "asa_enrollment_token=&lt;local&gt;"</code></p>

<p>You can also turn on additional features in Okta ASA, such as setup sudo grants, time-based access, use of bastion hosts, and SSH session capture just to name a few. All these features reduce the load on your playbooks and provide consistent account configuration across multiple servers.</p>

<p>Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, open-source blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data, discusses that while investors are integrating ESG factors into investment decisions, data privacy still remains one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today.</p><p>*NOTE* <a href="https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/why-privacy-should-be-esg-investors-next-big-priority/">originally published in Global Finance &amp; Banking&nbsp;Review</a></p><p>Investors are increasingly integrating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors into investment decisions in the hope that sustainable businesses offer less risk and long-term return on investment. Against this backdrop, data privacy and data management remains one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today.</p><p>Just recently, BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/blackrock-calls-for-climate-change-disclosure-expects-sustainable-investing-to-continue.html">predicted</a> a “tectonic shift” among investors towards sustainability-focused companies, which he believes is accelerating at an even greater speed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the largest money manager in the world, BlackRock has immense power in driving markets, however they are not alone: most large investment banks believe investing in sustainable companies is the future, a move that also helps to mitigate risk in uncertain times.</p><p>With sustainable investment surging, the risk of privacy and data breaches grows higher, as these relatively nascent investments may not have effective data management protocols in place. It is for that reason that the next big trend to join sustainable investing will be data privacy and data management.</p><p>When investors analyse companies they are thinking of investing in, they conduct thorough reviews of the companies’ finances, internal and external processes, hiring procedures, data management protocols, market position adherence to regulations such as GDPR and CCPA; the list is endless. At a time when cyber attacks and data breaches are happening more frequently than ever before, ensuring effective data management safeguards are in place is crucial to a company’s performance, especially one that is likely to receive increased investment. Investment firms must discern how the organization safeguards its system against an attack or fraud. How an organization safeguards its data against such attacks could set it apart as a waste of an investment, or a high profit deriving enterprise with sustainability at its&nbsp;core.</p><p>By integrating new measures such as Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET) and decentralized identity solutions, organizations can stay ahead of the curve and, in doing so, increase attractiveness, competitive advantage, and revenue streams. These benefits can undoubtedly be enjoyed by sustainable companies, but also by those looking to enhance their market position while playing catchup with the now more popular than ever ESG-focused companies. The popularity of sustainable investments may soon outweigh that of companies that cannot put sustainability at the forefront of their business objectives, meaning that these companies must now find other ways to remain competitive and attractive to prospective investors. Maintaining industry leading data management processes can greatly assist with&nbsp;this.</p><p>Ensuring comprehensive data management procedures is also financially beneficial for companies seeking an edge over their competitors: according to a <a href="https://www.ponemon.org/">report completed by the American Ponemon Institute</a> in 2020, the average cost of a data breach was $3.86 million. This cost, in tandem with the impact on a companies’ share price, could be devastating for many companies seeking to maximize their position. Safeguarding these procedures also makes it easier to ensure adherence to regulations such as GDPR, breaches of which bring with them significant financial implications. For example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/technology/google-europe-gdpr-fine.html">Google was fined $57 million in 2018</a> for a breach of GDPR, forcing the company to amend their data management processes. The bottom line is that effective data management makes a significant difference not only to the profitability of a company, but also to the reputation. This is similar to the reputational concerns wrought upon companies that disregard sustainability: reputational damage costs&nbsp;money.</p><p><a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3325397/idc-expect-175-zettabytes-of-data-worldwide-by-2025.html">IDC predicts</a> that by the year 2025, 175 trillion gigabytes of new data will be created around the world. With more and more people working from home, away from the often greater data protection offered by physical servers in-office, company data will be at a far more significant risk than before in years to come. As hybrid working and cloud computing become the norm, vulnerabilities will emerge and with them, hackers too. Research has shown that the greater the amount of data at stake, the greater the number of hackers that exist. Bad actors will remain a feature of the data ecosystem, but preventative measures are actionable and achievable. Companies in every industry; from sustainable investments and investment banking, to blockchain, healthcare,and commerce, can enhance their market position by adopting privacy-enhancing technology and decentralized identity solutions to ensure the risk of data breach is minimized.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/why-privacy-should-be-esg-investors-next-big-priority-4f5f15a5a986">Why Privacy Should Be ESG Investors’ Next Big Priority</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Intake<p>At Spruce, we’re building a product suite to manage all aspects of the data supply chain. Here’s the latest from our development efforts</p> Intake <p>Intake is a smarter onboarding tool for businesses via secure document collection and processing. These artifacts can then be used as evidence to generate and issue credentials to the counterparty that originally uploaded&nbsp;them.</p><p>The focus on development has been on three&nbsp;areas:</p>  Frontend styling, specifically for creating forms, and for users receiving information requests.  Event logging to give a complete picture of every action a counterparty has taken from opening a request to submitting information.  We have set up CI/CD towards end-to-end testing and continuous feature deployments.   DIDKit <p><a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a> is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>  <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">ssi</a> library released under Apache License, Version 2.0. Tagged release version&nbsp;0.1.0.  Implemented <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>  Implemented linked data proof type for Tezos DID method (<a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">did:tz</a>).  Built DIDKit CLI and HTTP server as Docker&nbsp;images.  Improved DID resolution support.  Adjusted API to allow for multiple DID methods derived from&nbsp;keypair.  DID method implementations modularized, making it easier to support more DID&nbsp;methods.  Updated Rust interfaces to use asynchronous I/O.  Documentation website launched: <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/</a>  Added more example shell&nbsp;scripts.  Added a CHAPI wallet implementation example.  Added a Spring Boot example application with sign-in powered by the previously mentioned CHAPI wallet example implementation using&nbsp;DIDKit.  Added Makefile targets to build static DIDKit library files for `aarch64-apple-ios` and `x86_64-apple-ios`.  (Unmerged) Added WASM build support using `wasm-pack`.  (Unmerged) Added Node.js build support using `neon-bindings`.   Credible <p><a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">Credible</a> is Spruce’s native credential wallet for the consumption, storage, and presentation of Verifiable Credentials on Android and&nbsp;iOS.</p>  Updated to make use of the official `v0.1.0` release of&nbsp;DIDKit.  Credible has now been built on iOS for the first time after DIDKit was updated, to build for `aarch64-apple-ios` and `x86_64-apple-ios`.  The settings were updated to include a personal profile page and pages with various notices (privacy, terms and conditions, licenses, etc).  There is now a DID sharing option available for&nbsp;users.   did-doge <p>As a quick experiment to demonstrate method interoperability, we’ve put together a <a href="https://did-doge.spruceid.com/">draft specification</a> for a <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/did-doge">DID Method</a> for the Dogecoin blockchain. Additionally, we plan on making a light rust implementation that integrates with&nbsp;DIDKit.</p><p>Our specification draws heavily from the work on <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">did:btcr</a> due to structural similarities. We managed to further improve upon the did:btcr spec with new privacy-preserving benefits.</p><p>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact">leave us a message</a>, and we will respond within 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

				 <p>This article is part of a growing set of articles called Pattern Breakers. This series helps highlight how the world’s pattern breakers change the world around them. The articles provide tactical and strategic approaches to breaking the patterns that are holding back your novel technologies. Each of the articles in the series will be adjusted and updated over time.&nbsp;</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Let’s imagine you have created something that changes the world. Your approach to solving problems is radically different and far more effective and efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can describe how your technology can be used to solve really hard problems – making them easy.&nbsp;You know it truly changes the world.</p>
<p>But you can’t make progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of the world beating a path to your door, you’re pushing harder and harder to make minimal progress.</p>
<p>Your marketing, business development, and sales teams talk about all the excitement in the field. But your tech doesn’t create blowout projects. You give your kit away, you pay for organizations to use it, you get paid to deploy.</p>
<p>…but the momentum doesn’t come. In fact you’re feeling like you haven’t moved at all – or moved backwards.</p>
<p>Your API is amazing and developers rave about how easy it is to use and how thoughtful it is. Your SDK works on iOS and Android and is a thing of beauty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means it likely isn’t your technology – though there are most certainly pieces in the technology that can be improved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your big problem is that you are breaking an existing pattern.&nbsp;Patterns help people understand complex things. They are there to simplify things – including the change required to get to a given state. If you’re asking to break a pattern you’re breaking the comfort with the existing pattern.</p>
<p>Being a Pattern Breaker is hard. You’re facing many obstacles.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inertia – Your potential customers are either solving their problems a different (harder, less efficient) way and it is working; or they have put the problem in a “too hard to solve” bucket. 
 Hysteresis – Organizations are like organisms. Changes in one area cause things to shift and the organism works to bring things back to its known state. 
 Early Adopters – they aren’t what you think you need. 
 Old Way Works Well Enough – this is partly momentum and partly messaging. 
 Don’t Grok It – You think they understand what you’re presenting but they don’t. (hint: if your customer groks the word “grok” you’re probably talking to the wrong person. 
 Momentum – more physics here – you need momentum to overcome the inertia in existing systems. 
 Incremental Change Isn’t Exciting – incremental change where percentages point improvements are all you can see are hard to convince. Tweaking the old ways is how we look to solve this kind of problem not big change. 
 
<p>Over time the bullets above will be fleshed out with discrete articles – with strategies and tactics that help you look at the situation better. This is the framework that we use with our clients. They have been applied for over a decade with success in some of the hardest organizational areas. While some approaches are simple, it is the subtle use and application that makes all the difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep being awesome.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Darrell</p>

<p>Vanaf vandaag, 4 februari, accepteert ook Woonnu brondata via Ockto bij het beoordelen van hypotheekaanvragen. Hierdoor versnelt het hypotheektraject doordat er 2 documenten minder aangeleverd hoeven te worden, de gegevens in één keer goed zijn en ze gemakkelijk digitaal kunnen worden opgehaald en aangeleverd bij Woonnu. Het gaat om data van UWV, Mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl en MijnOverheid.nl. Dat betekent dat het handmatig aanleveren van de werkgeversverklaring en Mijnpensioenoverzicht (MPO) voor de hypotheekaanvraag overbodig is. Een flinke stap in de digitalisering van de hypotheekaanvraag bij Woonnu.</p>



 Snel een volledig klantbeeld 



<p>Intermediairs kunnen met Ockto hun klanten op een eenvoudige, veilige en efficiënte manier gegevens laten aanleveren die zij nodig hebben voor het maken van het hypotheekadvies, de inventarisatie. Niet alleen van het UWV en Mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl, maar ook van MijnOverheid.</p>



 Hypotheekacceptatie op basis van brondata 



<p>Woonnu en hypotheekverwerker Quion zetten met het gebruik maken van brondata via Ockto een stap in het versnellen van het hypotheekacceptatieproces. Op deze manier hoeven er minder documenten los aangeleverd te worden, wat de foutkans verkleint. Bij Woonnu gaat het om de werkgeversverklaring en het pensioenoverzicht, daarbij hoeft het legitimatiebewijs pas bij het bindend kredietaanbod aangeleverd te worden. De stukkenlijst geeft vervolgens aan welke documenten nog wel aangeleverd moeten worden.</p>



 Toekomstbeeld: documentloze hypotheekacceptatie 



<p>Woonnu streeft naar een zo volledig mogelijke digitalisering van de hypotheekaanvraag. Dit is een eerste stap in deze richting. Op termijn zullen er meer gegevens op basis van brondata gevalideerd kunnen worden. Het doel is te komen op een hypotheekacceptatie zonder losse documenten.</p>



 Over de Ockto en de Brondata Service 



<p>Steeds meer partijen bieden mogelijkheden aan om digitaal informatie te delen, maar vaak ieder op zijn eigen manier. Daarom heeft Ockto samen met diverse ketenpartners de <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/hypotheekacceptatie/">Brondata Service</a> ontwikkeld. Met deze nieuwe standaard kan de consument zijn data veilig delen met verschillende partijen binnen de hypotheekketen.</p>



 Over Woonnu 



<p>Woonnu B.V. is een Nederlandse hypotheekaanbieder opgericht in 2020 en is een zelfstandige dochter van Nationale-Nederlanden Bank N.V. (NN Bank). Woonnu biedt eigentijdse hypotheekoplossingen voor de aankoop en/of verduurzaming van woningen en beloont duurzaam wonen met een duurzaamheidskorting op de hypotheekrente. Met Woonnu speelt NN Bank in op de toenemende vraag naar platformen waarbij institutionele investeerders in de Nederlandse hypotheekmarkt kunnen stappen. Het is een hybride regie platform, waarbij financiering niet alleen komt vanuit investeerders. Ook NN Bank zelf is investeerder. Als platform biedt Woonnu hiermee investeerders de mogelijkheid om samen de vergroening van de Nederlandse woningmarkt te financieren.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Oh, how time flies! It seems that the whole story of Zero Trust as a revolutionary concept for designing computer networks began just yesterday, but it’s been over a decade already. In fact, the very idea that was later somewhat awkwardly named “de-perimeterization” was being discussed nearly 20 years ago. Back then, in the early 2000s, years before the era of the cloud and ubiquitous presence of smart mobile devices, organizations were already feeling the pressure to reorganize their networks for the digital transformation – establishing communications to their partners, contractors, and even customers, building API-based public interfaces to their data siloes and embracing the early ideas of Internet-scale computing.</p>
<p>In 2009, John Kindervag, back then with the analyst firm Forrester, has come up with the idea that networks should be designed without implicit trust, enforcing strict identity verification and least-privilege access policies for every user, device, or application, regardless of whether they are located in the former local area network or somewhere on the Internet. The deceptive simplicity of the idea and the catchy name appealed to both industry experts and the public, and for over a decade Zero Trust has been one of the hottest buzzwords in IT.</p>
 Zero Trust: so close and yet so elusive 
<p>Alas, it seems that Zero Trust has been also one of the most elusive buzzwords as well. Back in the same 2009, Google has introduced BeyondCorp, a security framework created as a result of a sophisticated cyberattack on their internal infrastructure and aimed to prevent similar breaches in the future. BeyondCorp shifted access controls from the perimeter to individual devices and users. In a sense, it was a reference implementation of Zero Trust that the company has deployed internally. Now everyone wanted to be like Google!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, being like Google turned out to be somewhat complicated to achieve. Most organizations were looking for off-the-shelf solutions that would completely replace their existing network infrastructures: they were planning on “buying Zero Trust”. Turned out, Zero Trust doesn’t work this way. The very foundational principles of the concept show that Zero Trust is not a product or even a technology – first and foremost it requires a major paradigm shift in many aspects of IT and even core business processes of an organization. The only sensible way to achieve Zero Trust is a long journey where every step solves a specific problem and also strategically brings you a bit closer to the “holy grail”.</p>
 The gift that keeps on giving 
<p>On the bright side, however, even if the concept itself turned out to be quite hard to get hold of, it has created entirely new markets for innovative security, compliance, and IAM solutions. Without Zero Trust, we would not have software-defined networking and microsegmentation, no cloud access security brokers (CASB), and definitely no Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platforms. And when the COVID pandemic radically changed our society, the solutions that evolved from the original concept have made our lives a bit easier and safer.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a hundred years before Zero Trust, Vladimir Lenin once said: “The electron is just as inexhaustible as the atom, nature is infinite…”. Well, it seems that this idea is just as applicable to the notion of Zero Trust: over a decade after its conception, it keeps on giving…</p>
<p>But why am I writing this post anyway? Well, two things. First, last week Google has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp-enterprise">BeyondCorp Enterprise</a>, the direct descendant of their original Zero Trust solution. Some of the new features include agentless design (in fact, Google Chrome will be the platform’s agent, but you probably have it already), integrated threat and data protection, and simplified deployment. It seems that after 12 years in development, Google believes that Zero Trust has finally reached the product stage. Is it too ambitious a claim?</p>
 Come to the Zero Trust side 
<p>Hopefully, we’ll find out soon how BeyondCorp Enterprise fares against competitors – after all, the Zero Trust market is already pretty crowded, with both large companies like Microsoft, Cisco, or Akamai and more specialized vendors like Okta or Pulse Secure already have their own solutions to all your Zero Trust needs. When it comes to the potential ease of deployment and agentless operations, one could, for example, argue that Microsoft's ubiquitous presence on desktops (with Windows), in data centers (with Active Directory), and in the cloud (with Azure AD and Office 365) would make it an even <a href="https://aka.ms/ztguide">more enticing choice</a> for customers.</p>
<p>After all, the key obstacle to adopting Zero Trust beyond just standalone “quick win” deployments is the need to make the model work in every layer of your IT, from devices and networks to applications and data. Without a carefully planned strategy, it may end up wasting enormous efforts and resources. But how to avoid a Zero Trust disappointment?</p>
<p>Well, here comes a great opportunity to find it out yourself! KuppingerCole is planning an online event on Zero Trust on February 17th, with a focus on “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/zero-trust-reality">Making Zero Trust a Reality</a>”. We’ll be discussing a broad range of topics and technologies that enable or are enabled by Zero Trust and show how they can solve the very tangible challenges your company is facing during these difficult times.</p>

<p>Crypto News Flash: Development activity is the raisin d’etre for blockchain platforms. Those projects that manage to attract developers often find it a snowball effect, where a few successful launches serve as a showcase of the platform’s potential, which attracts more developers. One example of where this is visible is in the Ardor blockchain, which launched in early 2018. Over the last three years, Jelurida, the Swiss software development company that operates Ardor, has been working hard to attract developers. As Ardor now supports a multitude of real-world use cases, the work has paid off, with more activity on the way in 2021. Achieving a balance between ready-made features and near-limitless customization options has paid off for Ardor. The platform has become a hub of development activity, with numerous applications gaining traction</p>

<p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>Here’s a quick update on KILT’s plans for the next few months as we get closer to mainnet launch. We’ll continue to update you on milestones and partnerships via this blog, our <a href="http://twitter.com/kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> channels and our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/newsletter/">newsletter</a>. But first, a brief overview.</p><p>KILT provides a base layer for verifiable credentials in the Web 3.0 world. We’re building a permissionless trust infrastructure for real-world business cases like our <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/fractal-kilt-protocol-and-polkadex-collaborate-to-provide-decentralised-kyc-solution-for-exchange-d9d0f8c18163">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://thelosangelestribune.com/2021/01/20/degenics-com-aims-to-provide-anonymous-personal-genetic-testing-through-a-decentralized-blockchain-platform/">genetics testing</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-france-gaia-x-cloud-platform-eu-tech-sovereignty/">cloud computing</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">energy</a> partnerships. We’re also exploring collaborations in climate change and&nbsp;gaming.</p><p>Why does KILT need a parachain?<br>The opportunity to launch on Kusama and iterate with other fast-moving Polkadot projects is very attractive. A Kusama parachain could provide core functionality for KILT including:</p>  The ability to finalise blocks and thus secure our network, even while KILT is backed by a relatively small collator network. This provides extra security to the KILT Blockchain.  KILT would be able to provide its DIDs (Decentralised Identifiers) and Verifiable Credentials through the Relay Chain to other parachain projects inside the ecosystem.  This would provide enormous network effects for the KILT Blockchain.  KILT would soon be able to utilise functionality from other parachains, such as smart contract systems and&nbsp;oracles.  <p>We aim to go live with a Kusama parachain as soon as possible, because many ecosystem projects intend to use KILT functionality and we want to provide this at the earliest possible&nbsp;time.</p><p>Consequently we will participate in the first Kusama parachain auctions, and aim to start our mainnet on Kusama shortly after securing a parachain slot. We also anticipate the development of a Kusama to Polkadot bridge, which would enable us to provide the KILT functionality to Polkadot parachain projects.</p><p>For this reason we decided to switch around the launches of KILT and Polimec. KILT mainnet will now launch first. Later we plan to launch an upgraded version of Polimec that already incorporates KILT functionality.</p><p>What’s scheduled next</p>  KILT secures parachain slot on Rococo (29 January&nbsp;2021)  Parity team launches Kusama parachain auction&nbsp;timeline  KILT wins auction to secure parachain slot on&nbsp;Kusama  KILT implements mainnet, PoS migration and governance  Polimec upgraded version&nbsp;launches  KILT roadmap — how we plan to roll out KILT Protocol (click to enlarge or view on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/parachains/">kilt.io</a>)<p>With the Kusama parachain, KILT shall gradually go live as a fully decentralised protocol. We’re excited about the new possibilities for our partners, builders and the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Later KILT may bid for a Polkadot parachain slot and move the KILT Parachain to the Polkadot network. This possible upgrade is one of the decisions to be made by the KILT community, via the protocol’s future governance model.</p><p>Initial KILT Collator Programme</p><p>And as we move from testnet to mainnet, KILT plans to start the Initial KILT Collator Programme in February. If you are interested in running a KILT collator node, please email us at collators@kilt.io.</p>

 January Edition <p>Welcome to our monthly roundup — January edition, as always I’m bringing you the scoop of the month. If you have been reading the regular updates we share in Telegram or Twitter, you probably already know that we’ve now got a working Elemental Chat application and that we are hard at work preparing the Holochain and Holo infrastructure so that we can release it to all hosts. We are almost&nbsp;there!</p><p>If you’re wondering what exactly we’ve been working on at Holo and Holochain this past month — the wait is over! Let’s jump right&nbsp;in.</p> New Year, New&nbsp;Energy <p>The first Dev Pulse of the new year is going to be a short one. That’s not because nothing’s happening — in fact, it’s partly because there’s a lot going on, and I need to get back to it. Holochain RSM is growing up, and it’s time for both veteran and new devs to start developing on it. (That means that new developer documentation is coming&nbsp;soon!)</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 88 — <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/new-year-new-energy/">New Year, New&nbsp;Energy</a></p> Testing, Testing, Testing (and some goodies for developers) <p>The big focus of the last couple weeks has been testing Holochain, by way of testing Elemental Chat on HoloPorts. We’ve narrowed down the scenarios where performance decreases, and we’re doubling down on making Holochain work well in those scenarios.</p><p>I’ve also got a grab bag of news for developers — tools, promises of tools, and breaking changes in Holochain that should make your life a bit&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 89 — <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/testing-testing-testing-and-some-goodies-for-developers/">Testing, Testing, Testing (and some goodies for developers)</a></p> Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Yes, you read that right! We are actually ahead of where we expected to be in some ways. While it is taking a while to complete infrastructure testing because that is one of the most complex aspects of our work, we have been able to move many other activities forward. Because of that we decided to shift the HoloFuel application up in the roadmap. Here is what it looks like with the new changes. <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">Check it out on our website where you will find more&nbsp;details</a>.</p> Holochain RSM Migration Guide <p>while there’s not a lot of code samples in the guide, it does point out ways that we’ve been able to learn things over the past couple years. We’ve been able to leverage Rust in better ways for the SDK, which means app devs are able to cut their code 50–60% and write more ergonomic code in the process. We’re also taking advantage of advances in concurrency libs from the Rust ecosystem to remove deadlocks and race conditions and generally make this crazy distributed computing thing more efficient.</p><p>So the migration guide + the HDK docs (not available online, unfortunately), plus the new holochain codebase might be interesting for other RiB devs to explore. <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/blog/holochain-rsm-migration-guide/">Check out evolving Migration Guide from Redux to&nbsp;RSM</a></p> Regular Holo Dev Updates on&nbsp;Twitter <p>If you are curious about the — hot from the press dev updates — those can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_">Twitter</a>.</p> Low Code&nbsp;Zone <p>A series focusing on simple hApp dev solutions for real humans.

One such signature scheme is known as CL signature that is named after its <a href="https://jan.camenisch.org/">Jan Camenisch</a> and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/">Anna Lysyanskaya</a> in a series of papers from 2001 to 2004 [CL01, CL02, CL03, CL04]. CL signature popularized Anoncreds, and it also served as a cryptographic building block in Identity Mixer (Idemix) and Hyperledger Indy projects.</p><p>Here, we first discuss two important concepts for understanding CL signature—the discrete logarithm problem and cryptographic commitment—and then outline subprotocols of CL signature. Finally, the application of CL signature on selective disclosure is discussed.</p> Discrete Logarithm Problem <p>Given real numbers y and a, the value of m from an expression y=a^m can be calculated by evaluating a logarithm of y to base a, i.e. m=log_a(y). The term m = log_a(y) can be easily calculated when all a,m,y&gt;=0 are Real numbers. However, when y and a are members of a sufficiently large discrete group G, finding m becomes extremely difficult. This is known as the discrete logarithm problem, which serves as the foundation of many modern cryptographic protocols, including CL-signature.</p> Cryptographic Commitment <p>A commitment scheme is a cryptographic protocol that allows one to commit to a message while keeping it hidden to other parties, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. A commitment scheme that is considered here is known as the Pedersen commitment. In its simplified version, a commitment c of a message m is simply c = a^m where a is a member of a large discrete group G. The commitment c can be sent to another person, called the receiver, and the receiver will not be able to calculate m due to the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.</p><p>At a later time, the message m can then be revealed to the receiver. The receiver then verifies that the message m is really the one that was committed by checking that the expression a^m is really equal to&nbsp;c.</p><p>A more detailed discussion on Pedersen commitment can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/ped">here</a>.</p> CL signature <p>Originally, CL signature is based on the strong RSA (SRSA) assumption. As a result, its key sizes are very long to provide sufficient security against ever faster prime factorization algorithms and computers. There has been an improvement on this issue by using paring-based cryptography.</p><p>Here, for simplicity, we discuss the signing algorithm base on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_RSA_assumption">strong RSA (SRSA) assumption</a>. We consider two parties, namely an issuer, a holder, and a verifier. The issuer signs a signature on blocks of messages (or attributes) for the holder, and the holder then shares the messages together with the signature to the verifier. We assume that the holder has L messages m_1, m_2, m_3,&nbsp;…, m_L. The CL signature scheme consists of 3&nbsp;steps:</p>  Key generation  Signature generation  Signature verification   1. Key generation (Issuer) <p>First, the issuer generates two random numbers {p,q} that form a secret key. From the private key p and q&nbsp;, the issuer calculates</p><p>and then generate L+2 random numbers from a quadratic residue modulo&nbsp;n</p><p>The variables a_1, a_2, a_3,&nbsp;..., a_L, b, c, n form a public key for the&nbsp;issuer.</p> 2. Signature generation (Issuer) <p>First, the issuer generates a random prime e and random number s&nbsp;. Given input L messages m_1, m_2, m_3,&nbsp;…, m_L, the issuer computes the value v such&nbsp;that</p><p>The variables(e, s, v) forms the signature of the input L messages m_1, m_2, m_3,&nbsp;…, m_L&nbsp;.</p> 3. Signature verification (Holder and Verifier) <p>Given the signature (e,s,v) of messages m_1,&nbsp;..., m_L the holder can use the issuer’s public key a_1, a_2, a_3,&nbsp;..., a_L, b, c, n to verify that the signature is generated correctly by checking that the LHS and RHS of the following equation are&nbsp;equal.</p><p>After the holder is in possession of the signature, the holder can then share the messages m_1,&nbsp;..., m_L and the signature (e,s,v) with the verifier. The verifier can then use the issuer’s public key and follow the same signature verification algorithm to verify&nbsp;that</p>  the signature is really signed by the&nbsp;issuer  the messages m_1,&nbsp;..., m_L have not been changed or tampered with since the moment the signature is generated.  <p>This process allows the messages to be tamper-proof.</p> Selective disclosure <p>In the signature generation and signature verification algorithms above, the holder has an option to&nbsp;either:</p>  directly send a message m_i to the signer/verifier, and the signer/verifier can then compute (a_i ^ m_i) mod n;&nbsp;or  compute (a_i^m_i) mod n, which is the commitment of m_i, and sends it to the signer/verifier.  <p>Given the hardness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm">discrete logarithm problem</a>, the signer/verifier will not be able to compute the holder’s m_i from the commitmenta_i^m_i mod n. Therefore, the holder can selectively disclose which message(s) (or attributes) are revealed to the issuer/verifier. As a result, the issuer is capable of generating a valid signature without full knowledge of all messages. Similarly, the verifier is capable of verifying that the holder really possesses the messages even if the verifier does not gain full knowledge of all messages.</p><p>For example, the holder possesses 3 messages m_1, m_2, m_3. The holder could reveal m_1, m_2 and send a_3^m_3 mod n to the issuer to sign. Once the holder obtains the signature from the issuer. The holder can reveal m_2 and sends a_1^m_1 mod n, a_3^m_3 mod n together with the signature to the verifier. The verifier can finally verify that the holder possesses valid m_1, m_2, m_3—that have not been tampered with—even without the knowledge of m_1,&nbsp;m_3.</p><p>These capabilities laid the foundation for realizing and popularizing Anoncreds. In the final part of <a href="https://medium.com/finema/anonymous-credential-part-3-bbs-signature-26797721ca74">this series</a>, we discuss a sophisticated signature scheme for Anoncreds, which is known as the BBS+ signature.</p> References <p>[CL01] Jan Camenisch and Anna Lysyanskaya.

<p>After completing many major milestones in 2020, the Dock team is looking forward to another year of building innovative solutions, driving adoption, and engaging with our community.</p><p>Today we’re excited to share our <a href="https://www.dock.io/roadmap">updated roadmap</a> for 2021, which aims to take further steps for removing inefficiencies and centralized control from the issuance and management of credentials. In addition to working toward this goal, we will continue our efforts to increase adoption of the Dock offerings through enhanced features and user experience.</p><p>Below are high-level descriptions of the upcoming milestones:</p><p>Smart Contract Deployment (Q1)</p><p>We are leveraging <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier">Parity’s frontier project</a> to integrate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the Dock mainnet. Once this task is completed, it will be possible to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity on Dock and interact with them using existing Ethereum libraries such as Web3. This will also enable us to integrate Dock with <a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a> and price our network services in USD (further discussed below). As part of the milestone, we will be sharing an example of deploying a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Dock network as well.</p><p>Ledger Wallet Support (Q1)</p><p>The team has been hard at work to enable users to store the new Dock mainnet token on <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s">Ledger Nano S</a> hardware wallet. At the time of writing, we have submitted a new app for DOCK support to the Ledger team and are waiting for the review process to be completed. We will keep the community posted on our progress and release detailed instructions once this milestone is completed.</p><p>Delegatable Credentials (Q1)</p><p>We are currently working on a feature that will enable credential issuers to delegate, to other entities, the ability to issue and revoke verifiable credentials. We expect this feature to serve many important use cases in which a central entity (e.g., government) allows other groups (e.g., private test centers) to manage verifiable credentials (e.g., professional license) on its behalf.</p><p>Chainlink Oracle Integration (Q1)</p><p>Dock is integrating <a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a> to our mainnet using its <a href="https://data.chain.link/">price feeds</a>, so that the services on the network can be priced in USD. Read our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-integrating-chainlink-to-price-credential-services-in-usd/">earlier blog post</a> to learn more.</p><p>Dock Token Migration Ends (Q1)</p><p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-token-migration-part-4-the-migration-begins/">earlier post</a>, the Dock token migration will end at midnight (GMT) on March 31st, 2021, and all token holders must swap their ERC20 tokens to the new, native tokens before then.</p><p>Proof of Stake (Q2)</p><p>During the second quarter of 2021, we will further decentralize and democratize the Dock network governance by transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus protocol and allowing token holders to vote on key decisions. More details are available <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/gov-pos">here</a>. This phase will also provide the community with one of our most requested features, <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">staking</a>.</p><p>Dock Server and Wallet (Q2)</p><p>We’ve received lots of valuable feedback from the community over the past year, and many users have requested that we provide a wallet with which they can easily store and manage Dock tokens and credentials. As a starting point for this effort, we will build the cloud version of the Dock wallet, run on the Dock server.</p><p>Dock App v0.1 (Q3)</p><p>In Q3 of 2021, we will deliver a cross-platform app that serves as the mobile version of the Dock wallet. The app will allow users to store Dock tokens, send and receive tokens, as well as present verifiable credentials from their devices. The first version of the app will be launched as a private alpha, and as discussed below, tested intensively before being evolved into a beta version.</p><p>Dock App v0.2 (Q4)</p><p>Once the first version of the app is completed, the team will invite a select group of community members to try it and provide feedback. We will then build a new iteration, version 0.2, based on the user feedback. We plan on performing extensive penetration testing on the app at this stage as well, and distributing the new version to a wider audience once completed.<br></p><p>Our team is looking forward to achieving these exciting milestones and continuing to grow Dock’s offerings. We will, as always, keep the community updated through our blog (to which you can subscribe below) and social media channels.</p>

			<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.engage.hoganlovells.com/knowledgeservices/viewContent.action?key=Ec8teaJ9VaqgJXpiSpeTQMxgHJMKLFEppVpbbVX%2B3OXcP3PYxlq7sZUjdbSm5FIetvAtgf1eVU8%3D&amp;nav=FRbANEucS95NMLRN47z%2BeeOgEFCt8EGQ0qFfoEM4UR4%3D&amp;emailtofriendview=true&amp;freeviewlink=true">Luxembourg’s regulator, the CSSF, adopted a bill</a> that explicitly recognised the possibility of using distributed ledger technology for the dematerialisation of securities.</p>
<p>The regulation is moving quickly across Europe: Tokenized securities now fall under the same rules and regulations as traditional financial instruments in many other European countries including <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/content/dam/cliffordchance/briefings/2020/10/security-token-offerings-a-european-perspective-on-regulation.pdf">France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK</a>.</p>
 What will this new bill in Luxembourg mean for tokenized securities?&nbsp; 
<p>The Bill is a continuation of the law passed in 1 March 2019. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after it was introduced we saw a surge in demand from financial institutions in the region. Curiosity was sparked in Luxembourg and in wider European markets. Most importantly, it gave market actors the confidence they needed to start utilising the technology operationally. In the coming months, we expect the same to happen across the industry due to this recent regulatory development.</p>
 How can market actors adopt the technology? 
<p>For market actors to adopt the technology and benefit from the automation and transferability improvements, they need to do so in a compliant manner. Control and regulations still needs to be enforced. Therefore, proven and open-source security token standards like the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX protocol</a> are essential as they allow assets to be represented on the blockchain compliantly. They enable agents appointed by the issuer to exercise control over assets and ensure the securities can only be held by eligible investors.</p>
 What do we expect to happen in the year ahead?&nbsp; 
<p>We believe the regulation will give even more confidence to the financial services sector in Luxembourg and beyond. So far, Luxembourg has been one of the most proactive jurisdictions in Europe with its first law in 2019. However, this needed to be developed and last week’s law will bring more clarity and more confidence to asset owners. Real estate closed-end funds are currently the asset class that benefits the most from this new form of securities and we expect this to accelerate in 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://tokeny.com/weinvest-leverages-blockchain-technology-to-increase-its-real-estate-funds-value-proposition/">WeInvest</a>, <a href="https://www.finimmo.com/">Finimmo</a>, and <a href="https://tokeny.com/digibrixx-democratizes-real-estate-via-tokenization/">Digibrixx</a> are already tokenizing real estate assets in Luxembourg, showing the way for digitization to other fund servicers.</p>

  <p>Without question, comparing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce identity and access management (IAM)</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga">identity governance and administration (IGA) </a>providers is a massive undertaking. The stakes are high to meet digital transformation requirements, support and secure a remote workforce, and be prepared for future disruptions. And, sadly, ramifications of a poor IAM and IGA purchase decision live long.</p>

<p>You need to evaluate IAM and IGA providers not only for their ability to meet your current requirements, but also those to come. But, what are they? And, how do you know you’re asking the right RFP questions for your unique needs?</p>

<p>We’re here to help with a highly informative <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/workforce-iam-eval-guide">Workforce IAM Evaluation Guide</a>. The guide starts with a review of what to look for in an IAM and IGA solution in order to address <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/modernizing-workforce-iam">today and tomorrow’s workforce demands and trends</a>. For example:</p>

  Enabling remote work with trusted internal apps that can be accessed anywhere 
	 Giving users secure and appropriate levels of access to resources, systems, and apps while constantly verifying that access at scale 
	 Opening externally to third-party systems, apps, and identity-driven API ecosystems 
	 Securing digital workplace IoT “things,” such as robotics and sensors, as well as their associated data and system integrations 
	 Enabling a seamless migration of identities across systems to support evolving needs, such as reorganization or mergers and acquisitions 
	 Decreasing the strain on IT departments, resources, and administrators 
 <p>The guide also discusses that, in order to achieve all of the above and more, an IAM and IGA solution should include a series of strategic identity components that go beyond the basics of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">single sign on</a> <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">(SSO)</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/tag/multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>, authorization, and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, in order to ensure that you give users secure and appropriate levels of access to resources, systems, and apps and constantly verify that access at scale, you need a solution that takes the basic identity components ‘identity management’ and ‘identity governance’ to the next level. This includes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with your current identity systems. Using AI and ML, you can quickly collect and analyze identity data such as accounts, roles, and entitlements to identify security access and risk blind spots, as well as assist managers and approvers who conduct access reviews and approvals. The result is not only improved remote workforce security and operational inefficiency, but reduced costs as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet, how would you know to ask providers about this capability if you don’t know it exists?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asking the right IAM and IGA questions in your RFPs has long term consequences for your organization. The right purchase decision can result in:</p>

  An empowered and efficient workforce 
	 Reduced risk and fraud 
	 Accelerated legacy modernization and digital transformation 
	 Improved regulatory compliance 
	 Reduced costs 
 <p>So, now that you are aware of AI- and ML-informed IGA here are several RFP questions you should ask providers:</p>

  Does the provider offer AI and ML capabilities to extend the governance functionality? 
	 Can the AI engine consume data from other sources?&nbsp; 
	 Is the solution flexible enough to work with other IAM solutions and data sources, or is it limited to the provider’s platform only? 
 <p>ForgeRock has a fannatical commitment to our customers’ success. We wrote the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/workforce-iam-eval-guide">Workforce IAM Evaluation Guide</a> so you can be sure you cover all your bases when evaluating and comparing identity solution providers. It includes a list of basic and strategic IAM and IGA components, definitions (written in layman’s terms for those on your team unfamiliar with identity), as well as RFP questions to help make your selection process easier and comprehensive.</p>

<p>If you’re in the process of evaluating workforce IAM and IGA providers, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/workforce-iam-eval-guide">download our guide</a> and please let us know how we can further assist.</p>
