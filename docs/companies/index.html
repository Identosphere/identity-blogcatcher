 Stakers can claim DF3 rewards. DF4 counting has&nbsp;begun.  1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (LPs / stakers) for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 3 (DF3) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF3 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 30, 2022, and ended 11:59pm Wed Jul 6, 2022 (one week later). 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were available. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>DF Round 4 (DF4) is also part of DF Alpha phase. DF3 counting started 12:01am Thu Jul 7, 2022, and will end on 11:59pm Wed Jul 13, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards is available.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, then details on DF3 and&nbsp;DF4.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF3 Input Parameters <p>DF3 is the third week of DF overall, and third week of DF Alpha. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>DF3 parameters were the same as DF1. The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included these parameters. Then, “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-examples-c2d67a17b5f5">Ocean Data Farming Examples: DF1</a>” provided examples to better understand earnings, against the DF1 rewards formula and related settings.</p><p>We fixed a bug that affected results. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c#">In DF Launch</a> and since, we’ve specified “APY ≤ 125% for each LP at each pool”. That is, the maximum possible reward for an LP in a given pool is bounded by the amount staked in that pool (amount staked * WPY, where WPY = 1.5717%). Up until the fix, we’d only been bounding APY globally (stake of all LPs at once), rather than locally ( per-LP per-pool). We caught this bug, and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/commit/57f9662afce25412c3e186e0f48a2df68b1d396a">fixed&nbsp;it</a>.</p><p>Practically speaking, this meant that 5570.59 OCEAN was dispensed, rather than the 10000.0 OCEAN available. This is because in the pools that had consume volume, stakers didn’t stake enough to hit the max rewards. In fact, of the &gt;3M OCEAN staked in Ocean Market, &gt;1M was staked on pools which had no consumes at all. The rewards not dispensed remain in the OceanDAO treasury for future DF rewards or other community programs.</p> 4. DF4 Input Parameters <p>The rewards formula and related settings for DF4 are the same as for&nbsp;DF1-DF3.</p><p>This may not always be the case: we can expect round-to-round evolution of the Reward Function and related settings, based on learnings.</p> 5. DF3 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>OceanONDA V4 currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon and EWC had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;those.</p><p>Exchange rate was 0.1718 OCEAN/USD, taken from Binance&nbsp;API.</p>  Total Stake (averaged across 7 days). Polygon 1,691,705 OCEAN, EWC 3849 OCEAN, total 1,695,554 OCEAN ($291,296 USD).  Total DCV (total across 7 days). Polygon 2253.3 OCEAN, EWC 2.30 OCEAN, total 2255.6 OCEAN ($387.51&nbsp;USD).  OCEAN rewarded to LPs. Polygon 5570.2 OCEAN, EWC 0.336 OCEAN, total 5570.59&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Rewards Stats. Rewards were dispensed to 110 LPs. The largest reward was 1467.52 OCEAN, average 51.11 OCEAN, median 0.4401&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>For more info yet, see the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:1d84394247d2a0ef463048b6a5aa9b580d9402bfd846550853f00079cd2fdc6c">DF3 csvs</a> published as a free asset in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> 8. Conclusion <p>DF3 has completed. To claim DF3 rewards, go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF4 counting has&nbsp;begun.</p> Further Reading <p>The post <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Ocean Data Farming Series</a> collects together key articles, and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> for project announcements.

<p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s some of the latest from our development efforts:</p> Sign-In with Ethereum <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  We're currently in the process of designing and implementing a method of delegating object capabilities to a session key using a SIWE message. For more on session keys, check out:  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/from-sign-in-with-ethereum-to-session-keys/">  From Sign-In with Ethereum to Session Keys  Session keys let users root all their digital interactions to their keys.  SpruceWayne Chang    </a>  We are currently working various fixes across our libraries such as an update for our Discourse plugin, updating some of our examples, and are in the process of releasing <code>v2.0.4</code> of our SIWE core library.   As mentioned in our previous update, our <a href="http://oidc.signinwithethereum.org/">community run identity</a> server via the ENS DAO has had a witnessed deployment and is currently set up on Cloudflare along with relevant access for witnesses. Additionally, the Sign-In with Ethereum documentation has been updated to point to this new server.  We are currently finishing work with a major wallet on a direct Sign-In with Ethereum integration, and are currently working on how Sign-In with Ethereum can support non-standard verification methods.   We're currently working on a new, ergonomic way to use Sign-In with Ethereum and session management for applications, and are currently in the process of setting up beta testing. If you're interested in trying this out, <a href="mailto:hello@spruceid.com">please get in touch</a>.   Kepler <p>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your Web3 wallet.</p>  We've rewrote the core SDK functionality in Rust, refactored out some core definitions from <code>kepler</code> to <code>kepler-lib</code>, and added support for CACAO-ZCAPs (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/116">kepler #116</a>)   We've implemented better bundling of the Wasm SDK dependency to improve developer experience, removing the need for specific configuration downstream.

(<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/447">ssi#447</a>).  Various minor improvements and fixes.   Rebase   We have deployed the first demo example of a Rebase frontend that allows users to go through various workflows that result in the user receiving a valid Verifiable Credential.   The demo features credential workflows for Twitter accounts, GitHub accounts, DNS ownership, and demonstrating ownership over two Ethereum wallets.   We've fully documented the architecture, and have added guides on implementing new signers, witness flows, and schemas. This information will also be added to the core SpruceID documentation.   Our next step here is to contribute this codebase to the Rebase community initiative, allowing any organization to issue Rebase credentials.   Standards and Community   We congratulate the Decentralized Identity community on the DID-core specification moving forward to become a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/06/DIDRecommendationDecision.html">W3C recommendation</a>.    <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Through SpruceID and Kepler, Spruce provides an ecosystem of open source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place that they control, and show their cards however they want.

 Vinay Gupta, CEO of Mattereum and Ethereum launch co-ordinator in 2015 looks at how to survive the Crypto Winter and come out the other end with new&nbsp;purpose <p>Around 2017 I was looking at starting a VC fund. I didn’t know exactly how to do it: I’d worked in a fund in the 1990s but there was a lot about the business I did not understand at the&nbsp;time.</p><p>As part of the research, I put about 100 people through their first VR experience. I wanted to figure out if it was time to invest in VR projects. It was market research.</p><p>I came to the conclusion that we were years away from VR being a workable technology. The hardware was clearly ready: Oculus Rift was a little clunky but it was the Apple IIe of VR: the thing that tells you The Revolution is Coming. That was&nbsp;fine.</p><p>But the software was appalling. Back in the day they made movies by putting a camera on a tripod and doing a stage play in front of it. It took decades to make movies. A whole new art form (cinematography) had to be invented. Shocking and amazing things happened decade after decade for a century to get us to where cinema is now. Those changes were often driven by technology, but they were delivered by actors and directors portraying the human experience in new ways, creating ever-more-compelling works. VR is not ready for artistic reasons, far more than for technical ones. I could go on about this for some hours, but the lack of a “virtual cinematography” makes most VR experiences as compelling as watching CCTV footage of mall parking lots. It does not matter if I’m looking at the wheat fields of Gondor and scouting for Nazgul, if it’s not telling me a story I don’t want to&nbsp;know.</p><p>Also violence is overwhelmingly overpowering in VR. It’s literally just too much and reducing the violent content of our video games to the point that it doesn’t traumatize people to play (Arizona Sunshine, I’m looking at you here) is also going to take&nbsp;time.</p><p>So my prediction is this: the Metaverse is going to fail. The pandemic is more-or-less over, people are back out in the world again, and everybody loves this place! The stay-at-home culture which VR is fundamentally rooted in doesn’t provide the lived experiences which people want. There is something very much like VR which people do want, but until VR has solved the artistic problems of storytelling in the virtual medium it’s just chat rooms with better graphics. I have an Meta Quest II, and it’s gathering dust: there’s just nothing to *do* in&nbsp;there.</p><p>Not yet.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/w0000CE0/status/1537401568328404993">@w0000CE0</a></p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, we have inflation. To inflate. The state of things being inflated.</p><p>The bubble of all&nbsp;bubbles.</p><p>Folks don’t remember inflation.</p>Source: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/11/business/economy/april-2022-cpi.html</a><p>Realistically the <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts">US inflation rate is about 12%</a> right now, if it’s calculated using the same measures used back in the day. If that stays up for four years, each dollar in circulation loses half of its&nbsp;value.</p><p>The whole economy goes through what the Ethereum community has gone through in the last few weeks, over a couple of years. It is devastating. In theory wages adjust to keep up with inflation, and interest rates too. Practically speaking without strong labour unions to negotiate, workers get poorer year-on-year.</p><p>Pair that up with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/09/global-supply-chain-crisis-fuels-push-to-local-manufacturing-as-chinas-appeal-dims">global supply chain crisis</a>, including food, and you’ve got <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/06/1119752">a recipe for global disaster</a>.</p><p>The middle class don’t just get to retreat into the virtual world. There’s nothing there that anybody&nbsp;wants.</p><p>No, we have to stand our ground and fight for the real world: it’s where we&nbsp;live.</p><p>The metaverse is not going to save us. If we re-inflate the tech-hype bubble around the metaverse, it’ll produce a brief flare of innovation, some very inflated prices for assets which are inherently extremely volatile, and another flame-out like the one that we’re in, just a couple of years down the road (at most.) I quite liked <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-axs-price-risks-deeper-losses-despite-90-drawdown-already">play to earn as a concept</a>. It didn’t seem inherently bonkers to me that the age-old practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming">gold farming</a> could be modernized by crypto into something that allowed essentially independent operators to do it in a defi way. But it’s stuck in the <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">Perez spin cycle</a>, along with everything else, and people in developing world countries are losing their entire livelihood in this&nbsp;chaos.</p><p>We have to change how this&nbsp;works.</p><p>We have to take the hard path now: we have to start building the kind of wealth that Warren Buffet can understand, the rebuilding that outfits like Southwest Airlines specialized in.</p><p>We have to learn how to make&nbsp;money.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/build-back-better-8a1be80623b2">Build Back Better!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><br>
Introduction</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The main value of a platform such as Uber or AirBnB is that it reduces transactions costs for participants that use their network.</p>
<p>Before smartphones with connectivity and good map functionality, it wouldn’t have been economically viable to stand on a street corner and hope that a driver you don’t know would pick you up and take you to a predetermined place. Taxis were really the only solution – but you had to call one beforehand – sometimes far in advance and there was a price to that.</p>
<p>Platforms such as Uber come along and are able to use these technological advances to connect demand and supply, transfer value through cashless exchanges/credit card in-app; and create trust through a rating system. You can look at a platform like AirBnB with a similar lens.</p>
<p>I see what we’re doing in self-sovereign identity as further reducing the costs of business/transactions. And this incremental value value is achieved by reducing trust costs across silos.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Image 1 – The cost of establishing trust reduces with the elimination of silos</p>
<p>How can an organization trust that a supplier located hundreds of kilometers away is who they say they are? Or, as a person, how can I verify that the organization receiving my personal data is indeed who I believe them to be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a fundamental principle which often hinders development in the digital economy: trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the global economy continues to go digital, overcoming the challenges associated with digital identity management is crucial. The ability to accurately identify legal entities represents a huge part of that effort. Only by establishing trust between legal counterparties can the true benefits of a digitally enabled world be realized.</p>
 
 
 
<p><br>
Note: my thinking around network effects related to decentralized (non-siloed) ecosystems started while reading <a href="https://medium.com/selfrule/meta-platforms-and-cooperative-network-of-networks-effects-6e61eb15c586">this wonderful 2019 blog post</a> by Sam Smith.</p>

 Helping data providers to package, price and market their&nbsp;data <p>With the latest version of Ocean Protocol — OceanONDA V4 live, we are announcing a new initiative to accelerate the adoption of Ocean as the orchestration layer for Data and AI. The Ocean Data Bounty program seeks to expedite the shift into a New Data Economy by incentivising data-driven insights and the building of algorithms on datasets geared toward solving complex business challenges.</p><p>This blog post gives an overview of 1) Ocean’s vision driving the program, 2) Ocean bounty phases, and 3) Expected process and benefits.</p><p>Preamble</p><p>Everyone has data but few know how to package, price and market the data. Research has shown that the entire value chain for data sharing is fraught with mistrust, risk and uncertainty. Data providers are very open to exploring data sharing but they are also looking for best practices and guidance because the Data Economy is nascent and data sharing is not a core business activity.</p><p>Our analyses have shown that the context around the data determines data pricing and packaging. Data is useful depending on who the end consumer is and what they need the data&nbsp;for.</p><p>To Build Trust — Develop Context Around&nbsp;Data</p><p>On its surface, data is simply a collection of numbers, words, images, vectors, etc. It is only when data is presented with a context that it becomes meaningful. With the proper context, decisions can be made based on the data but also based on what the data means. Data context is the network of connections among data points. Those connections may be created as metadata or simply identified and correlated. Contextual metadata adds value, essentially making it possible to receive information from&nbsp;data.</p><p>Context around data can be established when the following questions are answered:</p>  What could my data be used&nbsp;for?  How can I give data consumers more confidence prior to making a buy decision?  How can the data be combined with other data&nbsp;sources?  What are the most useful analytics, reports and algorithms that could be built around the&nbsp;data?  Which communities and industries might the data&nbsp;help?  What specific problems could the data be used to&nbsp;solve?  What is the most appropriate pricing model for a customer&nbsp;segment?  <p>If data context questions are answered, then fit-for-function data packaging and pricing schemes can be built around the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Source: Chris Dixon,&nbsp;a16z</p><p>As the diagram above hints, if several contexts of use can be established for different user groups, then multiple pricing schemes and products can be developed to capture and generate maximum economic value creation for everyone.</p><p>Examples of Various Contexts for a&nbsp;Dataset</p><p>With the release of OceanONDA V4 and the new tools that allow for more frictionless data sharing on blockchain technology, the following opportunities present themselves:</p>  Existing data providers can tap new markets or add a new distribution channel for their data services by leveraging web3.  New data providers can learn the various contexts around their data, to help them decide how to package, price and market their&nbsp;data.  Researchers can access fresh, private, untapped data — to test out their skills and generate novel algorithms, analytics and&nbsp;reports.  <p>Introducing the Ocean Data Bounty&nbsp;Program</p><p>To accelerate the shift into a new Data Economy, Ocean Protocol is launching the Ocean Data Bounty to data&nbsp;owners.</p><p>Data owners will provide data samples and schemas to Ocean’s 250,000-strong community of data scientists and crypto-enthusiasts, who will then be given the challenge to submit ideas on how the data could be used, combine the data with other datasets to generate novel insights, write algorithms and analytics against the data and even identify real-world problems that can be solved using the data. Each Ocean Data Bounty will also be promoted/featured outside the Ocean community, with targeted/relevant communities of researchers and data scientists.</p><p>It’s our contribution to discover and nudge along the learning so that the adoption of web3 can be accelerated.</p><p>The 3 phases of Ocean Data&nbsp;Bounty</p><p>We envision this program to be executed in 3 different stages: Ideation, Algorithm, and Problem-Solving.</p><p>Bounty Phases</p><p>Phase I — Ocean Ideation Bounty: The objective will be to gather ideas and encourage brainstorming on how particular datasets can be used. We will be looking to collect 10–20 ideas for further review from a pool of around 200 submissions that will then be rewarded bounties worth $5,000-$10,000 USD to be paid in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Phase II — Ocean Algorithms, Analytics, Reports and Narratives Bounty: This second phase of the program will kick off after the successful execution of the ideation bounty where the initially selected ideas will be executed by building around 5–20 algorithms, analytics, reports and narratives on selected data sets. The amount on offer for this bounty will range from $10,000 — $20,000 USD to be paid in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Phase III — Ocean Problem-Solving Bounty: This shall be the last stage of the bounty program where built algorithms, reports and analytics will be deployed towards the development of proto-products like — dashboard, alerts, monitoring or new data marketplace — all geared towards solving a problem or business challenge.</p><p>These bounty phases have been designed to help data owners discover these various contexts for their data; build a community around the data and then turn ideas into commercializable reality.</p><p>Ocean Data Bounty Process and&nbsp;Benefits</p><p>Publishers are invited to bring datasets to be evaluated by the core Ocean team. The bounty scope will be defined and then launched for the Ocean community. Submissions will be assessed and the next challenge will be defined and issued soon&nbsp;after.</p><p>With the Ocean bounty program, we want data providers and data scientists to benefit&nbsp;in:</p>  Familiarizing themselves with Web3 and cryptocurrency in a safe&nbsp;manner  Engaging the Ocean community of data scientists and crypto-enthusiasts to win prizes and contribute to Ocean’s&nbsp;adoption  Build context around data, toward commercializable business&nbsp;models  <p>We want to expose the latent potential of data to activate new discoveries, products, and services.</p><p>Final notes</p><p>Data alone, without context, is worthless. In specific contexts, data has immense value. The Ocean Data Bounty program is designed to help data owners discover various contexts for their data; build a community around the data and then turn ideas into commercializable reality.</p><p>Our global Ocean community can engage with real, live data to test their skills, deliver value and vie for&nbsp;prizes.</p><p>Ocean technology will get road-tested and hardened, with new features and functionalities identified to allow broader adoption and access over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The Data Bounty program will help build a framework for commercializing new data sources by optimizing the assessment, packaging, cleaning, pricing and context building around&nbsp;data.</p><p>Our mission is to accelerate the shift to a new Data Economy and onboard new data providers faster and in a scalable&nbsp;manner.</p><p>*For the purpose of this blog post, the terms data owners, providers and publishers have been used synonymously.*</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Vinay Gupta, CEO of Mattereum and Ethereum launch co-ordinator in 2015 looks at the latest Crypto Winter and how we got&nbsp;here. <p>Once again, crypto winter is upon us. Depending on how you count this is my fifth or eighth. Back in the 1990s there was ITAR and the crypto wars, where the US Federal Government basically killed the industry in America, back when crypto was a thing you did to emails not a shorthand for privately issued anonymous digital cash. The early days of bitcoin, when it hit thirty-something dollars then crashed to four and stayed there. The 2016 DAO crisis. I’ve seen it&nbsp;all.</p><p>I want to talk about how we wound up where we are today, and how we get off this nightmare ride of boom-and-bust cycles which are psychologically trashing our industry and making it so hard to build enduring value. We can stop the bleeding, but we have to be&nbsp;smart.</p> The psychology of the boom-bust innovation cycle. <p>Here’s <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/2018-year-in-preview-the-future-of-cryptocurrency-b99110480ff0">the piece I wrote in 2017 about the 2018 crypto winter</a>. Some of you may remember it. It lays out the same basic case I’m going to make here: crypto wins by solving problems that nobody else can solve, profitably. It has to win at three levels to&nbsp;survive:</p>  Ordinary people have to use&nbsp;it  It has to generate actual value, not just move value&nbsp;around  Governments have to tolerate it or use it themselves — either one will&nbsp;do  <p>If we can’t hit all three of those criteria WANGMI. We’re building a technology that needs a billion regular users to survive. The constants are huge: big engineering teams, big marketing budgets, complex legal and regulatory work. It all costs money and the only thing that can sustain the industry is real economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>It is still <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/16/warren-buffett-invested-1-billion-crypto-bank/">Warren Buffet</a>’s world — literally, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/berkshire-hathaway/marketcap/">he owns it</a>. His way of analyzing the world is to look at the fundamental valuation and profitability of assets. He’s so good at it, his company has roughly the same market cap as Ethereum had a couple of years ago. But Buffet’s company doesn’t 10x up and 4x down every couple of years: it’s plodded along fairly reliably for decades, incrementally growing&nbsp;value.</p><p>Now, you’ve gotta ask yourself, “why can’t Warren Buffet see crypto?” And it’s not because he’s old or doesn’t get tech. No, it’s because he’s smart about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp">financial fundamentals</a>.</p><p>That’s all that boring stuff&nbsp;like:</p>  How much food will come out of the&nbsp;ground?  What’s the global market for machine tools going to look like next&nbsp;year?  How fast are people moving to the&nbsp;cities?  <p>Thinking about this stuff really carefully is how you figure out when a real-world asset is under-valued.</p><p>Buying things which are under-valued is how Warren Buffet makes&nbsp;money.</p><p>But Warren Buffet won’t buy bitcoin at any price. So we have to think about that. What do we know that Warren Buffet&nbsp;doesn’t?</p><p>Now let me introduce another big thinker about finance: <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/people/carlota-perez">Carlotta Perez</a>. Perez is good at valuing bubbles. Specifically, she’s good at thinking about how bubbles create value in the long run even though they all pass through horrible periods like&nbsp;this.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/">https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/</a></p><p>Source: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting</a></p><p>What Perez says, roughly, is that bubbles build infrastructure. There’s a massive surge of irrational enthusiasm during which water flows uphill, capital flows into the most improbable things, and the future seems so close you can touch it. Warren Buffet hates this stuff because it involves guessing about the future. During that initial lift, during the innovation burn period, the G-force is like sitting in a plane at take-off. It hits you right in the base of your spine. Here we&nbsp;go!</p><p>Then a little later nearly everyone goes bankrupt.</p><p>Then a bunch of grown-ups who know how to run business move in, buy up all the assets cheap, and turn all of this technological potential into profitable businesses.</p><p>It’s a fundamental change in the nature of the people that run the industry: it goes from innovators to operators. Risk tolerance goes way down because the technology already works but it needs people who can operate it profitably.</p><p>My company, <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> is in the middle of that process of transformation right now as our business team takes more and more responsibility for running the business, and the original innovators are now more integrated into product development and sales. Usually companies don’t make that transition under their own power — somebody has to come in and fire the CEO — but in our case we knew enough about how businesses really run to make those changes under our own power (without anyone firing&nbsp;me).</p><p>I’ll introduce a few members of our new senior leadership team in another Medium post&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>So we’ve been through basically six rounds of the Perez cycle in crypto in the past 15 years. These things come on each-other thick and fast. An enormous amount of underlying technological, financial and even social innovation has happened.</p>  Bitcoin  Altcoins  Ethereum  ICOs  Defi  NFTs  <p>And at the end of that we’re left with a rough copy of about a third of the global financial system. You could just about put together a mortgage loan and buy a house as an NFT if you really put your mind to it. It would take work and connections, but you could just about buy real estate as an NFT today, with financing. Mattereum is of course going to make that a lot easier real soon, but let’s deal with things as they are rather than as they’re going to&nbsp;be.</p><p>So in every one of these rounds of the Perez cycle we can see the future as clearly as all the folks who went bust installing “dark fiber” optic cables in the ground. About 20 years ago companies ploughed billions into the ground to lay fiber optic cables that nobody needed or would pay for. It was THE FUTURE. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/11/fiber-optic/">Then everybody went bankrupt</a>, grown ups bought the assets for a song, and slowly started to operate the fibre profitably. Same thing happened with airlines: again and again and again Southwest Airlines acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Southwest_Airlines">bankrupt airlines for a song</a>, with planes and routes, and operated them profitably.</p><p>In crypto we run this cycle super fast and with the same people in the room on each cycle. But the field keeps growing and changing, and all these ups and downs result in a most “interesting” phenomena: the All Time&nbsp;High.</p><p>During the All Time High, at crypto events, every single person in the room has made money. Everybody. You bought in yesterday, you’ve already made $5. You bought in six months ago and you look like a genius. The money just seems to take care of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>During a dip the “newbies” have lost money; the least socially connected 10% or 20% of the people in the room bought, then it dipped, and the old hands are buying at the current price. The newbies are a bit twitchy but the old hands are all looking greedy rather than fearful, and life goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>During a crash, and all-importantly after a crash, 70% of the people in the room have lost money. Some of them have lost 70% of what they invested: they took real money out of bricks-and-mortar assets and bought hype tickets, and then got rekt, to use current parlance. And in these periods the old hands aren’t buying anything; they’re sitting on their winnings and waiting for the rally somewhere on down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>The NFT space is now in this condition. At <a href="https://www.nft.nyc/">NYC.NFT</a> in June 2022 the mood was mordant. People have lost a lot of money, and they wonder if they’re ever going to make it back. Remember 2018, Ethereum people? The ICO craze had blown over because the massive promises made by those projects had failed to materialize, and people were gloomy as all hell. A long time passed until <a href="https://oecdonthelevel.com/2022/01/31/from-defi-summer-to-crypto-winter-leverage-liquidations-and-policy-implications/">Defi Summer</a> in 2020, and then the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">2021 NFT take-off a year&nbsp;ago</a>.</p><p>Most of the new folks in the space haven’t seen crypto winter before. 70% or so of the people in the room have lost money. The mood is down, down,&nbsp;down.</p><p>Welcome to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital">Perez Cycle</a>, kids. I’m sorry to be seeing you down here in the gutter one more time, but you’ll find a lot of old friends here, survivors of previous rounds of the&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>We stick together.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/winter-has-come-e56fcb667cfa">Winter Has Come</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Announcing the Launch of Veriscope 2.0 — A State Machine with An Enhanced VASP Experience  VASPs now have better and more flexible control over their p2p communications <p>We are very excited to announce the launch of the Veriscope State Machine. This major update enables counterparties, i.e., Originator VASPs and Beneficiary VASPs, to have better control over their peer-to-peer communications.</p><p>The update also enables VASPs to subscribe to several new webhook events that will trigger a response on their end, which includes instances such as a VASP requesting a signature or KYC/IVMS data and when a VASP receives or accepts encrypted IVMS data. Here, InterVASP Messaging Standard, known popularly as IVMS, refers to a framework set by the crypto ecosystem to standardize the exchange of Travel Rule&nbsp;data.</p><p>The new version of Veriscope includes improvements to how VASPs send encrypted KYC/IVMS data along with signature data, how they accept or reject an IVMS transfer, and allow them to subscribe to several new webhook events that will trigger a response on their&nbsp;end.</p><p>The Veriscope team is committed to providing the best-in-class Travel Rule solution to the industry; these key enhancements are a result of iterative testing between the team and participating VASPs during the integration testing phase. With this new launch, Veriscope once again demonstrates that it’s a solution built side-by-side with VASPs, taking their feedback and incorporating it into the product to serve them&nbsp;better.</p> Not Compatible With Previous Veriscope Version <p>The “State Machine” is a brand new release. Hence, it won’t support the previous iteration of Veriscope. VASPs using the earlier versions of Veriscope will have to upgrade to the new version before going live on the mainnet. This means that VASPs using earlier versions of Veriscope must delete the existing KYC templates &amp; implement the new webhook&nbsp;events.</p><p>Run the following command for the&nbsp;upgrade:</p> What’s Changed for the&nbsp;VASPs?  Flexible P2P Data Transfers <p>With the launch of the new “State Machine,” P2P Travel Rule data transfer between VASPs is much more flexible. Now, either VASPs (oVASP or bVASP) can share KYC/IVMS data first, and any of them can accept or reject a virtual asset transfer&nbsp;request.</p> Automated Processing Through Several new Webhook&nbsp;Events <p>The new version includes several webhook events that will automate transaction processing for VASPs. Some of the new webhooks are “Signature data requested,” “KYC data requested,” “Encrypted IVMS received,” and “Transfer accepted or rejected.”</p> Three new States to Keep Both oVASPs &amp; bVASPs Better Informed About the Status of Their Transactions <p>The three new states introduced in the latest update are KYC templates, which the VASP can update/accept/reject, data requests, and encrypted IVMS.</p> Proof of Address Coming&nbsp;Soon <p>Address Proofs (POAs) are currently in the development phase and will be made available soon.</p> About Veriscope <p>Veriscope is an open-source, decentralized travel rule solution that allows Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to comply with the FATF Travel Rule, preserve data integrity, maintain data sovereignty and enable a frictionless customer experience. It has been designed in collaboration with leading global cryptocurrency exchanges.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network is a public blockchain protocol designed to aggregate, embed, and leverage trust, validation, and discoverability to facilitate public and private data transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks. By encouraging individuals and enterprises to collaborate, Shyft Network successfully adds a layer of context on top of data, ultimately turning raw data into meaningful information.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShyftNetwork">Facebook</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a> | <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a></p>

<p>The European Union has been looking forward to the rollout of a verified, cross-border digital identity for years now. The European Commission has seen the spread of digital commerce as well as its integration with social media and has rightly deduced that new systems and protections are required as we move into the 21st century. Such an all-encompassing ID certainly can provide benefits to private users as well as big businesses, but there hasn’t been a clear vision as to just what it would look&nbsp;like.</p><p>The ideas so far put forward found insufficient traction, and that sent regulators back to the drawing board. However, with the release of an updated framework comes an opportunity. The new techniques and ideas that are necessary to bring about such an identification system are already present in the Nuggets verified Self-Sovereign Identity platform.</p><p>eIDAS 1.0 Explained</p><p>The Electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS</a>) is an EU regulatory framework designed to govern both electronic identification and general trust services in the world of electronic commerce. Established in 2014, eIDAS comes along with the European Commission’s (ECs) broader mission outlined in Europe’s “<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/64/digital-agenda-for-europe">Digital Agenda</a>.” The ultimate purpose of this endeavor is to push innovation and generally bring the EU into the 21st&nbsp;century.</p><p>eIDAS specifically calls for the Union-wide adoption of a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Digital Identity</a>. Under this system, all citizens are given their own unique, verifiable digital credentials. These can then be used to securely access services online and offline across the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>This is not a brand-new development, and a public service-only version of this model is already being rolled out, but the adoption rate of this first attempt has been fairly poor. Only about ⅔ of EU citizens even live in a country that has enabled such an ID, and they don’t yet all work together. To add to the problems, there has also been some <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/244763/eIDAS-policy%20paper-EW+EDRi.pdf">general resistance</a> to the move, with detractors pointing out the potential abuses surrounding both user autonomy and general&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>It also doesn’t help things that the events of 2020 and 2021 have left an irreversible mark on society and how people interact with it. This all has led to the EC deciding to go back to the beginning and reimagine what this regulation really needs to look&nbsp;like.</p><p>How To Fix What Was&nbsp;Wrong</p><p>Those who have opposed the original framework for this universal eID have pointed to a variety of concerns, so let’s take a look at what those are right now. First of all, in its original form, the regulation described a unique ID that was linked to all aspects of a person and would ultimately follow them for their entire life. There wasn’t enough wording to describe how things like privacy or separation of different types of information would work, leaving the door open for companies to be able to see far too much, and the user could only do little about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Then there was the concerning part of the proposal that called for governments to be able to implement a form of “kill switch” on any given ID. The stated purpose was to cut off funding should illegal activity or terrorist financing be detected, but many still felt this was too far of a stretch. The possibilities for abuse or even honest mistakes leading to the “deletion” of a person in the system were just too troubling.</p><p>Lastly, the eID described in the original version also isn’t well optimized for the variety of use cases it has in the private sector. Too many limitations and complexities meant it couldn’t be an all-in-one solution for both public and personal use, and other IDs would likely be necessary. This will only stand to limit adoption and frustrate the general public. Nobody wants to use one ID to board a plane and another to make a verified purchase.</p><p>Fortunately, EC listened and has put forward a whole new model called <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281&amp;from=EN">eIDAS 2.0</a>. This is being done to address the failings of the original model and hopefully roll out a system that is safe, functional, and ultimately attractive to private citizens, businesses, and governments alike.</p><p>What To Expect From eIDAS&nbsp;2.0</p><p>eIDAS 2.0 will engage with the points of contention that brought criticism to its predecessor. For starters, this new framework now acknowledges the role of self-sovereign identity (SSI). The benefits of SSI sit with ownership and control of the individuals’ personal information. Additionally, having been based upon decentralized blockchain technology, eIDAS 2.0 is based upon concepts of reusability and interoperability.</p><p>This also brings in the added benefit of curbing the control that big tech companies like Facebook have over user data. Because of some of the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/facebook-data-misuse-and-voter-manipulation-back-in-the-frame-with-latest-cambridge-analytica-leaks/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANwD9oHPeAK03BBZ9yYuCXw1IEvzo_AMDnfJb4QO-eYl-lSgMHRnSQrZajYX-QZkxLW2A9ObWuw_Ti1lV1GYZxhJeqFH1vksmcuWeIqPx6N4A3nbNAb3oN8RFV_QC3gLHmdlZ3GLc18Y5YEO45mX5q3Qj5tshPn3qZjbk2vqU6l">issues</a> surrounding how social media platforms handle this information, it is imperative that this new eIDAS system doesn’t hand them, even more, control and instead takes it away. This is especially true as eIDAS 2.0 is designed to incorporate many more types of personal data than any ID ever has&nbsp;before.</p><p>According to the legislation itself, any such ID would have to contain the bare minimum of the following information: name, address, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, educational qualifications, titles and licenses, professional qualifications, public permits and licenses, and financial and company&nbsp;data.</p><p>However, the potential use for SSIs goes way beyond these basic elements and can include things like medical history, purchasing, and browsing preferences. With strict measures in place that only allow this data to be accessed when and where the user&nbsp;decides.</p><p>As long as the end-user has final control over the private keys tied to their ID, then this system stands to empower them. This is likely the key to the broader adoption that the EC is looking for in such an eID. We’ve outlined many of the reasons and features that the new eIDAS will encompass, but how will it actually be developed? Well, fortunately, this is where Nuggets comes&nbsp;in!</p><p>How Nuggets Makes It All&nbsp;Work</p><p>Nuggets have already developed a multi-award-winning, verified self-sovereign digital identity and payment platform that can provide a persistent, interoperable, and verified digital identity. This new platform is designed for and compatible with Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and the rising Metaverse. In addition to verified digital identities, Nuggets also offers a personal cloud vault and auditable data.</p><p>This means that anyone using an SSI can demonstrate zero-knowledge proofs or selective disclosure of the minimum amount of data required for proof of identity or access instead of revealing everything and having to leave it behind. Combine this with verifiable credentials that cryptographically prove the validity of any information provided, a win-win situation for users and providers, and create a safer environment all&nbsp;around.</p><p>This stands to be the ubiquitous solution that is being described by the eIDAS 2.0 legislation. Because our platform is transnational, all credentials will be accessible anywhere with an internet connection. There is no need to “reinvent the wheel;” Nuggets already offers everything that the EC is looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>To make this system work, this SSI leverages a variety of technologies to bring to life the ideas outlined for eIDAS 2.0. For example, in order to limit access to data while still delivering verifiable proof of authenticity, Nuggets employs what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs</a>. This technique means that the ID can deliver an unfalsifiable confirmation of a person’s identification or right to access something without revealing the underlying data. ZK Proofs form a major cornerstone of how these IDs will bring full control of private information back to the users without sacrificing security for the platforms they engage&nbsp;with.</p><p>Furthermore, Nuggets leverages biometric data, such as a fingerprint or iris scan, to link these SSIs to the only person whom they represent. This will make it virtually impossible for anyone besides the actual individual to use them. Combining this type of veracity with ZK Proofs is how absolute validation is possible while still obscuring the underlying biometrics from any third&nbsp;party.</p><p>Nuggets packages all of these techniques with other powerful protocols, like W3C verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), and the encrypted communication standards of DIDComm. By bringing together all of these features, Nuggets is safe to use as a personal financial wallet. What this also means is that consumers can confirm things like age or prove that they have a sufficient minimum balance to, for example, make a purchase or take out a loan all without ever having to reveal their actual bank account information.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>We couldn’t be happier to hear that the European Commission has decided to revamp its outline for a European Digital Identity with eIDAS 2.0. Nuggets has already built a system that meets all of its specifications and even more. The platform is ready to use and easy for consumers to interface with. We fully support the need and possibilities that this new type of identification system can offer and can’t wait to bring verifiable, autonomous services to citizens in the EU and&nbsp;beyond.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/working-european-commissions-eidas-2-0-aligns-perfectly-with-nugget-s-technology-and-vision-996909bf9a36">Working: European Commission’s eIDAS 2.0 Aligns Perfectly with Nugget’s Technology and Vision</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining. Today, we are going to hear now what is next for identity and access management. And we have a guest who really does a lot of research and training and consultancy about specifically identity and access management. Our guest today is Simon Moffatt. He is Founder and Analyst at The Cyber Hut, a leading boutique industry research, analysis, and advisory firm focused on identity, access, and cybersecurity technology.</p>
<p>He has more than 20-year career experience within the identity and access management space, having worked for consultancies, start-ups, and global software vendors. He is a published author and contributor to identity standards as the likes of NIST and the IETF. He’s also fellow of the Chartered Institute of Information Security. His long running research is focused upon next generation authorisation and emerging authentication technologies, as well as having an interest in the history of code breaking, signals intelligence, and cyber warfare operations.</p>
<p>Hello, Simon.</p>
<p>Simon Moffatt: Hi, Oscar. How are we doing? It’s great to be here today.</p>
<p>Oscar: Pretty good. It’s a pleasure talking with you, Simon. So definitely, we want to hear what’s coming in identity and access management. So yeah, let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. And first, we would like to hear a bit more about yourself, especially what was your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, thanks. It’s such a fascinating area, identity. I’ve been fortunate to have been in it for just over 20 years, which is a little bit scary when I say that out loud. But I guess like any technology in any sort of technology trend, 20 years is an absolute lifetime. And there’s been so many changes in actual products that are available, the standards, how technology is used, it seems an absolute world away.</p>
<p>But I started my career back in 2001, working in industry, like most people probably do when they when they start their careers. And I was working for a large insurance company in the UK for three or four years. And I was essentially doing identity by hand. I was creating accounts on RACF mainframe, I was setting up access control profiles, and TSO IDs and job control language stuff, all this crazy stuff on the mainframe. And having to do this by hand, there was no sort of automation involved in account creation and managing permissions and things. And it was quite an eye-opening experience at the age of 20 odd, I guess, you know the starting my career doing all of these, these processes by hand, which were time consuming, really labour intensive, really error prone. And it was a really interesting sort of introduction to identity and management if you like.</p>
<p>And then essentially, from there, I spent a bit of time in consultancy. And then I ended up the vast majority of my career working for software vendors, making software to rid the world of all of those manual processes of having to set up accounts by hand and having to manage permissions and access management and single sign-on and authentication and all that stuff. And really had a good 14, 15 years building software in those landscapes around provisioning systems, governance and compliance, role-based access control, obviously more latterly, on things like authentication and MFA, and zero trust and some of the buzzing words which have become more prolific.</p>
<p>But it’s just been quite an interesting journey to go from doing everything by hand and doing it manually to sort of working on automating that stuff, really. And it’s just been good to see identity now become a really accepted part of the enterprise landscape. I think 20 years ago, for example, it was something which it wasn’t particularly automated, it sat within IT operations, and it was just something organisations had to do.</p>
<p>Whereas I think today, in 2022, identity is so pervasive, and it powers the consumer identity lifecycle, it’s integrating with IoT and privacy and a whole host of other things around defence and cyber warfare and all host of with the different angle’s identity is now taking. So, it’s been a bit of a privilege to being in a sector for so long and seeing all those changes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s quite interesting when you say that doing identity and access management by hand, right? It’s hard to imagine today. It will be crazy if someone does still by hand today. We have now, of course, the standards, we have the software who does that. Yeah, interesting. And also, one of the last things you said is that it started with IT, right? You were an IT manager or IT specialist when you are doing this by hand, but today, actually I think a lot of the identity and access management is not done anymore by IT, correct?</p>
<p>Simon: I think that’s a really, yeah, really good observation. I think when I started, it was definitely within the IT, the infrastructure operations part of the business. And I think, today, even in the B2E, the employee identity infrastructure, it’s very separate, it’s very different. There are their own identity specialists, identity architects, identity leads, maybe even Chief Identity Officers, perhaps in some organisations, but it certainly has its own domain. And I think with that brings responsibilities that there are new and different metrics around what success looks like for identity and access management. And then clearly, then we have this whole brand-new area, or more recent area around, things like consumer identity or the identity for devices too and that’s, I guess, driven these needs to have identity as a separate playing field really, it doesn’t just sit within IT anymore.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So now let’s explore some of the research that you have been involved recently. So, tell us about that, what did you discover.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, I mean, so at The Cyber Hut we work on, on looking at, emerging patterns that are happening in the broader identity and access management space. And it’s a pretty exciting space to be because there are so many new emerging themes, standards, use cases, vendors, solution providers, and there’s so much happening in there. But there’s a couple of interesting topics that we’ve been researching over the last sort of six or seven months or so. And one of them we released a report last year, looking at passwordless authentication.</p>
<p>And I think it’s an interesting topic, because we all hate passwords as end users and as consumers and as employees. But yet we use passwords every day. Every day of our lives, we log into to all of our web services, websites, our employee directories, our laptops, everything is still dominated by passwords and shared secrets. And this age-old way of authenticating. It’s been there since the mid ’70s when computing started its commercial journey. And I think we’ve been desperately trying to move away from passwords ever since, the best part of 50 years, I guess. And we still haven’t quite got there.</p>
<p>We started to look at this space and try to look at some of the vendors, and some of the use cases, and the technology that is now available and really trying to understand, are we really getting close now to being able to rid the infrastructure of passwords in its entirety? And it was a fascinating journey, really. And I think the technology is there today, I think there are numerous different solutions, whether it’s based on sort of biometrics, or perhaps standards, like FIDO and WebAuthn that provide us with the tools and techniques to rid ourselves of passwords.</p>
<p>But clearly, there’s a whole host of other factors involved, be it sort of psychological acceptability, the security angles, the integration angles, and so on. So, it was a fascinating journey. I think we are getting closer to killing the password. But unfortunately, we’ve all probably got stories of how we logged in today using the old way of doing it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, we’re hearing all the time of technology for getting rid of passwords. And yeah, hopefully in the near future, we would really be completely rid of passwords. Another topic I think you were exploring was authorisation, correct? Like, next-generation authorisation, so tell us about that.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, authorisation is a fascinating area. I think, on the authentication side, many organisations, that they do invest heavily in authentication technologies, login processes, and biometrics. And it’s interesting, the authorisation, you know, what happens after the person has logged in often was a little bit neglected. It wasn’t necessarily an area which received lots of investment from the enterprise, the number of start-ups involved. It wasn’t particularly huge. It wasn’t a particularly large market.</p>
<p>Whereas I think move forward to 2022, the authorisation has had a huge sort of re-invention, if you like, if that’s not too bold a word, so certainly a pretty extended evolution. And the authorisation aspects, you know, working out what access an individual has, or if the device, what access a device could potentially have, is now suddenly becoming vitally important whether you are talking about the B2E space and employees and how they perhaps operate in a distributed working environment on the back of things like COVID and a pandemic, right through to the consumer angle where we’re talking about privacy and data security there as well.</p>
<p>But authorisation has certainly had a huge re-investment, if you like, or a re-invention over last sort of 36 months, there are numerous different start-ups involved in here, lots of interesting VC funding. I’m really starting to see this emergence of external authorisation platforms and looking at things like adaptive access, contextual access control, and things like zero trust and identity-centric security is, I guess, driving the need to have a strong authorisation platform where you are handling permissions across on-premises systems, cloud systems, APIs, microservices, there’s a whole host of different assets that need to be protected.</p>
<p>And organisations are now figuring out that actually, if they get authorisation right, it allows them as a business to be more agile, allows them to increase the speed that they can deliver applications and services. And clearly, speed and agility are hugely important for most businesses, so they can essentially get to value and get to their customer bases as quick as possible.</p>
<p>So, I think authorisation, yeah, has certainly become vitally important. There is some interest in emerging patterns there around how you protect microservices, leveraging API protection clearly have things like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, which have been around for quite a while in protecting APIs. But there’s certainly interest in extending that and looking at things like contextual access and more dynamic and adaptive ways of giving access to different assets. And I think that that in itself is suddenly becoming very topical and very important I think for many CISOs and CIOs.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, and when authorisation is not a word that you hear so much, let’s say in marketing, at least. So, you don’t see them so much mentioned, you don’t see so much on the website. But for instance, you mentioned contextual access, what was that you mentioned just? What is that concept, for instance?</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, you’re absolutely right. You know, many people, they don’t think of authorisation as an object. They think of the business problem, which is, how do I get my staff or customers to complete a transaction, or gain access to the things that they need to do their job, or maybe perform a transaction online? So, the authorisation aspects, certainly from a contextual authorisation perspective is not just looking at the people involved, the identities involved, and the resources that they want to access. But it’s also starting to look at other data signals as well. So other pieces of information that could be leveraged to help make an authorisation decision.</p>
<p>So, we’re talking about things like the device characteristics, you know, the laptop and the mobile phone, is there anything from those devices that can be leveraged in the authorisation decision, things like device versions, operating system versions? Does the device have antivirus installed, for example, or what type of locking mechanism does the mobile device have? Or what potential apps have been installed on the device? And all of these little, small pieces of context and signalling essentially has helped the authorisation decision process become a lot richer, a lot more informed and allows that process to be more personalised, and more tailored.</p>
<p>And I think this context aspect is now starting to pull in information from the devices but also things like the environment, things like breach credentials, threat intelligence systems, anything really which can amplify the risk analysis process. And I think, if you can pull in more of that context during the authorisation decision, the authorisation output can be much more fine grained as well. And I think we’re certainly starting to move away from this very black and white allow and deny sort of model which we’ve had for a number of years, where, if something is slightly erroneous, or looks slightly risky, there’s a big block and deny comes down, the big 403, or a big interruption into the user journey.</p>
<p>Whereas I think actually, what we’re starting to see now is much more subtle degradation of the service. You may be allowed access, but some of the service may be removed, or perhaps you’re allowed access, but it’s only read only, or perhaps you are allowed access, but perhaps certain fields of the database have been removed, or certain attributes in a payload have been removed, because perhaps you’re on a public Wi-Fi and that has a high level of risk or something similar.</p>
<p>So, I think we’re certainly starting to see this leveraging more information during the authorisation decision. And then the output of that decision is much more fine-grained and much more personalised, I think. It’s just moving away from blocking access entirely to allowing access but… and it’s just having that “but” in there and allowing more personalised experience, I think, it helps the end users and I think it helps the security posture as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can visualise what you explained definitely also reduces friction because you get logged in with some level of authorisation. And of course, based on the algorithms or the system, it might lead you to a closer level of authorisation that you should have maybe it’s not the perfect, but you are logged in you have some level authorisation, and you can do at least part of your job and hopefully don’t need to contact the IT or whoever is administering that.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, exactly. That’s an interesting point as well, it’s allowing people to continue on their journey. And I think that’s become really important, I think, in both the employee space where, in honesty, a lot of people now are working from home, even though that the pandemic is easing. So, you do things remotely, you do things away from a central office. So, it isn’t easy is it to go and speak to the IT helpdesk, for example.</p>
<p>And certainly, in the consumer space as well. Last thing the consumer or the customer wants to do is have their journey interrupted, and they have to go and ring the help desk of their bank or their insurance company, or their, telephone company or whatever. So, I think it’s allowing journeys to continue but applying the necessary friction at the correct time, under the correct risk conditions. I think that that is certainly a winning combination, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. And what trends are you seeing emerge in identity and access management?</p>
<p>Simon: I think there are numerous actually. I think there’s the fact that we have a wonderful podcasts like this and lots of work and research everybody is doing in the community just amplifies that identity is now sort of pervasive. I think it is now the tentacles of identity and now being sort of placed into huge parts of the enterprise, be it data security, endpoint protection, privacy, consumer identity, employee identity, there’s a whole host of research around identity for IoT and identity for devices.</p>
<p>Now, I was at a conference this week in Paris, actually a defence conference. And there’s a whole host of discussions there around leveraging identity and access management and trust and assurance within this sort of space and defence sectors as well. So, under the whole host of research topics to think about. And you know, we talk about ourselves as consumers, and when we think of consumer and identity and consumer interactions, we’re talking about usability, we’re talking about privacy by design.</p>
<p>And these are quite new concepts really if you think about identity and security and that really occurred to most vendors or certainly most systems to think about the usability and the privacy enablement. It was a case of get the system working. And yes, we may think of security afterwards. But certainly now, things like privacy, enablement and privacy by design are vitally important and an identity is a huge part of how that would operate.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It seems super interesting that now, it’s yeah, concepts like that are already on their agenda, on their minds of many decision makers, it’s fabulous. And seeing a bit more towards the future, let’s say in the next five years, for instance, how do you see now the identity and access management landscape evolving?</p>
<p>Simon: Oh, it’s a great question, isn’t it? As an analyst, you get asked this sort of question quite a lot around what does the future look like, and which technologies or standards are going to die off and which ones are going to survive and become real? And I think it’s always quite difficult to predict. And I think there are certainly some interesting meta trends, I think, certainly, identity is now hugely important to both the security architecture of the modern enterprise, but also things like usability, privacy, business agility. And then all of the enabling technologies that allow businesses to grow and compete and be agile, and to all the things which allow them to be successful. I think that is quite certainly a different way of looking at identity and identity-based security.</p>
<p>Whereas maybe three or four years ago, it was always leveraging technology to be restrictive and preventing bad things happening and stopping the bad guys from doing so. I think we’re definitely moving towards identity as an enabler for business growth. There’s a whole host of technology areas, I guess, things like decentralised everything, you know, decentralised internet, decentralised identity, and distributed identities. And then I guess, empowering the end user to have more control, essentially, over their identity data, be it things like wallets and ownership of how they share their identity data with governments and third-party services. And we’re certainly starting to see this emergence around decentralised identity perhaps is maybe the next way of handling identity information.</p>
<p>But there are certainly the other interesting areas, I mean, do we need things like Chief Identity Officers in the organisation? Interesting conversation I had a few weeks ago about that, you know, do we need to have a C-level executive who looks after identity? Maybe in three or four years we may see that happening as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: Is there any now?</p>
<p>Simon: I’m not aware of any who have that particular label. I think certainly some of the larger enterprises, there are certainly executives who are leading the charge for identity, really looking to transform how identity is measured, how it’s reported into either the CISO or the CIO. I’m not sure they have the title, Chief Identity Officer, but it would be interesting to see how that emerges over the next few years though.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, there might be a top executive with kind of similar, very high-profile role in leading identity, especially as you said, in large organisations, but maybe not the CIO.</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, we already have one of those. Yeah, yeah. Agreed.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what are the main challenges that need to be solved in this next, let’s say five years, on relatively midterm?</p>
<p>Simon: I think there’s some interesting, I guess, obstacles, which are starting to emerge. I think the pandemic has accelerated lots of different things, technology trends, investment trends. And there are certainly some meta characteristics that have come out of that process. You know, businesses want to be more agile. They want to be more responsive to change external change from the competition, or threats such as COVID-19 and other things.</p>
<p>So, they need to be agile. And what does that mean? Well, they’re going to be driving towards agile methodologies, maybe containerisation, APIs, microservices, outsourcing everything to cloud systems and subscription-based systems. And that all brings a whole magnitude of challenges from an identity perspective and having visibility of your identity infrastructure across hybrid cloud, containers, legacy systems, on-premises systems and so on.</p>
<p>And I think that being able to identify threat across that identity landscape is becoming more of an issue, because essentially, the identity infrastructure is becoming more complex. So how do you handle permissions across a multitude of different systems? How do you embed identity into IoT devices and privacy enablement systems? It’s hard to do that unless you have that visibility across that quite complex landscape.</p>
<p>So, I think there’s lots to do but I think equally, there are some good opportunities now. I think identity is well-known. It’s seen now as a really important part of many enterprises’ digital journey. So, I think there’s work to do, a lot of challenges ahead, but I think there are the right people, the personnel, the training, and standards available to make identity a vital part of every organisation over the next three to five years.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, we expect that will happen. It looks like it’s going in the right direction as you said.</p>
<p>Simon: I think so. I’m hopeful. I’m positive.</p>
<p>Oscar: Simon, we’re almost leading to the end of this interview, I’d like to ask you one final question for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Simon: Oh, wow, wow, can only have one? I could probably give 10 I guess, which probably doesn’t help people, does it? I think it’s just being aware of identity. I think many organisations certainly, particularly, the large organisations probably have identity projects running and technology in place. But even if you’re a smaller organisation, maybe mid-sized enterprise, looking, thinking about things like data security or endpoint security or privacy controls, it’s thinking that identity really is the foundation for those aspects. And just thinking like, thinking about the identity concept, looking at identifying your identity assets within the organisation be that people, permissioning systems, perhaps where you may identify contexts and how you can respond to contextual changes.</p>
<p>But I think just having an understanding of what your identity landscape looks like, I think is a good starting point, you know, where your authoritative sources of directory information are, which piece of context you may need to use, which assets do you want to protect? And I think that seems quite simple, but I think it’s actually it’s quite important because I think a lot of organisations start with a technology first mindset where actually they may want to start with really identifying their identity landscape. And then working out the problems with their identity landscape before they sort of look at technology selection. So, I think like anything just understand your landscape first and that’s a really good, a good starting point.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I think it’s a great takeaway. Yeah, thank you for this super interesting conversation. I definitely enjoy hearing your passion about identity. I can feel it all the time when you when you talk, and you absolutely know a lot about this field and you are researching so thank you for sharing all this.</p>
<p>Finally, for our listeners who like to get in touch with you or learn more about what you’re doing, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Simon: Yeah, of course, it’s great to be here. I am passionate, it’s certainly it’s an exciting area to be in. And I guess the best place, I’m pretty active on social media, so reach out on LinkedIn, or on Twitter, or go direct to The Cyber Hut website at thecyberhut.com. We’re more than happy to reach out and then respond to any questions, comments or just interesting conversations people want to have around identity, we’re always open to those.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot, Simon. And all the best.</p>
<p>Simon: Thank you, Oscar. Thank you. Take care.</p>

  <p>There’s a lot of information floating out there about web security. But when I read through the material, I noticed some information wasn’t up to date, or it was written specifically for traditional server-rendered web applications, or the author recommended anti-patterns. In a series of posts, I will cover web security concerns that all web devs should be aware of, emphasizing client-side applications, namely Single Page Applications (SPAs). Furthermore, I’m not going to get into the nitty-gritty of web security, cryptography, and networking.  Instead, I’ll focus on the main takeaways and high-level to-do lists. I’ll also provide links to resources where you can dive in deeper.</p>



<p>So why do we worry about web security anyway? When we have vulnerabilities in our applications, it’s an avenue for exploitation by bad actors. In the wrong hands, exploiting the vulnerabilities can cause risks to your application, data, reputation, and bottom line. In the words of my coworker <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/authors/aaron-parecki/">Aaron Parecki</a>, it all boils down to one thing—liability. And we don’t want to expose ourselves, our applications, and our companies to liability. If you feel threatened, it’s a good time to read on and identify how to harden your application.</p>

 Use the OWASP Top 10 to identify the most common vulnerabilities 
<p>If you’re new to thinking about security, you may not have heard of the <a href="https://owasp.org/">Open Web Application Security Project</a> (OWASP). OWASP is a group that focuses on making the web a safer place. They maintain and publish a list of the most common web vulnerabilities named the “<a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top Ten</a>” and have a new top ten list for 2021; their infographic shows how the top web vulnerabilities have changed from 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/">CC-by Open Web Application Security Project</a></p>

<p>As this is a list of web vulnerabilities, the entire list is pertinent to our work as web developers. However, a few critical vulnerabilities call for extra attention, and some vulnerabilities are less susceptible when the front-end is a SPA with a JSON-based backend API.</p>

<p>We will cover some of these vulnerabilities specifically, but I’ll also list general things to keep in mind that feed into the vulnerabilities listed here.</p>

 Leverage your browser and security headers 
<p>First, we need to set the stage for part of our vulnerability mitigation strategy by bringing up security headers. Modern browsers (buh-bye Internet Explorer!!) have a lot of security mechanisms already built in. We have to leverage the built-in security mechanisms and can enhance them with additional security headers. Security headers are HTTP response headers that provide instructions on how the browser should behave. They are defined on your web server.</p>

<p>There are quite a few security headers that we can apply. Something to note, SPAs are unique, so not all security headers apply in the same way as they would for a traditional server-rendered web application. I’ll call out the security headers that you’ll want to use when we discuss how to mitigate a specific vulnerability.</p>

 Dive deeper into security headers 
<p>Here are some great resources to learn more about security headers. Figuring out how to configure the security headers can be esoteric. I like these posts that are short and offer actionable steps to configure security headers.</p>
 
   <a>An Overview of Best Practices for Security Headers</a>

   <a href="https://web.dev/security-headers/">Web.dev’s Security headers quick reference</a> 
 

 Securely transport data using TLS/SSL 
<p>Using HTTPS should be the undisputed standard, but there are legacy systems where applications don’t use HTTPS. It’s essential to use the secure hypertext transfer protocol; after all, the HTTPS acronym is appropriately derived from Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. And it’s essential to be secure across your entire stack, not just when serving the front-end site (don’t ask me how I know this can be a thing).</p>

<p>When you don’t use an up-to-date Transport Layer Security within your application system, you expose yourself to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">meddler-in-the-middle attacks (MITM)</a>. In this type of attack, agitators intercept communication between unsecured systems to siphon data or impersonate communicating parties.</p>

<p>You might think this callout to use HTTPS is unnecessary because it’s such a standard for hosting web apps, but <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/">cryptographic failures that cause insecure communication are the second most common vulnerability in the OWASP Top Ten</a>! Note that it’s not enough to slap any old mechanism for HTTPS on your web server. You want a recent version of TLS. Your cloud providers might even force you to upgrade if your TLS version is old, which is good!</p>

<p></p>

<p>– <a href="https://xkcd.com/2634/">xkcd</a></p>

<p>What’s the takeaway here? Specifically, you’ll want to make sure you have functioning certificates, ensure you’re using the latest version of TLS, and make sure you use SSL/TLS over your entire stack. All of these steps might already be covered by your cloud hosting provider. You should also verify you’ve added the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) security header to the web server, which adds an extra layer of security beyond HTTPS redirection.</p>

 Keep your framework and external dependencies up to date 
<p>You knew this was coming, even though we might lament the work involved to stay up to date. The advice to update your dependencies sounds like “Don’t forget to floss,” but it’s essential (just like flossing). <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/">Vulnerable and outdated components take the sixth spot in the OWASP Top Ten list</a>. And there were some significant vulnerabilities from dependencies in the news recently. So you know deep down that burying your head in the sand is not a good action plan.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that we should update outdated components and ensure we don’t accidentally depend on a vulnerable dependency. We should pin dependency versions in our <code>package.json</code> and then generate and enforce the use of a lock file. That means running <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm i</code> to force the exact versions defined in the <code>package-lock.json</code>. If you use Yarn, you will use <code>yarn install --frozen-lockfile</code>. This way, updating versions is an intentional act.</p>

<p>That’s it. Just do it. It’s important. Outdated components are a source of liability.</p>

<p>Check out a step-by-step guide on dependency management for JavaScript developers by the OWASP team - <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/NPM_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html">NPM Security best practices</a>.</p>

 Load resources securely 
<p>Cross-origin resources are a particular concern for SPAs; this refers to resources your web app uses that are not hosted on the same origin as your web application. When all the resources the front-end needs are available through the same origin, we have confidence that the resources are secure. Hopefully, we’re not pwning ourselves! At least not intentionally, right?!</p>

<p>A typical pattern for setting up URLs for SPA communicating to back-end APIs might look like the following, where your front-end is</p>

   <code>https://myfavekdramas.com
</code>   

<p>and the back-end API URL is</p>

   <code>https://apis.myfavekdramas.com
</code>   

<p>But the API URL is a subdomain, so the request is cross-origin. Most browsers (once again BUH-BYE Internet Explorer!) protect us by allowing only specific cross-origin requests. We can configure resource access by enabling Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS).</p>

<p>Between your production environment setup resembling the above URLs, and local development using different ports for your front-end and back-end, you might be tempted to enable CORS to allow all sorts of requests. Unlike other security measures covered in this post, your browser already protects you in the strictest way possible. Enabling CORS loosens that restriction.</p>

<p>So the advice is to enable CORS appropriately with considered use of allowlists. Use proxies as appropriate (such as for local development). The concept of least privilege applies here too, and keeping a tight lid on things helps mitigate security vulnerabilities.</p>

 Protect your cookies from theft 
<p>Really, this advice is applicable outside of web development too. But since we’re talking about web development in this post, we’ll skip mitigation strategies about protecting your physical cookies from marauders and focus again on security headers.</p>

<p>Cookies can contain all sorts of goodies, such as chocolate chips and the tidbits of data that agitators love to have! Current authentication best practices favor using in-browser memory or web workers for authentication tokens over cookies, and cookies should never be used for secrets, but there might still be sensitive information stored in cookies. To help protect cookies, we can use attributes.</p>

<p>Cookies should be temporary. In particular, cookies with sensitive information should be as short-lived as possible. When you or your back-end bakes up a cookie, adding the attribute <code>Max-Age</code> defines the longevity of the cookie.</p>

<p>There are some more attributes you can bake in! Adding the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute means the browser only sends a cookie for HTTP requests, and JavaScript won’t be able to access cookies. Setting the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute is an excellent first step to guarding your cookies against a malicious script that can read your cookies.</p>

<p>Having the <code>httpOnly</code> attribute means that JavaScript can’t access the cookie, but it doesn’t mean your browser carefully curates which cookies to send to each HTTP request! It just sends them all, resulting in the possibility of a vulnerability!</p>

<p>This is where the <code>SameSite</code> attribute comes into play. You can control when cookies should be sent by using the <code>SameSite</code> attribute and setting one of 3 values:</p>
 
   <code>Strict</code> - only send cookies if they are going to the same site that requested them. 
   <code>Lax</code> - only send cookies when the user is navigating to the origin site. (This is the default behavior now for Chromium-based browsers.) 
   <code>None</code> - send the cookies to everyone, everywhere. As a safeguard for your generous behavior, which is concerning to the browser, you’re also required to add the <code>Secure</code> attribute. 
 

<p>With the <code>SameSite</code> attribute set, you can no longer have a scenario like this
</p>

<p>Be thoughtful about cookies and apply principles of least privilege. Safeguarding cookies is a big step in mitigating other vulnerabilities.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — June 27th to July&nbsp;3rd  The EU co-legislators finally agreed to Crypto AML provisions, and&nbsp;more… <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. The crypto regulatory landscape continues to stay heated with the EU co-legislators finally agreeing to Crypto AML provisions. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> Crypto Travel Rule to be Implemented in the European Union by&nbsp;2024 <p>After months of discussions, EU co-legislators finally agreed on a provisional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) agreement based on the FATF’s Travel Rule, albeit with slight modifications.</p><p>Under the provisional agreement, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) will have to collect the personal information of both the originator and the beneficiary of the crypto transfer.</p><p>And unlike the Travel Rule, where the minimum ceiling limit for the regulation to kick in is $1000, there is no such limit in the EU’s version. Once implemented, VASPs will have to collect Travel Rule data for all crypto transactions in the EU, no matter the amount. That said, the provisional agreement won’t apply to the crypto transfers to unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Although the announcement made last Wednesday does not mention the exact date of the launch, it states that the aim is to roll out the EU-wide AML laws before the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA). And ECB President Christine Lagarde said during her recent testimony to the EU parliament that MiCA is likely to be implemented by&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Read more about it here: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/crypto-travel-rule-set-to-be-mandatory-in-the-eu-by-2024-aead21f46113">https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/crypto-travel-rule-set-to-be-mandatory-in-the-eu-by-2024-aead21f46113</a></p> FATF Asks Countries to Speed up Travel Rule&nbsp;Adoption <p>Financial Action Task Force, the global financial crimes watchdog, recently published a report highlighting the need for speedy adoption of the Travel Rule globally.</p><p>As per the report, only 11 countries have adopted the Travel Rule, a quarter of them will soon pass the law, and one-third have made no progress.</p><p>Citing increasing concerns around the growing use of digital assets, NFTs, and DeFi, the financial watchdog noted in its report that the “countries that have not introduced Travel Rule legislation should do so as soon as possible, and FATF jurisdictions should lead by example.”</p><p>Visit here to read more about FATF’s recent report demanding countries to fast rack Travel Rule adoption:</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/30/hurry-up-with-crypto-id-checks-fatf-tells-countries/">https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/30/hurry-up-with-crypto-id-checks-fatf-tells-countries/</a></p> Former Chairman of India’s Largest Bank Says International Co-operation the Only way to Regulate Cryptocurrencies <p>The surge in investments in crypto assets in India and globally during 2021, often termed the “Breakthrough Year of Cryptocurrencies,” attracted the attention of the country’s leading financial authorities, including the central bank and the finance ministry. And amid such careful observation by the authorities, the market tanked considerably in 2022, raising concerns about regulatory ambiguity around digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The recent high-profile executive to comment on digital assets is Rajnish Kumar, Former Chairman of State Bank of India, the country’s largest bank by assets. He welcomed the government’s decision to tax digital assets and deduct TDS as he believes these actions from the government will help allay fears around the use of digital currencies for money laundering &amp; terrorism financing.</p><p>While speaking about crypto regulations, Mr. Kumar said that “This (crypto regulation) is an area where no single country would be able to bring out the laws (alone). It requires international cooperation. For banking, we have the Bank For International Settlements. Similarly, for crypto, we need to have an international understanding, and a framework has to be established.”</p><p>Read more about it here: <a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/crypto-regulation-requires-international-understanding-and-framework-former-sbi-chairman-rajnish-kumar/">https://inc42.com/buzz/crypto-regulation-requires-international-understanding-and-framework-former-sbi-chairman-rajnish-kumar/</a></p> Morocco to Publish Crypto Regulations Soon <p>Morocco is on the verge of completing the crypto regulatory framework and will make it public soon, as per Abdellatif Jouahri, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) governor. Bank Al-Maghrib is the central bank of&nbsp;Morocco.</p><p>Mr. Jouahri also said that the central bank had coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank before drafting the regulations. As such, consultation with global financial bodies has enabled Morocco’s central bank to set a new benchmark regarding crypto regulations.</p><p>Read more about it here: <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-moroccos-central-bank-to-unveil-crypto-regulation-bill-soon/">https://news.bitcoin.com/report-moroccos-central-bank-to-unveil-crypto-regulation-bill-soon/</a></p><p>_____________________</p><p>There’s one thing absolutely clear amid the current crypto market downturn: the financial regulators &amp; governments around the world are 100% determined to bring crypto-assets within the regulatory net. It means Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must begin complying with local and international digital asset regulations, as there’s no way around&nbsp;it.</p><p>The most crucial piece of global digital asset regulation is FATF’s Travel Rule. And even if the country in which the VASP is based hasn’t adopted the Travel Rule, it is better to stay prepared. After all, with FATF pushing for faster Travel Rule adoption, all countries will begin enforcing it sooner or&nbsp;later.</p><p>The first thing that VASP will need to comply with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP), and Veriscope is the best one out there.

  <p>Architecture, operating model and governance are key viewpoints for every business as a whole and its subdomains as well. Depending of size of the organization, information security may be managed as single domain or divided into multiple subdomains. Viewpoints and domains are still static and there is needed a implementation strategy which must be proportional, sustainable and relevant in the agile and disparate world with limited resources.</p>
<p>Identity Fabric has become a reference architecture for IAM recently and describes how identity services could be built. But it is still one of multiple subdomains of information security. We will take a broader look and analyze how the Identity Fabric could fit into the cybersecurity programs.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-identity-access-management-2022-07-06-vool"></a>

<p>Dock is building a gateway to Web3 by providing simple solutions for businesses and developers to build, manage and present digital Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identities using blockchain. </p><p>Dock provides credentialing technology that can be used to create cryptographically secure and instantly verifiable digital credentials, including workforce certificates, academic achievements, identity documents, and KYC checks. <br></p> Problems With Existing Centralized Credential Systems <p>Identity management has been a major concern since the internet was invented. Centralized identity management has always been vulnerable to threats, cyberattacks, and privacy breaches with a single point of failure. Billions of dollars have been spent providing a private and secure space for digital transactions. </p><p>We also know that large companies and governments control this information on our behalf. This whole control of large organizations sparked the entire movement of decentralization that propelled the applications of decentralized technologies like blockchain. The movement started with financial data and gave its origin to Bitcoin. Now this whole movement is addressing the necessity of decentralizing ownership of every data and we are calling it Web3.</p><p>Web3 is an umbrella term for the next iteration of the internet that is blockchain-based, decentralized, transparent, secure, and provides true ownership of data to its users. This will also enhance the portability and security of our identity documents such as passports, educational certificates, driving licenses, social media resumes, and more. </p><p>This is one side of the problem. There is another side where the data is having no protection from getting forged and the documents produced in various industries are getting forged. Verifying a paper-based or pdf-based certificate/credential in a fast-paced environment like today is often time-consuming and prone to errors. Hence, you can see an interconnected web of problems where the centralized database of these documents is a goldmine for hackers, the documents can be easily forged and pirated for malicious purposes, and adding to this, there is no instant verification infrastructure available. </p><p>Right from our birth, we receive numerous certificates and credentials like birth certificates, driving license, national and taxation IDs, education degrees and transcripts, and medical certificates, to name a few. From an individual to an organization, the potential documents that need to be protected, kept private, and might need authentication verification are uncountable. This is where we need a blockchain-based cryptography-enabled solution that can make any document tamper-proof with instant verification, Verifiable Credentials (VC).</p> Introduction to Web3 and Decentralized Identity<br> <p>The Web3 movement is not only limited to ownership, it is also about how we establish trust. This vast amount of data and information individuals and organizations are generating at a massive scale remains unverified and unauthenticated. Billions of dollars have been spent only to establish 2 fundamental necessities in the ecosystem - Security and Trust. </p><p>Web3 is the next evolution of the World Wide Web that incorporates decentralization, blockchain technologies, and token-based economics. </p><p>Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to generate and control their own digitial identity without depending on a specific service provider. Web3 is about ownership and by using Dock’s technology, individuals can now truly own their most important documents and IDs and regain control over their data. </p><p>A major component of Web3 is blockchain technology. In fact, blockchain technology is the foundation on which Web3 is built since it revolves around decentralization. By building on a blockchain network, transactions are open, decentralized, and secure. Dock’s proof of stake blockchain is built for Web3. </p><p>Web3 is a newly popular term, but we have been working in this space since 2017. The Web3 Foundation recognized our efforts in the space and provided Dock with a grant to help organizations adapt and innovate in the Web3 ecosystem by helping them understand the true ownership of their data and making their documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable. <br></p> What is Dock? <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> is a pioneer in the revolutionary Web3 space. Since 2017, we have been building cutting-edge Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Credentials (VC) technology, which will act as a gateway to Web3 in the future. We have been helping organizations to adapt and innovate in the Web3 ecosystem by helping them understand the true ownership of their data and making their documents, certificates, and credentials become digital, tamper-proof, and instantly verifiable. Web3 is about ownership and by using Dock’s technology, individuals can now truly own their most important documents and regain control over their data.</p><p>Dock has built a decentralized network for issuing credentials and decentralized identifiers. But what does that mean for someone like you and me? Well, in our daily lives we come across questions like these situations:<br></p>  Is the doctor who will treat me at this hospital board certified?  Is there an easier way to provide your necessary personal information for KYC for a bank or financial app?<br>   Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers Explained <p>A digital identity is the body of information about an individual, organization, or electronic device that exists online. Data that form a digital identity includes a user name, password, and online searches. Almost all of our digital identities are connected through devices, apps, and services. </p><p>Up till now, we have only interacted with centralized identity systems and IDs where you create an account to access a service and enter personal information. Then, you either wait to manually authenticate this information or wait for automatic processes that only create your identity but not reliably authenticate it. This may be your educational certificates, customer IDs, employee IDs, business operation credentials, passport, or driving license, and the list is endless. Even your email and social media accounts are also a form of digital ID that you create yourself automatically just by agreeing to the terms and conditions of the platform. However, all the data produced by you using these central identifiers are not completely owned by you and the authentication processes are taxing. </p><p>Decentralized identity systems allow users to gain control, store, and manage their own identities and data. Users decide how and when they share their data and with whom. Instead of being siloed in one place, data is decentralized to each user. </p><p>Users have a digital identity wallet that stores their credentials and documents as Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Verifiable Credentials are cryptographically signed digital documents that can be instantly verified and authenticated based on the identity and trustworthiness of the issuer. Using VCs, you can prove your identity, skills and achievements, and a verifier will always know that the file was not modified or faked.</p><p>This identity wallet can hold verified user identity details such as their name, age, address, education, employment details, and financial information. The possibility to share verified information unlocks new opportunities with financial, employer, legal, and compliance-related use cases.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.dock.io/importance-of-verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials here</a>.</p><p>Each issuer and user has a DID, a Decentralized Identifier. A DID is an identifier that belongs to you. It's like an ID, similar to your employer or student ID, and you can have more than one. The big difference is this:oday the university gives you your Student ID. But with the Web3 enabled by Dock you:</p>  Generate the DID for yourself  Fully own and control your DIDsit  Can even create a different DID for every online interaction<br>  <p>The DID is written on the Dock blockchain when you create your DID. For example you can have multiple DIDs for: </p>  Your personal interests like signing in with one DID to play on different gaming websites  Professional purposes where you can use another DID to show educational credentials to employers when applying for a job  Financial reasons where you create a DID to access and use financial services  <p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.dock.io/blockchain-for-decentralized-identity/">Decentralized Identifiers here</a>.<br></p> The Dock Solution <p>We say Web3 will solve the problems related to data ownership, management, and security but nobody is demonstrating how. Web3, the decentralized internet built on the foundation of blockchain and cryptography has the potential to make this data secure, self-owned, and trustworthy. </p><p>This is where Dock is needed and we have built a technology that demonstrates how. We saw this problem and started to address this problem by building cutting-edge technology to ensure the data source can be known using decentralized identifiers and guaranteed (verified) using Verifiable Credentials. We have built a decentralized network for creating, issuing, and managing both Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identifiers on the Dock blockchain.</p><p>Dock’s Verifiable Credential ecosystem has the following 4 participants:<br></p>4 participants of a Verifiable Credential ecosystem<p><br>As the name suggests, the issuer is an entity that has the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials. This could be your college university issuing you a diploma after you finish the course, governmental organizations issuing you a national ID, etc. &nbsp;</p><p>The holder is someone who owns the credential. They store and share the Verifiable Credential from their digital wallet, in our case the Dock Wallet.</p><p>Lastly, the verifier is the one who validates or authenticates the credential. This could be a hiring company you’ve shared your diploma with.</p><p>Watch the video below to hear directly from our CEO, Nick Lambert to learn about the 4 actors of the Dock’s Verifiable Credential ecosystem.</p><p>But how is the identity verified?</p><p>The issuer issues the Verifiable Credential and digitally signs it with a cryptographic key (private key) that only the issuer can use.</p><p>When the verifier receives a credential, they will verify its authenticity through the Dock blockchain, an immutable and decentralized database.<br></p>Architecture of a Verifiable Credential Ecosystem built on Blockchain The Dock Blockchain - Built for Web3 <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/technology">Dock’s Substrate-based blockchain</a> provides an open-source, decentralized, and low-cost platform for organizations and developers to build Decentralized Identity and data applications for the Web3. Substrate is the primary blockchain SDK used by developers to create the parachains that make up the Polkadot network.</p><p>It is fast, interoperable, secure, scalable, and cost-efficient. It forms the basis of trust by maintaining a verifiable registry of all Dock-issued DIDs as well as additional functionality supporting Verifiable Credentials. Its architecture prevents the unauthorized modification of any data that is associated with a DID and the use of cryptography ensures that Verifiable Credentials are not tampered or forged. </p><p>Everyone using Web3 will need their own Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The Dock blockchain serves as the entry point with a protocol layer for all things Web3. Our blockchain-based credentialing system adheres to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C standards</a>. W3C is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work to set international standards for the World Wide Web. They created standards for URL, decentralized identifiers, and others. </p>Features of the Dock blockchain&nbsp; The Nominated Proof of Stake Consensus <p>Dock runs its own <a href="https://www.dock.io/validators">validator</a> network and our blockchain is built on Substrate (which is the same framework used throughout the Polkadot ecosystem). It uses the consensus mechanism offered by Substrate, which is a hybrid as it separates block production and finality and achieves them through different methods. The blockchain has the same consensus and governance mechanism as Polkadot.</p><p>In simple terms, nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) is the process of selecting validators to be allowed to participate in the consensus protocol. NPoS is a Proof-of-Stake variant that is used in Substrate-based Blockchains like Dock, Kusama, Edgeware, and Polkadot.</p><p>Nominated Proof of Stake has two entities in its space, the Nominators and the Validators. Nominators select validators they would like to process transactions, produce blocks, and validate transactions. They do so by staking Dock tokens. Validators process transactions, produce blocks (by putting transactions in blocks) and finalize them. They also validate blocks produced by other validators.</p><p><a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance">Learn more about governance on the Dock blockchain here.</a></p> Consensus and Framework <p>Dock uses the consensus mechanism offered by Substrate. The finality is achieved through a finality gadget called GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement). It finalizes chains rather than individual blocks and offers provable finality.</p><p>When Dock transitioned into utilizing PoS, the block production algorithm changed from Aura to BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension protocol) which selects a validator for each slot (interval of time) randomly using a VRF (Verifiable Random Function).</p> Dock Staking <p>There are 50 validators running the Dock blockchain at any given time. We are glad that Binance joined this group back in January 2022, which also includes highly regarded staking companies like Everstake, Stakin, Ryabina, My Container and others. All Dock token holders can participate in staking to earn rewards in the form of Dock tokens. <br></p> Dock Product Suite <p>Dock’s products are already capable of serving the largest organizations to instantly issue Verifiable Credentials and create decentralized identifiers on their own blockchain. We provide all of the necessary products for individuals and organizations to hold and manage these DIDs and Verifiable Credentials on a secure wallet app and verify these credentials.</p><p>Certs</p><p>We provide both ready-made and customizable VC and DID opportunities for companies and developers. Users can opt for whichever seems most convenient. Organizations that want to issue Verifiable Credentials without writing a line of code can simply use <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?utm_source=coinotag&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=guide">Dock Certs</a>. </p><p>Users can sign up for Dock Certs in a few clicks and start creating their Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. After the creation of the credential, organizations can send it to the user as a link in an email, a PDF or a JSON file. The JSON file can be saved in the user's digital identity wallet. Cryptography is used to ensure that the credentials were not modified since they were issued.</p><p>Certs API</p><p>Certs is available in both no-code and API versions. Dock offers developer-friendly APIs to easily and instantly issue, verify, manage, and revoke Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers on the Dock blockchain.</p><p>Wallet SDK</p><p>Using Dock Wallet SDK, developers can build a Verifiable Credentials wallet inside their own app and allow their users to store, receive, and manage their credentials as well as DOCK tokens. </p><p>Dock Wallet App</p><p>Individuals can store and manage these DIDs and Verifiable Credentials in a secure <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock wallet app</a>. With the Dock Wallet, you can now store your digital Verifiable Credentials and truly own your professional and educational achievements. </p><blockquote>All your data will not be stored on the Dock Blockchain. You will have complete control on your credentials via your personal app. <br></blockquote><p>This wallet can also be used to store, send, receive, and buy DOCK tokens.</p> Dock Partners and Clients <p>Currently, we are working with Seven Mile, an Australian-based organization that is using Dock Certs to issue educational qualification certificates to the students who are completing courses with their platform. </p><p>Winners of the prestigious Odyssey Momentum Hackathon, overhd has utilised our open-source software to implement and host a permissioned blockchain as well as leveraged Dock’s features of creating VCs and DIDs. </p><p>Dock has also advised Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, a German development agency commissioned by German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Dock assisted them with the technical architecture and features for a professional profile data wallet linked to atingi, a digital learning platform built by GIZ.</p><p>We have also announced several partnerships including Credenxia, an Australian workforce training company, and Xertify who is working on several pilots for COVID vaccine credentials in Mexico and Columbia. We are working with additional partners that will be announced later.</p> Dock Use Cases <p>Use cases for adopting Dock’s technology include healthcare, education, supply chain, finance, compliance, NFTs, DeFi, and many more sectors that rely heavily on credential data.</p><p>Let’s take the example of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/nfts-and-verifiable-credentials/?utm_source=coinotag&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=guide">NFT marketplaces</a>. Fraud is rampant both within and outside of the blockchain space, and NFTs are no exception with scammers setting up fake accounts and selling fake NFTs. A Verifiable Credential can be used to verify the identity of all parties involved in creating, buying, and selling NFTs, to ensure the reputation and authenticity of everyone involved without divulging private information. For example, an NFT creator could share a verifiable Credential that demonstrates a history of creating legitimate NFTs, or a seller can have a Verifiable Credential that shows a reputation score based on their previous NFT sales. And they can do this while remaining anonymous!</p><p>Here are some other examples of our use cases:<br></p>  Healthcare: &nbsp;Dock is working with a healthcare technology company that has created an ecosystem of credential issuers, employers, and individuals. We provide a platform to streamline credential issuing, verification and monitoring. With the use of Verifiable Credentials and blockchain, their product enables issuers to create digital Verifiable Credentials and a mobile app for individuals to store, share, and instantly verify in real-time. Learn more <a href="https://www.dock.io/case-study-healthcare">here</a>.<br>  Supply chain: &nbsp;Dock’s core technology can help businesses and government authorities ensure a legal and compliant supply chain with genuine goods and materials in addition to timely, reliable deliveries. The end results are significant savings in administrative expenses and increased profitability. Learn more <a href="https://www.dock.io/case-study-supply-chain">here</a>.<br>  E-learning / Education: The PDF certificate issued by e-learning platforms can easily be copied and imitators can fake their accomplishments. Adding a cryptographic signature by the issuer (the institute) using Certs or Certs API will make this certificate tamper-proof, instantly verifiable, and unique. Dock’s VC and VP can also help prevent cheating in academic and professional exams by confirming test taker’s identity. Learn more <a href="https://blog.dock.io/how-verifiable-credentials-can-transform-your-business/?_ga=2.77087509.1603741777.1656498704-1469528008.1651000225">here</a>.<br>  Employment: Dock Network streamlines the <a href="https://www.dock.io/case-study-workforce">hiring process</a> by providing credentials that are cryptographically verifiable. This can simplify and speed up the hiring process for both job seekers and employers by enabling instant and reliable verification of candidates’ skills and experiences. The end results are huge savings in administrative costs and increased trust in the talent pool.<br>  Financial Services: &nbsp;Identification and compliance practices are extremely important in providing financial services. Dock provides the technology to solve these verification challenges in the financial industry. Using Certs, Verifiable Credentials can be issued to provide a spectrum of financial and identity information that individuals and companies can present in order to unlock access to services. Learn more <a href="https://www.dock.io/case-study-finance">here</a>.<br>   DOCK token <p>All transactions to the Dock Blockchain, like creating DIDs, updating Revocation Registries, and creating Schemas amongst others, require <a href="https://www.dock.io/token">DOCK tokens</a>. The use of DOCK extends further to other initiatives that include governance and staking. </p><p>The utilities of DOCK can be divided into 3 main categories:</p>  Governance: Token holders can actively participate in submitting proposals, voting, and electing council members  Network operations: &nbsp;Dock tokens are used to pay for transactions in the network such as creating DIDs, anchoring and revoking credentials, and sending payments  Staking and validating: Validators are paid emission rewards for validating and those rewards are shared with nominators who support them<br>  <p>The total supply of DOCK tokens is fixed at 1 billion. Out of which 70% is with holders, 15% is with the Treasury and Dock Association, and 15% is for emission rewards. </p><p>According to the team, the circulating supply is 770 million and the emission of the remaining DOCK will happen over 25 years distributing 25-30% per year. DOCK’s token emission schedule can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">here</a>.</p> The Dock Team <p>The Dock Network is supported by two entities:</p>  ​​Dock Association: &nbsp;A Swiss non-profit Association dedicated to overseeing the network’s roadmap, establishing and providing ongoing governance, overseeing the promotion of the network and also driving its adoption.  Dock Labs: &nbsp;The team behind Dock working on developing the technology and driving marketing, business development, and operations to fulfill Dock’s vision.   <p>The team is led by Nick Lambert and Elina Cadouri who come with a wealth of experience in the blockchain and data tech industry. Nick, CEO at Dock, has been working in the blockchain industry since 2011 and was the COO of one of the earliest companies working in the Blockchain space, MaidSafe. Elina, COO of Dock, has remarkable experience in the data network industry. Lead Developer Lovesh Harchandani is an expert in the Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identity industry creating one of the most innovative solutions at Dock, and previously at Evernym. You can read more about our team and our entities <a href="https://www.dock.io/about">here</a>.<br><br></p> Final Conclusions <p>Web3 is not only about the Metaverse and NFTs. It is also going to be largely about data ownership. Web2 uses centralized identifiers like social media accounts and email addresses to access websites and apps while a Web3 ID will enable you to surf, transact, or share your data securely on a decentralized internet while fully owning and controlling your digital identity. <br></p><p>This Web3 ID:</p>  Will carry your credentials, IDs, your reputation, and the linked data in a decentralized digital wallet  Opens multiple use cases in DeFi and NFT marketplacesEnables the ability to prove/verify transactions and ownership of assets without revealing wallet address or the entire history of transactions<br>  <p>Dock already has all of the &nbsp;technology and tools to support functionality for decentralized identities. Adding the support of Verifiable Credentials is a powerful and secure way to add trust and authenticity to every credential, document, or a certificate used in Web3 while ensuring the privacy of everyone participating.</p>

We should own and control our identity and&nbsp;data.<p>What is your identity? It’s the ability to represent to the world who you are. That can cover everything from what you wear to who you associate with to what country you are from. Your identity is a collection of attributes that describe&nbsp;you.</p><p>In practice, proving your identity is also the key to unlocking your social and economic potential — physically and digitally. Society has always been built on trust, and sometimes, we need to know who we’re dealing&nbsp;with.</p><p>As such, your identity is core to who you are and what you’re able to do, whether that’s buying something online, opening a bank account, or starting a business.</p><p>The problem is that the way we deal with identity hasn’t caught up to the modern&nbsp;world.</p><p>Part of the reason is that our most credible forms of identifying documents like driver’s licenses and passports still live in the analog world. The pandemic further shone a light on those limitations with places like the U.S. still reliant on paper vaccination cards, which are inefficient, difficult to verify, and easy to counterfeit.</p><p>One of the issues with analog identifying documents is that not everyone has them. The reality is that our current system <a href="https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/">excludes 1.7 billion people from basic financial services</a>, many of whom lack traditional forms of identity. For instance, migrant workers may not even have a home&nbsp;address.</p><p>Things aren’t much better in today’s digital world, where an abundance of online accounts means that our identity and personal data are scattered across servers vulnerable to attack. Outside of just giving away your email and phone number or accepting tracking cookies on your browser, some services collect more official forms of identity. Have you ever had to send a picture of your driver’s license or insert your passport number when buying something online?</p><p>The result? In just the first half of 2019, <a href="https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/2019-midyear-data-breach-quickview-report">an astounding 4.1 billion records were compromised</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, we don’t own the digital identities we create. The Facebooks and Googles of the world do and profit mightily from our data. And because they own our data on their proprietary platforms, we can’t easily bring our identity and data with us if we decide to go somewhere else. The reputation you created on Facebook Marketplace as a long time seller is stuck on Facebook. If you ever decide to sell on Ebay, you’re starting from&nbsp;zero.</p><p>The fragmentation of your digital identity extends well beyond popular websites. A pillar of the United States traditional financial system is the credit score — a system entirely predicated on centralized digital identity that you have no control over. Anyone who’s moved to the U.S. from abroad understands the challenge of trying to get a mortgage or even open a bank account — even if you had great credit in your home&nbsp;country.</p><p>Do you want to know the worst part? The digital identities described above aren’t even that credible in the first place. Most social media platforms are more concerned with expanding their user base than verifying accounts are owned by real people, contributing to society’s growing trust&nbsp;deficit.</p><p>What we need is a human-centric approach to digital identity, one that is easier, safer, and cheaper than the one we have&nbsp;today.</p><p>We need a digital identity that works for people and organizations alike.</p><p>Your digital identity should&nbsp;be:</p>  Self-sovereign. We should own and control our identity and data. Further, we should be able to decide who we share our data&nbsp;with.  Private, secure and encrypted. Our data should be private and safe, always. You should be confident that only you have access to the information you create, save, and share. Third party entities and bad actors should never have the opportunity to see your information in the first&nbsp;place.  Interoperable and portable. Our identities should be premised on globally accepted standards just like the internet is built on interoperable protocols that power the web and email. They shouldn’t be locked into proprietary, closed ecosystems dictated by corporations or governments. Moreover, we should be able to bring our identity with us to whatever platform we choose. Remember when your cell phone number was locked into your mobile service provider? Today, our phone numbers are portable. You can bring your phone number with you no matter what provider you choose. The same will be the case for our digital identities.  Built on verifiable credentials. You should be able to verify your identity once, receive a machine-verifiable credential, and reuse that credential many times over. This means you won’t have to redundantly verify your identity and re-share your data each time you interact with a new business or service. The best part is that those services never need to see your personal information to know it is true. That way, businesses can trust that you are who you say you are, and don’t need to store and manage your personal data on their servers. Less servers holding your data means a more secure identity.  Usable. What good is a fancy digital identity if it is impossible to use in your daily life? Digital identity and the associated credentials are going to take years to be adopted by 100% of establishments. That’s why it is crucial to make safer digital identity useful in the contexts we are living in today. That might mean making it easier to store and share a picture of your ID card. Tomorrow it could mean applying for a bank account. Next year, it might mean doing your taxes. Human-centric digital identity must meet the moment, wherever it may&nbsp;be.  Inclusive. Identity is a human right. Anyone, anywhere should be able to create one. Notably, your identity should grant you access to basic services such as banking and payments.  <p>It’s clear that the way we handle our identities today is broken. What’s incredibly exciting is that a convergence of developments across fintech, regtech, and web3 now enable a smarter, better, and more inclusive framework.</p><p>Human-centric digital identity is the key to a future that works for us, allowing us to set new standards for how we deal with issues like financial inclusion, communication and censorship, and even the integrity of our democratic elections.</p><p>Our identities are the building blocks for a modern society and economy. We owe it to ourselves and each other to get this&nbsp;right.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about how digital identity can work for you and stay up to date with the latest updates, sign up for the monthly <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">GlobaliD Insider newsletter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">GlobaliD 101: How digital identity should work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Revised July 1, 2022</p>
<p>This week, Freddie Mac announced the latest Loan Product Advisor® (LPASM) enhancement that includes on-time rent payments as part of the company’s purchase determinations.</p>
<p>Mastercard, a designated third-party service provider for Freddie Mac, is excited to provide two reports for lenders that include rent payment history.</p>
<p>Our<a href="https://www.finicity.com/demo/"> Mortgage Verification Services (MVS)</a> product provides the consumer-permissioned data necessary for LPA’s rent payment history credit assessment with no setup required for the lender. If you’re already using an MVS asset report, you will automatically send the data necessary for a rent assessment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html">Mastercard’</a>s open banking platform (provided by Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary,<a href="https://www.finicity.com/"> Finicity</a>), is a designated service provider that offers a digital, single-vendor solution for assets, income and employment through both<a href="https://sf.freddiemac.com/"> Freddie Mac</a> and<a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/"> Fannie Mae</a>. By automating the asset and income assessment process, we can also provide transaction data for rent payment history, direct deposits and 10-day pre-closing reports for employment verification. These solutions help to streamline lenders’ loan approval process and increase homeownership opportunities to qualified borrowers.</p>
 Rent Payment History in Lender Credit Decisioning 
<p>By virtue of sheer numbers, millennials are defining the trends of today’s housing market. The age group now accounts for 43% of all homebuyers so far in 2022, according to a new report by the<a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2022-home-buyers-and-sellers-generational-trends-03-23-2022.pdf"> National Association of Realtors</a>. With approximately one-third of this demographic<a href="https://risk.lexisnexis.com/insights-resources/article/credit-invisibles#:~:text=Denying%20Credit%20for%20Millennials,millennial%20consumers%20are%20credit%20invisible."> being credit invisible</a>, there’s an opportunity to incorporate additional data sources to help establish creditworthiness and the ability to repay the loan. The integration of rent payment history into the mortgage lending process can be helpful to first-time homebuyers who have a strong track record of on-time rent payments, creating a new path to homeownership while still promoting safe lending.</p>
<p>In addition to this week’s announcement from Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae has included rent payments in their automated mortgage credit decisioning process in Desktop Underwriter® (DU®) since September 18, 2021. Fannie Mae identified recurring rent payments in bank statements and transaction data as a factor which could deliver a more inclusive credit assessment.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae said 17% of applicants who have not owned a home in the last three years and who did not receive a favorable mortgage recommendation could have instead received an “approved” or “eligible” recommendation if their rental payment history had been considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take advantage of the rent payment history feature, Mastercard provides a Verification of Asset and Income (VOAI) and a Verification of Assets (VOA) report through its Mortgage Verification Service (MVS) that includes 12 or 24 months of transaction data that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae can use to identify rent payment history that may provide a more favorable credit assessment.</p>
<p>If they are using the VOA report, lenders have the freedom to access either two or 12 months of data to satisfy their own underwriting requirements. The reports can be called with a direct API or are available currently in ICE Encompass and Encompass Consumer Connect, as well as the SimpleNexus mortgage point-of-sale (POS) platform.&nbsp;</p>
 Integrated with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae Systems 
<p>Mastercard is a service provider for Freddie Mac’s automated underwriting system, LPA, which automates the assessment of borrower assets, income and employment using LPA asset and income modeler (AIM). By leveraging the expertise of service providers, AIM helps to deliver a simpler, more efficient loan origination process.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae’s DU validation service also accepts our mortgage verification services to independently validate borrower assets, income, and employment data—providing Day 1 Certainty® on validated loan components. By digitally validating secure third-party data through DU, you can help eliminate the paper chase and help get your borrowers approved quicker.</p>

We are focused on building the infrastructure and delivering the tools for Web3. Ontology’s high-speed, low-cost public blockchain is designed to increase privacy, transparency, and trust, aiming to be a public chain that puts the users’ security and privacy front and center, whilst also allowing for interoperability. We recently launched Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to increase Ontology’s functionality by adding an Ethereum account system, Ethereum transaction types, and Web3 APIs to the existing Ontology blockchain.

The former IDnow and ARIADNEXT teams both have valuable benefits and skills and my job will be to bring this together into one platform that answers the needs of European companies across jurisdictions and use cases,” explained Jean-Marc Guyot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m especially excited to work with the teams in France and Germany and to meet the high standards in technology that are key for the IDnow Group,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jean-Marc Guyot started his career in 1995 as a system architect at LSI Logic, where he worked on the first Digital Terrestrial TV digital demodulation chip. He then joined NXP as Product Marketing Director.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2004 he founded Silembia, a high-tech startup, that he then sold to Silicon Laboratories (an American semiconductor company) and moved to the USA to manage the merger of the teams. Back in France in 2014, he joined ENENSYS to create the Telecom Business Unit with a focus on LTE Broadcast technology. There, he actively participated in the 3GPP SA4 standardisation committee. Early in 2019, he became Vice President of Engineering for Cloud-Based Security Services at WALLIX, before taking over the entire R&amp;D department. He created the R&amp;D site in Rennes which now employs more than 40 people and also re-sited the company in the future CyberPlace beacon building in Rennes. Finally, he and his teams won the “Grand Défi Cyber” with the OSCAR project and implemented the transformation of the R&amp;D teams into agile mode.</p>



<p>“Jean-Marc brings a wealth of technology and international leadership experience into his role. His arrival at IDnow will further accelerate the development of IDnow’s Identity proofing platform, starting with combining the best-in-class technology stack from all IDnow group companies. I’m looking forward to working with him,” commented Vikas Seth, IDnow Chief Product Officer.</p>

What a day! <a href="https://t.co/CVZsHOjBeL">pic.twitter.com/CVZsHOjBeL</a></p>— Kai (@Kai_dentity) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kai_dentity/status/1534543537680830464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>From 2021 until 2024, the German ministry of economics and climate action is funding four projects for “Secure Digital Identities”, each in a different part of Germany and executed by a consortium of different partners, stemming, respectively, from community administrations, industry sectors, tech providers, research institutions and use specific implementation partners. The four consortia are called ONCE, ID-Ideal, SDIKA and ID-Union.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ONCE consortium is one of the most ambitious of these four projects – led by the Bundesdruckerei they have the ambitious plan to be the first of the four SDI projects to wrap, by late summer of 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, with one year left and the pandemic-situation finally permitting to meet in person, it was time for an interim project meeting of the #ONCE2022 consortium. Altogether 65 participants gathered in Willingen from 8th – 9th June to discuss project milestones, next steps, and new developments. After multiple attempts and postponements, it was the first in-person meeting of the whole project team since the beginning of the implementation phase. As representatives from Jolocom, Kai Wagner and Ben Biedermann attended and presented our work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this get-together it was satisfying to see the progress made in the different work packages. From implementing first prototypes in the field of electronic identity (eID) or mobile driving license (mDL), to creating student ID’s, communal and resident credentials, as well as credentials for the tourism and hospitality industry: the past year has been a productive one. Aside from updating each other on our individual progress, in collaborative brainstorming sessions we also put our physical presence to effective use. One session was focussed on improving our future users’ journey by applying innovative approaches from different digital industries to the problems we tackle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Jolocom SmartWallet is the wallet of choice for all ONCE compliant use cases, but also in the broader SDI (Secure Digital Identity) ecosystem, with <a href="https://id-ideal.de/">ID-Ideal</a> and <a href="https://www.sdika.de/">SDIKA</a> using it as well. We saw six demonstrators for eID, mDL, and SSI credentials of all sorts from different partners. Furthermore, the Jolocom Agent is becoming increasingly popular among project partners as an efficient prototyping and implementation tool, be it as API or application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
<blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SSI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SSI</a> architectures don't change? Look closely. Iterations matter. We received good feedback when <a href="https://twitter.com/GETJolocom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GETJolocom</a> presented a perspective on the <a href="https://twitter.com/SDIKA_de?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SDIKA_de</a> solution at the <a href="https://twitter.com/once_identity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@once_identity</a> meet-up in Willingen earlier this month. <a href="https://t.co/CmtmnqZrYa">pic.twitter.com/CmtmnqZrYa</a></p>— Ben Biedermann (@ben_criticus) <a href="https://twitter.com/ben_criticus/status/1539541741585551371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 22, 2022</a></blockquote>
 



<p>In Willingen, Jolocom was able to engage in and facilitate several technological discussions. Working together on the spot helped us generate new momentum and ideas for the upcoming months, where we are planning to move many of the use cases into pilots in our partner cities. We also engaged in fruitful conversations with representatives from ID-Ideal and SDIKA on issues pertaining to interoperability across the SDI ecosystem. These issues have previously been fostered by the Begleitforschung and are now picking up speed in bilateral projects and discussions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All workshops benefitted from the constructive attitude of the participants. The event highlighted the&nbsp; productive and well-natured relationships that have been established in this consortium. State of the art conference rooms and facilities added to the friendly and inspiring atmosphere. On a personal level, our hike to the ski resorts of the region was a fantastic opportunity and reminder to connect beyond tiles on a screen and reconfirmed the importance of personal connections for developing safe digital identities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just yesterday, W3C Decentralized Identifiers were <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/06/DIDRecommendationDecision.html">approved to be released</a> as an official W3C Recommendation. As a W3C member organization, we are thrilled by this excellent outcome, and will celebrate it by sharing our favorite ideas about the next evolutions of DIDs that will make them more secure, composable, and friendly to implementers.</p>DIDs 101<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> is a URI that resolves to a JSON object called a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a>, which describes how to authenticate as the DID’s controller for different purposes. When a service knows that it’s talking to the controller, it can use this fact as the consistent anchor point to construct a decentralized identity, enriching the session with related data referring to the DID such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">verifiable credentials (VCs)</a> or any associated information found on a public blockchain.</p><p>Where do DID documents come from? Each DID specifies a “DID method” that describes an exact resolution procedure (among other actions) to interpret the DID’s “method specific identifier” and ultimately produce a DID document.</p>DID Documents 101<p>DID methods can retrieve data from a variety of sources: TLS-protected websites, public blockchains, or solely from the method-specific identifier itself. Over the past several years, dozens of different DID methods have emerged in practice, with proponents enthusiastic at how powerful and flexible DIDs can be to bridge disparate trust systems (e.g., Ethereum, GPG, and X.509), and detractors declaring an impending interoperability nightmare, with plenty of headaches for implementers. </p><p>However, there is a way we can prevent this impending interop nightmare!</p><p>Enter DID method traits: testable properties about DID methods that can help implementers tame complexity and choose the right DID method(s) for their use case. They can be used as requirements revealing which DID methods could satisfy the relevant constraints presented across different use cases. </p><p>For example, requirements to support certain operations for the NIST Curve P-256, NIST-proposed Curve Ed25519, bitcoin Curve secp256k1 could all be expressed as different DID method traits complete with test suites. Also expressible as DID traits is the guarantee that a DID method is “purely generative,” requiring no storage lookups as in the case of did-key and did-pkh, as opposed to those actively querying a network such as did-web, did-ens, and did-ion.</p><p>Finally, there may exist a DID method trait that ensures composability across different DID methods: that one DID may serve as the authentication method for another DID, such as <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-pkh/blob/main/did-pkh-method-draft.md">did-pkh</a> for <a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">did-ens</a> or <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion">did-ion</a>.</p><p>This means that a user can start with an Ethereum account represented as did-pkh, then “upgrade” to a DID method that supports key rotation such as did-ens or did-ion. This helps create a great user experience when using DIDs, as with this approach, users do not need to set up a new decentralized public key infrastructure just to get started.<br></p><p>Instead, they can start with whatever key-based accounts they have, leverage the corresponding DID methods, and graft their existing identifier to a more featureful DID method supporting this kind of composability whenever needed.</p><p>Previous work has been done on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-rubric/">DID method rubric</a>, which evaluates criteria as wide-ranging as underlying network decentralization, adoption metrics, and regulatory compliance. DID method traits may exist as a subset of possible criteria in the DID method rubric, or as a parallel spec used in conjunction.</p><p>I will be writing a paper on DID method traits as my submission to the forthcoming Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT) conference in The Hague.

European Parliament room (Frederic Köberl/Unsplash) Crypto-Asset Service Providers will be obligated to collect the personal information of the originator and beneficiary of crypto transactions, no matter the&nbsp;amount. <blockquote>Key Takeaways<br>Once implemented, the provisional agreement will make it mandatory for Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to collect personal information on both the originator and beneficiary of a crypto transaction.</blockquote><blockquote>Unlike FATF’s Travel Rule, there is no minimum ceiling limit for the AML-check-provision to kick&nbsp;in.</blockquote><blockquote>P2P crypto transfers won’t be subject to AML checks under the provisional agreement.</blockquote><p>After three months of discussions, EU Co-legislators finally agreed on AML measures to prevent the use of digital assets for money laundering and terrorism financing on Wednesday.</p><p>With this provisional agreement, Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) will be obligated to collect the personal information of the originator and beneficiary of crypto transactions, no matter the amount. This move will make crypto transactions traceable, which, in turn, will enable CASPs to flag and block suspicious transactions.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/ernesturtasun/status/1542217824613064704?s=20&amp;t=R1qcJkKQZIdb7YCKIFslEA">Image Source</a><p>Interestingly, crypto transfers to unhosted wallets won’t be subject to AML checks, which is surprising as EU authorities <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/03/31/eu-parliament-votes-on-privacy-busting-crypto-rules-industry-rails-against-proposals/">had initially vouched for</a> bringing both hosted &amp; unhosted wallets under the regulatory purview. Industry players and experts were largely against such a move, terming it overregulation.</p><p>The backlash may have resulted in authorities backtracking from their initial stance of subjecting private wallets to AML checks. That said, the provisional agreement will also set specific guidelines for all transactions between CASPs and unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>As for data protection, general data protection regulation (GDPR) will continue to apply to crypto transactions. There won’t be any separate regulations for it. It basically means that only CASPs will be allowed to store the Travel Rule data, which will impact how some Travel Rule Solution Providers (TRSPs) work. And this is what separates Shyft Veriscope from the rest of the solutions available in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>After all, Veriscope has been designed in such a manner that the Travel Rule data isn’t stored in its system. Instead, the exchange of Travel Rule data exclusively happens between&nbsp;CASPs.</p> Roll out by&nbsp;2024? <p>The co-legislators also agreed to sync the rollout of this provisional agreement with the EU-wide crypto regulation, Markets in Crypto Assets&nbsp;(MiCA).</p><p>Recently, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said in her testimony to the EU parliament that the Markets in Crypto Assets is likely to be implemented by 2024. Thus, the provisional EU AML agreement, which is in line with FATF’s Travel Rule, specifically Sections 4 &amp; 5, too may be implemented in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>The first proposal on EU-wide AML rules published under the title “<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/210720-anti-money-laundering-countering-financing-terrorism_en">Anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism legislative package</a>” in July 2021 also states that “the AML authority should be operational in&nbsp;2024.”</p><p>Thus, the positive aspect behind the announcement is that CASPs will have a clear deadline to comply with EU AML regulations that aim to implement FATF’s Travel Rule within the boundaries of the 27-member bloc.</p><p>The first thing CASPs must do now is zero in on a Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP). And we have the best TRSP to suggest — Veriscope! It is the only solution that can tackle the “Sunrise Issue’’ effectively.</p><p>Go ahead and check out Veriscope here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">https://www.veriscope.network/</a>.

			  Ivie Satijn is Marketing &amp; Business Development Intern at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Ivie (pronounced “eevee”). I was born in the Netherlands, where I have spent my childhood, teenage years, and where I studied for my Bachelor’s Degree. I consider myself a lucky kid because my mother has shown me all the beautiful natural areas in the south of the Netherlands, and my father brought me on many trips all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After finishing high school, I went to South Korea to volunteer and when I returned, I began studying at University College Maastricht. Soon after starting this degree, I noticed that I was not happy. I needed a study program that was more practice-oriented; therefore, I decided to switch to International Business. This was a good choice because I really enjoyed learning about business and languages, and I had the chance to spend a semester in Colombia and another in Mexico. Also, I was able to have a side job as a sports instructor, which was a lot of fun!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last September, I moved to Luxembourg and started my Master’s Degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation. I really like the city, and I feel that it gives me plenty of opportunities to start a career or launch my own business.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Two years ago, I coincidentally discovered an online course on bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I did not know anything about blockchain, so I decided to start it. Almost immediately, I realized that I was very interested in the topic and I continued learning. Step by step, my enthusiasm for web3 grew and when I started to plan my internship, I set the goal to land a position at a blockchain startup. I am very grateful that Tokeny offered me to work with them.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Interactive, high-paced, innovative, and nicely challenging. I am truly having an amazing time. As an intern, I am given many responsibilities and the Tokeny team is actively working on making my learning journey as valuable as possible. Also, even though we are working remotely, I feel like there is a very friendly atmosphere in the team. In Dutch, I would describe it as very “<a href="https://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/155-gezellig">gezellig</a>”.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To live somewhere surrounded by loads of nature and animals.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Accept the fact that you will feel thrown into the deep in the beginning. If you are open to learning, you will quickly catch up with the work style and the terminology. From then on, the fun can start!</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Personally, I am particularly looking forward to the point when ONCHAINID will become the identity standard for web3 activities, and I therefore never have to worry about losing my digital assets anymore.</p>

<p>Due to its immutability and censorship resistance, the Blockchain seems to be a suitable place to manage identities and credentials. However, querying the data on the blockchain in a trusted and efficient way is one of the most challenging issues every Web3 developer has to face while developing a DApp. Therefore, this article describes a simple approach to revoke verifiable credentials and a decentralized and efficient way to index and query those revoked credentials using the <a href="https://thegraph.com/en/">Graph protocol</a>.</p><p>We consider the knowledge of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and rudimentary knowledge of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/master/doc/did-method-spec.md">Ethr DID method</a> as a requirement for understanding this&nbsp;article.</p> Ethr DID and Credentials <p>The Ethr DID method uses Ethereum addresses as identifiers. By default, the DID of the issuer/subject does not require an on-chain registration and it is constructed from the Ethereum address and controlled by its private key. This feature minimizes the effort of integrating Identities in many on-chain use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>When an off-chain verifiable credential is created, the issuer entity must set the “issuer” property to its Ethr DID and the “credentialSubject.id” property to the Ethr DID of the subject.&nbsp;Example:</p> "verifiableCredential": {<br>    "@context": [..],<br>    "issuer": {<br>      "id": "did:ethr:0xf1232f840f3ad7d23fcdaa84d6c66dac24efb198"<br>    },<br>    "issuanceDate": "2022-07-2T12:00:00.000Z",<br>    "credentialSubject": {<br>      "id": "did:ethr:0x435df3eda57154cf8cf7926079881f2912f54db4",<br>      "degree": "Bachelor Of Arts"<br>    },<br>    "proof": { ... }<br>  } <p>After that as usual the issued credential will be used by the subject to generate a verifiable presentation. The verifier will verify the presentation and accept or reject it depending on its business&nbsp;logic.</p> Credential Revocation <p>Verifiable Credentials are similar to certificates, some of them have an expiration date and some don’t. However, in both cases, the issuer and the subject must be able to revoke them. To enable this critical requirement, we need a tamper-proof revocation data registry that is always available and cannot be censored by any of the mentioned parties. This can be achieved using the Blockchain. Such a registry can be implemented as a simple smart contract that stores a reference of the credential and a reference of the entity who revoked&nbsp;it.</p><p>The revocation process:</p>  Get the hash value of the issued verifiable credential using the keccak256 hash function after converting the credentials to bytes. This value will be used as the on-chain reference to the credential  Send a transaction to the revocation smart contract to call the revoke method revoke(bytes32 digest)giving the extracted hash value as&nbsp;input  The entity that revoked the credential is the address of the invoker and it can be matched with the issuer or subject of the credential based on their&nbsp;DIDs  <p>The additional important key that will help use indexing those revocations is that when a credential is revoked, the revocation smart contract triggers an event that includes the keccak256 hash of that credential and the address of the entity that revoked&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the Github <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/vc-revocation-graph">Repository</a>, we prepared a simple project&nbsp;that:</p>  Deploys a revocation smart contract that stores references to the credential and the entity that revoked&nbsp;it.  Uses the did-jwt-vc and ethr-did libraries to issue 3 off-chain verifiable credentials by 3 different issuers and revoke them&nbsp;on-chain  <p>Please check the&nbsp;./ssi-contracts folder and follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/vc-revocation-graph/tree/main/ssi-contracts">README</a> file. After following the steps you should have the address of the revocation registry smart contract deployed on the Goerli network. The 3 revoked transactions can be found on <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> using the address of the deployed contract.</p><p>Why do we need to index the revoked Credentials?</p><p>In a verification scenario, the verifier gets a verifiable presentation that includes 1 to n verifiable credentials from the subject. In addition to the normal validation process of the credentials, the verifier must also check the on-chain status of the credential at any time easily and efficiently. To do that the verifier could request the status of each credential by calling the methodrevoked(address issuer, bytes32 digest) in the revocation registry contract. However, this approach of getting the information is limited, costly, and not efficient for many reasons, some of which&nbsp;are:</p>  It requires knowledge of the Blockchain and Web3 technology  It is slow and limited because of the latency, number of requests, node capability  It requires running a blockchain node or relaying on a node&nbsp;provider  Duplicate requests for the same credentials are sent over and over&nbsp;again  It requires the verifier to be online all the&nbsp;time  <p>And this is when indexing comes into play to provide an easy, fast and simple way to iterate and query data. Indexing is especially needed in the Blockchain area where its underlying design makes it difficult to search for relevant&nbsp;data.</p><p>But How can we index the Blockchain?</p><p>One approach is iterating all transactions and checking if the transaction interacts with our revocation contract. This method is very slow and resource-intensive. The other approach which is used by most developers is to subscribe to events that are triggered by the target contract. This method is much easier, supported by tools and libraries like web3js, and is more resource-saving. Now we come to the second important question of who should do the indexing? There are some possible&nbsp;answers:</p><p>1. The verifier himself. But it is not a good solution because each verifier needs to build up and maintain its own logic and infrastructure. Furthermore, the server of the verifier that is responsible for the indexing is a Single-point-of-failure</p><p>2. External ingestion service that indexes the data on behalf of the verifier. Such a service could be very useful. However, it creates one of the most critical issues which is the lack of TRUST. Verifiers need to trust the ingestion service and relying on it eliminates the advantage of using the Blockchain</p><p>3. Decentralized indexing protocol like The Graph protocol, which enables decentralized applications to query complex data from the blockchain without having to develop and operate proprietary indexing servers or use a centralized service provider. This is the preferred solution in most use cases&nbsp;because:</p>  It is distributed and decentralized. Therefore it removes the Single-point-of-failure and the missing trust&nbsp;issue  It does not require advanced Web3 knowledge. Developers use only GraphQL requests to query the data from already implemented and indexed Subgraphs  The technology behind it has been designed specifically for the Blockchain. Therefore, it is quick and easy to query and&nbsp;filter  Cost-efficient because indexers are competing with each other to provide the best service for the lowest&nbsp;price  Can be used by many verifiers around the world with minimal latency because the nodes are distributed and&nbsp;public  <p>The creators of the Graph protocol recognized the indexing and querying problem at the end of 2017 and started working to solve it by defining and implementing a decentralized indexing protocol. The <a href="https://thegraph.com/docs/en/about/introduction/">introduction page</a> of the Graph protocol offers detailed information about the protocol and you can also join the free and very useful courses provided by <a href="https://thegraph.academy/courses/">The Graph&nbsp;Academy</a>.</p><p>Develop and Deploy a Revocation Subgraph</p><p>A Subgraph defines which data should be indexed from a blockchain, and how it should be stored. In our simple example, the core data the verifier requires is the hash of the credential and who revoked it. To make things easier for verifiers we could also add the timestamp and block&nbsp;number.</p><p>To keep the article simple we will deploy the subgraph on a <a href="https://thegraph.com/docs/en/hosted-service/what-is-hosted-service/">hosted service</a>. Hosted service can be seen today as a good and easy place to start with the development of Subgraphs because it is free to use and reduces the deployment and testing complexity of Subgraphs. Developers can at any time migrate their Subgraphs to the decentralized network.</p><p>The following steps to develop and deploy the Subgraph are described in detail with all the related files in this <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/vc-revocation-graph/tree/main/credential-revocation-subgraph-files">repository</a>&nbsp;:</p>  First, initialize a new sample project using the <a href="https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli">graph&nbsp;cli</a>  Then modify some of the configurations like adding a startBlock and checking the address of the&nbsp;contract  After that comes the main part of the development which is to define the entities and implement the handle method that will be executed when an event is emitted by a smart&nbsp;contract  In the end, build the project and deploy it on the hosted service using the graph cli and an access&nbsp;token  <p>When the Subgraph is deployed and synchronized we can query the indexed data using simple GraphQL requests.</p><p>Example: open https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/&lt;github-name&gt;/credential-revocation-graph in browser and run the following query to get the hashes of all credentials that are revoked by Issuer-A from&nbsp;./ssi-contracts</p>Query revoked credentials by an&nbsp;issuer<p>The results should contain only a single revoked credential unless you modified the scripts inside&nbsp;./ssi-contract or used an already existing contract for this query. You can also compare the results with the logged data of the executed script in./ssi-contract</p> Summary <p>In this article, we described one of many approaches on how to revoke issued credentials. This outlined approach benefits from the Ethr DID characteristic and it depends on the Blockchain as an immutable registry accessible for all parties. We also talked about the likely best way to index and query revoked credentials without relying on centralized services. And at the end, we showed how to develop a simple Subgraph that could run on the Graph protocol decentralized indexing <a href="https://thegraph.com/explorer/">network</a> and index the required&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> is a provider of crypto-economy solutions based in Stuttgart, Germany.</p><p>51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/indexing-and-querying-revoked-verifiable-credentials-e229dc2781d4">Indexing and Querying Revoked Verifiable Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF2 rewards. DF3 counting has begun. Maxing&nbsp;APY.  1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (LPs / stakers) for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 2 (DF2) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF2 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 23, 2022, and ended 11:59pm Wed Jun 29, 2022 (one week later). 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were computed and sent to the claims contracts. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>DF Round 3 (DF3) is also part of DF Alpha phase. DF3 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 30, 2022, and will end on 11:59pm Wed Jul 6, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards is available.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, then details on DF2 and DF3. And, it has a special section on really playing the DF game, including exploring “wash consuming”.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF2 Input Parameters <p>DF2 is the second week of DF overall, and second week of DF Alpha. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>DF2 parameters were the same as DF1. The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included these parameters. Then, “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-examples-c2d67a17b5f5">Ocean Data Farming Examples: DF1</a>” provided examples to better understand earnings, against the DF1 rewards formula and related settings.</p> 4. DF3 Input Parameters <p>The rewards formula and related settings for DF3 are the same as for DF1 and&nbsp;DF2.</p><p>This may not always be the case: we can expect round-to-round evolution of the Reward Function and related settings, based on learnings.</p> 5. DF2 Output&nbsp;Stats <p>OceanONDA V4 currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet (chainid 1), Polygon (137), Binance Smart Chain (BSC: 56), Energy Web Chain (EWC: 246), and Moonriver (1285).</p><p>Only Polygon and EWC had nonzero DCV in DF1, so we focus on&nbsp;those.</p><p>Exchange rate was 0.1968 OCEAN/USD, taken from Binance&nbsp;API.</p>  Total Stake (averaged across 7 days). Polygon 1,224,440 OCEAN, EWC 5423 OCEAN, total 1,229,863 OCEAN ($242,037 USD). Stake grew through the week, from just over 1M OCEAN to about 3M&nbsp;OCEAN.  Total DCV (total across 7 days). Polygon 961.98 OCEAN, EWC 4.59 OCEAN, total 966.57 OCEAN ($190.22&nbsp;USD).  OCEAN rewarded to LPs. Polygon 9999.192 OCEAN, EWC 0.8080 OCEAN, total 10000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Rewards Stats. Rewards were dispensed to 138 LPs. The largest reward was 4393.86 OCEAN, the smallest 3.3e-20 OCEAN, average 72.46 OCEAN, median 1.119&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>For more info yet, see the <a href="https://market-git-fix-1562-oceanprotocol.vercel.app/asset/did:op:a3aa14de333ee1ecb3b8a842954033c1c0004f9e77020cacb861843478c1079c">DF2 csvs</a> published as a free asset in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> 6. How to improve your APY? Playing the&nbsp;game. <p>Among other things, Data Farming is a game. Understand it better to earn more. Let’s start with the following curious datapoint: a single LP earned 44% of this round’s DF rewards (4393.86/10000). What game were they playing? Then to flip it around: can you play it? Consider this an opportunity for&nbsp;you.</p><p>To understand DF better, you need to understand what governs your payout. This is the rewards formula. Roughly speaking, reward = DCV * stake. Therefore, increasing DCV increases your rewards, and increasing your stake increases rewards.</p><p>Then ask yourself: how do you increase DCV, or stake? For stake, it’s obvious: just stake more. What about DCV? Well, there’s real consume and fake consume (“wash consuming”). Real consume is when people buy datasets and use them for real. This is a core value proposition for Ocean Protocol: Ocean makes it easy to monetize data, without compromising privacy or control. And of course since Ocean is still relatively young, then there is tremendous upside potential for real DCV. Create real datasets and algorithms that people want to consume, and the rest will&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Some LPs have discovered that wash consuming is profitable right now. A few hundred OCEAN spent on “fake” consumes will increase DCV, and can lead to thousands in OCEAN&nbsp;reward.</p><p>When real DCV is still low-ish, then this strategy pays. Therefore in the near term, expect more wash consuming!</p><p>Over time, we can expect liquidity to migrate to pools with maximum real DCV. This is because every $ on real volume is a $ that the LP doesn’t have to spend to create fake volume. So, as real DCV rises and wash consuming grows, profitability of wash consume will shrink. Eventually, real DCV will get big enough that it won’t be profitable to wash&nbsp;consume.</p><p>The 3% fee rate on every consume establishes this&nbsp;limit:</p><blockquote>If Consume Fee &gt; weekly Rewards Cap, then problem solves&nbsp;itself</blockquote><blockquote>— Manan&nbsp;Patel</blockquote><p>Well put. The weekly rewards cap is currently 10,000 OCEAN. At a 3% rate, DCV needs to be &gt; 10000 / 3% = 333,333 OCEAN. Put another way, if there was a DCV of 333,333 OCEAN, it would mean that total fees gathered for consume are 333,333 OCEAN * 3% = 10,000 OCEAN. Wash-consumers have paid 10,000 OCEAN in fees, and get just 10,000 OCEAN reward. Any higher DCV and it’s unprofitable to wash-consume. However, real data consumers are happy to keep buying and using the data, because they get business benefit from it. In short: once weekly real DCV exceeds 333,333 OCEAN wash consuming won’t be profitable.</p><p>The DF core team considered several mechanisms to stop wash consuming. But each of these adds complexity. However, as discussed, evolution will shrink wash consume over time anyway! In the meantime, we see it as as an extra incentive for the Ocean community to learn about Ocean Market and Ocean DF more. Therefore, the core team has held back from intervening. Let’s let evolution happen:)</p> 7. Conclusion <p>DF2 has completed. To claim DF2 rewards, go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF3 counting has begun.

<p>Today (June 28, 0222), the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI issued a warning</a> stating that scammers may be trying to score jobs at companies to access customer or financial data, corporate IT databases, and/or proprietary information. It goes on to state that there has been an increase in complaints reporting the use of deepfakes and stolen Personally Identifiable Information data (PII) to apply for various remote work and work-at-home positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a solvable problem, beginning with strong identity verification during the hiring process. Unfortunately, while identity verification is a standard process, current practices have failed to keep up with fraudsters.&nbsp;</p>
 Contractor Fraud and the Rise of Remote Work 
<p>Many organizations require the use of contractors, known as third parties. Managing these non-employees through the HR system, the authoritative identity source for their IT ecosystem, can be burdensome. In addition, third-party individuals often require access to organizational resources such as shared tools, applications, or data sets to provide critical services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that this access is usually for a limited period. Third parties present challenges and bring additional risks, such as ensuring that access rights and permissions are managed correctly and, when required, deprovisioned quickly. With the rise of remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, these concerns have only been exacerbated</p>
<p>Many companies assume that virtually checking a photo of a new contractor’s driver’s license and passport ensures that they are always the person logging in and working from home every day. Unfortunately, this isn’t necessarily the case. The increase in remote work in the last year has made it easier for fraudsters to attack your organization.&nbsp;</p>
 How Does Contractor Fraud Happen? 
<p>Let’s look at how identity fraud happens in an organization: When new contractors get hired, they receive access to numerous company resources like email and Slack. To gain access to these resources, they will likely use an active directory username and password and a 2FA tool.</p>
<p>What happens if this contractor outsources their work? The employee will provide a third-party outsourcer with usernames, passwords, and 2FA codes. It’s been done before, and with today’s collaboration technologies like Whatsapp and Slack, it can be done in seconds. This could be detrimental to an organization if this person found someone cheaper to do their work or got paid by a third party to let them into the organization to steal intellectual property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your company likely did a thorough background check of your employees and contractors. However, you did not do a background check on the subcontractor. This means that this individual could have a questionable background that is not suitable to work at your company. Your company resources and knowledge are vulnerable to the subcontractor.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Improve Third-Party Access Governance? 
<p>The reality is that nearly all organizations have a variety of these third-party individuals who need access to infrastructure, applications, and data. 1Kosmos improves the security of third-party access with our distributed digital identity platform that is <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">FIDO2</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">NIST</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/">PAD2</a> certified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefit of onboarding contractors with 1Kosmos BlockID is ensuring the highest degree of identity assurance in a virtual environment, eliminating fraudulent activities. Contractors who are bound to their proofed identity with 1Kosmos, they have identity-based biometric authentication and a passwordless experience. In practice, contractors can utilize their secure mobile device for physical or logical authentication and step-up authentication required for privileged access. As a result, each access event is associated with a real, verified identity. Overall, organizations will eliminate the risk of contractor fraud and extra security exposures contractors introduce.</p>
<p>Are you interested in learning more? I invite you to check out a webinar where we covered this very issue “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/webinars/identity-based-authentication-journey-to-passwordless/">Identity-Based Authentication and The Journey to Passwordless</a>” where Edward Amoroso and Mike Engle discussed third-party access management and contractor fraud prevention. </p>
<p>Additionally, this <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/contractor-enrollment-and-onboarding/">whitepaper</a> covers our integration with Saviynt Third Party Access Governance. The combination of technologies ensures that when a contractor authenticates into the organization, you will have a high assurance that it is the contractor you hired, not someone else working on their behalf or a hacker!</p>

<p>Open banking is a big deal.</p>
<p>That means that Mastercard’s platform (which includes services from Mastercard’s wholly owned subsidiary, Finicity Corporation) is a combination of the work of many different disciplines like engineering, financial expertise, security and more. At the center of it all are product analysts like Kayla Kent, who began at Mastercard in December 2021, after moving to Utah from Northern Virginia.</p>
 What’re your responsibilities? 
<p>I’m on the consumer experience team, and we support the development of Mastercard’s open banking products. As a product analyst, I’m kind of the middleman between our development team, our design team, marketing, legal, etc, making sure basically that we’re on track and aligned with our product roadmap. I help support the team through the software development lifecycle with an agile project methodology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What kinds of challenges do you solve? 
<p>When we’re going through our backlogs and getting work ready for our development team, there’s a bit of planning that goes into that, so a project management hat goes on. And then we’re working with our design team and reviewing product designs and features that are going in, so I’m putting on more of a creative hat. When we’re doing competitive analysis and seeing how we can be better, I’m wearing an analytical hat.</p>
<p></p>
 How does your team exemplify Mastercard values like urgency? 
<p>Our team just gets the work done. If there’s something blocking us, we’ll escalate it immediately. We help each other out by seeing if there are ways to fix any issues that are keeping the project from progressing, making sure we’re pulling in the right people to address those problems and things like that.</p>
 What’s the culture like on your team? 
<p>We have a lot of team bonding social events. So we’ll do a lot of lunches together; we do a bi-weekly team social where we’ll play games and stuff, which is super nice. Because it’s not just like it’s all work between your colleagues. You’re kind of building a relationship past that and having that cohesive team feeling.</p>
<p>I think what’s really cool is that, like, on Slack, there’s all these various team channels, and there’s one that’s called “#misc_womenatfinicity” where we’ll share upcoming volunteering events or career development events that are going on. Another cool resource is Unlocked, which is a resource where you can build your profile and find other volunteering opportunities if you want to develop certain skill sets, or even find a mentor.</p>
<p></p>
 What does working at Mastercard enable you to do in your spare time? 
<p>There’s a good work-life balance at a Mastercard company, and my fiance and I wanted to live in the Salt Lake City area because of all the outdoor activities the area has to offer. So in my free time, we do a lot of skiing, hiking, camping and exploring the national and state parks down in southern Utah, which has been super fun.</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a slower-paced lifestyle here, which I like because you get a chance to breathe, whereas in Washington, or really in any urban area, you get really wrapped up in your work, you’re pulling a lot of overtime and you’re kind of consumed in that.</p>
 Why should someone consider joining the Mastercard open banking team? 
<p>I was interested in working in fintech because you get more opportunity to truly innovate, which you don’t get at every workplace. Another thing is that Mastercard has subsidiaries and offices everywhere, so you’re working with people in places like Europe or in India, and you get that different perspective or background from them. The four weeks of work-from-anywhere time is also really nice—since my family and a lot of my friends are based on the East Coast, it’s nice to be able to take advantage of that.</p>
 Interested in joining our team? 
<p>We’re growing! Search for and apply to our open positions <a href="http://adtrk.tw/tp/rj6.nMip-y-K">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, stay informed about news, events, and opportunities at Mastercard by <a href="http://adtrk.tw/tp/rj6-7SS8_y.K">joining our talent community</a>.</p>

				  Cardea is a complete, decentralized, off-the-shelf, open source codebase for sharing health data in a way that’s compliant with data privacy law  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Cardea emerged from a crisis, a law, and a technology.</p>
<p>The crisis was the global Covid pandemic, the law a US requirement that Americans must be able to access their health care data, and the technology was verifiable digital credentials, which enabled people to do just that—hold their data, share it in a privacy-preserving way, and have it authenticated without having to check in with the source of the data.</p>
<p>That’s a lot to unpack, which is why the community of developers who built and maintain Cardea have written a white paper to explain it all—the background, the mechanics of decentralized identity and verifiable credential technology, and the benefits.</p>
<p>While Cardea now has a <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">white paper</a>, it’s far from a theory: it has been built and you can deploy it right now. It was developed by Indicio for SITA, the world’s leading provider of IT to the air transport sector, and the government of Aruba, which saw it as a way to manage Covid testing, reopen the tourist-dependent island safely, and ensure traveler privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				<a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf"> </a>
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>The trials were successful. The solution <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-the-eic-decentralized-identity-award-means-for-indicio/">won</a> SITA the decentralized identity and verifiable credential award at the 2022 European Identity and Cloud Conference, and Indicio has been <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-crn-tech-impact-awards/">nominated</a> for a social impact award at the CRN Tech Impact Awards in September. The unique parts of its codebase were donated to Linux Foundation Public Health so that public health authorities anywhere had a decentralized, privacy preserving solution optimized for Covid testing and vaccination. That’s when it acquired a name, <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a>.</p>
<p>In proving that tamper-proof health data could be issued to travelers by their health providers and be verified by airlines and other countries without having to check back in with the health provider, Cardea has laid the foundation for something much bigger than Covid testing. Verifiable credential technology provides a way for all kinds of health data to be shared in a privacy-preserving and security-enhanced way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we call Cardea a Trusted Digital Ecosystem because it enables all the parties in the ecosystem to trust the data being shared and to do so without direct integrations with the source of the data. Trustworthy data means immediately actionable data. And that has revolutionary potential in health, travel, finance, and the public sector. <br></p>
<p>This is just a thumbnail sketch of what can be done with the technology; there’s a lot more, and we’ve striven to make the white paper as accessible as possible to the widest audience possible. <br><br>Download a <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">PDF here</a>.</p>

Photo by Jon Tyson on&nbsp;Unsplash An invitation to experiment and&nbsp;explore <p>The UK is in the midst of a cost of living crisis and an unprecedented <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2022/03/Living-Standards-Outlook-2022.pdf">fall in living standards</a>. Brexit, COVID, and the war in Ukraine have worsened the problem. But it’s the long term trend towards an economy defined by asset ownership that means the poorest are being hit the hardest whilst landlords, energy companies, and large corporations continue to extract huge&nbsp;<a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/reports/prices-and-profits-after-the-pandemic">profits</a>.</p><blockquote>As <a href="https://autonomy.work/portfolio/berry-work-to-wealth/">Christine Berry</a> has written, rentierism — making money by controlling access to scarce assets — “is the preferred business model for today’s economic elite, since it is both easier and more lucrative than actually doing anything&nbsp;useful.”</blockquote><p>The institutions of collective action through which we might push back — primarily unions — are struggling to adapt to the asset economy. As part of the GLA’s <a href="https://challengeldn.london.gov.uk/challenge/604645abc2dfcb001c1539f9">Designing London’s Recovery</a> programme, Dark Matter Labs started an inquiry into the possibility of a new institution: the Neighbourhood Union.</p><p>A Neighbourhood Union would organise around the multiple forms of rent that are extracted from a local place: housing rent, utility payments, ground rents, service charges, small business rent. It would aim to build power through enabling people to identify and contact others who share the same rentier, and support them to take collective financial or legal action. Longer term, it would be a step towards greater neighbourhood democracy, and help empower residents to shape the development of their local&nbsp;area.</p><p>This blog summarises our work so far. There are many unanswered questions — legal, functional, organisational, digital, and more. But from all the conversations we’ve had, we are confident that there is something here. There is a gap, a need, a space to work&nbsp;into.</p><p>We know that to make Neighbourhood Unions a reality will be a collaborative effort with the thinkers, activists, funders and communities working on this&nbsp;already.</p><blockquote>This blog is an invitation. We are based in Hackney, so building Hackney Union first feels like a natural starting&nbsp;point.</blockquote><p>You could be a small business or resident in Hackney; a member of a local trade or renters union; a community group that wants to find new tools to campaign; or a funder interested in supporting radical, long term change for a new economy. You could be none of those, but just interested in exploring this with us, and working to make it a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>If so — we’ll be at Pub in the Park on Wednesday 13th July, and Thursday 18th August, from 6.30pm. We’d love to see you&nbsp;there.</p>Photo by Samuel Regan-Asante on&nbsp;Unsplash The problem: collection action in the asset&nbsp;economy <p>Rentierism runs through every part of the cost of living crisis.

The (often unfunded) struggles of marginalised groups — including communities of colour and working class communities — have frequently laid the foundations for the organising work that has succeeded in doing&nbsp;so.</p><p>However, the move towards the asset economy presents new challenges. The main vehicle of collective action — trade unions — are focused on employment. Whilst unions like <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/">IWGB</a> are thinking creatively about their options for collective bargaining in emerging sectors (such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/19/firms-urged-to-protect-workers-from-abuse-in-wild-west-uk-gig-economy">gig economy</a>) and finding new ways to exert leverage (such as targeting company owners and organising across sectors, as Alice Martin <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/newe.12256">documents</a>), they are still not focused on the relationship between owners and&nbsp;renters.</p><p>Other forms of union have emerged — in particular, tenants unions such as <a href="https://londonrentersunion.org/">London Renters’ Union</a> (LRU), or community unions such as <a href="https://www.acorntheunion.org.uk/">ACORN</a>. Whilst they have won many important victories, their organising model — based mainly on direct action, in-person peer and expert support, and public pressure of landlords — is hard to scale and lacks the ‘hard power’ of exerting real pressure on profits that traditional trade unions had via strike&nbsp;action.</p><p>There’s a gap: a need to focus on the asset owner-renter relationship and building collective financial power.</p> Our enquiry: The neighbourhood union as a new institution of solidarity <p>We began with the idea that neighbourhoods could provide a strong centre of gravity around which to organise. People often identify strongly with their local area, and remain there for a long time. Broad based community organising has always centred local leadership and&nbsp;place.</p><p>A Neighbourhood Union would aim to build the collective power of different groups — residents, small businesses, leaseholders — and connect their struggle to questions of local, democratic ownership. We see this as a complement to trade unions (organised around work) and renters unions (organised around&nbsp;tenure).</p><p>Our research — including interviews with members of London Renters’ Union, leaseholders, lawyers, policy makers, and think tanks — suggested three design principles for such an institution:</p>  Principle 1: Focus on one-to-many ‘relationships of&nbsp;power.’  Principle 2: Combine digital and social infrastructure  Principle 3: Provide practical tools &amp; services for collective action   Principle 1: Focus on one-to-many ‘relationships of&nbsp;power’ <p>As Deepak Pateriya has <a href="https://forgeorganizing.org/article/whats-your-power-analysis">argued</a>, understanding how power operates is a critical step in making change happen. Within a neighbourhood, there are a wide range of relationships that are characterised by a ‘one-to-many’ relationship between a rentier and a renter, resulting in a significant difference in power. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Corporate landlords (or managing agents) and residents. Many landlords own multiple properties, and the <a href="https://www.homeviews.com/business/industry-blog/the-6-build-to-rent-operators-rated-highest-in-the-uk/">build to rent</a> market is growing rapidly, in which each landlord has hundreds or thousands of tenants. Banks are increasingly getting in on the act, with Lloyds <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9dc9617-f059-4de6-b43a-d5e9978d8c0b">aiming</a> to become one of the UK’s biggest landlords in the next 10&nbsp;years.  Commercial landlords and small businesses. The level of <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/uk-corporate-debt-after-covid-19-what-might-the-impact-be/#:~:text=33%25%20of%20SMEs%20have%20debt,increased%20from%203%25%20before%20Covid.">SME debt</a> has massively increased since the pandemic, with 33% now sitting on debt more than ten times their cash balance, and the general <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-resolve-remaining-covid-19-commercial-rent-debts-now-in-place">moratorium</a> on commercial evictions ended in March. Whilst the government may be willing to take action to prevent commercial landlords from simply sitting on empty property, there is currently little scope for small businesses to engage in a collective conversation.  Freeholders and leaseholders. Many leaseholders have been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p09l35m3">shouldered</a> with extremely high costs for building repairs, which are often too high to pay and make it impossible to sell their flat. Some have started local groups, but often limited to their own building — as finding others with the same freeholder is hard to&nbsp;do.  Utility companies and customers. Energy companies have made huge profits as a result of the increase in prices while millions of people are struggling with bills. Water companies have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/01/england-privatised-water-firms-dividends-shareholders">paid out</a> £13billion in dividends in the last 10 years, whilst in 2020 Thames Water <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60046320">dumped</a> 400 Olympic sized swimming pools worth of raw sewage into the&nbsp;river.  <p>The advantage of focusing on the ‘one-to-many’ relationships is that it makes new forms of collective action possible. If my landlord only owns one property, then there are no other tenants with whom I could take action. If they own multiple buildings, then we could exert real pressure by withholding fees or bringing multiple legal&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The relevance of these one-to-many relationships will differ in each neighbourhood, and there may be others that are not included here. A Neighbourhood Union would aim to be a forum within which these power dynamics are analysed and coalitions built — with a focus on the possibility of disrupting flows of finance in an&nbsp;area.</p> Principle 2: Combine digital and social infrastructure <p>Our starting point in this work was that a digital platform could help address the problems of fragmentation and distance in trying to bring together people who might be scattered across a neighbourhood, and who do not work together. Organisations such as <a href="https://commonknowledge.coop/work/">Common Knowledge</a> and <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">My Society</a> are showing the potential of using digital tools to amplify the power of organisers.</p><p>We think a digital platform could&nbsp;offer:</p>  The ability to identify and connect with others who have your landlord. For example, by uploading information from a tenancy agreement, a platform could match you with other members who have the same landlord.  New participation pathways for those who would be unlikely to attend branch meetings of tenants&nbsp;unions.  An information hub that helps to signpost towards resources that might be helpful in a dispute with a landlord, utility company or freeholder.  Providing easy-to-access tools for collective action (see&nbsp;below).  <p>One message that came through clearly in our conversations, however, was that digital infrastructure alone would never be enough. Social infrastructure and interactions are vital to build trust, relationships, and solidarity between members. Places like the <a href="https://www.thefrontroom.cc/about/">Floating Front Room</a>, which acts as a long-term neighbourhood platform co-owned by local communities, provide creative inspiration for how to build the necessary physical roots in a place. The Local Trust’s work on <a href="https://localtrust.org.uk/insights/research/the-double-dividend/">social infrastructure</a> shows the critical role it plays in shaping residents’ sense of identity, fostering civic pride and building bonds that encourages peoples’ participation in their community. Groups such as <a href="https://www.right-here.org/">We’re Right Here</a> and <a href="https://renaisi.com/">Renaisi</a> are working on creating the conditions that communities need to&nbsp;thrive.</p><p>Whilst being digitally native would be the starting point, a Neighbourhood Union would need to have a physical home, or at least access to physical&nbsp;space.</p> Principle 3: Provide practical tools &amp; services for collective action <p>Our conversations highlighted some of the practical difficulties in organising. Leaseholders who were protesting against the astronomical amounts they were being charged by their freeholders spoke of the difficulty in finding others with the same leaseholder, and the lack of forums on which to communicate. Those that had managed to organise themselves were often doing so via WhatsApp — but one renter we spoke to said that their landlord had managed to infiltrate their WhatsApp&nbsp;group.</p><p>Managing a dispute is difficult enough when there is just one person. Collecting and documenting evidence, staying on top of communication with a landlord / company, filing the right legal papers — it all takes work. Coordinating that across a group who want to take collective action is a massive task. One benefit of being digitally native would be to offer tools and services that make it easier, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Collective case management (document storage, messaging);  Collective legal&nbsp;action;  Collective financial action (eg. withholding rent, bills or service charges).  <p>Unions have always provided practical and legal support — and the new unions mentioned earlier, such as IWGB, are also taking action to shape the law in new areas such as the use of <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/racist-facial-recognition/#:~:text=The%20Independent%20Workers'%20Union%20of,termination%20of%20darker%20skinned%20workers.">facial recognition technology</a> or Uber drivers’ employment status.</p><p>Neighbourhood Unions would aim to combine some of the best practice from new housing unions and new workplace unions in threatening the bottom line whilst working within a community.</p>Photo by Samuel Regan-Asante on&nbsp;Unsplash In the long&nbsp;term <p>The outline we have sketched above imagines a Neighbourhood Union as an institution that can push back against rentier asset owners. A group of leaseholders withholding service fees; a group of residents withholding their water bill; small businesses collectively negotiating rent. In the medium term, this would be an enormous win. But in the longer term, it could take a more proactive, positive role, and help shape local development. A Neighbourhood Union could — like a Community Land Trust — own assets on behalf of the community. Following Community Wealth Building principles, it could enable members to spend money collectively, for example on maintenance &amp; renovation contracts, in a way that retains money in the&nbsp;area.</p><p>Neighbourhood Unions of this kind would be part of the wider movement for civic organising that is taking root. There is growing recognition that the deep, structural and complex challenges we face require more than just policy change — although the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-deal-for-private-renters-published-today%5C">Renters Reform Bill</a> and the end of Section 21 no-fault evictions will be a massive step forward. But whether it’s responding to a pandemic, addressing the cost of living crisis or confronting the climate emergency, we need new institutions for collective actions as much as we need new&nbsp;policy.</p><p>If you’re interested in exploring this work further with us, please get in touch, or come and join us on July 13th at 6.30pm, at Pub in the&nbsp;Park.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/u/9dd85ed72d9e">Dan Wainwright</a> <a href="mailto:info@darkmatterlabs.org">info@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/u/3af4c23a5d6e">Tom Beresford</a> <a href="mailto:tom@darkmatterlabs.org">tom@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p>With thanks to all those we spoke to in writing this blog for their time, insight, and&nbsp;care.</p>

<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is the most important&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;innovation of the decade and it’s here now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is already introducing DI capabilities into its&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;privacy toolkit,&nbsp;which will be available as easy-to-use SDKs, sample apps and unbranded apps ready for fast deployment to customers. Our proven&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identities&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">fit neatly with the DI story</a>.</p>



<p>But what is DI, really? And what do all its technical components mean? We drilled down into Anonyome Labs’ deep knowledge of DI to come up with these simple words for complex terms.&nbsp;</p>



 DI lets us control our own personal information. 



 It’s a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is trustworthy, and respects privacy. 



<p>Decentralized identity&nbsp;is the technology and standards that allow a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is more trustworthy and respects privacy. DI puts the user in sole control of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;that forms their identity. It’s&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>DI allows a fully digital, universally accepted way of identifying ourselves online (e.g. to a web site or app) and in real life (e.g. at a bar or a border crossing) so:</p>



  We don’t have to use email or usernames and passwords to login, carry paper or plastic versions of our IDs, or give out our personal information to every organization we want to access.  No central authority (e.g. bank, airline, Instagram, Netflix) needs to collect and store our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal ID information</a>&nbsp;(e.g. name, DOB, SSN, address, phone number etc.) and abuse it or&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">risk losing it</a>.  We can take back control of our own IDs and personal information.  



<p>Another term for DI is&nbsp;self-sovereign identity, which simply means the system is&nbsp;self-governing – the user has full control over their personal information.</p>



 DI has 3 pillars:&nbsp; 



  verifiable credentials (or digital ID documents) and the digital wallet they’re stored in  decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and the methods used to verify them  blockchain/distributed ledger used as the anchor of trust.  



 Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 



<p>Digital ID documents with digital signatures that either replace or complement paper or plastic versions (e.g. digital driver’s license, digital passport, digital travel visa). They’re not tied to any one organization or central authority, the user stores and uses them autonomously, and they are easily shared and checked to confirm the holder’s ID to unlock services (e.g. proof of age at a bar, or proof of vaccination at an airport).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital wallet&nbsp;is like a leather wallet only it’s a digital app (usually mobile app) and on the user’s device instead of in their pocket. They use it to store, control, share and carry their digital ID documents, and establish trusted connections (say, between them and their bank or university).&nbsp;We are building a set of SDKs so our enterprise customers can quickly create their own digital identity wallet. We also plan on building an unbranded identity wallet app if an enterprise customer wants to get to market faster.</p>



Figure 1: Example use cases for verifiable credentials (digital ID documents).<br>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-use-cases/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>.



 Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) 



<p>You’ll recall from the digital wallet definition that a DID is the unique identifier that identifies a user or service. DIDs are generated&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/01/what-is-encryption-and-why-is-it-important/">cryptographically</a>&nbsp;– so each digital identity has a unique DID and a unique private/public key pair. Attached to the DID on the blockchain is a DIDDoc which contains the public key and also an endpoint address where a message can be sent. The issuer of a digital ID document would write their DID information (including their DIDDoc) onto the blockchain.&nbsp;<br><br>DID methods&nbsp;– This is the interface description of the decentralized ledger or blockchain. It describes how to write and read from the blockchain to use it for decentralized identity applications. For example, it explains the format of the DID, the DIDDoc (public key and endpoint user address for communication), how to write a verifiable credentials schema, credential definition and issuer DID.&nbsp;</p>



 Blockchain&nbsp; 



<p>Perhaps the most used term because it enables cryptocurrencies like bitcoin,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">blockchain</a>&nbsp;is a database for recording information so it can’t be changed or hacked (immutable). It’s how we establish&nbsp;trust&nbsp;in DI systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain is a type of decentralised database managed by multiple participants (computers in a network). Blockchain can be used for almost anything valuable such as supply chains, payments, accounts, production, orders, decentralized exchanges, smart contracts, etc. Benefits to users are that it’s cost effective and lower risk than a centralized database.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchains are unlimited in number and increasing all the time. Right now, about 1,000 blockchains exist in the world, with four different&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/What-are-the-4-different-types-of-blockchain-technology#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20main%20types,benefits%2C%20drawbacks%20and%20ideal%20uses.">types of blockchain network</a>&nbsp;(public, private, consortium and hybrid). Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euromoney.com/learning/blockchain-explained/what-is-blockchain">this</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-blockchains-are-there/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20at%20least,platforms%20provided%20in%20this%20industry.">this</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>



<p>Decentralized or public ledger&nbsp;– Similar to a blockchain, this is an encrypted, unalterable record-keeping system which is open to any internet-connected participant. It is secure and anonymous and is like a record book of all transactions between participants.&nbsp;It’s called a public ledger because no central or single authority (e.g. bank or government agency) owns, maintains or monitors it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main difference between a ledger and a blockchain is that a blockchain is fully public and permissionless, whereas a ledger is usually public and permissioned (limited assigned validators/endorsers on the network).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Putting it all together 



<p>That’s the basic concepts covered; now let’s look at who does what in a DI system.</p>



<p>DI needs 3 players:</p>



  Issuer&nbsp;– an authority that asserts a person is who they say they are and issues a digital ID document (e.g. driver’s license)  Holder&nbsp;– the person who owns and stores the digital ID document, and uses it where they want to unlock services (e.g. prove their age at a bar)&nbsp;  Verifier&nbsp;– a person, organization or device app such as a QR code scanner that checks the holder’s digital ID document and unlocks services.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



Figure 2: The 3 players involved in a DI system.



<p>You’ll see that both issuers and verifiers of a digital ID document interact with the blockchain: the issuer uses it to list its DID, schema and credential definition of the digital ID documents it is issuing, and the verifier uses it to check the digital ID document originated at the issuer and has not been modified.</p>



 Some other DI terms you might want to know 



  Verifiable data registry&nbsp;– In DI, this is the system that provides the source of trust for digital ID documents, encryption keys, and other relevant data, such as verifiable credential schemas, revocation registries, issuer public keys, etc. Blockchain is one example of a verifiable data registry.&nbsp;  Identity hub&nbsp;–&nbsp;Identity hubs are an additional data store beyond the digital wallet. They’re decentralized off-chain personal data stores which the user has total control over. In their identity hub the owner can securely store all their sensitive data in a way that prevents anyone from using it without their permission. The user can securely share their data with other people, apps, and businesses, and decide to give access to only the minimum data necessary and retain a record of who has access to what.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directory-identity/identity-hubs-as-personal-datastores/ba-p/389577">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;is doing a lot of work in this space.  DI standards&nbsp;– The rules for exchanging information uniformly via DI systems across the internet. Anonyome Labs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity-development/">actively contributes</a>&nbsp;to the DI standards area.  DI relay&nbsp;– A DI relay allows DI peer-to-peer messaging even when a user’s device (edge agent) is offline.&nbsp;Relays receive and store messages for when the user comes back online. We just introduced the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo Platform DI Relay</a>.  Edge and cloud agents&nbsp;–&nbsp;These are software components that users and services in the decentralized identity ecosystem leverage, including to set up relationships and handle communications.&nbsp;An&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">edge agent</a>&nbsp;is an application that sits on an edge device, such as a user’s mobile phone. Edge agents can provide an array of DI functionality such as providing wallet and peer-to-peer services.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">Cloud agents</a>&nbsp;are similar to edge agents but provide cloud-based&nbsp;services that are always available – they&nbsp;do not need relays because they are always connected to the network.&nbsp;  Zero knowledge proof&nbsp;– This is a privacy-preserving way of proving something without revealing the actual information. ZKPs make it possible to post confidential transactions to the blockchain by proving the transaction was carried out correctly without revealing the actual information involved in the transaction (e.g. addresses, dollar amounts, etc.).  Peer-to-peer&nbsp;– This simply means two users interacting without a third party in between, for communications, payments etc.&nbsp;  



<p>Some terms in an effective DI system:</p>



  Verifiable&nbsp;– It can prove the validity of a digital ID document (i.e., that a trusted issuer created it and it hasn’t been modified).&nbsp;  Trustless&nbsp;– There’s no requirement on the user to place their sole trust in any one third party in order for a network or payment system to function.  Self-governing&nbsp;– The user has full control over their personal information.&nbsp;  Permissionless&nbsp;– There are no restrictions, and no central authority or administrator controls participation.  Distributed and robust&nbsp;– It uses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;technology, with a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network (as used in cryptocurrency).  Stateful&nbsp;– Transactions can’t be changed (immutable) and are stored in the distributed database of the network.  Native built-in payments&nbsp;– It facilitates the exchange of payment information.  Standards-based and open source&nbsp;– It uses set “rules” so it can work across web sites and services.

Die rasante Digitalisierung in der Folge der Pandemie und die unsichere geopolitische Situation zwingen die Verantwortlichen, ihre Cybersicherheitsstrategien zu überdenken. Trotz eines deutlichen Anstiegs bei den Cybersicherheitsbudgets werden Unternehmen weiterhin Opfer von Cyberattacken. „Den Feind und die eigenen Schwachstellen erkennen und verstehen“ ist der Schlüssel zu wirksamen Verteidigungsstrategien und dafür, einen Vorsprung vor den Cyberkriminellen zu bekommen. Organisationen müssen einen vollständigen Einblick in die externe Bedrohungslandschaft haben und wissen, welche potenziellen Angriffe ihnen drohen. Diese vorausblickende Fähigkeit ermöglicht es Organisationen, sich auf die größten Risiken zu fokussieren und zumindest die schwerwiegendsten Schäden durch Angriffe zu vermeiden.

 Celebrate in your OWN&nbsp;way <p>Welcome to the Ontology 4th Anniversary Carnival! This year, we decided to let you OWN your own celebration. The celebrations are going to be great, with plenty of activities and prizes for you to earn. For all the new people here, welcome to our Ontology family, let us start with introductions.</p><p>In the four years that Ontology has been on MainNet, the focus has been on building the infrastructure and tools for Web3 via decentralized digital identity and data. With the growing popularity of Web3 and the Metaverse, the need for these solutions has become more important than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>To fully realize this solution, and to provide access to this exciting new iteration of the internet, we have recently launched our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-decentralized-society-own-your-value-c5be7088ac95">Ontology Web3 Network (OWN) infrastructure framework</a> to enable barrier free development and access to Web3, the Metaverse and beyond. The OWN infrastructure consists of three solutions: the secure, fast and cheap public blockchain, a collection of out of the box protocols to speed up development and ensure compliant implementation of identity and data solutions, and tools to access Web3 and the Metaverse.</p><p>We thought that the best way for you to get to know the OWN infrastructure was to play a few games and reward you with ONG for taking part. What better way to celebrate our birthday? It’s time to explain how you can take part, in your OWN&nbsp;way.</p><p>The Ontology 4th Anniversary Carnival is made up of 6 events for you to take part in, each with individual ONG rewards. 4 of the events will also reward participants with special NFTs, and people who collect all 4 will also receive the ultimate 4th Anniversary NFT. In total there are up to 9300 ONG to be won, let us explain&nbsp;how.</p> Event 1: Fiendish Math Quiz (Rewards: 200&nbsp;ONG) <p>We start off by warming up your OWN brain with our Fiendish Math Quiz. Can you solve the Ontology inspired puzzle, and be one of the randomly selected 10 winners who will win 20 ONG&nbsp;each?</p> Event 2: Let’s explore the Explorer (Rewards: 500&nbsp;ONG) <p>Now that you’ve warmed up your brains, we want to help you to explore your OWN Ontology Explorer. We will be hiding questions linked to an Ontology blockchain address that we will publish. Use the Explorer to discover the questions, and then transfer the amount of ONG that corresponds to your&nbsp;answer.</p><p>All participants will receive the EXPLORER NFT for this event and 200 random winners will win 2 ONG each, with a further 100 ONG shared between those who answered all 8 questions correctly.</p> Event 3: Stake More to Win More (Rewards: 3000&nbsp;ONG) <p>Ontology is a proof of stake network. This means your ONT can help secure the network, be an important part of governance, and earn you ONG rewards. This event is all about helping you to establish your OWN&nbsp;stake.</p><p>All participants will receive the STAKER NFT for this event, with the top 200 stakers, and top 3 nodes earning a share of 3000&nbsp;ONG.</p> Event 4: A Bridge to the EVM (Rewards: 3000 ONG, $1000 CELR, $10,000 UP and $1000&nbsp;WING) <p>The future of Web3 is multi-chain, and a key aspect of this is being able to bridge your tokens easily. This event is designed to help you bridge your OWN tokens, and make use of some of the protocols on the Ontology&nbsp;EVM.</p><p>You will have the opportunity to use cBridge, uTrade, and Wing Finance, and earn prizes for doing so! All participants will win the EVMER NFT, and 2500 ONG will be shared between the first 250 participants, with a further 500 ONG shared with those who use all 3 of our partners. Depending which partner you use, you also have the chance to earn $1000 CELR, $10,000 UP, and $1000&nbsp;WING.</p> Event 5: I am the #xxx, I am Using ONT ID Since (Rewards: 800&nbsp;ONG) <p>We’ve told you about us, and helped you to experience some of the things we do. Now, we want you to tell us about your OWN self. Tell us who you are, what you do, and when you first started using ONT ID — our digital identity solution.</p><p>There are 800 ONG up for grabs, and whilst we offer some advantage for the ONT ID OGs, anyone can win a share of the prize. If you haven’t already, set up your ONT ID and participate.</p> Event 6: DID in Web3 and the Metaverse (Rewards: 1500&nbsp;ONG) <p>Now that you have set up your ONT ID in event 5, it’s time to see how it has been used to access Web3 and the Metaverse. The more Ontology chain transactions, NFTs, the more tokens you hold and stake, the higher your&nbsp;score.</p><p>All participants will receive the IDENTIFIER NFT, and the top 100 ONT ID users will share 1500&nbsp;ONG.</p> The 4th Anniversary NFT <p>If you have collected all 4 NFTs from our events, then you deserve the ultimate 4th Anniversary NFT.</p><p>Congratulations!</p><p>We will also randomly select three 4th Anniversary NFT winners to receive a further 100 ONG&nbsp;each.</p><p>Don’t hesitate to get involved in our birthday celebrations, and remember to stay tuned on Twitter or Telegram for further&nbsp;details.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/our-very-own-mainnet-4th-birthday-e74a55468ad6">Our Very OWN MainNet 4th Birthday</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p>Wenn ein Passwort wie ein Hausschlüssel ist, dann sollte die Grundlage der Sicherheit der IT-Systeme eines Unternehmens eine sicher verschlossene Eingangstür sein. Wenn die Eingangstür bestmöglich gesichert ist, dann brauchen Sie vielleicht nie wieder Schlüssel für weitere Türen. Durch die Verwendung komplexer Passwörter verschwenden Unternehmen Zeit, Geld und Ressourcen für deren Rücksetzung und verringern die Produktivität ihrer Mitarbeiter. Die sichere Anmeldung bei Anwendungen ist wichtig, aber der erste Authentifizierungspunkt für die meisten Mitarbeiter ist der Laptop, Desktop oder die Workstation selbst. HYPR bietet mit seiner passwortlosen und phishing-resistenten MFA-Lösung eine einfache und dennoch sichere Anmeldung, die den Benutzer am Desktop identifiziert und die Eingangstür absichert. Die Desktop-MFA kann verwendet werden, um sich einfach und sicher an einem Gerät anzumelden und den reibungslosen und sicheren Zugriff auf Anwendungen zu ermöglichen.

 Providing inclusive trust infrastructure for&nbsp;Web3 <p>June 30th has significant meaning for Ontology.</p><p>On June 30, 2018, Ontology MainNet version 1.0 was officially launched;</p><p>On June 30, 2019, Ontology sharding and cross-chain TestNet were launched;</p><p>On June 30, 2020, Ontology MainNet 2.0, integrating Layer 2 technology;</p><p>On June 30, 2021, the Ontology EVM virtual machine test network was launched.</p><p>With the support of global developers, contributors, and community members, four years on since the MainNet launch of the Ontology blockchain, we have continued to innovate and remain committed to bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions. Let’s look back on year four and see what we have achieved.</p> Enhancing Trust and Collaboration in Web3 Through the OWN Infrastructure <p>Web3 is here to revitalize the way in which our entire society operates, ushering in a new era of trust and collaboration Building trust in Web3, and facilitating collaboration based on this trust, is Ontology’s overarching goal.</p><p>We recently announced the launch of the OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure, which is a series of general blockchain protocols and products created by Ontology for Web3 applications. This infrastructure includes public chain protocols, Layer2 protocols, Web3 protocols (ONT ID and reputation management) and general-purpose tools (Web3 gateway, ONTO). The OWN Infrastructure provides the blockchain ecosystem with seamless, interoperable decentralized digital identity and data management solutions. Developers can choose the components they need for varied scenarios.</p><p>The emergence of the OWN infrastructure allows Web3 developers to quickly build applications without building basic functions from scratch. Individual users can also easily access Web3 applications by using the freely available OWN products. Furthermore, the OWN infrastructure, built around the decentralized identity DID framework, promotes cost-free trust collaboration through the underlying public chain, protocol layer and application layer. This three layered approach enables applications to fully protect their private data and bring users more rights to independently manage data and&nbsp;assets.</p> EVM Helps to Achieve On-chain Universality and Compatibility <p>We recently completed the integration of the Ontology EVM, which supports four types of smart contracts, as well as multi-chain and cross-chain collaboration. Supported smart contracts include Native; NeoVM; WasmVM; and EVM. This makes Ontlogy the public chain platform supporting the largest number of development languages ​​and virtual machines, greatly improving the Ontology chain’s compatibility and interoperability with other chains and projects. Through the Ontology Bridge and ONTO Wallet, intercommunication between Ontology and Ethereum digital assets is permitted. Various decentralized applications including Wing Finance, Unifi, and cBridge have also been extended to the Ontology EVM&nbsp;network.</p><p>In March, Ontology launched an <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-releases-ethereum-virtual-machine-and-announces-10-million-fund-to-support-web3-3974a26d3fb3#:~:text=Save-,Ontology%20Releases%20Ethereum%20Virtual%20Machine%20and%20Announces%20%2410%20Million%20Fund,Web3%20Developers%20Building%20On%20Ontology&amp;text=Ontology%2C%20the%20project%20bringing%20trust,Ethereum%20Virtual%20Machine%20(EVM)">EVM Fund</a> of US$10 million for global developers and then in April, held a global online hackathon with <a href="https://dorahacks.io/">DoraHacks</a>, the world’s leading developer community. There were both in an effoort to continue to empower the Ontology blockchain platform alongside the entire Web3 ecosystem. At present, a total of 26 projects have participated in this hackathon and applied for incentives, which cover many popular Web3 fields including NFTs, DAOs, and domain&nbsp;names.</p> ONT ID Upgrades Provide A Better Development Experience <p>ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/faq">W3C recommendations</a> for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. It can be seamlessly integrated into both Web2 and Web3 applications, saving developers time and money when it comes to identity system development.</p><p>ONT ID continues to grow in popularity, with registrations in excess of 1.6 million. In May 2022, the ONT ID Ontology decentralized identity framework was upgraded in order to achieve widespread deployment and seamless access for users. Ontology VC SDK series DID tools are now open source, including two categories of two development languages ​​and a total of four sets of tools, that can save the development cost involved in the implementation of DID. Enhancements have also been made to the ONT ID product suite, including Mercury — a secure, trustless, DID-based peer-to-peer communication protocol — ONT Login — a trustless universal authenticator — and ONT TAG — a trust anchor&nbsp;gateway.</p> Celebrating Major Milestones in Year&nbsp;Four  Ontology’s Global Community Now Exceeds Over&nbsp;100,000 <p>The Ontology proof of stake network continues to be popular amongst node operators of all sizes, alongside an enthusiastic staking community. The global Ontology community is an integral part of the Ontology ecosystem, with members now exceeding 100,000. We remain committed to building and developing our global community across a variety of language regions and languages. As of May 2022, the Ontology global community serves users in over 30 languages.</p> We Opened A New German&nbsp;Office. <p>In January, we announced the opening of our new European office in Berlin, Germany. This announcement showed our alignment with Europe’s efforts to increase data privacy and protection through legislation, including GDPR. Europe is one of the largest hubs for blockchain related services and Web3 innovation worldwide, with much of the action happening in Berlin, which has seen over $13 billion of investment since 2016. As such, we chose Berlin as a key strategic location where it will aim to expand its reach and capitalize on the incredible talent and resources available. Having a presence in Europe allows Ontology to expand its digital identity solutions, Web3 infrastructure, and decentralized solutions to both users and regulators alike.</p> Cross-Industry Partnerships <p>Over the last year, Ontology has partnered with a number of leading organizations across the automotive, music, and consultancy spaces to provide DID technologies, including <a href="https://bloxmove.com/">bloXmove</a>, the decentralized car platform; <a href="https://rocki.com/">ROCKI</a>, the music streaming platform; and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-ap-llc-to-bring-blockchain-solutions-to-japan-1c997059fac5">AP.LLC</a>, the Japanese consulting company.</p> Attended Multiple Industry&nbsp;Events <p>Ontology is gradually expanding its global influence and seeking new opportunities through industry events and conferences. From Consensus in the US to its participation in the Wanxiang Blockchain conference, to the SME Finance Forum and Binance Live and TwitterSpaces with Blocklike and Cointelegraph and etc., all have proven to further our overall&nbsp;mission.</p> The Future of Web3 is Coming, and the Road Ahead Looks Promising <p>Mainstream awareness of Decentralized Society (DeSoc) has been rapidly growing, and it is beginning to look like an inevitable trend in the development of Web3. With the growth of DeSoc, DID will become a key component for Web3. The combination of DID and other decentralized technologies, as well as related protocols and products, will further build trust and collaboration in a decentralized society. Ontology will continue to provide dApp developers with a platform that can host projects and equip developers with the necessary protocols and tools to remove barriers to accessing Web3, whilst simultaneously providing individual users with data privacy and protection, alongside increased autonomy.</p> About Ontology <p><a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a> is a project designed to bring trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Recently deepfakes made a splash in the headlines: Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kiev held one-on-one virtual interviews with several European leaders – or so they thought. In the days following the interviews, it came to light that the Ukrainian official was not actually conducting the interviews, but an unknown party had presented a false representation of Klitschko – with possibilities ranging from a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/25/european-leaders-deepfake-video-calls-mayor-of-kyiv-vitali-klitschko">real-time deepfake</a> to a <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/vitali-klitschko-zweifel-an-giffeys-deep-fake-these-2206-166427.html">re-edited version of existing video footage</a> called “shallow fakes” – that lasted approximately 15 minutes. One of the interviewees became suspicious of Klitschko’s authenticity and broke it off early, but others had no suspicions and continued the interview until its conclusion.</p>
 Deepfakes pose risks for businesses 
<p>More detailed information is not available about the falsified Klitschko, but it opens up many questions about the implications of shallow and deepfakes in politics and across all industries. It adds to the ongoing discussion: how do we know who we interact with digitally, be it our customers, employees, partners, or board members?</p>
<p>Access being granted to an impostor poses severe risk to an organization, be it in this case an impostor gaining audience with mayors of major European cities, or in countless other scenarios such as impersonating a CEO to authorize a funds transfer. Risks like these are clear calls for Zero Trust architectures, described at its simplest as “trust nothing, verify everything”. What options do organizations have to verify the identity of those they interact with digitally?</p>
<p>Remote identity verification is popular in industries like financial services, retail, and health care for consumer-facing interactions, and is gaining traction in many others to cover use cases such as external partner/organization onboarding, employee onboarding, and authentication bound to a verified identity. These solutions typically onboard the person in question by scanning a government-issued identity document (with OCR, NFC, or other means) and compare it against government registries and a real-time selfie of the individual for both biometric measurement and liveness detection. Although this is a market segment that is still maturing, the technologies are well established and continuously being improved. But are they robust enough to detect and reject deepfakes?</p>
 Deepfakes vs. liveness detection 
<p>The biometric onboarding and liveness detection portions of remote identity verification solutions are designed to address presentation attacks, but are not yet always equipped to fend off deepfake attacks.</p>
<p>The concept of detecting liveness is to confirm that the correct individual is physically present at the time of the transaction, and is not misrepresented by a photo, video, or mask, and sometimes synthetic representations (like a deepfake). Usually, the individual is asked to take a live selfie with their mobile device providing real-time evidence that the correct individual is conducting the transaction. Checks such as audio and facial synchronization, consistent blinking, and biometric inconsistencies help to indicate if a synthetic video or deepfake has been presented.</p>
<p>A deepfake could be injected via a faulty API, bypassing the device camera, or infecting the computer with malware. In this case, a selfie (injected by the attacker) may not be interpreted as fraudulent. For additional security against such deepfakes, either active or passive liveness checks should be completed. The individual may be asked to follow directions like blinking, turning their head, saying a series of random numbers, and so on to detect if the person is real and can respond to spontaneous instructions. This is referred to as active liveness, since the individual is asked to actively do something to prove their presence, to which a deepfake may not always be able to dynamically respond. Passive versions exist as well such as flashing a random sequence of colors on the individual’s face as they take a selfie. If a deepfake video was injected into the communication stream, this series of colors would be interrupted and indicate an attack.</p>
<p>Both deepfakes and liveness detection are improving, making it a game of chess to stay ahead of attacks.</p>
 Do deepfakes require adoption of identity verification? 
<p>The simple answer to this is yes, the more deepfake attacks increase in volume and sophistication, the more businesses can counteract with identity verification. However, the reality depends on factors:</p>
 
 The high cost of producing deepfakes 
 The scenarios deepfakes will be used in 
 The willingness of normal, non-fraudulent users to verify their identity 
 The different circumstances that non-fraudulent users are willing 
 
<p>Currently, believable deepfakes are labor-intensive to create, and do not scale well compared to other presentation attacks like static images, videos, 2D or 3D masks, injection attacks, or replay attacks. Deepfakes will likely play an increasingly threatening role in social engineering attacks and spear-phishing, since the resources required to develop it can be focused on a particular target. But largescale attempts to onboard or authenticate fraudulent users may not be the most common use case for deepfakes. Additional protection against deepfakes for high-profile people, politicians, celebrities, and C-level members of organizations may be considered, but may not be necessary when general public onboards or authenticates.</p>
<p>It may be prudent to ask if a political leader would subject themselves to remote identity verification conducted by another sovereign nation. Would it be viewed as a security risk for country that they represent, or seen as a gesture of goodwill? The same could be said for C-level members being verified by an external organization that they wish to do business with. And if these individuals refuse to agree to an identity verification step, will the other party rely on increasingly passive methods, which are arguably more invasive as collecting appropriate consent becomes more difficult?</p>
<p>While certainly not a complete answer to these questions, interoperability and standard credential formats can help ease the reluctance of one party being verified by the system of the other, mainly by allowing the identity verification step to be conducted internally, and shared with the other party in a standardized format. Initiatives like <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81119/gain-explained">GAIN</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81204/guide-to-implementing-decentralized-id">Verifiable Credentials</a> are making steps towards establishing globally interoperable <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity">reusable verified identity</a>.</p>
 What changes do we need? 
<p>As the quality and scalability of deepfake attacks increase, we must increase the defensive detection measures. While some current identity verification solutions claim to detect deepfake attacks, most are geared towards deterring more scalable attacks like spoofing, fraudulent documents, or masks. Especially notable is synchronous video identification, where the individual joins a video call with a live agent. These solutions rely on manual verification only, and while agents are trained in verifying documents and passports, they are not trained to detect a deepfake. Since these attacks look more and more believable to the human eye, video identification in particular would benefit from additional algorithmic checks for anomalies. We should expect remote identity verification solutions to invest in the ability to better detect deepfake attacks.</p>
<p>The best weapon against attacks that use AI is defense that uses AI. Adding algorithmic anomaly detection for deepfake tell-tales like inconsistent or nonexistent blinking, inconsistent background and inconsistent video quality will be a meaningful step forward towards deterring more deepfake attacks. Deepfakes already have and will undoubtedly continue to address these inconsistencies, and therefore it becomes paramount to develop the capabilities to detect anomalies that have never been seen (or trained for) before.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole continues to research the identity verification space, and will publish a series of reports in the later half of 2022. Keep an eye out for this research to stay up to date on topics like liveness detection.</p>

 Understanding the potential of the vLEI – the Organisation verifiable credential 
<p>We’ve been involved in some really cool work over the last few weeks focusing on the issuance of vLEIs and associated role credentials. Specifically, Ubisecure was the credential issuer for the GLEIF’s vLEI proof of concept project and issued the world’s first vLEI to the GLEIF, which was then used to sign the GLEIF’s 2021 annual report. </p>
 
 <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/press-releases/gleif-showcases-one-digital-id-for-every-business-globally-with-first-verifiable-lei-deployment">Read full vLEI press release</a> 
 <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/vLEI/ixbrl-report-2021-viewer.html#">View vLEI role-based signatures in the 2021 GLEIF Annual Report</a> 
 
<p>The system works really well, but stepping back from the entire process there is a lot of technology and complexity involved behind the vLEI, as there is with most identity and/or cryptographic platforms. Like many complex systems we can break it down and take a more understandable view on what a vLEI actually is, what they do, and how we expect them to be used in the future. </p>
 What is a vLEI? 
<p>We are going to make a few assumptions here, the main one is that you already know about <a href="https://rapidlei.com/knowledge-base/what-is-an-lei-code/">LEI</a> (short for Legal Entity Identifiers). If you want to know more about the LEI itself we have some great material in our <a href="https://rapidlei.com/knowledge-base/">LEI Knowledge Base</a>. </p>
<p>The v in vLEI stands for “verifiable”, but what does that mean? The term verifiable in this case comes from the term “Verifiable Credential”. A verifiable credential is just a collection of information with a mechanism that allows a computer to verify that the information has not been modified and that the information was originally stated to be correct by some third party (maybe a bank, or the driving license authority). Often (almost always really) the information will include a link to the entity the information is about. </p>
<p>With those three things the verifiable credential can be used to provide information to others in a way that allows the receiver to be very confident about the claims made by the information.</p>
<p>Let’s take a simple, parallel example based around a driving license. Fred has his driving license as a plastic card in his wallet as issued to him by his national driving authority. He loses his card, but shortly gets a call from the local police station saying it has been handed in and he should come and claim it. When Fred gets to the police station the desk sergeant spends a long time looking at the photo (which is quite out of date now, time has not been kind to Fred!), asking Fred questions about his address, date of birth etc. Eventually the sergeant feels that Fred has answered enough correctly and hands over the license. </p>
<p>Alice also has a driving license but her license is on her mobile phone. Unfortunately, Alice loses her phone, but again shortly gets a call from the police to say it has been handed in. When Alice gets to the station, she can prove it is her phone by using her fingerprint to unlock it. The desk sergeant does not need to use his judgement, Alice has proved control over the phone and so it must be hers.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials work in the same kind of way, there is the ability to prove ownership of the credential. This process is understood by computer systems and so all the checks can be performed electronically online and in turn that allows automation and significant cost saving.</p>
<p>Back to the vLEI, at the basic level the vLEI is simply an LEI code, a unique organisation identifier, stored as part of the information set in a verifiable credential. A standard mechanism exists to prove ‘control’ over any given vLEI and so it is possible to determine, automatically, if the entity presenting the vLEI is entitled to do so. This capability now allows organisations to participate in trusted automatic transactions.</p>
 Wait, there’s more to vLEI than just the organisation 
<p>The vLEI standards define more than just a verifiable credential for the legal entity. Two further verifiable credentials are defined that allow information on people associated with the organisation.</p>
<p>The first of those two credentials is the “Official Organisation Role” credential (OOR). The OOR links an individual with an organisation in a well-known role. The roles are limited to an official set of ‘official’ roles as defined by an ISO standard (ISO 5009_2022). This list includes roles such as ‘Director’, ‘Chief Executive Officer’, ‘Chief Financial Officer’. With an OOR credential an individual is able to present themselves as holding an official role for a given organisation, and all the claims presented can be electronically verified in real time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second of these two credentials is the “Engagement Context Role” credential (ECR). The ECR is very similar to the OOR except that the role is custom, the legal entity can define any role they wish and place that in the ECR. For example, “customer of”, “supplier to”, “contractor for”.</p>
<p>In the below example we see the GLEIF annual report signed using vLEI, OOR and ECRs. The browser-based document viewer displays the signers, their roles and their organisation association:</p>
<p></p>
 What can we do with a vLEI  
<p>There are many reasons why vLEIs will see a rising prominence in the coming months and years:</p>
 
 Document signing: document signing solutions exist, however they currently use ‘standard’ signatures. These do not have the ability to link between signatures. Credentials from the vLEI ecosystem can provide the same level of security of signature and also provide linkage information between the various signing parties. 
 KYC/KYB: It is currently quite challenging to determine that an individual is empowered to act in a certain capacity for an organisation. The vLEI credentials solve this challenge by design, massively reducing onboarding and ongoing verification costs. 
 Delegation: The ability to understand the linkage between an individual and an organisation allows for electronic delegation of rights and responsibilities. Delegation capabilities brings significant cost saving to organisations where complex inter-company relationships need to be electronically enabled and enforced, see <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/customers/" title="Ubisecure’s Finnish Government Katso case study">Ubisecure’s Finnish Government Katso case study</a> for an example. However whereas Katso was a closed community operating just within one jurisdiction, the vLEI offers the same potential using a trusted, standardised, globally verifiable credential.  
 Representation Governance: Parameterising delegation (think individual expense sign off levels as an example) moves delegation into the role of representation governance. This capability then allows all the business process that have been manual to be automated with the obvious cost savings. Whilst this is already possible in some regions the vLEI ecosystem enables this capability on a global basis. 
 
 It’s all about trust (frameworks) 
<p>There are more credentials in the broader framework than have been covered here, and that broader framework is quite important.</p>
<p>We have already understood that a credential wraps information and that systems can automatically verify the information to determine the original issuer of the information and that it is unaltered. This allows someone receiving the credential to know the Legal Entity in question and the nature of the relationship between that Legal Entity and the individual representing them. But how do we know that the person didn’t manage to get a fake identity through the system?</p>
<p>That assurance comes from the vLEI ecosystem having a defined Trust Framework, and an audit system that validates compliance to the Trust Framework. </p>
 
 <a href="https://www.gleif.org/lei-solutions/gleifs-digital-strategy-for-the-lei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei/2022-02-07_verifiable-lei-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework-primary-document-draft-publication_v0.9-draft.pdf">Download GLEIF vLEI Trust Framework primary document (PDF)</a> 
 
<p>When the credential is originally issued the issuer (known as a ‘Qualified vLEI Issuer’ or QVI) is required to perform identity checks to a globally defined standard. This is the same as you having to present your passport when you open a bank account or create a mobile phone account. As more national Ids become available the national ids will be able to provide the individual information meaning that a manual check will not be needed. In fact eIDaS 2 will be based on verifiable credentials itself. </p>
 What happens now 
<p>The GLEIF, along with stakeholders like Ubisecure, have been working incredibly hard to progress the vLEI project. Now the proof of concept has been released, the ecosystem will continue to develop the issuance technology and policy frameworks to make the vLEI a commercial reality. We are excited to continue to contribute to this exciting organisation identity advancement.</p>

  <p>The cyber threat landscape has become very complex, with state-of-the-art intrusion, ransomware, and cryptocurrency mining tools now readily available through online stores and service providers, and an expanding attack surface due to increased cloud computing and remote working. Keeping data secure while ensuring its availability to legitimate users has become extremely challenging.&nbsp;Join experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and One Identity as they discuss the evolution of the cyber threat landscape and consider how correlating visibility, security, and control to an identity and its associated processes and accounts can significantly mitigate against modern cyber threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cybersecurity threat landscape continues to evolve and pose new challenges to CISOs and security managers. But as Paul Fisher, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole will explain, it isn’t just about responding to threats, but also managing identity access and cloud infrastructures in new ways.&nbsp;Alan Radford, Global Identity and Access Management Strategist at One Identity will explain how to achieve a consistent view across users, machine identities, and accounts to help organizations move to a unified state. He will also highlight the importance of managing privileged users, and provide an overview of Unified Identity Management Platform that integrates Access Management, PAM, and IGA solutions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/dealing-effectively-modern-cyberthreats"></a>

 Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap (June 20 — June&nbsp;25)  The global crypto market is in a slightly better position than the week before. Yet, the cloud of uncertainty looms large over the broader&nbsp;market. <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. The global crypto market is in a slightly better position than the week before. Yet, the cloud of uncertainty looms large over the broader market. Authorities continue to stress the need for regulatory measures to put an end to the wild-west days of the crypto industry. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> Swiss Financial Authority CEO Demands Strong Crypto Regulations to Prevent Market&nbsp;Abuse <p>Drawing parallels to the US stock market of the 1920s, Urban Angehrn, Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Market Supervisory Authority, Switzerland’s financial regulator, demanded strong regulatory measures for the digital assets market to prevent abusive market practices.</p><p>While speaking during a conference in Zurich, Angehrn said, “It would seem to me that a lot of trading in digital assets looks like the U.S. stock market in 1928, where all kinds of abuse, pump, and dump, are now, in fact, frequently common.”</p><p>He also asked his colleagues to brainstorm ways to simplify the technology, find ways to make massive data processing easier to handle crypto transactions, and create frameworks to protect investors against market&nbsp;abuse.</p><p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/swiss-regulator-urges-financial-watchdogs-to-protect-crypto-investors/">Click here to learn&nbsp;more</a>.</p> A Leading Nigerian Bank MD Calls Country’s Auditors to Monitor &amp; Flag Crypto Transactions for any Terrorism Financing-related Incidents <p>Math Ude, Managing Director of one of the leading Nigerian wholesale and investment banks, Nova Merchant Bank Limited, recently called on auditors to focus on digital asset-related transactions in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Attending a quarterly meeting of the Association of Chief Audit Executive of Banks in Lagos, Ude said that illicit actors involved in terrorism might turn to digital assets for money laundering &amp; terrorism financing.</p><p>Thus, he said that auditors must watch out for a systematic framework that enables them to collect sender &amp; beneficiary information, such as names &amp; account details of individuals &amp; organizations behind the transactions, and flag high-risk ones to the authorities. And doing so will prevent the misuse of digital assets in illicit activities in the&nbsp;country.</p><p><a href="https://leadership.ng/terrorism-financing-auditors-urged-to-monitor-digital-payments-system/">Click here to learn&nbsp;more.</a></p> ECB President Pushes for Extending Crypto Regulations to Staking &amp; Digital Assets&nbsp;Lending <p>While giving testimony to the European Parliament, the Head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, proposed to EU lawmakers to extend the current crypto regulatory framework to staking and crypto lending. She termed her proposal, MiCA&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Lagarde’s statement comes amid increasing demand from users to regulate the crypto lending space as some of the most popular virtual asset lending companies recently paused or limited withdrawals.</p><p>Leading crypto lending platforms like Celsius and Babel Finance recently paused withdrawals amid growing market uncertainty. Whereas, BlockFi and Voyager reduced the withdrawal limit. The fiasco attracted the attention of global authorities, including the&nbsp;SEC.</p><p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ecbs-christine-lagarde-proposes-a-mica-2-0-to-cover-bitcoin-staking-and-lending/">Click here to learn&nbsp;more</a>.</p> Panamanian President Sends Back Crypto Bill for not Including AML Provisions <p>Laurentino Cortizo, President of Panama, recently rejected to sign the crypto bill, legally known as Bill No 697 in the country, over AML-related concerns.</p><p>Although President Cortizo had called the bill “innovative” in the past, he is concerned about the lack of anti-money laundering provisions to prevent the use of crypto-assets in illicit activities.</p><p>Panama is known worldwide for its tax haven status, denting its global reputation, especially among financial regulators, such as the Financial Action Task&nbsp;Force.</p><p>As of now, Panama is placed in the “Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring” list. Thus, the President wants to strengthen the country’s AML framework to improve its reputation.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/president-of-panama-rejects-to-sign-the-crypto-bill-sends-it-back-for-further-discussion-over-d8b3e3c50708">Click here</a> to read more on the Panamanian President’s stance on the country’s crypto&nbsp;bill.</p><p>The current crypto market downturn is wreaking havoc on some of the largest crypto companies in the world, with crypto lending and exchanges companies facing the most heat. Such a brutal market downturn has made one thing clear to the global financial regulators: this industry cannot continue without regulatory oversight. Thus, this week, too, authorities continue to vouch for bringing crypto assets within the regulatory net.</p><p>The day when countries will co-ordinate and develop a global framework to regulate digital assets is not far. Hence, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must start complying with current national and international laws around digital assets. Speaking of global crypto regulations, the most important piece of law today is the FATF’s Travel Rule. And to comply with the Travel Rule, you will need a Travel Rule Solution Provider&nbsp;(TRSP).</p><p>Check out Veriscope, the best TRSP in the market.

<p>Kuala Lumpur/Manila, 29 June 2022 — Xarcade and TheFamous Labs are pleased to announce a partnership today for the benefit of web3 game developers and players. Xarcade with this partnership will be able to offer more solutions to web3 game developers when creating their NFT assets inventory.</p><p>Xarcade game developers will be allowed to access TheFamous Labs NFT factory and customize their NFTs with a library of options such as creating limited edition sub-NFTs or dynamic NFTs that can evolve during a game’s lifetime.</p><p>At the same time, Xarcade game players will benefit from an access to a dedicated section on TheFamous NFT marketplace to trade their assets from different Xarcade games with the possibility to bag and carry them, with their wallet, back to&nbsp;Xarcade.</p><p>When using Xarcade, a game developer can seamlessly blockchain his game and does not need to have any prior blockchain development knowledge to get started. Once done blockchaining his game, Xarcade also distributes the game, thus opening up a whole new&nbsp;market.</p><p>TheFamous Labs is the provider of an NFT factory and a marketplace that allows the creation, sale, and trade of a new generation of NFT VIP (Verifiable, Interoperable and Protectable). NFTs created by the factory can be easily verified using a unique passport that gives easy access to metadata, copyright certificate, buyer rights, and other events linked to ownership.</p><p>The NFTs can also be carried by owners from different blockchain platforms to trade or use them. Finally, NFTs are made dynamic and more secure with rights that can be revoked if used illegally while having an NFT suspended if proven to have been&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>According to Otto von Nostitz, CEO of Xarcade, “By partnering with TheFamous Labs, we can provide for our users an even more entertaining gaming experience. A game developer will be able to further enhance his blockchain game development by having access to TheFamous Lab’s innovative features.”</p><p>Fred Saurat, one of the founders of TheFamous Labs, commented, “When we were introduced to Xarcade via our common partner ProximaX, and we understood the vision of this metaverse project for web3 gamers, we immediately realized that our NFT platform and factory would be a perfect fit for this exciting and innovative venture.”</p><p>About Xarcade</p><p>Xarcade is a next-generation video game tokenization and distribution platform. It is a game-changer for seamless blockchaining of games and is a cost-less alternative to other app stores. The Xarcade gaming ecosystem consists of the Xarcade platform and the future Xarcade metaverse called MetaXar. On the Xarcade platform there is the testnet environment, whereby the game developer can release a game with assets of no real-world value in order to have his gameplay tested before releasing in the mainnet environment whereby a game will have assets of real-world value. Then from mainnet, the game developer can have his game released in&nbsp;MetaXar.</p><p>About TheFamous Labs</p><p>TheFamous Labs (a reference to Warhol factory and pop culture), is building a new economy around web3, culture and a community in transit to metaverses.</p><p>TheFamous Labs using its NFT factory and marketplace focus on building bridges, from the first generation of NFT to a new one more secure and intelligent, to and between metaverses while providing its technology to some of them, from creators to digital collectors offering solutions to onboard non-crypto native and finally from pop and street culture to the digital and cyber&nbsp;ones.</p><p>The Labs is also developing partnerships with institutions, curators and brands providing its technology and solutions, to develop innovative NFTs collections and web3 projects in different metaverses.</p>

 Enjoy the latest OWN insights, by our Chief Scientist, Dr. Kendall&nbsp;Mao. <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article from Dr. Kendall Mao, Chief Scientist of Ontology.</p> I. Introduction <p>The Internet was born for the sharing and exchange of information. With the development of technology, Internet service providers have completed the transformation from being an information display portal to becoming content generation portals, which is the so-called transition from Web1 to Web2, and the Internet users have also changed from “passive” reception to “interactive” participation. At present, most of the Internet platforms we are familiar with, whether they are search engines, knowledge communities, or social networking sites and video applications, rely on the interactive participation of users. It is under such a transformation that the scale of the Internet has developed to a considerable size, and the Internet has become an indispensable part of the life of the Human&nbsp;race.</p> 2. Lack of “Proactivity” <p>Behind the prosperity and development of the Internet, the reality of excess information has caused “attention” to become an important resource that various platforms and creators on the platforms compete for. Platforms have made huge profits by catering to the needs of users and winning the attention of users. The platforms accumulate a large amount of user data, including not only creator-generated content, but also consumer behavior and preferences. These data have become the most valuable assets of the platform. The analysis of this data through tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning guides these platforms to lock in old users, attract new users and extract high profits, and build themselves into the best in the&nbsp;field.</p><p>In this context, creators have to shift to the top Internet platforms that can attract users’ attention on a large scale. The lead platforms that occupy the dominant position through network effects, firmly lock in consumers and enjoy most of the profits, whilst the rewards obtained by creators do not match their efforts. At the same time, due to the platform’s recommendation algorithm, the number of pageviews and likes has become an indicator of oppression for creators. Creators no longer pursue in-depth content creation, but aim to please large groups and move towards a direction that can cater to the attention of a larger audience which creates the problem of homogenization of the creator’s content. This has made creators more and more superficial and content more and more biased towards virality.</p><p>Creators’ rethinking of the production relationship between them and the platform has awakened creators. The “attention economy” in the Web2 era makes creators firmly bound to the platform, and their returns are far less than their efforts. The platform’s control over creators is not only reflected in the way and the amount of returns for creators, but it is also reflected in the control over their behavior, such as creators not being able to migrate with their fans, or change the way they interact with fans. This deeply hits the enthusiasm of creators, who are unwilling to “actively” explore and create more layered and in-depth&nbsp;content.</p> 3. The “Proactive” Web3 Enables the Expressive Economy <p>In the past two or three decades of Web2, the “attention economy” has enabled the Internet to develop brilliantly, but it can also be seen that creators are at the bottom of the game with the platform, showing a downward spiral. The rights and voices of creators are less and less valued, and they can only cater to the public. In fact, if we think about it, the “attention economy” itself is biased towards attracting consumers and attracting the public. In this economic model, creators can only stay at the level of “interaction”.</p><p>The emergence of Web3, or the emergence of decentralized collaboration methods, gives hope that people will see a fundamental solution to this problem. Web3 enables users to regain ownership of their data and content, breaking the platform’s monopoly on content and how it is priced. The method of distribution and amount of rewards for creators has been greatly improved, and is no longer dependent on the platform and having a huge fan base. Creators can rely on high-quality content output to attract interested people and get high returns, which makes creators motivated and willing to “actively” create content with depth and connotation. Consumers are no longer just consuming the content provided by creators, they can invest in potential creators in the form of decentralized organizations.</p><p>In such a mode, creators no longer need to struggle for the “attention” of large groups, but focus on their own content and “actively” fully demonstrate their “expressiveness”, in order to acquire the consumption and investment of high-quality users. It’s also worth noting that there is an upward spiral between high-quality content and high-quality fans, which is a win-win relationship.</p><p>We call such a pattern the “expressiveness economy”, reflecting the positive correlation between “expressiveness” and returns in Web3. This “expressiveness” is not only reflected in the expressiveness of individual creators, but also in the expressiveness of the decentralized collaborative organization formed by creators and related users such as&nbsp;fans.</p> 4. Conclusion <p>Blockchain-based Web3 brings one of the greatest characteristics of the Internet, users have control over their own identities and data. In such a network, with decentralized identity as the cornerstone and NFT and verifiable certificates as the data verification certificates on and off the chain, a production relationship of decentralized collaboration will be formed, which will promote the development of the Internet in a new direction&nbsp;. And all we can do is see it, engage with it, and build on&nbsp;it.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of general blockchain basic protocols and products provided by Ontology for Web3 applications. Basic components including data and reputation, etc., and general-purpose tools such as a Web3 wallet, etc. Web3 applications can choose different basic components according to different scenarios for easy integration. It saves Web3 applications from developing basic functions from scratch, and thus can quickly develop applications. Individual users can also quickly access Web3 applications by using OWN basic products.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/web3-the-proactive-expressive-economy-5d77f56192c6">Web3: The “Proactive” Expressive Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Determined cyber attackers will nearly always find a way into company systems and networks using tried and trusted techniques. It is therefore essential to assume breach and have the capability to identify, analyze, and neutralize cyber-attacks before they can do any serious damage.&nbsp;But this can be challenging, especially when critical data is stored in business applications on-premise and in the cloud. Join cybersecurity experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and SAP for a discussion on why monitoring the SAP landscape is necessary and how this can be best achieved.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will talk about finding the right mix of cross-application solutions for threat detection, SIEM, and SOAR, and specialized solutions for critical environments such as the SAP line of business applications. He also will look at the interplay between security and identity, and how this can all converge in a modern Security Operations Center.&nbsp;Arndt Lingscheid,&nbsp;Solution Owner for SAP GRC – Security and Data Protection at SAP&nbsp; will share his perspectives and provide a detailed overview of SAP Enterprise Threat Detection Cloud Version that is designed to provide expert SAP security monitoring to neutralize threats in real time based on an included Managed Security Service.</p>

				<p>“Humanity is sending people to space, editing genes, and developing AI that can write better blog posts than I can,” said Riley Hughes, co-founder and CEO of Trinsic. “Yet, I still can’t even prove my legal name is Riley Hughes – let alone anything else about myself – digitally. Decentralized identity will finally solve this. We’re fortunate to have a front-row seat as our customers and partners bring that future a step closer to reality every day.”</p><p><br></p>

A wallet with every identity.<p>When we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-the-wallet-87870843dc1b">first launched the GlobaliD Wallet</a> powered by Uphold back in June of 2020, the goal was clear. Our vision has always been that anyone, anywhere should be able to create and own their <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e">self-sovereign digital identity</a>. And along with that identity, they should get a wallet, providing them access to basic financial services.</p><p>These are the bare necessities of anyone trying to operate in the modern world, and the release of the original GlobaliD Wallet was a huge step toward achieving that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>But there have also been limitations when it comes to wallet access, where users living in certain countries or states have not been able to participate in the full GlobaliD experience. This is no fault of Uphold, which continues to expand its services to more and more jurisdictions. Instead, it’s the nature of any <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/custodial-wallets-vs-non-custodial-crypto-wallets/">custodial offering</a> in a highly regulated space.</p><p>What we’ve learned over the last two years is that in order to truly achieve our vision, we need to transition to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/custodial-wallets-vs-non-custodial-crypto-wallets/">non-custodial solution</a> for the GlobaliD Wallet. That way, anyone who creates an identity with GlobaliD can get a non-custodial GlobaliD&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Beyond access, moving to a non-custodial solution gives us more control over our own destiny with exciting prospects for new products and features — including future debit card programs. It also means our users will be able to own and control their money along with their identity, furthering our mission toward building a more self-sovereign future.</p><p>So what will these changes look&nbsp;like?</p> 1. Effective July 15, 2022, you will need to access your wallet directly through Uphold rather than GlobaliD. Rest assured, the contents of your wallet won’t&nbsp;change.   On July 15, 2022, the GlobaliD Wallet powered by Uphold will be removed from the GlobaliD&nbsp;app.  GlobaliD Wallet users will still be able to access their wallet through Uphold’s website and&nbsp;app.  If you don’t have separate login credentials with Uphold, use the email address associated with your GlobaliD to login to Uphold using the “forgot password” flow to establish a password&nbsp;there.   2. The new non-custodial GlobaliD Wallet will soft launch in the near future — stay&nbsp;tuned.   This is still a work in progress and will be a staggered release so stay tuned, but this will be a pivotal step towards achieving our vision of providing anyone, anywhere with an identity and a&nbsp;wallet.   3. Debit card programs tied to the custodial GlobaliD Wallet including the GlobaliD and XRP Mastercard® Debit Card will cease operation on July 15,&nbsp;2022.   As both of these debit cards are tied to the custodial GlobaliD Wallet powered by Uphold, they will also cease operation on July 15,&nbsp;2022.  We have plans for future card programs, but it’s too early to discuss those details at this&nbsp;time.  XRP Rewards will be ending along with the debit card program. Your XRP Rewards will continue to accumulate through July 15 and will be available in your Uphold account after the card program&nbsp;ends.   4. The XRP Army Group on GlobaliD will live&nbsp;on.   Despite the XRP Card program ending, we will continue to support the XRP Army Group on GlobaliD.  As a core group of early adopters on the platform that have made a huge contribution to GlobaliD’s ongoing success, we will continue to engage with the XRP Army Group. Group members will receive exclusive early access to new products and features such as the new non-custodial GlobaliD Wallet and potential future card and rewards programs.  <p>Making these changes wasn’t an easy decision, but we believe that it’s the right strategic move in order to build a best-in-class identity and wallet offering for a more inclusive and equitable future.</p><p>In the coming weeks we will be announcing and releasing new tools, like our aforementioned non-custodial wallet as well as new privacy-preserving ways for people to use their identity. If you’d like to stay up to date on these and future card releases, <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">subscribe to our GlobaliD Insider newsletter</a>.</p><p>If you have more questions about this change, your wallet, or your card, you can refer to the FAQ below. If you have additional questions, please reach out to our <a href="https://care.global.id/hc/en-us">Customer Care</a>&nbsp;team.</p><p>For questions regarding your Uphold wallet, you can reach out to <a href="https://support.uphold.com/hc/en-us">Uphold&nbsp;Support</a>.</p> Frequently Asked Questions <p>Why is this happening?</p>  Over the last two years we’ve learned that in order to truly achieve our vision of self-sovereign identity and inclusive finance, we need to transition to a non-custodial solution for the GlobaliD Wallet. The initial non-custodial solution will not support a card program at&nbsp;launch.  <p>What happens to my funds in my&nbsp;wallet?</p>  Your funds are safe. You will be able to access them directly through the <a href="https://uphold.com/en-eu">Uphold</a> mobile or web application. You will not be able to access them via GlobaliD after July&nbsp;15th.  <p>What happens to my&nbsp;rewards?</p>  All of your paid-out rewards will be accessible via Uphold in the Portfolio section. Click the dropdown next to “XRP” and you will see “Reward — XRP.”  <p>What happens to the money that was funding my&nbsp;card?</p>  All of your funds will still be available through Uphold in the Portfolio section.  <p>What do I do with my&nbsp;card?</p>  The card will stop working on July 15th, 2022. After that point, you will no longer be able to use it to make payments or collect new rewards and are free to dispose of the card if you wish to do&nbsp;so.  <p>How do I access my Uphold&nbsp;account?</p>  From the Uphold website, you can log in with the email address you registered with GlobaliD. If you don’t have a password, click on “Forgot password?” and proceed with Uphold’s password recovery flow to create a password. You will now be able to access your Uphold account with your email and password.  <p>How do I use my Uphold&nbsp;wallet?</p>  Please visit <a href="https://uphold.com/en-us/faq">the Uphold help center</a> to learn more about your Uphold wallet and&nbsp;account.  <p>Do I need to do anything to disconnect the XRP card or close&nbsp;it?</p>  No. After July 15th the card will automatically deactivate.  <p>Will GlobaliD support a card program in the&nbsp;future?</p>  We are looking into different ways to support card programs on the new non-custodial GlobaliD Wallet, but there are currently no short-term plans to start supporting this feature. If you’d like to stay up to date on product updates and future card releases, <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">subscribe to our GlobaliD Insider newsletter</a>.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/building-a-more-inclusive-and-equitable-future-745f897a2c2b">Building a more inclusive and equitable future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In May we met with a group of actors from the Swedish food systems to explore what is changing in the systems at the moment and how this could be strategically navigated to enable a more rapid transition towards healthy and sustainable food&nbsp;systems.</p>Navigating the change landscape<p>In transformation theory, crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, are formative moments that could enable whole systems to transition and even transform. To understand how this potential could be seized, four strategic areas for change had been identified, based on the lab’s previous research and scenario workshop. They became the basis for discussion.</p><p>You can read more about what we were doing during the workshop and also download audio files that describe the strategic areas in this <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/making-strategic-moves-towards-sustainable-food-system-futures-31ffae3e64c2">previous blog</a>. Below we are outlining key findings and strategies built during the workshop with the actors. We recognise that the actors who participated primarily represented Stockholm perspectives and that the results are not representable for Sweden in its entirety.</p>Rapid Transition Lab: Strategy&nbsp;workshop A: Self-sufficiency <p>This group discussed how to strengthen the Swedish food systems capabilities to become more self-sufficient and resilient. The crisis has flashed out Sweden’s great dependency on imports and foreign food. Which may stimulate the national goals of increased resource efficiency and sustainable production methods. Incentives and business opportunities play a vital role, as well as new technologies. The group emphasized that there is a need to increase local production but also to change what is being produced and not necessarily more of the same (for example meat and&nbsp;dairy).</p><p>When looking at the change landscape we see that there has been an increased sale of locally produced goods. Some of the small grocery stores in rural areas have increased their sales. The participants had also found that there had been an increased interest in the role that publicly procured food can play for increased health and sustainability. The group elaborated on the fact that the increased prices on fuels and fertilizers both can be seen as an obstacle as well as a hinder. In terms of challenging food systems based on unsustainable use of diesel and chemical fertilizers, there is opportunity to bring in alternative products and increase efficiency.</p><p>The strategic moves discussed in the group had a stronghold towards government activities. The government was seen both as a driver for change in procurement of local and sustainable food, as well as creating incentives for change in regulations (like: all school meals should be sustainable products) and incentives for more sustainable production. For example, to use a “carrot and stick” approach to shift fossil fuel dependency in food productions. The group went deeper into the discussion around strategic moves for a circular value chain and specifically identified several activities connected to side stream opportunities and a shift towards mainstreaming biological fertilizers.</p> B: Regenerative farming <p>This group focused on how to create a culture of regenerative farming, where the farmers’ job is attractive, generates nutrition, fibers and energy (without waste) and cares for the long-term health of soil, plants and animals. Regenerative practices further include: 1) managing other types of land, such as forests, lakes and waterways, 2) meeting people’s needs within the means of the planet, and 3) providing the farmer with a reasonable income. Some participants highlighted regenerative farming as part of local food systems, whereas others emphasized the need for regenerative farming to be scalable and produce food to&nbsp;many.</p><p>When looking at the current change landscape, participants identified movements that could support change towards regenerative farming. Increased costs of diesel and chemical fertilizer could make regenerative practices more feasible compared to conventional ones, as it relies mainly on renewable and domestic inputs. Actors promoting regenerative practices could further connect to the heightened security debate by arguing that a resilient food production is an important part of civil defense. Yet, some actors highlighted the risk of regenerative farming not being able to produce enough food and that there may be a shortage of fertilizer (e.g. manure), especially, if it is implemented too&nbsp;fast.</p><p>With this in mind, the group discussed an overarching strategy to make financial resources available to drive the transformation toward regenerative agriculture (regardless of the farm’s size). This would address the lack of economic incentives and capital to make the transition. Several strategic moves were identified to enable this, for&nbsp;example:</p>  paying regenerative farmers for their efforts to improve and mitigate climate change (for example carbon sequestration and increasing biodiversity),  creating subsidies for the use of low-tilling practices and natural fertilizers,  shift the current tax relief for diesel costs for farmers into helping farmers transition to renewable fuels and technology  establishing promoters that connect farmers to investors,  scaling out Svensk Kolinlagring’s “carbon club” and digital platform to more farmers, investors and other&nbsp;actors,  following Norway’s example with lower tax on labor in rural areas,&nbsp;and  finding long-term investors such as Swedish pension&nbsp;funds  <p>In addition, the actors discussed the importance to make regenerative farming a prioritized area for research and innovation (e.g. Vinnova’s new innovation environment), to address the difficulty to measure and risk of scaling these practises. Research and development could help assess the outcomes of and define principles for regenerative farming that could be picked up to different degrees by different types of existing farms (e.g. organic, conservation and conventional).</p> C: Food as preventive health <p>This group looked at how food can be used for preventative health care. This includes looking at why, what, how and when one eats and its relationship to different bodies’ health defense systems. The participants discussed the potential for it to be building the resilience of the Swedish population in times of crises (such as the pandemic or times of war). Some emphasized the role of public meals and education whereas others had a larger focus on consumption at&nbsp;home.</p><p>The group looked at the change landscape and identified movements that could enable the transition towards using food as preventative health care. Grocery stores’ increased demand for locally produced food could become an opportunity to simultaneously ensure that new local products benefit our health defense systems. Sweden’s regulations already ensure products that are better for people’s wellbeing, when compared to many other countries. Similarly, the increased use of delivery services and online grocery shopping could be an opportunity to make it easy to make choices that benefit one’s&nbsp;health.</p><p>The success of the Covid-19 pandemic’s communication strategy is another opportunity. It showed how communication can shift behaviors and could lead the way for other health related campaigns; educating people about food’s impact on the body. This aligns with the government’s increased awareness of crises’ physical and mental health consequences. It has generated a larger, yet limited, interest in working more preventatively on a government level.</p><p>To navigate these changes the group shaped a strategy including three different strategic moves. It starts with an economic analysis of the adoption of healthier diets across the Swedish population; including direct costs and savings as well as the cost of missed opportunities. With this evidence as a foundation, strategic movement building could start, generating the demand for more healthy foods both commercially and politically. This could include: making food a part of every subject in school, cool role models talking about food’s impact on our health, songs about eating well, information brochures to everyone in Sweden and reporting the health impact of your grocery shopping on your receipt. This would in turn require new representation and collaboration on a government level, driving regulatory and policy changes together with actors in the food systems. This could for example include: establishing a food minister working horizontally across government and setting up policy labs where food systems actors work directly with policy&nbsp;makers.</p> D: True cost of&nbsp;food <p>This group reflected on how to price food according to its true cost, hence its impact on human and planetary health. Food systems activities such as production, distribution, consumption etc., and its effects on environmental and human health are not included in current food prices. At the same time, we must consider the affordability of healthy foods and how to make it accessible to all. Participants discussed how our financial model supports our current systems and therefore must change in order to change food systems. Consumers are also lacking basic knowledge around the impact of food and should not be responsible for making the right choices, price indicators could help them make the right&nbsp;ones.</p><p>Participants used the change landscape to look for movements that could open up for the opportunity to change the current pricing system. As a result of several recent and current crises (Covid, Energy crisis, the war in Ukraine, Oil prices increase), food prices have increased and continue to rise. This situation has brought light to the discussion around how much food should cost for producers to be profitable and how to make healthy food affordable for all. The Covid pandemic also showed us that we can change both behavior and policy if we have to in the face of a crisis, an opportunity that we could&nbsp;use.</p><p>The group brainstormed around a strategy for how to take advantage of the lowered threshold caused by these changes and identified a set of strategic moves. To support a new pricing system in how to determine what is sustainable and healthy or not, a new accounting system is needed. This would entail creating an open database and would require gathering data for all food and evaluating it, also including its social impact. Implementing the new pricing system would require education provided to organizations and a will to engage (potentially driven by economic incentives) amongst businesses. Food deliveries could also be priced according to the impact of the ordered&nbsp;food.</p><p>To facilitate for consumers to make the right decisions and navigate amongst all labellings; communication could be standardized and products labeled that are bad instead of the ones that are good. And in order to increase the knowledge amongst consumers of tomorrow, mandatory education about food and its impact should be implemented in school education. And to help children out of food poverty, statutory school breakfast could be introduced using the same mechanisms already in place for school lunches. This could have long term effects on societal welfare and would need to involve school politicians, principals, the Swedish food agency and possibly local stores and producers.</p> Next steps <p>Moving forward the lab will sens-make the findings, focused on connections to the change landscape, overlaps between strategies, and relationships with outcomes from the previous <a href="https://medium.com/rapid-transition-lab/growing-seeds-of-food-system-transformation-68ace0712fc">scenario workshop</a> and interviews.

Deceptively simple in theory, it promises to drastically improve security and compliance when dealing with sensitive data but requires a careful strategic approach to translate into a practical architecture. This whitepaper explains how the layered security approach combined with unified visibility and analytics help make data-centric security a reality.

				 <p>We use language to communicate with each other, express our thoughts and feelings, and interact in the world. But as we all know, words can be powerful, and the power of words can often have unintended consequences. The words we choose are important because they can affect how others see us and how we see ourselves. In a sense, the words we use create our reality.</p>
<p>They can make or break deals, inspire employees, and attract new customers in the business world. When used correctly, words can be a powerful tool for growth, and the wrong words can lead to misunderstandings, lost opportunities, and even legal troubles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power of words matters whether you’re working with a high-performance team and coming across a new customer or a new group inside your company or trying to improve how things are running to get that high-performance state. In this video, I’ll give some reasons for this and a real-world example of a high-stakes situation where two distinct differences between a single phrase had a critical outcome. Some things are interchangeable, but those casual words we use to define our business and our customer’s business become critically important.</p>
<p>Words are still free, so take advantage of them as much as possible, and don’t take this lightly. No one else has more control than you. The prize goes out to those who set their language apart from everyone else within their industry.</p>
<p>Our words create our reality. Choose wisely.</p>

A tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal">here</a>.</p><p>Proposals will then be published on Ocean <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-16/76">Port</a>. Port is also where voters can read proposal details.and ask questions.</p><p>All proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO voters receive funding, shortly after voting concludes.</p><p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing, to stay eligible in future Funding Rounds.

New&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN&nbsp;token.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  7,500 USD for New Teams (non-outreach category)  4,500 USD for New Teams (outreach category)  17,500 USD for 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Teams  13,000 USD for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  <p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to Ocean Protocol there are earmarked Core Tech Initiatives that are being continuously expanded upon.

This drastically increases probability for receiving a grant, on top of Quadratic Funding. (You can reduce your Deliverables commenting in Port, if you only receive a minor part of your overall requested budget.</p><p>Voting Boosts: Quadratic Voting helps distribute voting power better. The more projects you vote on, the higher your overall voting power becomes. In addition, you can now visit the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">Web3 Portal</a>, register yourself with BrightID and receive a 400% voting&nbsp;boost.</p><p>Voter Delegation: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/delegate">Voter Delegation</a> allows participants to delegate their decision making to ecosystem members they trust, easily assigning their voting power to other addresses. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-voting-improvements-qv-delegation-multi-chain-c393afc7f5e6">More info&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Funds recycling: Any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the treasury.</p><p>Working Groups</p><p>Our current WGs&nbsp;are:</p>  Project Guiding Working&nbsp;Group  Parameters &amp; Roadmap Working&nbsp;Group  Core Tech Working&nbsp;Group  OceanDAO Engineering Working&nbsp;Group  Outreach Working&nbsp;Group  Ambassadors Working&nbsp;Group  <p><a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> has a channel for each WG.

<p>Genting International Convention Centre, Kuala Lumpur / 24th &amp; 25th June 2022 — we were honoured to be part of the Malaysia International Blockchain Get Connected Conference organized by BNB Chain last&nbsp;week.</p><p>Sponsored primarily by Indonesian company Sangkara Misa, the event featured over 12 distinguished speakers from various facets of the blockchain and crypto space, ranging from defi apps to crypto exchanges to blockchain platforms.</p><p>Both CEO of Xarcade, Otto Von Nostitz, and our founder, Lon Wong, were amongst the invited speakers during this event. Otto took to the stage in the morning to introduce Xarcade, a unique video game tokenization and distribution platform which allows for seamless blockchaining of games. Otto also touched on the future of Xarcade, a metaverse called&nbsp;MetaXar.</p>Otto presenting Xarcade<p>Lon’s talk was more technical, where he covered the topic of crosschain swaps and its security. Lon explained how crosschain transactions in ProximaX are conducted differently from what is practised by the industry at large. In ProximaX, crosschain swaps are bridged directly between parties without the use of any smart contract. The benefit of this methodology is that the security of the crosschain transaction no longer depends on the quality or programming of the smart contract, albeit it is more centralized. It was ironic that a mere few hours before Lon’s talk and unbeknownst to him (and many in the audience), hackers had stolen $100million from Harmony’s smart contract dependent bridge, Horizon. As Lon said in his presentation, the security of a crosschain transaction is “only as good as its smart contract”.</p>Lon explaining how the ProximaX swap service&nbsp;works<p>One of the highlights of the BNB Chain Get Connected Conference was the talk by Indonesia’s Deputy Minister of Trade, Dr. Jerry Sambuaga, who charmed the audience with his enthusiasm and knowledge about the crypto industry. He encouraged Indonesian crypto players to continuously innovate and educate the public so that crypto could be used as a bona fide investment instrument. He emphasized that Indonesia has a huge potential as a market given its demography that supports the development and progress of the crypto industry. “We cannot hold progress in technology, but we can choose what is good and what is not by providing sufficient education and clear protection for all industry stakeholders,” Dr. Jerry Sambuaga.</p><p>This conference also gave the audience and speakers from both Malaysia and Indonesia to network and get to know one another with the hope of fostering closer cooperation between industry players from both countries. We would like to take this opportunity to thank the BNB Chain for organizing this lively conference and look forward to attending and contributing to future&nbsp;events!</p>

 In this guide, we will give you step-by-step instructions on how to stake, unstake and claim&nbsp;rewards. <p>With Shyft Network’s Staking Dashboard launching tomorrow, you can stake SHFT tokens, unstake them, and also claim your rewards. In this guide, we will show you how to do all three with step-by-step instructions. Let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it:</p> 1. How to Stake SHFT&nbsp;Tokens? <p>The first thing you need to do is choose “Shyft Mainnet” through the wallet&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Step-1: Visit Shyft Network’s staking dashboard first (http://dashboard.shyft.network/) and click on the “Connect Wallet” button. Don’t forget to agree to the terms &amp; conditions before&nbsp;that.</p><p>Step-2: Now, you must connect your wallet with the DApp. Currently, Shyft supports two wallets: Metamask &amp; Walletconnect, and you can select any of the two&nbsp;options.</p><p>For this guide, we will use Metamask. So, after clicking on the Metamask wallet option, you will see a Metamask login page, where you must enter the password and click on the login button. After this, you will be logged into the “Overview” page of Shyft Dashboard.</p><p>Metamask Login&nbsp;Prompt:</p><p>Overview Page:</p><p>Step-3: Now, click on the “SHFT Stake” option shown just below the “Overview” button on the left side of the screen to access the Shyft Staking interface. Make sure to select “Shyft Mainnet” on your Metamask wallet. Check out this step-by-step instruction on switching to “Shyft Mainnet” on Metamask.”</p><p>Once you are on the staking interface, you will see data on “Total Pool Volume,” “Pool Rate,” and “Your Liquidity Deposits.”</p><p>Step-4: Click on the purple “Stake” button to begin the staking process. After this, you will see a pop up screen where you can enter the amount of SHFT tokens you want to stake or click on the “Max” button to stake all the SHFT tokens in your account. Then, click on the “Deposit” button.</p><p>Now, you will see a Metamask notification showing you the amount of SHFT tokens you are staking and the gas fee you will be paying for the transaction. Verify the transaction details and click on the blue “Confirm” button to go ahead with the transaction.</p><p>After confirming the transaction, a pop up message will appear at the bottom right side of the screen showing the amount you have staked. It will take a couple of seconds to approve the transaction.</p><p>As soon as the transaction goes through, the “Total Pool Volume” will go up, and that’s it! You have successfully staked your SHFT&nbsp;tokens.</p> 2. How to Unstake your SHFT tokens from Shyft Network’s Staking Dashboard? <p>Step-1: First, click on the unstake option. After this, you will see the current stats on “Your Liquidity Deposits” and “Unbonded Request.”</p><p>Unstaking your SHFT tokens will basically involve a two-step process: unbonding &amp; unstaking.</p><p>First, click on the “Unbonding’’ button. After you do so, you will see a popup notification where you must fill in the percentage of SHFT tokens you want to&nbsp;unbond.</p><p>Then, enter the percentage of SHFT tokens you want to unbond and click on the “Confirm” button.</p><p>After this, you will see a Metamask confirmation, showing the type of transaction (Unbond in this case), the number of SHFT tokens involved, and the gas fee you will have to pay. Click on the “confirm” button to proceed&nbsp;further.</p><p>The unbonding process will be completed in a few minutes on the test net, but on the mainnet, the unbonding process will take 28 days at&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Step-2: Next, click on the “Unstake” button shown next to the amount of SHFT tokens you unbonded. After this, you will see a Metamask notification showing the type of transaction, the amount of SHFT tokens involved in the transaction, and the associated gas fee. Click on the “Confirm” button to go ahead with the transaction.</p><p>That’s it! The unstaking process will be completed within a couple of seconds, and the unstaked SHFT tokens will be deposited into your&nbsp;account.</p> 3. How to Claim&nbsp;Rewards? <p>Step-1: Click on the “Rewards” section shown on the right side of the “Unstake” option. Here, you will see the amount of SHFT tokens you can claim as&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Step-2: Click on the “Claim all” button to claim your rewards. Then, you will see a Metamask notification, which you must confirm to proceed with the transaction.</p><p>After successfully claiming your rewards, the unclaimed SHFT rewards tracker will turn to&nbsp;zero.</p><p>That’s it! With these instructions, you should be able to use the Shyft Network Staking UI prepared by the Shyft DAO. We hope you find it&nbsp;useful.</p><p>Remember to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShyftNetwork">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> to stay up-to-date on all updates and community engagement opportunities.</p>

<p>SIM binding is growing in popularity due to the ease of use and the greater amount of security provided compared to PIN code verification.</p>
<p>What is SIM binding? SIM binding is a type of device binding where an individual uses their mobile phone and binds that phone to their SIM card. This provides for greater security in user authentication.</p>
 What Is Device Binding and How Does It Work? 
<p>Device binding is a security practice where a security token, used as proof of identity, is linked to a device trusted by the user and a service provider. Typically, devices, in this case, mean any device with a way to store digital information, which includes the following objects:</p>
 
 Smartphones 
 Tablets 
 Smart Watches 
 SIM Cards 
 Laptops 
 RF Transmitters 
 EMV Chip Cards 
 
<p>An authentication token is a key that shows a security service that a device is trusted. Tokens may produce a one-time password validated by the authentication server or utilize some other form of identification like a hardware identification number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These tokens generally fall into one of two categories:</p>
 
 Hardware Tokens: These devices use a small, physical system to serve as the token and produce the OTP. These usually come in a USB key, a smart card, or a wireless device used in high-security enterprise contexts.&nbsp; 
 Software Tokens: These tokens are installed on devices as an application or even inside another application like a web browser. Common forms of software tokens are <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/identity-authentication/">identity authentication</a> apps released by companies like Microsoft or Google that generate timed OTPs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>SIM binding is a form of hardware token security. A device, usually equipped with a dedicated application linked to an <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-solution/">identity solution</a>, will provide that app to detect the presence of SIM cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SIM card is registered with the employer and their authentication provider and, if necessary, linked with additional authentication measures. The application then validates that user and device and uses the token to authenticate it whenever it attempts to access systems and resources.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Benefits of SIM Binding? 
<p>With cloud technologies, remote workers, and distributed systems becoming the rule rather than the exception, proper security is necessary. Hardware tokens provide several advantages to help administrators implement that security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of hardware tokens and binding include the following:</p>
 
 Heightened Multi-Factor Authentication: Hardware tokens can serve as a secondary form of authentication that supplements technologies like passwords, SMS verification, or biometrics.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Furthermore, it intrinsically links SIM authentication with the typical biometric options available on modern smartphones, particularly fingerprint and facial scanning.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Self-Service and Simplified Onboarding: Administrators can automate access provisioning for old employees and new ones without requiring those employees to undergo complicated onboarding that involves several steps and personnel.&nbsp; 
 Continuous Authentication: In industries like finance and banking, administrators can ease the use of continuous authentication against risk-based identity management through device binding that can provide regular data streams of customer behavior to prevent fraud.&nbsp; 
 Passwordless Authentication: With SIM binding and mobile authentication, most organizations can remove the need for passwords at all. Passwords are often the weakest point in terms of security, and your organization can bypass them altogether.&nbsp; 
 Fraud Reduction: Binding can reduce fraud by requiring a physical device for authentication. Coupled with additional measures like identity proofing, an organization can avoid many fraud attempts that rely on gaps in identification and remote access.&nbsp; 
 Technology Agnostic: Outside of having a SIM-connected device (which nearly every person has), the binding token can streamline authentication across several platforms, services, or user portals—all from the same device.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These improvements are possible because binding is a localized, physical form of authentication, superior to passwords. Furthermore, this kind of authentication can mitigate hackers taking control of accounts to gain access to private information—the hacker would still need the device in hand to authenticate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To speak to these advantages, the Reserve Bank of India published their “Master Direction on Digital Payment Security.” They noted that existing token-based authentication (namely through SMS) was not, in and of itself, enough of a security measure to guarantee identity in a financial transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, they mandated that any payment transactions in that jurisdiction must use an additional authentication method (for banks. The method must be “dynamic or non-replicable,” including device and SIM binding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this kind of guidance, the signal to the broader financial industry is that device-based authentication will become the norm, rather than the exception, in the world of online banking and finances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Human imagination is like a box with a wide range of ideas: every person could imagine different things, but as a society it is common to picture outstanding scenarios where the species would achieve amazing progress. For instance, some movies like X-Machina or Bicentennial Man envisioned a future where relationships between robots and people are possible, and implanted the idea of machines having consciousness and feelings towards others. We probably looked at these films as impossible scenarios, but what happens when reality overlaps with fiction?</p>
<p>A few days ago, many people around the world started talking about LaMDA, a Language Model for Dialogue Application created by Google in 2017, system that recently gained relevance because it is claimed to be sentient by one of the researchers of the technological company. Considering the digitalization progress, it is not that hard to believe that the machines could develop unexpected capabilities, but before judging or commenting, it is important to understand how artificial intelligence work.</p>
 The Evolution of AI 
<p>Artificial intelligence is software that mimics human responses under certain conditions, and according to Alan Turing, “the possibility of letting the machine alter its own instructions provides the mechanism for this” (Turing, <a href="https://www.vordenker.de/downloads/turing-vorlesung.pdf">Lecture to the London Mathematical Society</a>, 20 February 1947). While Turing’s definition is one of many for artificial intelligence, it emphasizes its sometimes unbelievable capabilities to learn as humans do so that it can address problems it has never faced before. AI as Turning imagined it is not yet here, but its precursors are and can be applied to different fields: from decision-making in a self-driving car to answers provided by a chatbot. Specialists have improved algorithms and, undeniably, neuronal networks have changed the rules.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the first discussions and discoveries of artificial intelligence were in the 40s when engineers discovered an algorithm to decipher hidden messages during the war. If we compare that with the current decade where big data has undoubtedly gained relevance, we can say that artificial intelligence took great advantage of the massive amount of data available and the capabilities of the computers, which allow the machines to respond logically and, in some cases, faster than humans (e.g., in a chess game)</p>
<p>Nowadays, the software can understand different words and their meaning together in a sentence, learn from previous answers to develop a conversation, and reply according to the receptor’s assumed preferences in a very smooth way. Regardless of how amazed we are of this capabilities, the greatest limitation machines have is that they cannot transfer their “knowledge” on one topic to another similar or related one. For instance, if a human knows how to play chess, then the person would be able to play checkers in a few hours, but if a machine is trained to play chess, this is the only game it will be capable to play, and if we want the machine to play checkers, we need to train the software for that.</p>
<p>Taking into account the model’s mimic of the human brain and coming back to the main point, is it possible for a machine to feel like a human? The answer is no. Feelings are associated with emotions that occur within the body, while the machines can sense the world and agents around them, and by doing so they can respond to the circumstances. To make it clearer, software or robots can express sadness or happiness, but they do not feel it in the way that we know and do. LaMDA is a language built using artificial intelligence, and it is capable of developing answers according to what it learned. Undoubtedly it is an amazing creation, and it is bringing us closer to the superintelligence that scientists are looking for, but it is still a software created by humans whose functionality is learning from the experience and improving on its own.</p>
 What do we know about LaMDA? 
<p>To sum up, LaMDA is capable of connecting millions of sentences, giving them a meaning, and talking about many topics. Artificial intelligence needs humans as humans need computers. The two complement one another, but the existence of this new kind of intelligence would not be possible if the human does not indicate to the algorithm what to do and how to work. Although there is outstanding progress in this industry, we still have to keep the expectations of machines to have emotions on hold and leave this topic for the science fiction movies. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A seismic shift is under way in the huge, ongoing international project called ‘digital identity’. It hasn’t triggered any spectacular earthquakes yet. It’s more tectonic than that. But it’s seismic nevertheless.</p><p>Ten years ago, we (Mydex CIC) were one of five companies (along with the likes of the Post Office and the credit reference agency Experian) chosen by the UK Government to pioneer its Verify digital identity programme. At the time the Government had a vision for identity which went something like&nbsp;this.</p><p>An ‘identity’ — that confirms that a person is who they claim to be — would be a sort of digital product produced by specialist producers called ‘identity service providers’ (ISPs). They would compete in a market for digital identities made up of competing ISPs. Organisations would buy these identities from the ISPs to help them reduce the costs and risks they incur in checking to see if individuals are who they say they&nbsp;are.</p><p>None of this vision is likely to survive as it gets replaced by a different, more efficient and more person-centric perspective.</p><p>The first shift towards this new perspective happened a few years ago when the Government decided to launch its Identity and Attributes Trust Framework. Adding the word ‘attributes’ isn’t just a small semantic change. It signifies something very important (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>The second shift, confirmed by the publication of the Government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version">Beta version</a> of this Trust Framework, is the explicit recognition that ‘identities’, attributes, or both, may be shared by a range of different parties including citizens using personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>The Trust Framework paper gives the example of Carmen, a doctor moving to work at a new hospital. Before starting work at the hospital, she must prove who she is and that she has the relevant qualifications. She gets a digital version of her registration certificate that confirms her licence to be a doctor in the UK. It is added to her personal data store. The information from this registration certificate can be checked against an authoritative source. She can share it when needed e.g. when applying for a post at her new hospital.</p><p>Says <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version/uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework-beta-version">the&nbsp;Paper</a>:</p><blockquote>“Attributes can be created, collected and checked by an attribute service provider. An attribute service provider could be an organisation or a piece of software, like a personal data store or digital&nbsp;wallet.”</blockquote><p>It’s all obvious, sensible stuff. But what it points to is a new vision of identity that has got nothing to do with the one outlined by Verify above; that combines trust-building with citizen agency with the reduction of friction, effort, risk and&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Here are some of the main operational differences between the two&nbsp;visions.</p> A new vision of&nbsp;identity <p>First, an ‘identity’ is not a fixed ‘thing’. It is a byproduct of a process for the sharing of verified attributes (that is, details about an individual that have been generated or checked by a recognised, responsible body such as a bank or government department). The particular bits of information that may go towards confirming that an individual is who they say they are may vary greatly from situation to situation. It doesn’t really matter what they are, as long as the process for making them available is reliable, safe and efficient.</p><p>Second, the use cases of ‘identity’ vary widely. Most people think of identity as relating to one specific scenario such as opening a bank account when, as an individual, you have to prove to the bank that you who you say you are and not some sort of fraudster. That’s important. But it’s actually just one step in an entire sequence of operations where it is necessary to know the identity and attributes of a person in order to provide them with a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Other use cases include being recognised when you return to a service, checking eligibility for the provision of a service (such as for a loan or a benefit), configuring the details of that service so that they fit the circumstances of the individual concerned, planning the delivery of this service, and implementing its delivery.</p><p>At each stage, different bits of information may be needed. If a person is applying for a job where they will be driving a lot, they will need to present evidence of having a valid driving licence. If they are applying for a loan or benefit, the driving licence may be irrelevant but details about their financial circumstances become central. At each point, it’s the ability to access and use verified attributes that matters — and it is the bundles of these attributes that make up the individual’s identity in that&nbsp;context.</p><p>Third, this means there can never be a fixed, separate product called ‘an identity’, because the detailed bits of information in play at any one time will be changing. What really adds value is the ability to configure multiple different data points to fit the task at&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Fourth, this ability to access, share and configure verified attributes requires the existence of enabling data logistics infrastructure — infrastructure that enables these processes in a safe, efficient, privacy-protecting way. This mental and operational shift from ‘product’ to enabling infrastructure is vital. It is what our recent White Paper on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-the-personal-data-economy-f63ffa93e382">Design Principles for the Personal Data Economy</a> is&nbsp;about.</p><p>Fifth, this means there is no need for a special class of producers called ‘Identity Service Providers’, because their role is being fulfilled by this infrastructure.</p><p>Sixth, it also means that identity provision will never, ever become a ‘market’ because there isn’t a ‘product’ to sell. At one time, many companies hoped to make a fortune selling identities for fabulous profits. The opposite is true. Like all infrastructure such as roads, railways, electricity and the internet, the greatest benefits accrue all round when the costs of using attribute sharing infrastructure are brought to as close to zero as possible. The economic logic driver here is ‘cost out’, not ‘margin&nbsp;plus’.</p><p>Seventh, and most important of all, ‘identity’ is not just a service to organisations. It is first and foremost inclusive: a service for citizens as the example of Carmen shows. It is about empowering citizens with agency; with the information they need to make their way efficiently and effectively within a complex world of service provision.</p><p>Finally, the citizen-empowering data logistics infrastructure that’s needed for this new realistic vision of identity is already built — by Mydex CIC. As just noted, we have just published a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-the-personal-data-economy-f63ffa93e382">White Paper</a> examining the design principles of the ecosystem it needs to work&nbsp;within.</p> Conclusion <p>For decades now, identity practitioners (Governments, big businesses, tech companies) have been chasing a vision of identity that was as real as a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. That is why they have spent decades — huge amounts of wasted time, money and effort — getting&nbsp;nowhere.</p><p>But now there is growing Governmental recognition of the need for a different approach that empowers citizens as agents able to share verified attribute about themselves. This idea lies at the heart of Digital Identity Scotland’s <a href="https://digitalgovernment.scot/digital-identity-scotland/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a>, the Korean Government’s increasingly ambitious MyData initiative, and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/data-governance-act-explained">EU’s Data Governance Act</a> (especially its provisions for ‘data intermediaries’).</p><p>The Government’s proposed Identity and Attributes Trust Framework doesn’t get us all the way to the coherent, alternative vision that is needed. But it has made some decisive steps in that direction. By recognising the pivotal importance of verified attributes and the potential role of personal data stores in enabling the sharing of these attributes, it is opening the door to actually solving the problem of identity. At&nbsp;last.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/getting-identity-right-at-last-8512abadcfbc">Getting Identity Right. At Last.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The biggest Hacker House till date — Web3Auth and Solana Team Up in Bengaluru With unseen or unheard of early morning queues to enter the venue, the Solana x Web3Auth HH in Bengaluru turned out be a mega&nbsp;event<p>Earlier this year we made a special <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/solana-and-web3auth-team-up-to-organize-an-unforgettable-6-day-hacker-house-f78b95f9d2e9">announcement</a> about co-organizing 4 global Hacker Houses with Solana. The first such collaboration took place in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/solana-and-web3auth-team-up-to-organize-an-unforgettable-6-day-hacker-house-f78b95f9d2e9">Singapore</a> in February this year over 6 unforgettable days.</p><p>Regarding the next collaboration, we asked our folks on Twitter on where they thought we would be next and guess what, they got it right. Bengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India was indeed to become our second destination for the global&nbsp;tour.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth/status/1511300534048739339">@web3auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Highest Turnout Ever<br>India has one of the biggest developer communities in the world and not surprisingly, the event received way more registrations than the venue could accommodate. What happened as a result? A long queue that has never been seen in any of the Solana Hacker House conducted anywhere in the&nbsp;world.</p>Image from Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta">https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta</a><p>The participants mostly included enterprising college going folks between the age&nbsp;17–21.</p><p>We caught hold of 14-year old X to find out why he was at the Hacker House (and not in&nbsp;school)</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1532241513299578881">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Office Hours with Team&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p>Fresh from participating at two major blockchain events, first at the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-happened-ethamsterdam22-89562c5e8d18">Paris Blockchain Week</a> and later at <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-at-the-paris-blockchain-week-2022-2a26345c9c06">ETHAmsterdam</a>, team Web3Auth was present in full force at the Bengaluru Hacker House. Web3Auth offered office hours which were attended by different participants. The Web3Auth team patiently spent time answering queries of different kinds ranging from UI/UX to user on-boarding to privacy and security.</p><p>Influencers on Stage — Tanmay Bhat and Biswa Kalyan&nbsp;Rath</p><p>Two major star attractions at the event were two of India’s most famous stand-up comedians. However, only one of them was at the event in capacity as a comic and that was Biswa Kalyan Rath who performed on the second day of the event leaving the young crowd thoroughly entertained. A lot of previously unheard crypto jokes found presence in his set for the Hacker&nbsp;House.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/pranavgamedev/status/1524432939630571520">@pranavgamedev</a></p></blockquote><p>The other star attraction was Tanmay Bhatt who was at the event in capacity as a member of the SuperTeam DAO. The SuperTeam DAO’s main role is to help grow the Solana ecosystem in India, South East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa. Tanmay, one of India’s most well-known digital content creators, offered a very insightful presentation on “how to make good content?”</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1525768520922869760">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Many Applications Integrated with&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p>Web3Auth was integrated with many applications being built at the Hacker House.

  <p>Firebase is an exciting cloud platform from Google available to businesses today.  Firebase connects everything from simple static websites to IoT devices to AI and machine learning platforms. The platform provides various services to facilitate these connections, like storage and authentication.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn about two core Firebase products: Cloud Functions for Firebase and Firebase Hosting. Hosting is for deploying static web applications. Functions are the Firebase serverless platform.  You will create a static application using React that authenticates users via Okta’s React library. After obtaining an access token from Okta’s authorization server, you will use a Firebase function to exchange the Okta token for a Firebase token and sign in the user using Firebase’s authentication structure. You will obtain additional user information by calling the <code>userInfo</code> endpoint on your Okta authorization server and including that data in your Firebase token. Finally, you will create another function endpoint to handle a simple HTTP request that requires an authenticated user.</p>

<p>Once you’ve built your application, you will deploy it to the Firebase platform for public consumption using the Firebase CLI.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a> offers Authentication and User Management APIs that reduce development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure. Okta’s intuitive API and expert support make it easy for developers to authenticate, manage, and secure users and roles in any application.</p>

 Add authentication using OIDC 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The CLI outputs the Issuer and Client ID. You’ll need those coming up.</p>

 Create your Firebase project 

<p>Next, open the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/">Firebase console</a> and click Add Project. Give your project a name, preferably <code>okta-firebase</code>. For now, you can turn off the analytics and create the project. Once that’s completed, you’ll be able to access the project dashboard.</p>

<p>First, click the Upgrade button next to the Spark option at the bottom of your screen. Change your plan to Blaze and if you wish, set a billing budget for $1 to let you know when you are incurring a charge. Blaze is pay-as-you-go, and the rates are pretty generous for hobby projects. You shouldn’t incur any charges at this time, but the budget will let you know if you do.</p>

<p>Click the settings wheel next to Project Overview and click Project settings. At the bottom of the overview page, there’s a prompt to Select a platform to get started and select web app (it will look like &lt;/&gt;). Give your app the nickname <code>okta-firebase-demo</code> and select Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app. Click Register app, and in a moment you will see some JavaScript code for setting up your Firebase app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Hold onto this information as you will need it in your app. Click through the rest of the wizard and return to your console. Again go to the Project settings section and navigate to the Service accounts tab. Click Generate new private key and let that file download. You will need this in your Firebase Function shortly.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, click the Build&gt;Authentication in the side nav and click Get Started. Pressing the Get Started button generates a Web API Key that is required for using the auth features.</p>

 Create your front end in React 

<p>Next, create your React app.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app@5 okta-firebase
cd okta-firebase
</code>   

<p>The npx command will scaffold a new React version 18 application for you.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to install a few dependencies to help you.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-react@6.4.3
npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@6.2.0
npm i react-router-dom@5.3.0
npm i bootstrap@5.1.3
npm i firebase@9.8.1
</code>   

<p>First, you want to install the <code>@okta/okta-react</code> package to assist in authenticating users and obtaining the tokens from the Okta authorization server. This package will help you access the authentication state, direct users to the Okta login page, and handle any callbacks.</p>

<p><code>@okta/okta-react</code> relies on the <code>@okta/okta-auth-js</code> package, so you need to install it.</p>

<p>Next, you want to install <code>react-router-dom</code>. This package will set up the callback route for you and any other routes you may need.</p>

<p>Finally, you will use the <code>firebase</code> package to call the various platform features in Firebase, such as functions and authentication.</p>

<p>Add a file called <code>.env</code> in your root directory and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=/oauth2/default
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourClientID}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APIKEY={yourFirebaseAPIKey}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN={yourFirebaseAuthDomain}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECTID={yourFirebaseProjectID}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET={yourFirebaseStorageBucket}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGINGSENDERID={yourFirebaseMessagingSenderID}
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APPID={yourFirebaseAppID}
REACT_APP_ENV=production
</code>   

<p>You obtained the Okta values when you created your application using the Okta CLI earlier. Your Okta domain is part of the Issuer. The Firebase values came from the configuration you copied when you first created your application.</p>

<p>There is currently a known error in React 18 with the Okta React library where multiple rerenders can lead to an error message in the <code>oktaAuth</code> object. Work on fixing this error is ongoing. In the meantime, you can work around it by taking React out of <code>strict</code> mode. Replace the code in your <code>index.js</code> file with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
    &lt;App /&gt;
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();

</code>   

<p>Next, open your <code>App.js</code> file and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>import "./App.css";

import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import AppWithRouterAccess from "./AppWithRouterAccess";
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';


function App() {

  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;      
      &lt;AppWithRouterAccess /&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>You are replacing the default code with a <code>Router</code> and an <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code> that you will write next. Open a new file called <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import "./App.css";

import { Route, useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { Security, LoginCallback } from "@okta/okta-react";

import Home from "./Home";

const {
  REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
  REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID
} = process.env;

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
  clientId: REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID,
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + "/login/callback",
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
});

function AppWithRouterAccess() {
  const history = useHistory();

  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin));
  };

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
}

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>This file will define your routes and establish the <code>/login/callback</code> route for Okta to handle signing in your users.</p>

<p>Finally, add the <code>Home.jsx</code> file to your application with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from "react";

import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

<p>This page will handle both the authenticated and unauthenticated states. If the user is not authenticated, they are presented with a screen requesting them to do so. If the user is authenticated, they can <code>getGrades</code> by selecting a semester from the drop-down and calling the server.</p>

<p>The <code>getGrades</code> function ensures the user is authenticated using the build-in authentication function in Firebase. Firebase also integrates with authentication tokens from providers such as Okta. To utilize this functionality, you will mint a Firebase authentication token using an Okta authentication token. Okta returns an <code>accessToken</code> to the client when the user logs in. The client then passes the <code>accessToken</code> to a Firebase function called <code>exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken</code>. In this Cloud Function for Firebase, you verify the token and return a Firebase token to log the user in. Then subsequent calls to the functions will treat that user as logged in to Firebase.</p>

<p>At this point, you can use the <code>npm run start</code> command to run your app locally. You’ll see a few console errors from Firebase, and you’ll see Login buttons. Notice that you’re able to authenticate with Okta now, but the login process doesn’t call Firebase yet, so your login is still incomplete.</p>

 Make your React application ready for Firebase 

<p>Now you are ready to prepare your application for Firebase. If you haven’t done so yet, please install the Firebase CLI.</p>

   <code>npm install -g firebase-tools@11.1.0
</code>   

<p>To log in with your Google account, you may need to run <code>firebase login</code>.</p>

<p>Next, run the command <code>firebase init</code> to start the initialization of your project.</p>

<p>Select both of the following features:</p>
 
   Functions: Configure a Cloud Functions directory and its files 
   Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys 
 

<p>Select Use an existing project and select your <code>okta-firebase-{ID}</code> project</p>

<p>After a moment, you’ll see prompts to set up Firebase functions. Select the following options:</p>
 
   Language - Javascript 
   EsLint - No (You should use this in production-ready applications.) 
   When prompted to install dependencies say Yes 
 

<p>Next, select the following options to set up hosting.</p>
 
   What do you want to use as your public directory? - build 
   Configure as a single-page app?  yes 
   Setup automatic builds?  no 
 

<p>Before deploying your application, you must run the <code>build</code> command on your React app to prepare it properly. By configuring your app as a SPA, you tell the Firebase CLI to edit the configuration to redirect to <code>/index.html</code>.</p>

 Add authenticated Firebase functions 

<p>You should notice that a new folder called <code>functions</code> has been added to your directory. There, you will see some Firebase config stuff and a file called <code>index.js</code>. You’re going to add the code for two functions.</p>

<p>First, you will need one that accepts an Okta token and returns a Firebase token for the client to use. To verify the token, you will use the <code>@okta/jwt-verifier</code> package from Okta.</p>

<p>The second function will accept arguments from the client, namely the semester, and use that along with some information from the token to build report card data for the client to use to create the report card.</p>

<p>Start by navigating to your functions directory and installing your dependencies.</p>

   <code>cd functions
npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@2.3.0
</code>   

<p>The <code>@okta/jwt-verifier</code> will verify your JWT from Okta when calling the <code>exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken</code> function.</p>

<p>Next, copy the keys file you downloaded from the Firebase console earlier and add it to your <code>functions</code> folder. Make a note of the name, as you will need that shortly.</p>

<p>Add a file to your <code>functions</code> folder called <code>grades.js</code> and add the following code.</p>

   <code>const getGrades = (user, semester) =&gt; {
  return {
    name: user.name,
    school: getFakeUniversityName(user.email),
    semester: semester.name,
    year: semester.year,
    grades: grades
      .filter((r) =&gt; r.year == semester.year)
      .filter((r) =&gt; r.semester == semester.name),
  };
};

const getFakeUniversityName = (email) =&gt; {
  const number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
  const domain = parseDomain(email);

  switch (number) {
    case 0:
      return "University of " + domain;
    case 1:
      return domain + " State University";
    default:
      return "University of " + domain;
  }
};

const parseDomain = (email) =&gt; {
  const emailParts = email.split("@");
  const domainParts = emailParts[1].split(".");

  let name = "";

  domainParts.forEach((part, i) =&gt; {
    if (i &gt; 0) {
      name += " ";
    }
    if (i + 1 &lt; domainParts.length) {
      name += part.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + part.slice(1);
    }
  });

  return name;
};

module.exports = { getGrades };
</code>   

<p>First, <code>exchangeOktaTokenForFirebaseToken</code> will provide a custom token from Firebase to use in your application. Firebase allows you complete control over your authentication via the <code>signInWithCustomToken</code> method you used on the client. You need to create a custom token using your service account. You downloaded your service account definition as a JSON file earlier. Now you can call <code>createCustomToken</code> from your <code>auth</code> object against your service account. This function requires a <code>uid</code> and optionally accepts other claims you may wish to add.  Be mindful that <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens#reserved_custom_token_names">Firebase reserves token names</a>.</p>

<p>You can then obtain a token from the Okta authorization server and present it to the Firebase function to be verified using the <code>OktaJwtVerifier</code>. If the Okta token is valid, you will call your Okta authorization server’s <code>userInfo</code> endpoint to obtain additional information about your user. You can include this information in your Firebase token as its custom claims. Then you can use the <code>firebaseApp</code> object to create your token with those claims. You’ll return this token to the client and sign in with it.</p>

<p>Next, you have the <code>getGrades</code> function. You check <code>context.auth</code> to see if the user is logged in. If they aren’t, you are throwing an error. If they are, allow the user to access the grades data in that file.</p>

<p>There are two different ways to set up functions in Firebase, <code>onCall</code> and <code>onRequest</code>. <code>onRequest</code> gives you a more raw form of handling the incoming call. You’d need to set up your CORS code, your authentication, and all the good stuff that the <code>onCall</code> wrapper takes care of for you. For example, <code>context.auth</code> is provided because you used the <code>onCall</code>, whereas through <code>onRequest</code> you would need to obtain this information manually.</p>

 Test your app locally using Firebase emulators 

<p>Now you are ready to test your application locally through the Firebase emulator. The emulator will make it so that your services can communicate as though they were deployed to Firebase.</p>

<p>First, edit your <code>.env</code> file to replace <code>REACT_APP_ENV=production</code> with <code>REACT_APP_ENV=development</code>. This change tells the application to connect to the emulator. Next, run the following commands in your project’s root directory.</p>

   <code>npm run build
firebase emulators:start
</code>   

<p>First, you need to build your application since Firebase expects your application to be in the <code>build</code> directory as you configured earlier. Next, it will create an emulator and deploy your function and web application to that emulator. By default, the web app deploys to <code>localhost:5000</code> rather than the usual <code>localhost:3000</code>.</p>

<p>If you find that you have conflicts with the default ports that Firebase uses, you can update the <code>firebase.json</code> file entries for <code>emulators.functions.port</code> and <code>emulators.hosting.port</code> to ports that you have available. See below for an example <code>firebase.json</code> file that uses port 5002 for hosting and 5001 for functions.</p>

 <code>{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  },
  "functions": {
    "source": "functions"
  },
  "emulators": {
    "functions": {
      "port": 5001
    },
    "hosting": {
      "port": 5002
    },
    "ui": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
</code> 

<p>You’ll need to open the Okta admin console and navigate to your Okta application to add these ports to the allowlist.</p>

<p>Open <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Portal</a> and Sign in to Okta. Then press Admin to launch the admin console.</p>

<p>Navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and find your Okta application for this project. Select it to edit. On the General tab, Edit the General Settings with the new ports. For example, if your Firebase hosting port is 5000, add <code>http://localhost:5000/login/callback</code> to Sign-in redirect URIs and <code>http://localhost:5000</code> to your Sign-out redirect URIs. Update the port number based on your Firebase emulator settings and save.</p>

<p>There’s one more place to add the new port in the Okta admin console. You’ll add the port as a Trusted Origin so your app can complete the logout process. Navigate to Security &gt; API and open the Trusted Origins tab. Press the + Add Origin button and add the new URL with the port, such as <code>http://localhost:5000/</code>. Select the Redirect and CORS checkboxes and save, then return to your application.</p>

<p>At this point, you should be able to log in to Okta, exchange your token for a Firebase token, select a semester, and click Get Grades to see your report card generate.</p>

<p></p>

 Deploy your application to Firebase 

<p>Once this works, you are ready to deploy your application to Firebase. First, set your <code>.env</code> entry for <code>REACT_APP_ENV</code> back to <code>production</code> if you had set it to <code>development</code>. You may need to run the <code>npm run build</code> command once more in case you’ve made any edits or changes. Once complete, run the command <code>firebase deploy</code> from your root directory.</p>

<p>After completing this step, your CLI will provide a URL to your application. You should see your application running on Firebase if you click that. But, Okta won’t work at this point. You need to go back to your Okta admin portal, under your application, and add <code>{yourFirebaseDomain}/login/callback</code> to your Sign-in redirect URIs, <code>{yourFirebaseDomain}</code> to your Sign-out redirect URIs to the General Settings tab of your Okta application, and add {yourFirebaseDomain} as a Trusted Origin</p>

<p>Now return to your application in Firebase and click Sign In to ensure Okta is hooked up correctly. Once you are signed in, you should be able to select a semester and click Get Grades to see your report card generated.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We learn who we are in practice, not in theory.”</p><br>David Epstein, Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</blockquote>



<p>I love when different spaces come together. There are so many opportunities to challenge assumptions, learn from each other, and find common ground. And if you happen to be sitting right in the middle at the time, suddenly you have the opportunity to unify and bridge seemingly unbridgeable gaps.</p>



<p>It’s been a busy month for decentralized identity. Led by Vitalik Buterin, the Web3 community joined the party with a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">proposal on Soulbound Tokens</a> (SBTs), culminating in an excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbyVyVNsyys">debate</a> on Bankless between Vitalik and Evin McMullen from <a href="https://disco.xyz/">disco.xyz</a>, about the risks and rewards of the “public by default” identity tokens over the “private by default” Verifiable Credential (VC) standard recommended by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/">TBD</a> and Jack Dorsey published their equally tongue-in-cheekily-named <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/">Web5 proposal</a>, essentially coming down firmly in the VC camp, stating that nothing should be put on chain, and if it should, then it should be on bitcoin (because who needs smart contracts anyway)?</p>



<p>We at Civic find ourselves sitting in the middle of a debate that we are extremely familiar with. We’ve been negotiating this dichotomy since our inception. In 2017 we published <a href="https://vinnylingham.com/civic-enabling-the-future-of-privacy-digital-security-with-chainauth-b79d61904d4c">Chainauth</a>, a mechanism for anchoring verifiable credentials on Bitcoin, and in 2021 we released <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/">Civic Pass</a>, a multi-chain token protocol, in conjunction with <a href="https://identity.com/">identity.com</a>.</p>



<p>I, for one, feel like a Berlin resident in 1990 tapping away at the Berlin Wall as others on each side pick up pick-axes around me, suddenly realising that a wall that shouldn’t exist anyway can, in fact, be toppled.</p>



<p>Why, if we had Chainauth, based on verifiable credentials, did we release Civic Pass, a token protocol very similar to SBTs? Why do we, at Civic, think that, all in all, SBTs are a good thing? After all, we share the privacy concerns of SBTs that were eloquently enumerated by Evin McMullen. Alongside the benefits of shared state for revocability and “negative reputation” listed by Vitalik, the main driver for us is flexible and uncomplicated integration into smart contracts, be they <a href="http://dex.solrise.com/">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://realms.today/">DAOs</a>,<a href="https://docs.civic.com/integrations/adding-captcha-to-candy-machine-v2"> NFT mints</a>, or others. Essentially we believe that there is benefit for an individual in circumspectly registering aspects of their identity on-chain.</p>



<p>There are right ways and wrong ways to achieve this (and watch this space for an upcoming post about the four pillars of identity-based tokens), but what Civic is doing is building the bridge between SBTs and VCs. Civic strongly believes that the future of decentralized, reusable identity is verifiable credentials. We issue VCs behind the scenes. We have an identity wallet that allows users to store and present those credentials, and we are building a web portal to replace it (keep an eye on <a href="http://civic.me/">civic.me</a>). However, smart contracts never see them, because we allow users to “tokenize” them on whatever chain they are using. In this way, an SBT is really more of a decentralized access-control layer, which is why we decided to call it Civic Pass. Combining these two concepts, off-chain verifiable credentials and on-chain passes, is immensely powerful, allowing seamless integration with on-chain projects, an identity that is portable across multiple chains, while still allowing users to provide their credentials off-chain to organizations that need them for regulatory, or other, purposes.</p>



<p>Vitalik opened the debate with Evin by stating that the two sides have more they agree with than they disagree with, and we at Civic certainly agree with that. We have been operating in both worlds for several years now, and have lived the debate internally several times. Essentially it comes down to figuring out a common language, so that the Decentralized Identity world can integrate into Web3, their biggest ally to wide-scale adoption, and the Web3 world can truly kick-off with a robust, secure and self-sovereign identity model.</p>

 Stakers can claim rewards. DF2 counting has&nbsp;begun  1. Overview <p>The <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean</a> <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> program incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (LPs / stakers) for higher data consume volume (DCV) and&nbsp;stake.</p><p>DF Round 1 (DF1) is part of DF Alpha phase. DF1 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 16, 2022, and ended 11:59pm Wed Jun 22, 2022 (one week later). 10K OCEAN worth of rewards were computed and sent to the claims contracts. LPs can now claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF&nbsp;webapp</a>.</p><p>DF Round 2 (DF2) is also part of DF Alpha phase. DF2 counting started 12:01am Thu Jun 23, 2022, and will end on 11:59pm Wed Jun 29, 2022. 10K OCEAN worth of rewards is available.</p><p>The rest of this post describes how to claim rewards, then details on DF1 and&nbsp;DF2.</p> 2. How To Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>As an LP (staker), here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal  Connect your&nbsp;wallet  For each network with rewards (where you staked): select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)  <p>In DF1, only Polygon and EWC had nonzero DCV, therefore rewards only went to those networks.</p><p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p> 3. DF1 Input Parameters <p>DF1 is the first week of DF overall 🥳. This also makes it the first week of the the DF Alpha phase. DF Alpha runs 4 weeks, with 10K OCEAN rewards budgeted per week. DF Alpha’s aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.</p><p>The DF launch post “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a>” included DF1’s parameters. Then, “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-examples-c2d67a17b5f5">Ocean Data Farming Examples: DF1</a>” provided examples to better understand earnings, against the DF1 rewards formula and related settings.</p> 4.

Image: <a href="http://Cortizo%20veta%20parcialmente%20el%20proyecto%20de%20ley%20que%20regula%20los%20criptoactivos">Revista&nbsp;Summa</a> President of Panama Rejects to Sign the Crypto Bill, Sends it Back for Further Discussion Over “AML-related” Concerns  The most pressing concern that the President had was the lack of Anti-Money laundering provisions in the&nbsp;Bill.  Key Highlights <blockquote>- Panama’s President Laurentino Cortizo vetoed the crypto bill due to a lack of robust anti-money laundering provisions.</blockquote><blockquote>- President Cortizo previously called the crypto bill “innovative law.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Once signed by the President, it will enable local businesses to accept payments in digital currencies, legally recognize DAOs, and create a framework for the government to use blockchain technology for record-keeping.</blockquote><p>Recently, a Panamanian media outlet, La Prenda, <a href="https://www.prensa.com/economia/cortizo-veta-parcialmente-el-proyecto-de-ley-que-regula-los-criptoactivos/">reported</a> that Bill №697, informally known as the “Crypto Bill,” was vetoed by Panama’s President Laurentino Cortizo.</p><p>The President said that the proposed bills need further improvements to meet the standards of Panama’s banking regulations. The most pressing concern that the President had was the lack of Anti-Money laundering provisions in the&nbsp;Bill.</p><p>In May 2022, while giving a speech during a Bloomberg event, President Cortizo was very upfront about his view that he wouldn’t sign the bill if it failed to incorporate FATF’s AML regulations.</p> Partially Rejected <p>That said, President Cortizo hasn’t rejected the bill in its entirety, as he appreciated specific segments of the bill. In fact, previously, he has also called the bill an “innovative law.” But he demanded strong measures to prevent the illicit use of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>President Cortizo is heavily stressing the need for a robust AML mechanism because the country has been campaigning to improve its reputation among global financial regulators, which has been dented due to its popularity as a tax haven. For instance, the Financial Task Force (FATF) categorized Panama under the “<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/high-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/documents/increased-monitoring-june-2022.html">Jurisdictions Under Increased Monitoring</a>.”</p> Reactions <p>Gabriel Silva, a Panamanian Congressman who played a vital role in introducing the said Bill, wasn’t enthused about the President’s vetoing the bill. He tweeted that the President’s decision to reject the bill resulted in “a lost opportunity to generate jobs, attract investment and incorporate technology and innovation in the public&nbsp;sector.”</p><p>He further stated that Congress would make further changes to the bill after going through the Veto and then re-submit it to the President for consideration.</p> What the Bill has to&nbsp;Offer? <p>If the bill comes into force, it will enable local businesses to accept payments in digital currencies of all sorts. Thus, Panama’s crypto adoption will be different from El Salvador, which has only legalized the use of Bitcoin as a means of payment in the country by approving it as a legal&nbsp;tender.</p><p>Besides, the Bill will also pave the way for using blockchain technology for government record-keeping purposes and give legal recognition to the Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).</p><p>__________</p><p>Considering the pseudo-anonymous nature of crypto transactions, countries worldwide are tightening their AML-related rules to prevent its use by sanctioned individuals and entities. The first such global push for the digital assets space came in the form of FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Although not all countries have started enforcing the FATF’s Travel Rule yet, sooner or later, they all will. Thus, all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) will have to begin complying with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>The first thing that a VASP will need to start complying with the Travel Rule is a Travel Rule Solution Provider (TRSP). And Veriscope is second to none when it comes to TRSPs.

				  Indicio a Finalist in CRN Awards for social impact  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The CRN Tech Impact awards are given to IT vendors, distributors, and resellers for their social and environmental impact. This year, Indicio is a finalist in the Social Impact Project Category for its work with SITA, the world’s leading provider of IT to the air transport sector,&nbsp; on verifiable credentials for travel.</p>
<p>Indicio worked with SITA and the Aruban government to develop a decentralized identity solution for managing Covid testing and vaccination for travelers to the tourism-dependent island. The goal was to avoid the need for airlines or governments to directly integrate with health care providers, while providing travelers with a tamper-and-fraud proof, privacy-preserving way to prove their health data (and thereby comply with health data privacy requirements).</p>
<p>After successful trials, the code was donated to Linux Foundation Public Health as a privacy-preserving way for public health authorities to share health data. Known as the <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea Project</a>, the codebase continues to be developed to address other health data sharing needs.</p>
<p>As a Public Benefit Corporation, Indicio has made the advancement of decentralized identity its public benefit mission. The social impact of Cardea is enormous. There is now a complete open source decentralized ecosystem for issuing, holding, and sharing health data in a privacy-preserving way. At the same time, SITA’s application of the same digital technology promises to transform our experience of travel from check in to border control.</p>
<p>To read more about some of the work that was done you can read the original press release <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">here</a> or read the <a href="https://cardea.app/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cardea-White-Paper-V1.0.pdf">Cardea white paper.</a></p>
<p>Other finalists in the social impact category are Epson UK and Clevertouch Technologies and Interactive AV Solutions.</p>
<p>For the full list of categories and finalists, visit <a href="https://event.channelweb.co.uk/crntechimpactawards2022/en/page/2022-finalists">CRN.</a></p>
<p>Indicio is honored to be nominated and looks forward to the announcement of the winners in September.</p>

<p>The 2022 Verizon Data Breach report found that a staggering 82% of breaches this year were caused by the human element which encompasses errors, misuse, and social engineering. The report also found that 45% of breaches were caused by credential misuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization secures any remote access systems like Zscaler with a password, you are vulnerable to a data breach. Even if 2FA or password based MFA has been implemented, a user’s password is the first authentication factor, which can be stolen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about biometric based MFA? Device level biometrics like Touch ID and Face ID don’t actually prove the user’s identity. This is because multiple fingerprints and faces can be registered to the same phone. Furthermore, these fingerprints and faces are never matched to any valid source of proof like a government issued credential.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, it is important that remote access solutions like Zscaler are protected from data breaches. As the workforce has become increasingly remote over the last two years, the risk of data theft has been exacerbated by employees who use their personal devices and networks which have lower security standards than their corporate-controlled alternatives. This makes it easier than ever for hackers to access company data.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>BlockID hardens the security of remote access solutions like Zscaler by enabling them to prove the identity of their users. By proving the identity of users each time they log in, all of the other pillars of zero trust become easier to manage.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Prove Identity?&nbsp; 
<p>When a user downloads the BlockID app and enrolls, they will take a live selfie – This is part of our LiveID. Then, we ask the user for that selfie and compare it to their photo from government issued documents like a passport or a driver’s license. 1Kosmos matches the selfie with the documents and gives the user a digital certificate that verifies their identity and it binds the account to the proven identity. When users authenticate through LiveID we compare the live selfie with the one taken at enrollment to prove identity and grant access.</p>
<p>To summarize, proving identity and reaching Zero Trust requires one platform that</p>
 
 Establishes user-controlled identity 
 Proves authentication with that previously established identity 
 
<p>There are two standards for identity and authentication: NIST 800-63-3 for ID enrollment and strong ID usage, and FIDO2 for passwordless. No platform besides BlockID has combined both of these into one experience. When done right, this single experience can replace many legacy processes and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/1kosmos/">FIDO</a>, BlockID’s live biometrics are <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1Kosmos-Biometric-Subsystem-Certification-Report-V2.0-1.pdf">iBeta</a> certified which validates the reliability of BlockID for accurately performing live biometrics for identity proofing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about the BlockID platform and how it can support your zero trust journey, I invite you to watch our ondemand webinar, “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/webinars/implementing-a-sustainable-zero-trust-architecture/">Implementing a Sustainable Zero Trust Architecture.</a>”</p>

<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week’s Holochain release brings a large and anticipated change, what will become the foundation for the 0.1.0 release of the HDK and the Stable Validation milestone. I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-roadmap-online/#holochain-roadmap-is-now-live">hinted at it</a> a few months ago, and now the time is finally upon us.</p> Holochain 0.0.143: Maintenance release <p>HDK compatibility: 0.0.129 to 0.0.136</p><p>This release brought more documentation updates to a couple packages, and that’s about it.</p> Holochain 0.0.144: Integrity/coordination split <p>HDI compatibility: 0.0.9<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.137</p><p>This release sees a number of changes to the HDK in preparation for the next release. You’ll note that I’m now listing the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/external-links/#integritycoordination-split-begins">previously announced</a> HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate as a separate thing — this library has only existed as part of the HDK before this release, but it becomes a separate thing from now on.</p><p>I have to admit that the title of this Dev Pulse is not exactly true. As you may know, data integrity is critical when groups of people want to coordinate their actions. If you can’t trust what your peers are saying and doing, you can’t move forward safely with them.</p><p>Also, when I say ‘coordination’ I’m not even talking about that kind of coordination. I’m talking about something more low-level and programmer-ish: one application instance coordinating the flow of its own processing and data, nothing more.</p><p>And finally, they’re not really parting ways — it’s just that the pieces of your hApp’s code that are responsible for data integrity will be split from the pieces that are responsible for application execution. They’ll exist in separate zomes in your DNA. If you’re familiar with the MVC (model, view, controller) programming pattern, you could look at it this way:</p><p>Your application’s integrity zomes comprise its model layer — everything that defines the shape of the data. In practice, this means three things: entry type definitions, link type definitions, and a validation callback that constrains the kinds of data that can validly be called entries and links of those types.</p><p>And the coordination zomes comprise its controller layer — the code that actually commits data, retrieves it, handles countersigning sessions, and sends and receives messages between peers or between a cell and its UI. In other words, all your zome functions, your `init` functions, your remote signal receivers, and your scheduler callbacks will all live in coordination zomes.</p><p>To repeat what I described a few months ago, the intention is to let you split the core integrity components of your application, which define the unalterable rules of the game, from the business logic. That way, your DHT can last a long time yet still receive upgrades and bug fixes — as long as you don’t need to change your integrity components.</p><p>And we’re making the same promise for the reduced library that your integrity components are built on — the HDI (Holochain Deterministic Integrity) crate. Once it reaches its 0.1.0 release, we plan to keep HDI stable for a while between minor releases.</p><p>You’re probably wondering how to refactor your hApp given this substantial change. Here are the most important things to know:</p><p>Your DNA manifest file is broken into <code>integrity</code> and <code>coordinator</code> sections. <code>integrity</code> holds everything that affects the DNA’s hash: the list of integrity zomes, the DNA properties, the UID, and a new <code>origin_time</code> field that indicates the earliest possible timestamp for a source chain entry, which is used to prevent time-travel attacks. Only the <code>integrity</code> section affects your DNA hash.</p><p><code>coordinator</code> holds the list of coordination zomes. Coordination zomes must explicitly list their dependencies; that is, the integrity zomes that contain definitions for the entry and link types they intend to write. (If you have only one integrity zome, however, you don’t need to list it as a dependency in any of the coordination zomes.) Here’s a complex example with multiple zomes of both kinds:</p> <code>manifest_version: "1"
name: multi integrity dna
integrity:
  uid: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  properties: ~
  origin_time: 2022-02-11T23:05:19.470323Z
  zomes:
    - name: zome1
      bundled: ../dna1/zomes/zome1.wasm
    - name: zome2
      bundled: ../dna2/zomes/zome1.wasm
coordinator:
  zomes:
    - name: zome3
      bundled: ../dna1/zomes/zome2.wasm
      dependencies:
        - name: zome1
    - name: zome4
      bundled: ../dna2/zomes/zome2.wasm
      dependencies:
        - name: zome1
        - name: zome2
</code> 
<p>As mentioned, your entry/link definitions, membrane proof self-checks, and validation callbacks will need to be moved into integrity zomes with only one core dependency on the HDI crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_deterministic_integrity"><code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code></a>. This crate has been around for a while, but you haven’t needed to worry about it until now because it was just part of the HDK. (It still is, but it now is meant to exist independently of the HDK.) integrity zomes should not depend on the full HDK — it’s not going to remain stable over time like HDI is. There are new macro helpers for defining entry and link types. The test suite has examples of an integrity zome with <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.144/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace/integrity_zome/src/lib.rs">entry types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.144/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace/link/src/integrity.rs">link types</a>.</p><p>All of your zome functions, init callbacks, remote signal receivers, and scheduler callbacks should go into coordination zomes. They can (and likely should) depend on the full HDK, which still includes <code>holochain_deterministic_integrity</code> as a dependency.</p><p>Only the coordination zomes can use non-deterministic host functions in the full HDK such as source chain commits and queries, DHT gets, agent activity queries, signal emitters, remote calls, and complex crypto functions. Integrity zomes can only use deterministic functions such as <code>must_get_*</code>, <code>dna_info</code>, <code>zome_info</code>, and simple crypto functions such as hashing. This makes sense, because the only functions available to your validation callback are the deterministic ones; this just becomes explicit with the separation between HDI and the rest of the HDK.</p><p>There are some changes that remove <code>zome_id</code> from the headers of entry and link creation elements. These changes are temporary and will be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1453">reverted</a> in a future release. In fact, before the 0.1.0 release of HDI there will likely be more changes, although they will mostly be hidden behind macros and other conveniences. If you want to have a say in the usability of the hApp development experience, please jump in now and tell us what you think. But if you desire stability, it’s probably best to wait until 0.1.0.</p><p>You can also look at the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.144/CHANGELOG.md#20220616084359">full changelog</a> or the integrity PR (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1325">#1325</a>) for the fine details.</p><p>There are a lot of other changes in this release, some related to the integrity/coordinator split and some not:</p>  New: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/prelude/macro.wasm_error.html"><code>wasm_error!</code></a> macro in the HDK, which captures line numbers. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1380">#1380</a>)  New: Stubs for libsodium Salsa20-Poly1305 <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/secretbox">secret box</a> encryption in the HDK. It’s not yet supported by the Lair keystore, so it will currently throw unimplemented errors. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1410">#1410</a>)  New: Updated to newest Wasmer, which allows us to implement metering. Zome calls are now limited to a generous 10 giga-operations, which should prevent infinite loops from overwhelming an agent’s machine. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1386">#1386</a>)  Breaking: When using <code>get_links</code>, the <code>link_type</code> parameter now takes <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html">more than one</a> link type at a time. And because a coordination zome can depend on more than one integrity zome, you can even specify link types from multiple integrity zomes. Any link types not defined in a coordination zome’s dependencies will be filtered out.

Breaking: <code>update_entry</code> takes anything that implements <code>TryInto&lt;Entry&gt;</code> rather than <code>EntryDefRegistration</code>.  Breaking: <code>Path</code> now must be <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/hash_path/path/struct.Path.html#method.typed">typed to a specific <code>LinkType</code></a>.  Breaking: <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.136/hdk/prelude/struct.CreateInput.html#structfield.entry_location"><code>CreateInput</code></a>, used in <code>create_entry</code>, replaces <code>entry_def_id</code> with <code>entry_location</code> which allows you to specify that the entry is either an app entry (with entry def ID) or a capability grant/claim. In practice, you don’t need to worry about this if you’re using the entry def helper macro, because it will create a type that can be converted into a <code>CreateInput</code>.  Breaking: The <code>register_entry!</code> macro has been replaced by an <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.137/hdk/entry/attr.hdk_entry_defs.html"><code>#[hdk_entry_defs]</code></a> helper.

Breaking: <code>EntryDefs::entry_def_index_from_id()</code>, <code>ZomeInfo::matches_entry_def_id()</code>, <code>CreateLink::zome_id</code>, and <code>AppEntryType::zome_ID</code> have been removed because there is no way to go from a local ID to a global ID.

We believe these language changes will make it easier for new developers to understand what these structures are about. Every source chain commit is a record of a particular type of action (publishing an agent key, creating data, deleting a link, etc), so this language aligns with that reality. <code>Entry</code> is remaining the same. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1441">#1441</a>)  Breaking: When you’re using an ‘enzyme’ in countersigning (a trusted agent who collects all the signatures, rather than waiting for signatures to get published to the DHT and broadcast to all signers), you now specify that a session <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html#structfield.enzymatic">is enzymatic</a>, and the enzyme agent will be the first countersigner by convention. Previously the enzyme's agent ID was specified explicitly and separately from the other counterparties. (Note: the API is fully fleshed out, but the network plumbing to support enzymes is not functional yet.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1394">#1394</a>)  Breaking: In a countersigning session, you can now specify a number of <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html#structfield.optional_signing_agents">optional signers</a>. You can specify how many of them <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.138/hdk/prelude/countersigning/struct.PreflightRequest.html#structfield.minimum_optional_signing_agents">must sign</a> in order for the session to complete; that number must be equal to or greater than a majority of the optional signers. This is useful for reaching ‘micro-consensus’ over rivalrous data such as usernames, in a way that tolerates downtime among trusted authorities. Note: When using optional witnesses, the session must use an enzyme, who must be the first agent in both the list of signing agents and the list of optional signers. This allows the process to be more efficient and less ambiguous than waiting for the DHT to reach consistency.

 Identity Platform 2022.1 is released today, including SSO 9.0 and CustomerID 6.0 
<p>Across this release cycle we have covered deep technical improvements and modernisations of the Identity Platform, as well as making progress in a new key development area. For all the details, please head over to our <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20221/pages/8907554826/Identity+Server+2022.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the structural changes found in this release, OpenLDAP MDB (regarding memory and disk space), the move to Java 11 and some third-party libraries, we felt there were sufficient changes to make this release a major version update. As such, SSO is moving from 8.9 to 9.0 and CustomerID is moving from 5.9 to 6.0 during this 2022.1 release cycle.</p>
 Features 
<p>Sign in with BYOI: Within the Identity Platform we have added another ‘essential’ BYOI (bring your own identity) provider into full support – Apple. Now you can easily configure sign-in functions with Google, Microsoft, and Apple identities. They enable you to support most consumers or external users and offer an already existing, easy to use identity method to empower your digitisation. You no longer have to maintain internal identity and password management services if you do not require them. Adding in “Sign in with Apple” continues our journey towards offering you a passwordless future, where users can be allowed access based on their existing credentials and authenticated with a glance at their phone. It may take some time for the entire world to transition to this easy-to-use feature, but just like the gradual transition to electric cars, the FIDO alliance will help enable a passwordless future for everyone. For more details on the FIDO backed, passwordless future check out this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/05/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard/">Apple blog</a>.</p>
<p>Risk-Based Authentication (RBA):&nbsp;We have continued our development of risk-based authentication features over the past several months, with ongoing developments to be continued. For this release, we have added the ability to offer SMS OTP (one time password) and SMTP OTP for unregistered users. Utilising either OpenID Connect or SAML, you can now both securely integrate an external IdP, as well as require a second authentication factor (MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)) to highly assure external users from that IdP. The external user signs into your application via OpenID Connect (or SAML) and after returning to SSO will query the external IdP for the user’s phone number. From there, a six-digit OTP code is sent as an SMS to the user. When the user enters the OTP code on your application login screen, the external MFA is completed, and the user will be allowed to access your application.</p>
<p>Risk-Based Authentication is an area that we will continue to develop over the next two to three release cycles. We are excited to expand our Identity Platform into this dynamic security space and believe we will deliver many useful enhancements to the platform. Ask your Sales Team/Account Manager for more information on upcoming development plans.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>We are all aware that security is a continual process, not a one-time destination. For the Identity Platform, this process of continually ensuring our security posture is paramount. We have been investing development cycles to ensure we can respond to unforeseen security events, like Log4j v2 at the end of last year, as well as making systematic improvements to the core functioning and performance of the Identity Platform. During this release we have published several further improvements to the platform.</p>
<p>OpenLDAP MDB: We’ve updated the directory (OpenLDAP) which underlies our SSO application to OpenLDAP MDB (Memory-Mapped Database), which has proven to give a responsive and ready-to-scale datastore to our Identity Platform. We have been operating MDB for one of our cloud customers for six months now and it has proven capable of handling upwards of a million active user sessions. An updated session manager (which is also used with Redis deployments) further improves session management on the platform. Read the release notes for more details as there are environment updates needed to migrate from the existing OpenLDAP BDB to MDB.</p>
<p>Java11: We have recompiled the Identity Platform with Java 11. This fundamental improvement brings all the enhancements of Java 11, as well as the security improvements permitted by enabling updates in third-party libraries and services (like WildFly) used throughout the Identity Platform. For many of us, Java 8 has been a mainstay for a number of years. Java 11 will not be as long lived as Java 8 was – please see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html">Oracle’s page</a>&nbsp;over Java SE life cycles. We will review Java 17 vs Java 21 in late 2023, so please anticipate your environment needs as we move forward.</p>
<p>Third-party libraries: The Identity Platform follows open standards, like OIDC (OpenID Connect), and uses many third-party libraries. The standards and libraries help to ensure that the code is reviewed by a global community, with the community offering patches against security vulnerabilities and bugs. For each and every release, we continue to patch the third-party libraries used and as needed update the libraries to more modern or better functioning libraries and code bases. Within the 2022.1 release, we’ve continued this updating. As with prior releases we encourage every customer to update their environment as soon as possible, to benefit from these latest updates.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>As we head into the summer months, we are aiming to finalise another section of Risk-Based Authentication (directory mapped users will gain the ability to use TOTP as their MFA), complete the modernisation of logging libraries within the platform, and complete some updates to make premises-based installations easier. We have some exiting mid-term goals that we hope to announce at the end of summer, that will bring IDaaS into sharp view and consideration for all&nbsp; future customer projects. We expect to have a two-year roadmap laid out to discuss with all of you at the end of summer. Until then, please have a look at the 2022.1 Release Notes. Feel free to engage with us via the Operations team or your account team – we are always happy for your input to help shape our future developments.</p>

<p>Account creation fraud–also referred to as new account fraud (NAF) or fake accounts fraud–is the act of fraudsters creating accounts on online services with malicious intent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many variations in how and why fraudsters engage in this activity (and we will cover these below in detail), but the general ideas are the same:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>A fraudster creates accounts on an online service with malicious intent using fake or stolen identity information.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A fraudster uses fake accounts to conduct fraudulent activity for the purpose of monetization (directly or indirectly).</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tactics of account creation fraud vary between different online services depending on the information required for account creation, the information verification processes, and eventually the ways that accounts can be used for illegitimate activity. Some examples of these differences between services are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Online gaming platforms: A valid email address alone is sometimes sufficient to create an account. Once created, a fake account may be used, for example, to spam other players or to gain in-game assets that can then be transferred.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Online retail and e-commerce: An email address and basic details such as gender and name are usually sufficient for account creation. A fake account may be used, for example, for credit card testing (i.e., simply verifying that account details and credit card details are valid) or as part of accounts referral chaining to collect referral bonuses.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Financial services: Account creation usually requires highly detailed account information such as an address, phone number, and social security number. A fake account may be used, for example, to access credit.</p>

<p>Small-to-midsize business (SMB) owners have had to pivot and adjust to the new realities of the economy, throughout the pandemic and beyond. Implementing new business models, investing in PPE and managing employees all come with additional costs, in a business environment that’s already rife with inflationary pressures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing these challenges takes every available resource, and owner-permissioned SMB open banking data is powering the financial management apps and services that owners are embracing to improve their business operations. According to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Rise of Open Banking Small Business report</a>, connecting accounts is the main driver that provides the insights and analytics that owners are looking for to help tackle critical business tasks. Ninety-six percent of owners are currently linking their business financial accounts, taking advantage of fintech apps and services that leverage open banking data to generate crucial information and insights for their businesses, helping to improve decision-making. The top reasons for connecting accounts are:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Receiving payments from customers (75%) 
 Banking (73%) 
 Billing/invoicing (73%) 
 Paying bills/expenses (73%) 
 Accounting (73%) 
 Cash flow management (72%) 
 
<p>With all the benefits of linking accounts, fintech innovators have a window of opportunity in the SMB space to improve the connection process:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Reducing time for cross-platform verification 
 Making it intuitive for SMB owners to link their accounts, or communicating how to link accounts 
 Utilizing UI that auto-populates routing and accounting numbers 
 Utilizing account owner verification to mitigate fraudulent accounts 
 
<p>Even with the understandable adjustments that it takes to press forward into a new era of digital business and financial management, the desire to adopt is strong in the SMB sector. Owners want to digitize their businesses to help prevent fraud, automate processes and share data and insights across apps.&nbsp;</p>
 Linking Accounts Generates Real-Time Financial Insights 
<p>Despite rising fintech use, 94% of small business owners still encounter financial pain points. Many of them cite financial management as a major source of stress.</p>
<p>Owners are seeking solutions that can help them with financial management to address these pain points. They’re looking for better ways to harness their business’s data to get a holistic view, optimize financial management and inform business strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where SMB fintech services providers can step in and provide solutions, partnering with SMBs as they push forward into the new digital economy. Owners are open to receiving help. Sixty-three percent are looking for help with financial planning for their business, and 85% want the kind of custom financial recommendations that come from linking accounts and sharing open banking data.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The top driver for owners linking accounts is improvement in business decision-making. This comes directly from financial management apps and services. Real-time data paired with AI, machine learning and analytics can have a powerful impact on an owner’s speed of decision-making and action, allowing them to either take advantage of opportunities or avoid costly mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better data and better decisions naturally feed into the rest of the top-three SMB owners’ concerns: saving time and improving financial health.&nbsp;</p>
 How Small Businesses are Using Open Banking Fintech Apps and Services 
<p>According to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">report</a>, banking is the top use case for small businesses, once they link their accounts. Depositing checks, paying bills and transferring funds are core, everyday needs that SMB owners are currently using fintech to accomplish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Billing and invoicing can be streamlined and automated with fintech, and small businesses want this. Sixty-one percent of small businesses are already using fintech to do so. When routine tasks can be handled in the background by apps, owners can move more pressing concerns to the forefront. Growing, scaling and developing products or services can be given the bandwidth they deserve.</p>
<p>Sixty percent are using digital apps and services for cash flow management. With real-time data from linked accounts, owners can pay bills strategically, while making sure they can pay vendors, employees and themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the number of SMBs leveraging fintech apps is currently in the 50-60% range, the Rise of Open Banking study found that the number who want to use digital apps and services powered by open banking is over 90% for the majority of use cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/05122043/Small-Business-FAQ-2020.pdf">31.7 million small businesses</a> in the US are looking for more choice in financial services. They’re willing and ready to adapt to the digital future, and are looking for innovators that provide solutions to help them make better decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastercard’s “always on” platform means maximum connection uptime and the highest quality data for insights into the financial health of a small business. Read the full report <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">here</a> to see details on the solutions small businesses are looking for from financial service technology.</p>
<p>*Some open banking services are provided by Mastercard’s wholly owned subsidiary, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Finicity Corporation</a>.</p>

<p>A bipartisan group of legislators in the US House and Senate has proposed a bill that could result in a long-awaited national data privacy law. This is big news that could allow internet users to opt out of targeted advertisements and sue companies that improperly sell their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 This is the biggest breakthrough to date for a national privacy law 



<p></p>



<p>While it’s too soon to say whether the bill will pass, whether its protections will be diluted before it passes, and how rigorously the law will be enforced, this is the biggest breakthrough to date for a national data privacy law.&nbsp;The US is one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;strong&nbsp;national privacy laws&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Some say this bill offers a compromise position 



<p></p>



<p>Until now, partisan disagreements and privacy actives fighting for their version of a perfect bill have hampered efforts and distracted from the benefits of passing a reasonable, decent bill. Democrats argue for a private right of action that will give consumers legal rights if government fails to enforce the federal law, while Republicans want a federal law to preempt state laws to end the patchwork of compliance obligations on business.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/03/internet-privacy-congress-compromise-proposal/">Observers</a>&nbsp;say this current bipartisan bill represents a compromise on these two big sticking points, in that it limits when and how users could sue internet companies for privacy violations and contains measures that would supersede most state data privacy laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the proposed bill:</p>



  Companies would have to restrict their data collection to only data that is necessary for their business to function.  Companies couldn’t charge users to access data privacy measures except in some limited circumstances.  The Federal Trade Commission would have to maintain a public registry of data brokers and present a way for users to opt out of targeted advertisements and other data sharing practices.  Consumers could access, correct and delete their own data and companies would have to tell third parties to change user data where users request it.  Companies would have to annually prove their compliance.  The FTC would be tasked with enforcing the law via a new purpose-built bureau for consumer data privacy.&nbsp;  Individual users could sue companies after a four-year waiting period from the date this new bill is enacted. There are some caveats on individual powers to sue.  The new federal law would supersede most state data privacy laws with some exceptions.  



<p>The proposed bill needs more members’ support and is in a race against time to be passed before the midterm elections. So while this proposed bill is generally good news, a bill is only as good as the funding and capabilities of the agencies responsible for enforcing it. And if it doesn’t pass before the midterms, what then?</p>

We must ensure that security is at the forefront of innovation as security holds the power to create an efficient and reliable ecosystem, without which, Web3 will&nbsp;falter.”</p><p>Blockchain transactions are both transparent and immutable. With this in mind, decentralized identity (DID) solutions can ensure every effort is employed to uphold the integrity of users’ data, providing new safeguards for users. DID solutions can verify identities, authenticate traceability, validate digital assets, and in turn increase the overall security of the internet. Through DID applications, users can successfully manage their own digital identities, where they can log in securely to different systems without exposing their private information.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-june-14-20-2022-6dcb9976b32">Ontology Weekly Report (June 14–20, 2022)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Last month we were asked to give a talk in Korea on the design principles for a new personal data economy. We’ve turned this talk into a White Paper, <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">published here</a>.</p><p>It’s important because, in our view, most current debate about personal data is based on a philosophical category error that inevitably leads to a dead&nbsp;end.</p><p>If you want to solve a problem you need to know what’s causing it. If you’ve got a heart problem, no matter how many pills you take for gastric wind you won’t solve it. When it comes to personal data, most discussion assumes that our problems are caused by how organisations handle the data they collect and use. They are not. They are caused by the design of the system these organisations are operating within.</p><p>‘System design’? That sounds rather abstract and airy-fairy. Not for practical people. But it’s not abstract or airy-fairy at all. Birds are living systems designed to fly in the air. Fish are designed to swim in water. If you ask a fish to fly you won’t get very far because that’s not what its system is designed to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Today’s personal data system is designed to help organisations collect and use data to further their particular purposes. It is not designed to help citizens get the benefits of their data, to use data to address social ills, or even to help economy-wide innovation and growth (which may involve the creation of new and different organisations).</p><p>In fact, with the way our current system works citizens have little or no control over their own data and are not benefiting as they should from it. Service providers often lack access to the data they need and face high costs in accessing and using it. And the system as a whole experiences high costs along with low levels of trust and restricted innovation.</p><p>But these problems are not created by the behaviours of individual organisations in isolation. They are created by the way the system itself works. Its design: the fact that it is organised solely around organisations collecting and using data for their own particular purposes. We simply won’t solve the problems we now face by asking organisations to behave differently; by asking fish to fly. We can only solve them by introducing a different system&nbsp;design.</p> Fitness for&nbsp;purpose <p>We need a system for personal data that unleashes its full personal, social and economic potential; that goes beyond only helping organisations achieve their purposes. To achieve this we need to design a new system that’s fit for a broader range of purposes; that’s designed to fly rather than&nbsp;swim.</p><p>These design principles are not random, plucked from the air because we think they might be nice. It’s no accident that all fish are sleek and that birds have wings. These designs fit what they need to do. So what fit-for-purpose design principles do we need to&nbsp;adopt?</p><p>For a start, we need to build on the fact that unlike other commodities, when data gets used it doesn’t get used up. It can be used again and again, for many different purposes. We expand on this <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">theme here</a>. This being the case, it makes no sense to restrict access to data to just one organisation with one set of purposes. We need to break out of the confines of organisation-centricity, to enable data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>However, if you try to create a system where all organisations try to share data with all other organisations, you quickly create <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">a complexity catastrophe</a>. To solve this problem you need fit-for-purpose design. If data about each individual is deposited in the individual’s personal data store, then these personal data stores can act as hubs for the safe, efficient sharing of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>This is effectively a new layer of data infrastructure that transforms the design of the system. It turns multiple separate, independent, exclusive and excluding silos of data collection and use (today’s organisations) into a networked data sharing ecosystem with three core functional layers:</p>  Service providers collecting and generating personal data (acting as ‘data factories’ if you&nbsp;like)  A new exchange layer made up of personal data stores where data is stored and distributed under the individual’s control (data warehouses holding what the factories have produced)  The same and other service providers accessing and using this data to produce specific services.  <p>This means that our system’s current operating principle — that ‘the organisations that use data always store the data in question in their own systems’ — increasingly makes way for a different operational principle: the increasing separation of data storage and use, where personal data stores store individuals’ data and specialist users access this data when they need it. (Like to going to a shop when you need bread rather than baking it yourself.)</p><p>A key element of this new system design is that it is now largely citizen- or person-centric. Personal data stores a) give each individual control over the collection, sharing and use of their own data, and b) act as the natural point where all information about them is aggregated — information that was previously dispersed across hundreds of different, separate organisations collecting data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>This new structure not only empowers citizens with their own data (thereby shifting balances of power and reward within the data economy), it also creates new person-centric data assets that are impossible to create under the old structure and which are natural sources of future innovation and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The economics of all this is another question which we will return to shortly. Right now, our focus is the design principles themselves which fall into four main areas of system architecture, infrastructure, governance and economic/business model. The following tables summarise their key points. The <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">White Paper itself</a> explains their logic in further&nbsp;detail.</p> Architecture <p>Today’s data economy is organised exclusively around organisations, disperses citizens’ data across many different organisations, excludes citizens from its workings (with organisations collecting and using data about them), operates via separate data silos that act like moated castles of data control, and integrate the collection and use of data behind these castle&nbsp;walls.</p><p>The new data economy will enable citizens to collect and use their own data (as well as organisations), make individuals the point at which data about themselves is integrated, and place this new data asset directly under the citizen’s control. It will connect today’s data silos via a new ‘exchange layer’ of personal data stores that enable citizen-controlled data sharing and increasingly separates the storage of data from&nbsp;use.</p>Table 1: Architecture of the new personal data ecosystem Infrastructure <p>Today’s organisation-centric approach to personal data use creates multiple separate data silos where data is concentrated in a small number of centralised databases. Citizens’ control over their data is restricted to (often only formal) rights to consent to data collection and use. By the very way it operates it is privacy invading: organisations get to know a lot about the individuals they hold data&nbsp;on.</p><p>The new infrastructure is distributed, with multiple nodes (personal data stores) where individuals can exert real, direct control over their data. Because each personal data store is individually encrypted, with only the individual holding the key, it operates on a zero knowledge (rather than privacy invading) basis. It has a technology agnostic, cloud- based approach where PDS providers ensure key functions such as interoperability.</p>Table 2: Infrastructure of the new personal data ecosystem Governance <p>The critical governance challenge is that trustworthiness cannot be reduced to an organisation’s policy or promise: a policy that may change at any time or a promise that may be broken at any time. Commitments to ensure data security, privacy etc need to be permanent and legally enforceable, embedded in the constitutions of the institutions providing the data infrastructure. (This relates to the ‘built to last’ principle — see&nbsp;below).</p><p>In today’s data ecosystem, many organisations seek to gather and use personal data for the purposes of competitive advantage. To achieve this, they restrict who has access to the data.. For infrastructure designed to empower and include citizens and to enable data sharing of wider, improved data use, while competition between different service providers can be as intense as ever, the data infrastructure needs to be neutral: it must be designed to enable all legitimate users, without&nbsp;favour.</p>Table 3: Infrastructure governance in the new personal data ecosystem Economic logic and business&nbsp;models <p>To sustain themselves in a way that maintains and fulfils their function, personal data store providers need to be able to cover their costs. This ensures their independence from external parties who may wish to use control over the purse strings to exercise control over purposes. Because the purpose of this infrastructure is to enable others’ actions rather than to make and sell a specific ‘product’, its prime economic logic and benefit is ‘cost out’ rather than ‘added margin’. All its financial and economic incentives need to be designed to ensure this sustainability, neutrality and mission alignment.</p><p>A key part of this is continuity and longevity: a personal data store is for life, so the institutions providing personal data stores should be designed for decades (centuries, even). Whatever particular corporate form they take, legal safeguards relating to continuity and longevity of purpose need to be built into how they&nbsp;operate.</p>Table 4: Economic and business models underlying the new personal data ecosystem <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/design-principles-for-the-personal-data-economy-f63ffa93e382">Design Principles for the Personal Data Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: In the recent years, there have been organisations across the world creating, for instance, mobile credentials, and specifically mobile driving licenses. So, we’re going to discuss about this topic, and also the privacy side of this super interesting system that has been around. So, for that, we have an expert who is joining us today. My guest today is John Wunderlich. He is an information privacy and security expert with extensive experience in information privacy, identity management, and data security.</p>
<p>He has designed, built, operated, and assessed system for operations and compliance in the private and public sectors for over 25 years. These includes working or consulting for Fortune 500 corporations, government ministries, small companies, volunteer organisations, regulators, and health system organisations of all sizes.</p>
<p>Hello, John.</p>
<p>John Wunderlich: Hi, Oscar, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. It’s a pleasure talking with you.</p>
<p>John: Likewise.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. That’s a super interesting topic we’re going to discuss today about mobile credentials, so yeah, let’s talk about digital identity. But first, of course, we want to hear something a bit more about you as a guest. So please tell us your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>John: Long story short, I used to be Corporate Systems Administrator, Network Administrator, Operations Manager, and the Federal Privacy Law in Canada was introduced, I took that as a project at my company, and it turned into a career. When I moved from the corporate side to working for a regulator, I first met Kim Cameron, a name that most of your listeners will know, working with the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, shortly after he introduced the Seven Laws of Identity. And around the same time, my former boss introduced the idea of Privacy by Design.</p>
<p>So, for me going back 15, 16 years privacy and identity have been in lockstep. There’s a very large Venn diagram overlap between the two. And I’ve been consulting and working on standards and volunteer areas in that joint area since then.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Yes, just a few years ago, maybe almost two, a bit more than two years ago, we met in Kantara Initiative, in one of the working groups, and you are super involved there. And I know that recently, you and other authors have released one document called <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/pimdl-v1-final/">Privacy and Identity Protection in Mobile Driving License Ecosystem</a>. So first of all, kudos for that very good report.</p>
<p>John: Gracias!</p>
<p>Oscar: I read at least partly that and definitely I want to hear more about that today. So going into that specific mobile credentials, mobile driving licenses, I would like to hear, to start, a simple definition. So, what are mobile credentials?</p>
<p>John: Well, at the very highest level, a mobile credential is a bundle of attributes about an entity that sits on a mobile phone, or a mobile device. That’s at a very high level. And it then sort of branches down from there. You look at wallets or you can look at flash passes, or you can look at mobile driving licenses which have a specific ISO standard. You can talk about the W3C mobile credentials data model. You can talk about decentralised IDs, the W3C DIDs. So, it branches out into a whole grouping of things, but it ends up being bundles of attributes on a mobile phone.</p>
<p>Oscar: In practice, that replaces holding a driving license, the physical driving license.</p>
<p>John: I think in any substantive way, it doesn’t replace it yet. I mean, we’re talking about in-person presentation on the phone. In the workgroup that I lead that’s working on a recommendation report at Kantara, we’ve kind of matched the scope of ISO 18013-5, sorry for the ISO number reference, which is mobile driving licenses on the phone. It’s not the online presentation, which helps reduce the problem space significantly. But I think it is the case that most credentials like that are issued on the phone still have physical analogues.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>John: So that people have a choice of presenting, for example, in Canada, health is a provincial matter so depending on the province, you would be issued a QR code for your COVID vaccination status and you could print that out on paper, or there were apps that you could present it on the phone, so people did both. So, I think in the space of the mobile credential, mass adoption is still sort of dual track, not replacing but supplementing.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So yeah, whichever is available or convenient for the individual. And tell me, because I know it’s in some countries, you mentioned in Canada, this type of mobile credentials, more specifically, the mobile driving licenses are already being issued, not everywhere in world. Normally, who are these mobile credentials issued by and how do they work in practice?</p>
<p>John: Well, anybody can issue a credential. The analogue is weak, but I still think of a bundle of credentials, a bunch of attributes as the digital equivalent of a business card. I can print my own business card. But the level of assurance and level of authority is pretty weak on a business card, as opposed to a laminated plastic with a hologram issued by a government for a driving license or a proof of citizenship or a medical card or an in between, something that might be issued by a university or a company. So, you have different levels of assurance in the physical world, just as you do in the digital world. So, anybody can issue a credential, the question is what level of authority you give to the credential.</p>
<p>Oscar: And we can say the right now the most, the mobile credential that has the highest level of assurance are done by governments today.</p>
<p>John: Yeah, I don’t think that’s going to change. The government, possibly financial institutions, possibly health institutions, but they are institutionally issued by institutions that have the capability of doing identity verification on initial issuance to provide a very high level of assurance that this credential is associated with this entity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sure. Tell me a bit of the practicalities because I have never used, at least a mobile driving license, how it works in practice, when people who drive want to present the credential?</p>
<p>John: Well, let’s talk about two use cases for a mobile driving license. One is proof of authority that you’re, in fact, a licensed driver. So, you’re pulled over by the police and asked to present your driver’s license. Right now, you present a plastic laminate card, they look at it, look at the picture, may go back to their squad car, and do a check to make sure that there’s no problems with that license, that there’s no warrants. Once a warrant is issued against your name, all that good stuff. We’re presuming here that this is a legitimate traffic stop. I have a lead foot, they pull me over for going 80 in a 60, or whatever. And all of that is authorised by law. So, they get a full set of the credentials that are on the card and are able to access their backend system to get further information about me. So that’s fairly intrusive. But that’s what you would expect when you are a potential violator of the law.</p>
<p>As opposed to the more common use case for driving license, which is age verification. So, it’s long past the age where I get checked when I go into an establishment where I could buy alcohol or cannabis. But that’s the joke, driving licenses get used much more for drinking than they do for driving because people need them to buy alcohol. So right now, if I’m a just barely legal age young woman, because this is the edge case that causes real difficulties, and I’m trying to enter a club, I have to show the doorman or the bouncer at the front of the club my entire driving license. Now, what he should be doing is looking at the driving license, looking at the picture to make sure that I’m actually the person I purport to be. And then looking at the date of birth and making sure that I’m old enough in that jurisdiction to enter the club. That’s it. That’s all and no retention of information.</p>
<p>The problem, the dual edged nature of the digital driving license is this. If you do it right, you end up with all that shows up on the device that the doorman is using to verify your digital license. So, you present a QR code or there’s an NFC, you wave your phone near their receiver, the same way you do a tap to pay or a Bluetooth off in the MDL specification. All of those are allowable, the Bluetooth and the NFC are preferable. And what shows up on the doorman’s verifying device is a picture of the person whose license it is so that they can do the proof of presence. Yeah, this is indeed the person I’m presented with. And a green checkmark that says this person is old enough.</p>
<p>So, as opposed to the analogue physical driving license, he has no opportunity should he be amorously struck by the person to grab her address or follow her or grab your phone number or do any of that stuff. And the system operated by the bar also cannot record anything other than there was an age verification for a person, or they can–. On the other hand, depending on how the presentation goes, the backend system for John’s Bar and Grill could collect all the credentials that are on that driving license even if it only shows the doorman the other one and send me marketing email and all that other kind of stuff. So, you can do it in a really privacy protective manner, or you can take the bad edge case of presenting a card and automate that for negative consequences.</p>
<p>So obviously, the Kantara workgroup that I lead for reports and recommendations on privacy enhancing mobile credentials, is trying to come up with a set of recommendations for providers of verifier device issuers, providers of wallets or designers of mobile credentials, how to protect the privacy of the individual above and beyond the transaction.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. In this example of the going to a bar, you illustrated how it works, but also in the privacy implications.</p>
<p>John: Personally, I’d prefer some of the European countries that don’t have age distinctions. If you want to send your six-year-old to the bar to pick up some wine, then… But I think there’s cultural bands in those countries where if you’re publicly intoxicated, you’re subject to social ridicule. There’s no social benefit to being inebriated. Anyway, that’s a side-line.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And definitely you started explaining there some of the challenges about privacy. What would you say are the main, if you can just summarise the main challenges about privacy?</p>
<p>John: Well, the business culture, surveillance capitalism, if you will, I know that’s a fraught face. When I was running networking systems and systems administrator in the ’90s, I was issuing X.509 certificates and I had all my user data, and I had access to it. Which kind of made sense in mid to late ’90s systems. And we were a B2B company that I was working for, but we were processing the personal information of our customer’s clients. So, we also had a proprietary interest in that.</p>
<p>So, coming into 2000, there’s this sort of culture of data about people is an asset owned by the companies and can be used to those companies’ advantage. The idea of, because systems were centralised and few, privacy issues didn’t really raise their head. There was good confidentiality in most companies, but not privacy.</p>
<p>And then, with the explosion of systems, and the introduction of a very interconnected backend, and especially with the introduction of monetising data through behavioural advertising and tracking, the entire thing got out of control, and we need to wrest control back of our own information. The challenge is cultural as much as anything, like the business culture around personal data. And the business models, which are I think, not sustainable.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. And could you now tell us about the solutions? What are the solutions to those challenges you just mentioned?</p>
<p>John: Well, I think the solutions are two or three-fold. Legislation like the GDPR in Europe, or a day or two ago, I don’t know when this is going out. But just today, I heard the news that in the US, there was an agreement that might lead towards a Federal Privacy Law in the US. But all of those laws have the same flaw, which is that they’re built on the idea of Fair Information Practices, which came out of a 1970s vision of the way computer networks and systems run. Which is what we know now to be a completely flawed, notice and consent model where the organisation is a trusted organisation. It provides you notice of what they’re going to do with your data, they get your consent, and then they take possession of your data and act as a trusted custodian of your data. That was fine when there was a couple of 100 mainframes scattered around the world and IBM, [0:13:31] [unsure] on most of them doesn’t make any sense now.</p>
<p>So, there’s a new type of regulation that’s needed. But there’s a new type of standard that’s needed as well. So, the new type of regulation is what I started to taking to call “digital building code” which is you shouldn’t, any more than you shouldn’t build a house with electrical connections without making sure that your electrical infrastructure meets the building code for your jurisdiction. I think that there needs to be digital building codes so you can’t build a system that’s going to process personal information without meeting a certain minimum set of standards for protecting so that people don’t have to try and read privacy policies that can give notice and consent. That should be matched by standards and business culture to meet that floor standards.</p>
<p>So, it’s a tripod, if you will, the complaint mechanisms in the current regulations, safety regulations to make sure everybody is operating off the same floor, and standards to enable developers and companies to meet those. And I’m working on the standards side.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. You mentioned the companies tend to use the data of the individuals as a property. So how you, when we were discussing before this interview, you mentioned was the role of the IAM into this, what is your view on that?</p>
<p>John: Well, I remember talking at IIW a few years ago, it wasn’t about SSI as this was pre-SSI, but it was about a product in the system that enabled companies to give control over some portion of their customer’s data to the customer. So, in financial institutions, they’re highly regulated, and oftentimes have a requirement to send paper to their customer’s home on a yearly or quarterly basis.</p>
<p>If you have the wrong address, it’s very expensive, but you have this address in your database for the customer. And if you’ve got it wrong, you eat the cost of reprinting, resending, bringing back the data that you sent to the wrong address. The customer neglected to update you on their address, and so forth and so on. It costs millions of dollars to some of these companies every year just in data around customer addresses.</p>
<p>So, this was a system that instead of a customer requesting an address change, the company gave control of the address information to the customer, so that if the customer didn’t update the data, so with power comes responsibility, then the customer will be charged for the delivery charge to the wrong place, the reprinting and delivery charge. So that de-risks that company on that.</p>
<p>In that particular system, I had also enabled the customer to update their address with multiple companies at once if they were participating in the protocol. So, you can de-risk your data, especially against data rot, by actually giving control back to the person who knows it best. Now, you’re not going to do, I know I worked in payroll and HR so theoretically, customers can also update their financial information like, “Oh, I changed account, let me enter, put a new account number.”</p>
<p>But anybody who’s worked in payroll and HR knows that you want to verify that, so you have to balance that. But giving control of customer’s data can save you money and improve the quality of your data. And I think that was kind of one of the arguments that SSI people don’t make often enough is just the simple, reduced cost and business risk of putting people in control of aspects of their own data.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Regarding the report that you built in Kantara, tell me more about that. How it was the work that and you can tell the main findings?</p>
<p>John: The way Kantara works, there’s two kinds of discussion groups which produce reports and then recommendations, which will have requirements for conformance that could be tested. So, your audience may well know the identity assurance work trust mark that Kantara can issue if you want to make claims about your level of identity assurance for your firm.</p>
<p>So, the discussion group produced a report on protecting privacy and information and mobile driving licenses coming and that report is available on the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/">kantarainitiative.org</a> website for download and you can take a look at it. The workgroup is trying to do a little bit more ambitious. It’s trying to talk about how do you meet the reasonable expectations of privacy in the issuer, holder, verifier triangle where Alice is the holder? How can she trust that her reasonable expectations of privacy are maintained in the transactions after she’s been issued a mobile credential that that credential won’t be abused in a way? Because most of the standards are transactional, which is to say that if you use the ISO MDL standard, for example, it talks about the interfaces. It has good requirements around data minimisation, and notice and consent, but it’s all around the transaction. It doesn’t speak to, and it’s not supposed to, it’s scoped out of it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t speak about if John’s Bar and Grill is the verifier and they’re using a system issued by ‘insert your mobile payment system verifier here’ that both that system at John’s Bar and Grill. And John’s Bar and Grill, once they’ve gotten the identity attributes from the transaction, how do they use those in a privacy protective manner? If you’re building a wallet or building a mobile credential for a phone, how do you do that, so that Alice can trust the wallet not to share the information for advertising on the backend, and so forth, and so on. So, building human trust between entities is how I like to summarise it rather than technical trust between endpoints, which is a lot of what most of us work with.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s a very interesting distinction you make, right? Trust is something technical for most of us.</p>
<p>John: Well, sure. But if you think about it, Zk-SNARKs or Zero Trust Solutions make perfect sense, right? If I went back to being a Network Administrator, I’d build a zero-trust network. I would assume that there was an APT inside my network and there would be zero trust between the endpoints, and everything would be cryptographically signed and verified and yadda yadda yadda.</p>
<p>But in the real world, and this is– I steal this example from Bruce Schneier. If there was zero trust, nobody would ever cruise through a green light. How many times, if you were driving today, how many times to do sales through a green light without looking to see if some idiot was ignoring the red light and ploughing through? I mean, it happens every once in a while, for a variety of reasons. But by and large, if you’ve got a green light, you trust that all the other drivers on the road are following the rules and you just go through.</p>
<p>That’s trust. That’s human trust. It’s built on systems that have all kinds of safeguards to make sure that you don’t have a green light going four ways. But once the systems are working, people can trust each other using those systems. And we do not have that on the internet. There is essentially zero people trust, and sadly, that’s been earned by the behaviour of a number of ecosystems that handle personal ecosystems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. So, you have seen this, the understanding of trust, let’s say the identity professionals are the one who are building the systems and the, let’s say, the majority of people that difference. So, you have noticed that this makes things complicated for developing the systems?</p>
<p>John: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, the story for surveillance capital, like companies that depend on advertising is, we never sell your information, or we never share your information. Well, which was true in a sense, and that if you went to site X, or site F, or site G, you know, insert whatever company. And you went to that site, and then behind the scenes, real time bidding occurred, they didn’t share your information with any of the advertisers. The advertisers said, I want to put my ad on profiles that meet these parameters. And there’ll be real time bidding.</p>
<p>So, at one level, until you clicked on the ad, and at which point your positive action of clicking on the ad created a relationship between you and the advertiser, at which point it’s out of system X or system F or system G’s hands, you’ve now done something, and that advertiser or the publisher has access to your information, because you clicked on their ad. So, in a very narrow, untrustworthy sense, yeah, they weren’t selling your data. Although a lot has come out now about the way real time bidding works, and how much information is shared for the 100 bidders, who get to see some bit of your data to bid on that page, and only one of them actually gets the data, the one that actually wins the bid. It’s a snake pit behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. Well, thank you, very interesting, what you are sharing with us about the mobile credential, the privacy and how things are progressing. Could you tell us now for all business leaders that are listening to us, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>John: The actionable item is, do you know who you share your customer’s data with? And why you shared it? And would you be comfortable sharing that information with your customer? So, the answer to all three of those questions should be yes. Yes, I know with whom I shared it. Yes, I know what I shared. And yes, I’m comfortable letting the customer know that I’ve shared it. If any one of those answers is no, then there’s going to be a reckoning at some point with your customers, or with the regulator, or with your business model.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yup. Three questions that, as you said, they should be yes, absolutely.</p>
<p>John: Those three yeses de-risk and future-proof your organisation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, exactly. Well, thanks a lot for putting it in a very, very clear way for everybody who is listening to this. Well, thanks a lot for sharing all this super interesting about mobile driver licenses. And of course, I recommend, so we’ll put the link to the report, <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/download/pimdl-v1-final/">Kantara Initiative report</a> that John has co-authored and super interesting,</p>
<p>John: And a link to the workgroup, hopefully, because I invite anybody who is interested in this to join the workgroup because you can start to help shape the requirements for the standard to come.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, what is the name of the workgroup? What is the exact name?</p>
<p>John: <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/groups/pemc-wg/">The Privacy Enhancing Mobile Credentials</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. We will add the link as well. Fantastic. So, John, it was a pleasure talking with you. If there’s something else that you would like to tell or how people can get in touch with you.</p>
<p>John: Probably the simplest way is I’m @PrivacyCDN on both Twitter and LinkedIn, P-R- I-V-A-C-Y CDN. That’s a play on words because in Canada, CDN is sometimes used for Canadian. But in the rest of the world, it means Content Delivery Network, so I thought that was an interesting pun. Anyway, @PrivacyCDN on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/privacycdn/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&amp;originalSubdomain=ca">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivacyCDN">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, I didn’t know that’s CDN, so it’s good to know, thank you. Again, it was a pleasure talking with you, John, and all the best.</p>
<p>John: Take care, Oscar.</p>

<p>Between long hours at work and time spent on devices outside of work hours, digital interactions have become a dominant and permeating force in the lives of people all over the world. In 2020 and 2021, the global COVD-19 pandemic rewired consumers to be digital-first (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CpZP-avaaBZPAawyV07a_GWwFGOlGIiO/view?usp=sharing">Adobe</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this, organizations and businesses have become hyper-focused on boosting user experience (UX) to ensure that customers and employees can easily engage with all their digital properties, helping to support and drive business growth. Unfortunately, this also means that bad actors are also on the rise, and online threats are more prevalent than ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great UX is critical in this digital-first world but begs the question: is it possible to balance UX and security in a way that creates a smooth experience for the user and a secure environment for your organization? In this article, we will look at how identity security can balance UX and security throughout the user journey.</p>

  <p>When it comes to infrastructure, public clouds are the most popular choice these days, especially Amazon Web Services (AWS). If you are in one of those lucky or unlucky (depending on how you see it) teams running microservices, then you need a way to orchestrate their deployments. When it comes to orchestrating microservices, Kubernetes is the de-facto choice. Most public cloud providers also provide managed Kubernetes as a service; for example, Google provides Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Microsoft provides Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Amazon provides Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that deploying and managing microservices on the public cloud is easy; each cloud service comes with its own challenges and pain. This is especially true for Amazon EKS, which, in my opinion, is the most difficult Kubernetes service to use, but also one of the most flexible. This is because EKS consists of some clever orchestrations doing a complex dance on top of other AWS services like EC2, EBS, etc.</p>

<p>If you want to run a microservice stack on EKS, you will need to spend some extra time and effort setting it up and managing it. This is where infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> come in handy.</p>

<p>So here is what you will learn to do today:</p>

 
   Scaffold a Java microservice stack using JHipster, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud 
   Create an EKS cluster, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, and required Kubernetes add-ons using Terraform on AWS 
   Set up OIDC authentication for the microservice stack using Okta 
   Build and deploy the microservice stack to the cluster

 Why Terraform, why not CloudFormation? 

<p>At this point, the first question that might pop up in your mind would be, “Why not use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a>?”. It’s a good question; after all, CloudFormation is built by AWS and hence sounds like an excellent solution to manage AWS resources. But anyone who has tried both CloudFormation and Terraform will probably tell you to forget that CloudFormation even exists. I think CloudFormation is far more complex and less developer-friendly than Terraform. You also need to write a lot more boilerplate with CloudFormation in YAML or JSON. Yikes! And most importantly, Terraform is far more powerful and flexible than CloudFormation. It’s cross-platform, which means you can take care of all your infrastructure management needs on any platform with one tool.</p>

 Scaffold a Java microservice stack using JHipster 

<p>You need a microservice stack to deploy to the cluster. I’m using a microservice stack scaffolded for demo purposes using <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a>. You can use another microservice stack if you want. If you prefer using the same application as in this demo, then you can either scaffold it using JHipster <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/intro">JDL</a> or clone the sample repository from <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-k8s-eks-microservices-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Option 1: Scaffold the microservice stack using JHipster</p>

   <code>mkdir jhipster-microservice-stack
cd jhipster-microservice-stack
# download the JDL file.
jhipster download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-k8s-eks-microservices-example/main/apps.jdl
# Update the `dockerRepositoryName` property to use your Docker Repository URI/Name.
# scaffold the apps.
jhipster jdl apps.jdl
</code>   

<p>Option 2: Clone the sample repository</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jhipster-k8s-eks-microservices-example
</code>   

<p>In either case, remember to change the Docker repository name to match your Docker repository.</p>

<p>The JHipster scaffolded sample application has a gateway application, two microservices, and uses <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a> for service discovery and centralized configuration.</p>

 Create an EKS cluster using Terraform 

<p>Now let us move on to the important part of the tutorial. Creating an EKS cluster in AWS is not as straightforward as in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You need to also create a lot more resources for everything to work correctly without surprises. You will be using a bunch of Terraform providers to help with this, and you will also use some prebuilt Terraform modules like <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc">AWS VPC Terraform module</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints">Amazon EKS Blueprints for Terraform</a> to reduce the amount of boilerplate you need to write.</p>

<p>These are the AWS resources and VPC architecture you will create:</p>

<p></p>

 Build the Terraform configuration 

<p>First, make sure you use a specific version of the providers as different versions might use different attributes and features. Create a <code>versions.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>mkdir terraform
cd terraform
touch versions.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>terraform {
  required_version = "&gt;= 1.0.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "&gt;= 3.72"
    }
    kubernetes = {
      source  = "hashicorp/kubernetes"
      version = "&gt;= 2.10"
    }
    helm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/helm"
      version = "&gt;= 2.4.1"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "&gt;= 3.2.0"
    }
    nullres = {
      source  = "hashicorp/null"
      version = "&gt;= 3.1"
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you need to define variables and configure the providers. Create a <code>config.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch config.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code># ##  To save state in s3. Update to suit your needs
# backend "s3" {
#   bucket = "create-an-s3-bucket-and-provide-name-here"
#   region = local.region
#   key    = "eks-cluster-with-new-vpc/terraform.tfstate"
# }

variable "region" {
  default     = "eu-west-1"
  description = "AWS region"
}

resource "random_string" "suffix" {
  length  = 8
  special = false
}

data "aws_availability_zones" "available" {}

locals {
  name            = "okta-jhipster-eks-${random_string.suffix.result}"
  region          = var.region
  cluster_version = "1.22"
  instance_types  = ["t2.large"] # can be multiple, comma separated

  vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  azs      = slice(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names, 0, 3)

  tags = {
    Blueprint  = local.name
    GitHubRepo = "github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints"
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = local.region
}

# Kubernetes provider
# You should **not** schedule deployments and services in this workspace.
# This keeps workspaces modular (one for provision EKS, another for scheduling
# Kubernetes resources) as per best practices.
provider "kubernetes" {
  host                   = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_endpoint
  cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_certificate_authority_data)

  exec {
    api_version = "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
    command     = "aws"
    # This requires the awscli to be installed locally where Terraform is executed
    args = ["eks", "get-token", "--cluster-name", module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id]
  }
}

provider "helm" {
  kubernetes {
    host                   = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_endpoint
    cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_certificate_authority_data)

    exec {
      api_version = "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1"
      command     = "aws"
      # This requires the awscli to be installed locally where Terraform is executed
      args = ["eks", "get-token", "--cluster-name", module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id]
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>You can uncomment the <code>backend</code> section above to save state in S3 instead of your local filesystem. This is recommended for production setup so that everyone in a team has the same state. This file defines configurable and local variables used across the workspace and configures some of the providers used. The Kubernetes provider is included in this file so the EKS module can complete successfully. Otherwise, it throws an error when creating <code>kubernetes_config_map.aws_auth</code>. The helm provider is used to install Kubernetes add-ons to the cluster.</p>

 Build the VPC 

<p>Next up, you need a VPC, subnets, route tables, and other networking bits. You will use the <code>vpc</code> module from the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules"><code>terraform-aws-modules</code></a> repository. This module is a wrapper around the AWS VPC module. It makes it easier to configure VPCs and all the other required networking resources. Create a <code>vpc.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch vpc.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>#---------------------------------------------------------------
# VPC, Subnets, Internet gateway, Route tables, etc.
#---------------------------------------------------------------
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~&gt; 3.0"

  name = local.name
  cidr = local.vpc_cidr

  azs             = local.azs
  public_subnets  = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 8, k)]
  private_subnets = [for k, v in local.azs : cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 8, k + 10)]

  enable_nat_gateway   = true
  single_nat_gateway   = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true

  # Manage so we can name
  manage_default_network_acl    = true
  default_network_acl_tags      = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }
  manage_default_route_table    = true
  default_route_table_tags      = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }
  manage_default_security_group = true
  default_security_group_tags   = { Name = "${local.name}-default" }

  public_subnet_tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.name}" = "shared"
    "kubernetes.io/role/elb"              = 1
  }

  private_subnet_tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/cluster/${local.name}" = "shared"
    "kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb"     = 1
  }

  tags = local.tags
}
</code>   

<p>This will create:</p>

 
   A new VPC, three private subnets, and three public subnets, 
   Internet gateway and NAT gateway for the public subnets, 
   and AWS routes for the gateways, public/private route tables, and route table associations. 
 

 Build the EKS cluster 

<p>Now that you have the networking part done, you can build configurations for the EKS cluster and its add-ons. You will use the <code>eks_blueprints</code> module from <a href="https://aws-ia.github.io/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints/v4.0.9/"><code>terraform-aws-eks-blueprints</code></a>, which is a wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules"><code>terraform-aws-modules</code></a> and provides additional modules to configure EKS add-ons.</p>

<p>Create a <code>eks-cluster.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch eks-cluster.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>#---------------------------------------------------------------
# EKS cluster, worker nodes, security groups, IAM roles, K8s add-ons, etc.
#---------------------------------------------------------------
module "eks_blueprints" {
  source = "github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints?ref=v4.0.9"

  cluster_name    = local.name
  cluster_version = local.cluster_version

  vpc_id             = module.vpc.vpc_id
  private_subnet_ids = module.vpc.private_subnets

  managed_node_groups = {
    node = {
      node_group_name = "managed-ondemand"
      instance_types  = local.instance_types
      min_size        = 2
      subnet_ids      = module.vpc.private_subnets
    }
  }

  tags = local.tags
}

module "eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons" {
  source = "github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints//modules/kubernetes-addons?ref=v4.0.9"

  eks_cluster_id       = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id
  eks_cluster_endpoint = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_endpoint
  eks_oidc_provider    = module.eks_blueprints.oidc_provider
  eks_cluster_version  = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_version

  # EKS Managed Add-ons
  enable_amazon_eks_vpc_cni    = true
  enable_amazon_eks_coredns    = true
  enable_amazon_eks_kube_proxy = true

  # K8S Add-ons
  enable_aws_load_balancer_controller = true
  enable_metrics_server               = true
  enable_cluster_autoscaler           = true
  enable_aws_cloudwatch_metrics       = false

  tags = local.tags

}

# To update local kubeconfig with new cluster details
resource "null_resource" "kubeconfig" {
  depends_on = [module.eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons]
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws eks --region ${local.region}  update-kubeconfig --name $AWS_CLUSTER_NAME"
    environment = {
      AWS_CLUSTER_NAME = local.name
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>eks_blueprints</code> module definition creates:</p>

 
   EKS Cluster Control plane with one <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html">managed node group</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html">fargate profile</a>, 
   Cluster and node security groups and rules, IAM roles and policies required, 
   and AWS Key Management Service (KMS) configuration. 
 

<p>The <code>eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons</code> module definition creates:</p>

 
   Amazon EKS add-ons vpc-cni, CoreDNS, and kube-proxy, 
   AWS Load Balancer Controller that provisions an AWS Network Load Balancer for distributing traffic, 
   and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server">Metrics Server</a>, and Cluster Autoscaler for scaling your workloads. 
 

<p>The <code>null_resource</code> configuration updates your local kubeconfig with the new cluster details. It’s not a required step for provisioning but just a handy hack.</p>

<p>Finally, you can also define some outputs to be captured. Create a <code>outputs.tf</code> file:</p>

   <code>touch outputs.tf
</code>   

<p>Add the following to the file:</p>

   <code>output "vpc_private_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "VPC private subnet CIDR"
  value       = module.vpc.private_subnets_cidr_blocks
}

output "vpc_public_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "VPC public subnet CIDR"
  value       = module.vpc.public_subnets_cidr_blocks
}

output "vpc_cidr" {
  description = "VPC CIDR"
  value       = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block
}

output "eks_cluster_id" {
  description = "EKS cluster ID"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.eks_cluster_id
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroups" {
  description = "EKS managed node groups"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_groups
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_ids" {
  description = "EKS managed node group ids"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_groups_id
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_arns" {
  description = "EKS managed node group arns"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_group_arn
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_role_name" {
  description = "EKS managed node group role name"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_group_iam_role_names
}

output "eks_managed_nodegroup_status" {
  description = "EKS managed node group status"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.managed_node_groups_status
}

output "configure_kubectl" {
  description = "Configure kubectl: make sure you're logged in with the correct AWS profile and run the following command to update your kubeconfig"
  value       = module.eks_blueprints.configure_kubectl
}
</code>   

 Provision the cluster 

<p>Our Terraform definitions are ready. Now you can provision the cluster. First, initialize Terraform workspace and plan the changes:</p>

   <code># download modules and providers. Initialize state.
terraform init
# see a preview of what will be done
terraform plan
</code>   

<p>Review the plan and make sure everything is correct. Ensure you have configured your AWS CLI and IAM Authenticator to use the correct AWS account. If not, run the following:</p>

   <code># Visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials for creating access keys
aws configure
</code>   

<p>Now you can apply the changes:</p>

   <code>terraform apply
</code>   

<p>Confirm by typing <code>yes</code> when prompted. This will take a while (15-20 minutes), so sit back and have a coffee or contemplate what led you to this point in life. 😉</p>

<p>Once the EKS cluster is ready, you will see the output variables printed to the console.</p>

</code>   

<p>You should see the cluster details if you run <code>kdash</code> or <code>kubectl get nodes</code> commands.</p>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The EKS cluster defined here will not come under AWS free tier; hence, running this will cost money, so delete the cluster as soon as you finish the tutorial to keep the cost within a few dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

 Set up OIDC authentication using Okta 

<p>You can proceed to deploy the sample application. You could skip this step if you used a sample that does not use Okta or OIDC for authentication.</p>

<p>First, navigate to the store application folder.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Make sure to add the newly created <code>.okta.env</code> file to your <code>.gitignore</code> file so that you don’t accidentally expose your credentials to the public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Update <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code> with the OIDC configuration from the <code>.okta.env</code> file. The Spring Cloud Config server reads from this file and shares the values with the gateway and microservices.</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, configure the JHipster Registry to use OIDC for authentication. Modify <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> to enable the <code>oauth2</code> profile, which is preconfigured in the JHipster Registry application.</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

<p>The application is now ready.</p>

 Secure secrets 

<p>If you have noticed, you are setting secrets in plain text on the <code>application-configmap.yml</code> file, which is not ideal and is not a best practice for security. For the specific JHipster application, you can use the encrypt functionality provided by the JHipster Registry to encrypt the secrets. See <a>Encrypt Your Secrets with Spring Cloud Config</a> to learn how to do this. But that would also rely on a base64 encoded encryption key added as a Kubernetes Secret, which still can be decoded. The best way to do this would be to use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/">AWS Secrets Manager</a>, an external service like <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">HashiCorp Vault</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">Sealed Secrets</a>. To learn more about these methods see <a>Encrypt Your Kubernetes Secrets</a>.</p>

 Deploy the microservice stack 

<p>You are ready to deploy to our shiny new EKS cluster, but first, you need to build and push the Docker images to a container registry. You can use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)</a> or any other container registry.</p>

 Build the Docker images 

<p>You need to build Docker images for each app. This is specific to the JHipster application used in this tutorial which uses <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">Jib</a> to build the images. Make sure you are logged into Docker using <code>docker login</code>. Navigate to each app folder (store, invoice, product) and run the following command:</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-repo-uri-or-name&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;
</code>   

<p>Image names should be <code>store</code>, <code>invoice</code>, and <code>product</code>.</p>

 Deploy the applications to EKS 

<p>Start the deployment using the handy script provided by JHipster. You could also manually apply deployments using <code>kubectl apply -f &lt;file&gt;</code> commands.</p>

   <code>cd kubernetes
./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>You can also run the following command to see the status of the deployments:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n jhipster
</code>   

<p>View the registry using port-forwarding as follows, and you will be able to access the application at <code>http://localhost:8761</code>.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n jhipster 8761
</code>   

<p>You can access the gateway application using port-forwarding as follows, and you will be able to access the application at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/store -n jhipster 8080
</code>   

<p>Or, you can access the application via the load balancer exposed. Find the external IP of the <code>store</code> service by navigating to the service tab in KDash or by running the following:</p>

   <code>kubectl get svc store -n jhipster
</code>   

<p>Navigate to the Okta Admin Console and go to Applications &gt; Applications from left-hand navigation. Find the application you created earlier with <code>okta apps create jhipster</code> and add the external IP from <code>kubectl get svc</code> command to the Sign-in redirect URIs and Sign-out redirect URIs. Make sure to use the same paths as the current <code>localhost</code> entries.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to visit the external IP of the <code>store</code> service on port 8080 and see the application, and you should be able to log in using your Okta credentials.</p>

 Tear down the cluster with Terraform 

<p>Once you are done with the tutorial, you can delete the cluster and all the resources created using Terraform by running the following commands:</p>

   <code>cd terraform
# The commands below might take a while to finish.
terraform destroy -target="module.eks_blueprints_kubernetes_addons" -auto-approve
# If deleting VPC fails, then manually delete the load balancers and security groups
# for the load balancer associated with the VPC from AWS EC2 console and try again.
terraform destroy -target="module.eks_blueprints" -auto-approve
terraform destroy -target="module.vpc" -auto-approve
# cleanup anything left over.
terraform destroy -auto-approve
</code>

<p>SOC 2 compliance should be at the top of the list for all technology services, software-as-a-service organizations, and service providers managing or storing customer data in the cloud.</p>
<p>What is SOC 2? SOC 2 is a compliance standard that outlines how organizations must handle customer data. The outline is based on the five trust services criteria developed by the American Institute of CPAs.</p>
 What Is SOC 2 and How Does It Apply to Enterprises? 
<p>Service organization control reports are specialized, non mandatory audits that organizations undergo to demonstrate basic capabilities in areas like finance and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Conceived of and maintained by the American Institute of Certified Professional Accountants , SOC standards provide private businesses with a framework to assess their operational capabilities, demonstrate security and privacy controls around sensitive data, and provide clients with assurance that the organization has critical procedures and policies for that data. SOC 2 audits are provided by CPAs authorized by the AICPA to conduct such audits, and the report will contain several elements, most notably an overall opinion letter from the auditor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three different types of SOC reports:</p>
 
 SOC 1: These reports describe the results of audits of an organization’s financial reporting controls. Financial data is often subject to different requirements concerning transparency, security, and accountability, and SOC 1 describes the company’s ability to meet those requirements. 
 SOC 2: These reports, by far the most common, cover the security and processing capabilities of an organization’s operations. This compliance framework helps a company show that protecting data is a top priority.&nbsp; 
 SOC 3: SOC 3 reports are truncated versions of their SOC 2 counterparts. SOC 2 reports contain several in-depth sections covering the results of an audit and the controls implemented by the organization and often remain private except for contractual reasons. SOC 3, however, can provide a public-facing report to help these organizations advertise their compliance.&nbsp; 
 
 Types and Benefits of SOC 2 
<p>SOC 2 is a solid and recognizable way to signal to potential clients and partners that your organization takes privacy, security and stability seriously–at least enough to undergo rigorous annual audits to ensure that you address those concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOC 2 reports are additionally broken down into two different types:</p>
 
 SOC 2 Type I: A Type I report provides an audit of the organization’s capabilities at a specific point and time.&nbsp; 
 SOC 2 Type II: A Type II report provides the same audit, only extended to ascertain the organization’s continued adherence to SOC 2 standards over time—usually six months. 
 
<p>An additional and relatively newer SOC audit called SOC for Cybersecurity covers an organization’s cybersecurity risk management capabilities and controls.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Five Trust Services Criteria of SOC 2? 
<p>The foundation of SOC 2 audits are the five trust services criteria. These criteria represent five different categories by which organizations are audited. When a CPA audits a business, they do so by following the criteria of the services categories listed here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly, no business is required to undergo the entire slate of criteria; they only need to select ones based on their needs and the data they handle. The exception to this rule is that all organizations committing to a SOC 2 audit must include security as one of their criteria, making the SOC 2 security audit the most widespread.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The five trust services criteria are as follows:</p>
 
 Security: The common criteria, security covers how the organization protects information. This criterion includes controls like firewalls, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/secure-authentication/">secure authentication</a> and authorization controls, and anti-malware tools.  
 Availability:&nbsp;This criterion covers how readily an organization can access and use data. While not quite intuitive for an audit, it’s critical for a business to maintain a suitable network and IT infrastructure to ensure that the data they collect and use is, in fact, usable. 
 
<p>This criterion can include ascertaining if data is siloed in different systems or if internal network connections underperform. Finally, functions like disaster recovery and performance monitoring fall under this category.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Processing Integrity: This category focuses on the ability of policies, procedures, and systems to ensure that data is processed correctly, predictably, and error free. The general idea is that a system should be able to take information and provide reliable results as expected by design and do so without corrupting or deleting that data during the process.&nbsp; 
 Confidentiality: Confidentiality refers to protecting data marked as “confidential” as part of a business or financial agreement. This includes specific access and authorization controls around confidential data. Identity and access management and encryption are standard controls in this category.&nbsp; 
 Privacy: Privacy is much like confidentiality but refers explicitly to protecting personally identifiable information. This criterion can also include encryption and IAM, in addition to nontechnical items like privacy policies and consent management tools. 
 
<p>Some controls may span over multiple categories. For example, data encryption is a security control that also refers to the processing and transmission of confidential information and PII. The critical thing to remember&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Common Controls for SOC 2? 
<p>To help organizations prepare for and manage SOC 2 compliance, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission provides a common framework. COSO is a consortium of private sector organizations that provide leadership and frameworks for security and privacy controls in the financial and corporate sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The framework includes a few categories of common internal controls:</p>
 
 Control Environment: The control environment addresses the delimited control system around security and compliance infrastructure. Any processes, positions, delineation of duties, and management roles all play a part in this controlled environment.&nbsp; 
 Risk Assessment: Many compliance frameworks and regulations turn to risk as a guideline for more extensive cybersecurity decision-making. Implementing risk management strategies will help you take a broad view of your organization.&nbsp; 
 Control Activities: Internal policies and procedures, risk minimization protocols, security management plans, project life cycle documents, or data governance approaches all fall under control activities that should be assessed prior to an audit.&nbsp; 
 Information and Communication: This refers to the clear, reliable, and regular communication of data, policies, expectations, and organizational goals. Clear and regular communication is the cornerstone of successful compliance.&nbsp; 
 Monitoring: No system stays compliant forever—that’s why most SOC 2 audits cover six months and occur annually. Continuous monitoring can help you understand the state of controls and procedures, evaluate threats and challenges, and make changes or optimizations.&nbsp; 
 
 Secure and Protect Data for SOC 2 with 1Kosmos 
<p>Regardless of what type of audit you undertake, SOC 2 will require some minimum controls, namely two-factor or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a>. However, the more sensitive your data and the more reliant you are on security to protect that data, you’ll most likely want to go above and beyond simple MFA implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter 1Kosmos BlockID. With BlockID, you get the right combination of advanced authentication and biometrics (including IAL-compliant identity proofing and liveness testing), decentralized identity storage, and passwordless access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos features include the following:</p>
 
 Identity Proofing:&nbsp; BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Identity-Based Authentication:&nbsp; We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out of the box integrations or via API/SDK.&nbsp; 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user.&nbsp;

				  Break and rebuild your decentralized identity products and services with Indicio’s new TempNet  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:lynn@indicio.tech">Lynn Bendixsen</a></p>
<p>When we talk about decentralized identity solutions, we usually talk about public ledgers for anchoring and verifying credentials. But there are use cases where the best solution is a private network. This type of distributed ledger network requires a certain level of permission to write to or even to read from.</p>
<p>A private network allows companies and organizations with shared or specific interests to provide verifiable information only to their customers or stakeholders. You could use a private network to manage a supply chain, a specific geographic location, or—as with the new Indicio TempNet—do critical internal product testing.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://indicio.tech/private-networks/">Indicio Private Networks</a>, you have a quick and hassle-free way to spin up your own networks; and now with our latest TempNet offering, you have access to a&nbsp;&nbsp; production-ready, lab environment for penetration testing, performance testing fixes, and private demos.</p>
<p>This is perfect for teams who want to test their mission-critical products or services to breaking point before public deployment. The key feature of Indicio’s Private Networks is that we take the responsibility for hosting, maintaining and updating these networks. Test it, break it, record it, demo with it, then when you’re done, you walk away and leave us to clean it up and decommission it.</p>
<p>But… maybe you want to keep your new TempNet network? No problem. We’ll switch it over to one of Indicio’s Private Network plans so you get continued maintenance, upgrades, and the tools you need to keep it running in perpetuity.</p>
<p>With years of experience in decentralized network development and management, our expert staff can build you a customized private network that meets your business or organizational needs—and we can do it in days, not weeks.

 The regulatory landscape remains heated, with authorities from many countries calling for regulating virtual&nbsp;assets <p>Welcome to Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. This week, too, the regulatory landscape remains heated, with authorities from many countries calling for regulating virtual assets. Without further ado, let’s dive straight into it. We hope you enjoy&nbsp;it.</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share.</p> Travel Rule Compliance to Become Mandatory in the UK From 23rd September 2023 <p>Amid concerns around sanctioned individuals &amp; entities using digital assets to bypass sanctions, the United Kingdom recently introduced “Amendments to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 Statutory Instrument 2022.”</p><p>The recent amendment proposal is aimed at strengthening the country’s Anti-Money Laundering/ Counter Financing of Terrorism framework. The UK government believes that although the implementation of the Travel Rule will increase the cost of compliance for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), it will be beneficial for the crypto industry in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>The government has also agreed to provide a grace period for ease of compliance. Hence, the UK-based VASPs will now have until 22nd September 2023 to prepare for the Travel Rule compliance. If the amendment receives green light from the legislature, complying with the Travel Rule will become mandatory from 23rd September 2023.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/travel-rule-will-be-mandatory-in-the-uk-by-23-september-2023-2bfb3c4d1cde?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------">Click here</a> to read more about the UK government’s recent amendment proposal.</p> South Korean Government Asks Country’s Crypto Industry for Suggestions to Further Strengthen the Digital Asset Regulations <p>The Terra-Luna debacle continues to be a hot topic among the South Korean government and authorities. Recently, a Korean media report mentioned that the ruling party in South Korea has called for suggestions from the crypto industry to prevent Terra-Luna-like instances in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>As per the report, the South Korean government met industry representatives for consultation on Monday. And it was during the consultation, the officials and lawmakers asked industry players to come up with innovative suggestions to help ensure the safety of the country’s crypto industry.</p><p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korean-government-calls-for-voluntary-regulations-from-crypto-industry/">Click here</a> to read more about&nbsp;it.</p> Kazakhstan to Allow Authorized Virtual Asset Service Providers to Open Local Banking&nbsp;Accounts <p>The government of Kazakhstan is taking multiple initiatives to become a regional hub for the digital assets industry. Recently, the country’s Ministry of Digital Development adopted the framework that will allow Astana International Financial Center-registered VASPs to open accounts and avail of various financial services from local tier-II&nbsp;banks.</p><p>This positive news comes after the country’s central bank, the National Bank of Kazakhstan, said that the talk around legalizing the virtual asset industry is not something they are considering now. That said, the financial regulator is keeping an eye on the nascent&nbsp;sector.</p><p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kazakhstan-allows-registered-crypto-exchanges-to-open-accounts-at-local-banks/">Click here</a> to read more about&nbsp;it.</p> India’s Central Bank Governor Calls for Global Coordination for Crypto Regulations <p>While speaking at the Financial Express-organized Modern BFSI Summit on June 17, Shaktikanta Das, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said that global coordination is necessary for digital asset regulations.</p><p>Das also gave the example of decentralized finance (DeFi) to explain why global regulators should come together and cooperate to regulate virtual assets. He said that DeFi’s “No-intermediary Approach” presents a unique challenge to regulators, which can only be tackled through a “globally-coordinated regulatory and inter-regulatory coordination.”</p><p><a href="https://inc42.com/buzz/blockchain-technology-transcends-boundaries-need-global-regulations-rbi-governor/">Click here</a> to read more about the RBI governor’s recent statement on the need for global cooperation for digital asset regulation.</p><p>____________</p><p>With the global crypto market tumbling, regulators are demanding international coordination for regulating the industry. Thus, sooner or later, regulators will come together and work on a global regulatory framework for digital assets. In the meantime, the virtual asset service providers should begin complying with local and international digital assets regulations.</p><p>Speaking of international digital asset regulations, VASPs must first comply with the FATF’s Travel Rule. So, from where should VASPs start? Well, first, they should zero in on a Travel Rule Service Provider (TRSP), and no solution’s better than Veriscope.

			<p>Product Focus</p>
 The Sound of the ERC3643 Community 
<p>When Tokeny’s team designed the ERC3643, one of our key objectives was to develop a versatile open source standard that can be implemented in a variety of use cases, no matter the industry. At its core, it brings control and direct ownership at the token level while leveraging public blockchains. Since then, many applications – mostly in finance (securities, stablecoins, reward programs, etc.) – were built with this set of smart contracts.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in June 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>It is also interesting to see that a community of developers is now using this framework to improve or create different implementations of the standard. On that note, we recently had the opportunity to mentor the team at Nusic, a DeFi startup creating groundbreaking work in the music industry. In brief, <a href="https://nusic.fm/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM#/">Nusic</a>&nbsp;provides a decentralized infrastructure for music creators, giving them the opportunity to unlock new streams of revenue and ultimately increase monetization through NFT bonds.</p>
 Monetization Made Compliant with ERC3643-based Permissioned NFTs 
<p>In 2021, Nusic won the Grand Prize at the&nbsp;<a href="https://chain.link/hackathon/hackathon-2021-fall?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM">Chainlink Fall Hackathon</a>, yet even though the project received critical acclaim from the DeFi ecosystem, they also received much blowback from potential investors regarding their proposed NFT bonds. It turns out that, after taking the Howey Test (which classifies whether or not transactions are considered investment contracts),&nbsp;their NFTs actually qualify as financial instruments, rather than utility tokens.</p>
<p>As their digital assets were now deemed securities, Nusic decided to look into permissioned tokens and the possibility of creating permissioned NFTs as their product. They eventually stumbled upon the ERC3643 standard and reached out to us on how they could make this happen. After some passionate discussions with the Nusic team about their intention to make a non-fungible version of the ERC3643, we decided to assist them in adopting, modifying, and implementing this standard for their music NFTs to meet their needs.</p>
<p>For this to work, we had to&nbsp;transpose the onchain permissioning layer of ERC3643 to NFTs&nbsp;which, by default, ensures compliant transfers and eligibility of each single token owner, thanks to the use of digital identities (<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM">ONCHAINID.com</a>). It was decided to name this new version of the standard&nbsp;ERC3643N&nbsp;(“N” for non-fungible).&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nusic-fm/nusic-permissioned-token?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM">It is now published and available for the community</a>.</p>
<p>Musicians can now directly monetize their work through the Nusic application in an innovative, fully decentralized, and compliant way.</p>
<p>Their work on the ERC3643N made Nusic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kLXEqQ6tL0&amp;utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rStajvtW6BK_tHrpTHbM0ONPrasZzhTFfpR23Mh7aqGgtky5fUKwdn87DmjKIfCJ1DslM">winners</a>&nbsp;of another Chainlink Hackathon, taking home two prizes (in the NFTs &amp; Gaming, and Filecoin categories) from this year’s Spring Edition.</p>
 ERC3643 Sees Widespread Adoption as Web3 Users Search for Additional Safety and Security 
<p>We are very happy with the work accomplished with Nusic and extremely proud that the ERC3643 is spearheading itself as an easily accessible market solution across different industries using blockchain. As word continues to spread, it is becoming apparent that market standard permissioned tokens will be used in broader scenarios more often than before. We are looking forward to seeing more innovative use cases using this solution.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we would like to congratulate Nusic again on their achievements. The success from our work together is music to our ears!</p>

Then, it will cover each of the following scenarios as worked examples.</p>  One LP, smaller stake, hits the APY cap of&nbsp;125%  One LP, larger stake, hits the weekly OCEAN_budget cap  Two LPs, same data consume volume (DCV), same&nbsp;returns  Two LPs, different data consume volume, different returns  <p>This post is not intended to cover all possible scenarios. Rather, it gives a few simple scenarios and shows a path by which the reader may do their own reasoning and logic in other scenarios.</p><p>Based on learnings, we can expect evolution of the DF Rewards Formula in future DF rounds DF2, DF3,&nbsp;etc.</p> Reward Function&nbsp;Formula <p>Here’s the Reward Function formula for DF1. The post <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-is-launching-f633532d831c">Ocean Data Farming is Launching</a> explains its details more, as well as the specific meaning of each&nbsp;term.</p><p>RFᵢⱼ = stakeᵢⱼ * DCVⱼ = (stake of LP i on pool j) * (DCV on pool&nbsp;j)</p><p>RFₜₒₜₐₗ = sum across all&nbsp;RFᵢⱼ</p><p>Pro-rata RF for LP i and pool j: RFᵢⱼ_ₙₒᵣₘ = RFᵢⱼ /&nbsp;RFₜₒₜₐₗ</p><p>Subject to APY &lt;= 125% per LP per pool. An annual percent yield (APY) of 125% means a weekly percent yield (WPY) of 1.57171%.</p> Scenario 1 <p>Setup:</p>  1 pool  1 LP (staker), of 100K&nbsp;OCEAN  1 consume. Price on consume was 1.0 OCEAN / datatoken  10K OCEAN rewarded (= weekly budget for DF alpha&nbsp;phase)  <p>Q: How much does the LP earn in one week? What’s the&nbsp;APY?</p><p>First, calculate the pro-rata RF value for the&nbsp;LP:</p>  LP 0’s stake in pool 0 (i=0, j=0): stake₀,₀ = 100K&nbsp;OCEAN  Data consume volume for pool 0 (j=0): DCV₀ = 1 consume * (1 OCEAN / datatoken) = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  Reward function value for LP 0 on pool 0 (i=0, j=0): RF₀,₀ = stake₀,₀ * DCV₀ = 100K * 1 =&nbsp;100K  RFₜₒₜₐₗ = sum across all LPs and pools = RF₀,₀ =&nbsp;100K  RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ = RF₀,₀ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 100K / 100K = 1.0. The value of 1.0 means that this LP gets all the&nbsp;reward.  <p>Now, calculate the rewards going to the&nbsp;LP:</p>  OCEAN_budget = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  total_OCEAN_rewards = min(OCEAN_budget, total_staked * WPY) = min(10K, 100K * 0.015717) = min(10K, 1571.7)= 1571.7&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 0’s rewards (i=0): rewards₀ = RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 1.0 * 1571.7 = 1571.7 OCEAN. That is, LP 0 gets all the rewards because they’re the only&nbsp;LP.  <p>Finally, calculate APY:</p>  LP 0’s weekly percent yield: WPY₀ = rewards₀ / stake₀,₀ = 1571.7 / 100K = 0.015717 =&nbsp;1.5717%  LP’s 0’s annual percent yield: APY₀ = (1 + WPY₀)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.015717)⁵² — 1.0 = 1.25 = 125%. This is the predicted yield for the year, if every week had the given WPY and it compounded.  We can confirm APY this by observing that total_OCEAN_rewards calculated value was bounded by the APY term (total_staked * WPY), not the budget term (OCEAN_budget).  <p>Discussion: APY was maxed out to 125% because stake was sufficiently low.</p><p>Summary: LP’s rewards were 1571.7 OCEAN, and APY was&nbsp;125%</p> Scenario 2 <p>Setup:</p><p>The setup is like scenario 1 but stake = 1M OCEAN (not 1000 OCEAN). That&nbsp;is:</p>  1 pool  1 LP (staker), of 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  1 consume. Price on consume was 1.0 OCEAN / datatoken  10K OCEAN&nbsp;rewarded  <p>Below, bold = different than scenario&nbsp;1.</p><p>Q: How much does the staker earn in one week? What’s&nbsp;APY?</p><p>First, calculate the pro-rata RF value for the&nbsp;LP:</p>  stake₀,₀ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₀ = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀ = stake₀,₀ * DCV₀ = 1M * 1 =&nbsp;1M  RFₜₒₜₐₗ = RF₀,₀ =&nbsp;1M  RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ = RF₀,₀ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 1M/1M =&nbsp;1.0  <p>Now, calculate the rewards going to the&nbsp;LP:</p>  OCEAN_budget = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  total_OCEAN_rewards = min(OCEAN_budget, total_staked * WPY) = min(10K, 1M * 0.0157171) = min(10K, 15717.1) = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 0’s rewards: rewards₀ = RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 1.0 * 10K = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Finally, calculate APY:</p>  WPY₀ = rewards₀ / stake₀,₀ =10K / 1M = 0.01 =&nbsp;1.0%  APY₀ = (1 + WPY₀)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.01)⁵² — 1.0 = 0.678 =&nbsp;67.8%.  <p>Discussion:</p>  In scenario 1, reward was bounded by the APY, so we saw (a) max APY and (b) rewards given was less than the weekly&nbsp;budget.  Here, in scenario 2, reward was bounded by the weekly budget, so we saw (a) APY less than max (b) rewards hitting their cap of the weekly&nbsp;budget.  <p>Summary: LP’s rewards were 10K OCEAN, and APY was&nbsp;67.8%</p> Scenario 3 <p>Setup:</p><p>This is a bit like scenario 2 but with two pools, and two LPs, each with equal stake and consume volume. That&nbsp;is:</p>  LP 0 stakes 1M OCEAN into pool 0. Pool 0 has 1 consume, price 1.0&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 1 stakes 1M OCEAN into pool 1. Pool 1 has 1 consume, price 1.0&nbsp;OCEAN  10K OCEAN&nbsp;rewarded  <p>Below, bold = different than scenario&nbsp;2.</p><p>Q: How much does the staker earn in one week? What’s&nbsp;APY?</p><p>First, calculate the pro-rata RF value for the&nbsp;LP:</p>  stake₀,₀ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  stake₁,₁ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₀ = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₁ = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀ = stake₀,₀ * DCV₀ = 1M * 1 =&nbsp;1M  RF₁,₁ = stake₁,₁ * DCV₁ = 1M * 1 =&nbsp;1M  RFₜₒₜₐₗ = RF₀,₀ + RF₁,₁ = 1M + 1M = 2M&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ = RF₀,₀ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 1M/2M =&nbsp;0.5  RF₁,₁_ₙₒᵣₘ = RFi₁,₁ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 1M/2M =&nbsp;0.5  <p>Now, calculate the rewards going to the&nbsp;LP:</p>  OCEAN_budget = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  total_OCEAN_rewards = min(OCEAN_budget, total_staked * WPY) = min(10K, 2M * 0.0157171) = min(10K, 31434.2) = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 0’s rewards: rewards₀ = RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 0.5 * 10K = 5K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 1’s rewards: rewards₁ = RF₁,₁_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 0.5 * 10K = 5K&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Finally, calculate APY:</p>  WPY₀ = rewards₀ / stake₀,₀ = 5K / 1M = 0.005 =&nbsp;0.5%  WPY₁ = rewards₁ / stake₁,₁ = 5K / 1M = 0.005 =&nbsp;0.5%  APY₀ = APY₁ = (1 + WPY)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.005)⁵² — 1.0 = 0.296 =&nbsp;29.6%  <p>Discussion: this is a simple scenario of two identical LPs getting identical rewards</p><p>Summary: each LP had 5K OCEAN rewards, and APY of&nbsp;29.6%</p> Scenario 4 <p>Setup:</p><p>This is like scenario 3, but pool 1 has 9x more consumes. That&nbsp;is:</p>  LP 0 stakes 1M OCEAN into pool 0. Pool 0 has 1 consume, price 1.0&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 1 stakes 1M OCEAN into pool 1. Pool 1 has 9 consumes, price 1.0&nbsp;OCEAN  10K OCEAN&nbsp;rewarded  <p>Q: How much does the staker earn in one week? What’s&nbsp;APY?</p><p>First, calculate the pro-rata RF value for the&nbsp;LP:</p>  stake₀,₀ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  stake₁,₁ = 1M&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₀ = 1 consume * (1 OCEAN / datatoken) = 1&nbsp;OCEAN  DCV₁ = 9 consumes * (1 OCEAN / datatoken) = 9&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀ = stake₀,₀ * DCV₀ = 1M * 1 =&nbsp;1M  RF₁,₁ = stake₁,₁ * DCV₁ = 1M * 9 =&nbsp;9M  RFₜₒₜₐₗ = RF₀,₀ + RF₁,₁ = 1M + 9M = 10M&nbsp;OCEAN  RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ = RF₀,₀ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 1M/10M =&nbsp;0.1  RF₁,₁_ₙₒᵣₘ = RFi₁,₁ / RFₜₒₜₐₗ = 9M/10M =&nbsp;0.9  <p>Now, calculate the rewards going to the&nbsp;LP:</p>  OCEAN_budget = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  total_OCEAN_rewards = min(OCEAN_budget, total_staked * WPY) = min(10K, 10M * 0.0157171) = min(10K, 157171) = 10K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 0’s rewards: rewards₀ = RF₀,₀_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 0.1 *10K = 1K&nbsp;OCEAN  LP 1’s rewards: rewards₁ = RF₁,₁_ₙₒᵣₘ * total_OCEAN_rewards = 0.9 *10K = 9K&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Finally, calculate APY:</p>  WPY₀ = rewards₀ / stake₀,₀ = 1K / 1M = 0.001 =&nbsp;0.1%  WPY₁ = rewards₁ / stake₁,₁ = 9K / 1M = 0.009 =&nbsp;0.9%  APY₀ = (1 + WPY₀)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.001)⁵² — 1.0 = 0.296 = 0.0533 =&nbsp;5.33%  APY₁ = (1 + WPY₁)⁵² — 1.0 = (1 + 0.009)⁵² — 1.0 = 0.5934 =&nbsp;59.34%  <p>Discussion: With everything identical except 9x DCV, LP 1 gets 9x the rewards of LP 0. As a staker, it really matters where you&nbsp;stake!</p><p>Summary: LP 0 had 1K OCEAN rewards and APY of 5.33%. LP 1 had 9K OCEAN rewards and APY of&nbsp;59.34%.</p> Conclusion <p>This post described worked examples to help stakers understand DF earnings in&nbsp;DF1.</p><p>The first two scenarios had just one LP (on one pool). Scenario 1 showed how APY could be the bounding factor, and scenario 2 showed how OCEAN_budget could&nbsp;be.</p><p>The next two scenarios had two LPs, each on its own pool, with identical stake. Scenario 3 had identical DCV, leading to identical reward for each LP. In scenario 4, one pool had 9x the DCV which led to 9x the&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Based on learnings, we can expect evolution of the DF Rewards Formula and related settings in future DF rounds DF2, DF3,&nbsp;etc.</p>Happy farming!

<p>Today, we are announcing the deprecation of support for Bloom Vault in the latest version of our Affinidi&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>This blog outlines the updates in the new versions of Affinidi stack and the required steps developers should take to avoid any disruptions in our SDK’s functionality.</p><p>What’s new in Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 and&nbsp;above?</p><p>At a glance, here’s what changes from Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 and&nbsp;above.</p>  Migrating from Bloom Vault to Affinidi Vault for improved performance  Server-side search by credential Id  Server-side search by credential types  <p>Read on to know why we are migrating to Affinidi Vault, what’s in it for you, and what steps you must&nbsp;take.</p><p>What are we changing?</p><p>The earlier versions of Affinidi SDK (below v6) use Bloom Vault as the end-to-end provider-agnostic storage. Undoubtedly, this has helped our customers to securely store verifiable credentials when using Affinidi’s open-source SDK. But starting from Affinidi SDK v6.0.4, we are migrating from Bloom Vault to our in-house built Affinidi&nbsp;Vault.</p><p>Why are we changing&nbsp;it?</p><p>It is our goal at Affinidi to provide an easy-to-use, secure, reliable, and high-performing set of functionalities within our Affinidi SDK. As a part of our continuous performance improvement activities, the engineering team has identified a need to replace the Bloom Vault with something that provides better performance and more advanced functionality. Thus, we have implemented Affinidi Vault as a replacement for Bloom within our&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>If you’re wondering why, here’s a comparison chart of the performance of Bloom vault vs Affinidi&nbsp;vault.</p><p>Comparison of vault performance</p><p>As you can see, there is a huge time-saving by switching to the Affinidi Vault, and this is why we made the&nbsp;change.</p><p>Why should you&nbsp;upgrade?</p><p>If you are using the earlier Affinidi SDK versions (lower than v6), your application won’t support the Affinidi Vault, and hence we can’t migrate you out of the Bloom&nbsp;Vault.</p><p>From Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 onwards, we have introduced an automatic migration trigger to the Affinidi Vault and that is why we ask you to upgrade to that version or above. Otherwise, your credentials will never be migrated and will eventually be wiped from the Bloom&nbsp;vault.</p><p>Please note that this migration will NOT impact the SDK performance negatively. On the contrary, if you have more than 100 credentials in Bloom Vault, you’re sure to see a big jump in performance after the migration.</p><p>Action points for&nbsp;you</p>  Update your services to use Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 or&nbsp;above.  Please pay attention to the changelog while upgrading the SDK version as some methods may be changed or deprecated.  <p>How to upgrade to the latest version of Affinidi&nbsp;SDK?</p><p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">GitHub</a> and upgrade to version v6.0.4 or&nbsp;above.</p><p>When you send your first API request to get all the credentials using the new SDK, our system will start the asynchronous migration of your data from Bloom to the Affinidi Vault. No more action is required from&nbsp;you.</p><p>Once the migration is complete, your services will automatically start using only Affinidi Vault for both the write and read operations.</p><p>What is the timeline for this&nbsp;upgrade?</p><p>Starting from 8th July 2022, we will block writes to the Bloom Vault. All users must update their services to use the Affinidi SDK v6.0.4 or above by then. From 25th July 2022, we will block both reads and writes to Bloom Vault and depreciate support for the&nbsp;same.</p><p>For further questions/doubts, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:developers@affinidi.com">developers@affinidi.com,</a> or drop us a note on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/affinityproject/affinidi-core-sdk">Visit GitHub</a> to download Affinidi SDK&nbsp;v6.0.4.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/upgrade-to-the-latest-affinidi-sdk-version-for-improved-performance-81e7d0cc7334">Upgrade to the Latest Affinidi SDK Version for Improved Performance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				<p>Vortrag von Dominik Deimel auf dem bitkom eIDAS Summit 2022 online verfügbar. <br></p><p>Flexibel gestaltbare Ecosysteme unter Einsatz von Komponenten- Technologie eröffnen zahlreiche neue Geschäftsmodelle. Warum das so ist, führte Dominik Deimel in seinem Vortrag auf dem eIDAS Summit 2022 des bitkom aus.</p><p>Mobile Lösungen wie Identity Wallets werden von der EU gefordert und ersetzen veraltete Kartentechnologie in vielen Lebensbereichen. Denn Karten, Schlüssel und herkömmliche Token sind teuer im Betrieb, leicht manipulierbar und wenig komfortabel im Handling. Hier punktet das mobile Endgerät mit durchgehend digitalen Möglichkeiten, und zwar sowohl für den On- als auch den Offline-Use. Voraussetzungen sind entsprechende umfassende mobile Sicherheitstechnologie und ein flexibel gestaltbarer, vertrauenswürdiger Attribute-Austausch, dementsprechend wie es der jeweilige Service im Use Case benötigt. Hier ist bei den rein formalen Identitäts-Attributen wie Name oder Alter noch lange nicht Schluss.</p><p>Im Vortrag führt Dominik Deimel aus, worauf es im Zusammenspiel der Akteure und in der technischen Architektur von Wallets ankommt und wo Vorteile und Chancen liegen.</p><p></p><p>#vortrag #digitalIdentity #eIDAS #comuny #souvereignIdentity #wallet #ecosystem #bitkom #eIDAS22 #digitaleGeschäftsmodelle<br></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concern regarding downtime is one of the major reasons that companies may be hesitant about implementing changes to their applications and services, including minor updates. Should you keep a current/old version so that users won’t lose access, or should you launch the new version but risk pushing users away to the competition while you make updates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where zero downtime deployment comes in. Companies can launch new versions of their applications and services without needing to have any downtime during the process.</p>

 Monthly Roundup for April&nbsp;2022 <p>Happy #HoloMonday everyone! Thanks for taking the time to click in to the latest Monthly Roundup. We are already a quarter through the year, and both the Holo and Holochain teams are busy working hard. Check out exactly what we’ve been doing in the roundup&nbsp;below.</p> 3 Milestones in 3 Months: Holo&nbsp;Update <p>On the Holo build out we’re really pleased with the fact that we <a href="https://press.holo.host/212551-holochain-roadmap-holo-milestones">passed 3 milestones in (less than) three months</a> over the holidays. Here is a short description of those milestones as they appear on our <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">roadmap</a>, and why they matter. Below is a brief summary of each of the Milestones:</p>  Elemental Chat in Public&nbsp;Alpha  HoloFuel Transactions Pre-release UX/UI  HoloPort Registration Usability   Check out the *New* Holochain Roadmap <p>As Holo announced in their <a href="https://press.holo.host/212551-holochain-roadmap-holo-milestones">recent update</a>, Holochain now has a <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">public roadmap</a>. I’m thoroughly excited about this, and I sincerely hope it helps you, dear hApp developers, get an idea of where we’re heading — and plan your development trajectory accordingly.</p><p>There are a lot of milestones planned, including ephemeral storage (non-permanent DHT data) and pub/sub (subscribe to DHT change events), but I want to call out one in particular that’s simultaneously the least and most interesting: Stable Validation.</p> Approaching Longitudinal hApp&nbsp;Testing <p>We’re getting close to the <a href="https://press.holo.host/213339-today-s-update-april-15th">release of our next Holo milestone,</a> Longitudinal hApp Testing. Elemental Chat will be tested on the Holo infrastructure with no pre-determined limit for how long we keep it available. This is a longevity test primarily for use by our biz dev team and other partners building hApps and to gather data about use over time. Following the initial release, additional hApps will be added to the infrastructure. This release sets us up for future publishing milestones where we’ll work with early adopter app developers who want to publish their hApps in a live test environment. We’ve recently updated Elemental Chat to a recent version of Holochain and we’re doing regression testing for minor&nbsp;changes.</p> Regular Holo Dev Updates on&nbsp;Twitter <p>If you are curious about the — hot from the press dev updates — those can be found on Holo&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_">Twitter.</a></p> Dev Pulse&nbsp;117 <p>This is a very short Dev Pulse; but Paul covers the changes in the Holochain release earlier in April. Good news, links have gotten some more changes (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1298">#1298</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1308">#1308</a>), bringing us closer to the Holochain Resource Locators <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">milestone</a>. Now you can use headers as your link base or target, without having to re-type them to entry hashes (which worked but felt kinda hacky to me). But not only that — you can now use external hashes as&nbsp;well!</p><p>Read the whole Dev Pulse&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/external-links/">here</a>.</p> Agent Key Stability in Holochain <p>Watch a clip from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtWViZHLxHE&amp;feature=youtu.be">latest AMA</a> where Erik Harris-Braun talks about what agent key stability looks like on Holochain.</p> Ecosystem Session with&nbsp;IOEN <p>Watch the Eco Sessions replay with Mike Gamble, Simon Wilson, and Phil Beadle on the <a href="https://twitter.com/IOEN_tech">@IOEN_tech</a>.

In the coming two years we are committing upwards of $2M to build and foster an ecosystem of developers.

<p>Ocean Explorers is dropping 100K NFTs, deploying Civic Pass to protect the drops against bot spamming, as a way to illustrate bot protection at scale for large NFT mints.</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO (June 20, 2022) — Civic, a leader in digital identity solutions for Web3, will be the official partner in protection for the upcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/ExplorersNFT">Ocean Explorers</a> NFT drop. Ocean Explorers co-founders Vinny Lingham, Michael Tant, Jason Plepel and Concept Arthouse intend for the free, phased drop of 100K NFTs, featuring 10 factions of 10K NFTs each, to bring a diverse and broad array of new users into the NFT market. Broad access to the drop is made far easier due to Solana’s low fees and fast throughout.</p>



<p>By leveraging a new suite of tools based on its flagship Civic Pass product, Civic is addressing a botting issue that has plagued NFT drops and made for a poor user experience for human participants. Civic is also introducing a tool, called uniqueness verification, that determines user uniqueness. Each user will be able to use one wallet, making the drop a more fair experience across the board. With this new tool, Civic aims to prevent bots from accumulating the bulk of the NFT inventory, and selling it on secondary markets for profit.</p>



<p>Civic also provides tools that can help avoid price manipulation and denial of inventory. By requiring NFT buyers to verify that they are not bots, Civic Pass has already prevented more than 1 million bots from participating across more than 275 mints.</p>



<p>Early glimpses of Ocean Explorers reveal a beautiful array of ocean characters, including pirates, deep sea soldiers and surfers. A full roadmap, or treasure map, will be revealed in the coming months ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vinny Lingham, co-founder of Oceans Explorers, shared, “Using free NFTs, a community of 100k real people, who are not priced out of participation from the start, could become very powerful. In order to build a big, diverse community, we must prevent bots from exploiting the drop. This is now possible with a new uniqueness verification from Civic Pass.”</p>



<p>Chris Hart, CEO of Civic, said, “As Ocean Explorers’ official bot protection partner, we look forward to participating in this first-of-its-kind free drop of 100K NFTs. By limiting the drop to support a diverse set of human buyers, this project will be a best-in-class example of how to leverage NFTs as a massive community-building tool.”</p>



<p>“Ocean Explorers is a collection based on some deep, wholly original lore with intricate worldbuilding. It’s also devised to be unique from a technical perspective so we can set limits on how many NFTs each person can purchase during the mint,” explained Jason Plepel, of the Ocean Explorers’ team. “We’re excited to launch this ambitious NFT community and look forward to seeing people engage and become long-term contributing members.”<br>Get ready for the mint by <a href="http://civic.me/#oe-get-civic-pass">securing your uniqueness verification now</a> for a small fee. And, join the Ocean Explorers Discord community for the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ysFJHDXVVc">latest minting information</a>.</p>

<p>This new and important certification for the world of trust services joins others that InfoCert has earned over the years, confirming it as a European Champion of Digital Trust.</p>



<p>AgID recently certified InfoCert for its Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signature and for its Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seal.</p>



<p>This new certification was designed to address a market need to ensure that large organisations (primarily central governments, public administrations and companies operating in the banking ecosystem) are able to verify with absolute certainty the validity and integrity of a signature affixed to a contract or document, whether by a natural person (QESig) or a legal entity (QESeal).</p>



 InfoCert increasingly a European Champion of Digital Trust 



<p>With this new certification, companies and public administrations in Europe can easily integrate this new, entirely API-based solution, and again rely on the largest QTSP in Europe.</p>



<p>InfoCert’s services portfolio has always included the signature validation service, until now offering it in GoSign Desktop, the most widely used signature application in Italy. This solution allowed anyone to upload a signed document to GoSign and verify its validity, whether in Italy or in any European country in which the certificate was issued.</p>



<p>Today this AgID-certified service is <a href="https://developers.infocert.digital/signature-validation/">also available via API</a> and InfoCert’s clients can automatically integrate the signature and seal validation step into their business processes.&nbsp; Verification is done in real time and validates signed files in any format, including PDF, P7M, XML and JSON.</p>



<p>This additional certification at the European level recognises our intensive group work and means that we can once more position ourselves as market leader in both Italy and Europe for Trusted Services compliant with the eIDAS regulation.</p>

  <p>React was designed to make it painless to create interactive UIs. Its state management is efficient and only updates components when your data changes. Component logic is written in JavaScript, meaning you can keep state out of the DOM and create encapsulated components.</p>

<p>Developers like CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) apps because they show a lot of the base functionality you need when creating an app. Once you have the basics of CRUD completed in an app, most of the client-server plumbing is finished, and you can move on to implementing the necessary business logic.</p>

<p>Today, I’ll show you how to create a basic CRUD app with Spring Boot in React. In this tutorial, I’ll use the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow and package the React app in the Spring Boot app for production. At the same time, I’ll show you how to keep React’s productive workflow for developing locally.</p>

<p>You will need <a href="http://sdkman.io">Java 11</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 16</a> installed to complete this tutorial.</p>

 Create an API app with Spring Boot 

<p>I’m a frequent speaker at conferences and user groups around the world. My favorite user groups to speak at are Java User Groups (JUGs). I’ve been a Java developer for almost 20 years and love the Java community. One of my good friends, James Ward, said doing a JUG Tour was one of his favorite developer advocate activities back in the day. I recently took his advice and traded overseas conferences for JUG meetups in the US.</p>

<p>Why am I telling you this? Because I thought it’d be fun to create a “JUG Tours” app today that allows you to create/edit/delete JUGs and view upcoming events.</p>

<p>To begin, navigate to <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a> and make the following selections:</p>

 
   Group: <code>com.okta.developer</code> 
   Artifact: <code>jugtours</code> 
   Dependencies: <code>JPA</code>, <code>H2</code>, <code>Web</code>, <code>Lombok</code> 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click Generate Project, expand <code>jugtours.zip</code> after downloading, and open the project in your favorite IDE.</p>

<p>TIP: If you’re using IntelliJ IDEA or Spring Tool Suite, you can also use Spring Initializr when creating a new project.</p>

 Add a JPA domain model 

<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is to create a domain model that’ll hold your data. At a high level, there’s a <code>Group</code> that represents the JUG, an <code>Event</code> that has a many-to-one relationship with <code>Group</code>, and a <code>User</code> that has a one-to-many relationship with <code>Group</code>.</p>

<p>Create a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/jugtours/model</code> directory and a <code>Group.java</code> class in it.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.NonNull;
import lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.*;
import java.util.Set;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Entity
@Table(name = "user_group")
public class Group {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    @NonNull
    private String name;
    private String address;
    private String city;
    private String stateOrProvince;
    private String country;
    private String postalCode;
    @ManyToOne(cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
    private User user;

    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
    private Set&lt;Event&gt; events;
}
</code>   

<p>Create an <code>Event.java</code> class in the same package.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Builder;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.ManyToMany;
import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.Set;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Builder
@Entity
public class Event {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    private Instant date;
    private String title;
    private String description;
    @ManyToMany
    private Set&lt;User&gt; attendees;
}
</code>   

<p>And a <code>User.java</code> class.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
}
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>GroupRepository.java</code> to manage the group entity.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

import java.util.List;

public interface GroupRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Group, Long&gt; {
    Group findByName(String name);
}
</code>   

<p>To load some default data, create an <code>Initializer.java</code> class in the <code>com.okta.developer.jugtours</code> package.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours;

import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.Event;
import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.Group;
import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.GroupRepository;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

@Component
class Initializer implements CommandLineRunner {

    private final GroupRepository repository;

    public Initializer(GroupRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }

    @Override
    public void run(String... strings) {
        Stream.of("Seattle JUG", "Denver JUG", "Dublin JUG",
                "London JUG").forEach(name -&gt;
                repository.save(new Group(name))
        );

        Group djug = repository.findByName("Seattle JUG");
        Event e = Event.builder().title("Micro Frontends for Java Developers")
                .description("JHipster now has microfrontend support!")
                .date(Instant.parse("2022-09-13T17:00:00.000Z"))
                .build();
        djug.setEvents(Collections.singleton(e));
        repository.save(djug);

        repository.findAll().forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>TIP: If your IDE has issues with <code>Event.builder()</code>, you need to turn on annotation processing and/or install the Lombok plugin. I had to uninstall/reinstall the Lombok plugin in IntelliJ IDEA to get things to work.</p>

<p>If you start your app (using <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>) …</p>

<p>… it will fail because Spring Boot 2.7.0 forces H2 v2.0. The H2 2.0 ecosystem doesn’t seem like it’s quite ready for prime time, so I recommend you downgrade to H2 version <code>1.4.200</code> in your <code>pom.xml</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;com.h2database&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;h2&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.4.200&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Then, <code>mvn spring-boot:run</code> should result in something like:</p>

   <code>Group(id=1, name=Seattle JUG, address=null, city=null, stateOrProvince=null, country=null, postalCode=null, user=null, 
  events=[Event(id=5, date=2022-09-13T17:00:00Z, title=Micro Frontends for Java Developers, description=JHipster now has microfrontend support!, attendees=[])])
Group(id=2, name=Denver JUG, address=null, city=null, stateOrProvince=null, country=null, postalCode=null, user=null, events=[])
Group(id=3, name=Dublin JUG, address=null, city=null, stateOrProvince=null, country=null, postalCode=null, user=null, events=[])
Group(id=4, name=London JUG, address=null, city=null, stateOrProvince=null, country=null, postalCode=null, user=null, events=[])
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>GroupController.java</code> class (in <code>src/main/java/.../jugtours/web/GroupController.java</code>) that allows you to CRUD groups.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.web;

import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.Group;
import com.okta.developer.jugtours.model.GroupRepository;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import javax.validation.Valid;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Optional;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
class GroupController {

    private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GroupController.class);
    private GroupRepository groupRepository;

    public GroupController(GroupRepository groupRepository) {
        this.groupRepository = groupRepository;
    }

    @GetMapping("/groups")
    Collection&lt;Group&gt; groups() {
        return groupRepository.findAll();
    }

    @GetMapping("/group/{id}")
    ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; getGroup(@PathVariable Long id) {
        Optional&lt;Group&gt; group = groupRepository.findById(id);
        return group.map(response -&gt; ResponseEntity.ok().body(response))
                .orElse(new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND));
    }

    @PostMapping("/group")
    ResponseEntity&lt;Group&gt; createGroup(@Valid @RequestBody Group group) throws URISyntaxException {
        log.info("Request to create group: {}", group);
        Group result = groupRepository.save(group);
        return ResponseEntity.created(new URI("/api/group/" + result.getId()))
                .body(result);
    }

    @PutMapping("/group/{id}")
    ResponseEntity&lt;Group&gt; updateGroup(@Valid @RequestBody Group group) {
        log.info("Request to update group: {}", group);
        Group result = groupRepository.save(group);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().body(result);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/group/{id}")
    public ResponseEntity&lt;?&gt; deleteGroup(@PathVariable Long id) {
        log.info("Request to delete group: {}", id);
        groupRepository.deleteById(id);
        return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add the following dependency to your <code>pom.xml</code> to fix compilation errors:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;jakarta.validation&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jakarta.validation-api&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;2.0.2&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>If you stop and start your server app and hit <code>http://localhost:8080/api/groups</code> with your browser, or a command line client, you should see the list of groups.</p>

<p>You can create, read, update, and delete groups with the following <a href="https://httpie.org">HTTPie</a> commands.</p>

   <code>http POST :8080/api/group name='Utah JUG' city='Salt Lake City' country=USA
http :8080/api/group/6
http PUT :8080/api/group/6 id=6 name='Utah JUG' address='On the slopes'
http DELETE :8080/api/group/6
</code>   



 Create a React UI with Create React App 

<p>Create React App is a command line utility that generates React projects for you. It’s a convenient tool because it also offers commands to build and optimize your project for production. It uses webpack under the covers to build everything.</p>

<p>Create a new project in the <code>jugtours</code> directory with <code>npx</code>.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app@5 app
</code>   

<p>After the app creation process completes, navigate into the <code>app</code> directory and install <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, cookie support for React, React Router, and <a href="https://reactstrap.github.io/">Reactstrap</a>.</p>

   <code>cd app
npm i bootstrap@5 react-cookie@4 react-router-dom@6 reactstrap@9
</code>   


<p>You’ll use Bootstrap’s CSS and Reactstrap’s components to make the UI look better, especially on mobile phones. If you’d like to learn more about Reactstrap, see <a href="https://reactstrap.github.io">reactstrap.github.io</a>. It has extensive documentation on Reactstrap’s various components and their use.</p>

<p>Add Bootstrap’s CSS file as an import in <code>app/src/index.js</code>.</p>

   <code>import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
</code>   

 Call your Spring Boot API and display the results 

<p>Modify <code>app/src/App.js</code> to use the following code that calls <code>/api/groups</code> and displays the list in the UI.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

const App = () =&gt; {

  const [groups, setGroups] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    setLoading(true);

    fetch('api/groups')
      .then(response =&gt; response.json())
      .then(data =&gt; {
        setGroups(data);
        setLoading(false);
      })
  }, []);

  if (loading) {
    return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;
  }

  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;header className="App-header"&gt;
        &lt;img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" /&gt;
        &lt;div className="App-intro"&gt;
          &lt;h2&gt;JUG List&lt;/h2&gt;
          {groups.map(group =&gt;
            &lt;div key={group.id}&gt;
              {group.name}
            &lt;/div&gt;
          )}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default App;

<p>TIP: I learned a lot about React Hooks from <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/">Build a CRUD App in React with Hooks</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/taniarascia">Tania Rascia</a>.</p>

<p>To proxy from <code>/api</code> to <code>http://localhost:8080/api</code>, add a proxy setting to <code>app/package.json</code>.</p>

   <code>"scripts": {...},
"proxy": "http://localhost:8080",
</code>   

<p>To learn more about proxying API requests, see Create React App’s <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/#docsNav">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure Spring Boot is running, then run <code>npm start</code> in your <code>app</code> directory. You should see the list of default groups.</p>

<p></p>

 Build a React <code>GroupList</code> component 

<p>React is all about components, and you don’t want to render everything in your main <code>App</code>, so create <code>app/src/GroupList.js</code> and populate it with the following JavaScript.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Button, ButtonGroup, Container, Table } from 'reactstrap';
import AppNavbar from './AppNavbar';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const GroupList = () =&gt; {

  const [groups, setGroups] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    setLoading(true);

    fetch('api/groups')
      .then(response =&gt; response.json())
      .then(data =&gt; {
        setGroups(data);
        setLoading(false);
      })
  }, []);

  const remove = async (id) =&gt; {
    await fetch(`/api/group/${id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    }).then(() =&gt; {
      let updatedGroups = [...groups].filter(i =&gt; i.id !== id);
      setGroups(updatedGroups);
    });
  }

  if (loading) {
    return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;
  }

  const groupList = groups.map(group =&gt; {
    const address = `${group.address || ''} ${group.city || ''} ${group.stateOrProvince || ''}`;
    return &lt;tr key={group.id}&gt;
      &lt;td style={{whiteSpace: 'nowrap'}}&gt;{group.name}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;{address}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;{group.events.map(event =&gt; {
        return &lt;div key={event.id}&gt;{new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {
          year: 'numeric',
          month: 'long',
          day: '2-digit'
        }).format(new Date(event.date))}: {event.title}&lt;/div&gt;
      })}&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;ButtonGroup&gt;
          &lt;Button size="sm" color="primary" tag={Link} to={"/groups/" + group.id}&gt;Edit&lt;/Button&gt;
          &lt;Button size="sm" color="danger" onClick={() =&gt; remove(group.id)}&gt;Delete&lt;/Button&gt;
        &lt;/ButtonGroup&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  });

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;AppNavbar/&gt;
      &lt;Container fluid&gt;
        &lt;div className="float-end"&gt;
          &lt;Button color="success" tag={Link} to="/groups/new"&gt;Add Group&lt;/Button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;My JUG Tour&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;Table className="mt-4"&gt;
          &lt;thead&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th width="20%"&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th width="20%"&gt;Location&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Events&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th width="10%"&gt;Actions&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
          &lt;/thead&gt;
          &lt;tbody&gt;
          {groupList}
          &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/Table&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default GroupList;
</code>   

<p>Create <code>AppNavbar.js</code> in the same directory to establish a common UI feature between components.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Collapse, Nav, Navbar, NavbarBrand, NavbarToggler, NavItem, NavLink } from 'reactstrap';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const AppNavbar = () =&gt; {

  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    &lt;Navbar color="dark" dark expand="md"&gt;
      &lt;NavbarBrand tag={Link} to="/"&gt;Home&lt;/NavbarBrand&gt;
      &lt;NavbarToggler onClick={() =&gt; { setIsOpen(!isOpen) }}/&gt;
      &lt;Collapse isOpen={isOpen} navbar&gt;
        &lt;Nav className="justify-content-end" style={{width: "100%"}} navbar&gt;
          &lt;NavItem&gt;
            &lt;NavLink href="https://twitter.com/oktadev"&gt;@oktadev&lt;/NavLink&gt;
          &lt;/NavItem&gt;
          &lt;NavItem&gt;
            &lt;NavLink href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-react-crud-example"&gt;GitHub&lt;/NavLink&gt;
          &lt;/NavItem&gt;
        &lt;/Nav&gt;
      &lt;/Collapse&gt;
    &lt;/Navbar&gt;
  );
};

export default AppNavbar;
</code>   

<p>Create <code>app/src/Home.js</code> to serve as the landing page for your app.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import AppNavbar from './AppNavbar';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Button, Container } from 'reactstrap';

const Home = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;AppNavbar/&gt;
      &lt;Container fluid&gt;
        &lt;Button color="link"&gt;&lt;Link to="/groups"&gt;Manage JUG Tour&lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>Also, change <code>app/src/App.js</code> to use React Router to navigate between components.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Home from './Home';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import GroupList from './GroupList';
import GroupEdit from './GroupEdit';

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;Routes&gt;
        &lt;Route exact path="/" element={&lt;Home/&gt;}/&gt;
        &lt;Route path='/groups' exact={true} element={&lt;GroupList/&gt;}/&gt;
      &lt;/Routes&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  )
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>To make your UI a bit more spacious, add a top margin to Bootstrap’s container classes in <code>app/src/App.css</code>.</p>

   <code>nav + .container, nav + .container-fluid {
  margin-top: 20px;
} 
</code>   

<p>Your React app should update itself as you make changes, and you should see a screen like the following at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on Manage JUG Tour and you should see a list of the default groups.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s great that you can see your Spring Boot API’s data in your React app, but it’s no fun if you can’t edit it!</p>

 Add a React <code>GroupEdit</code> component 

<p>Create <code>app/src/GroupEdit.js</code> and use <code>useEffect()</code> to fetch the group resource with the ID from the URL.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Button, Container, Form, FormGroup, Input, Label } from 'reactstrap';
import AppNavbar from './AppNavbar';

const GroupEdit = () =&gt; {
  const initialFormState = {
    name: '',
    address: '',
    city: '',
    stateOrProvince: '',
    country: '',
    postalCode: ''
  };
  const [group, setGroup] = useState(initialFormState);
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const { id } = useParams();

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (id !== 'new') {
      fetch(`/api/group/${id}`)
        .then(response =&gt; response.json())
        .then(data =&gt; setGroup(data));
    }
  }, [id, setGroup]);

  const handleChange = (event) =&gt; {
    const { name, value } = event.target

    setGroup({ ...group, [name]: value })
  }

  const handleSubmit = async (event) =&gt; {
    event.preventDefault();

    await fetch('/api/group' + (group.id ? '/' + group.id : ''), {
      method: (group.id) ? 'PUT' : 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(group)
    });
    setGroup(initialFormState);
    navigate('/groups');
  }

  const title = &lt;h2&gt;{group.id ? 'Edit Group' : 'Add Group'}&lt;/h2&gt;;

  return (&lt;div&gt;
      &lt;AppNavbar/&gt;
      &lt;Container&gt;
        {title}
        &lt;Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
          &lt;FormGroup&gt;
            &lt;Label for="name"&gt;Name&lt;/Label&gt;
            &lt;Input type="text" name="name" id="name" value={group.name || ''}
                   onChange={handleChange} autoComplete="name"/&gt;
          &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
          &lt;FormGroup&gt;
            &lt;Label for="address"&gt;Address&lt;/Label&gt;
            &lt;Input type="text" name="address" id="address" value={group.address || ''}
                   onChange={handleChange} autoComplete="address-level1"/&gt;
          &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
          &lt;FormGroup&gt;
            &lt;Label for="city"&gt;City&lt;/Label&gt;
            &lt;Input type="text" name="city" id="city" value={group.city || ''}
                   onChange={handleChange} autoComplete="address-level1"/&gt;
          &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
          &lt;div className="row"&gt;
            &lt;FormGroup className="col-md-4 mb-3"&gt;
              &lt;Label for="stateOrProvince"&gt;State/Province&lt;/Label&gt;
              &lt;Input type="text" name="stateOrProvince" id="stateOrProvince" value={group.stateOrProvince || ''}
                     onChange={handleChange} autoComplete="address-level1"/&gt;
            &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
            &lt;FormGroup className="col-md-5 mb-3"&gt;
              &lt;Label for="country"&gt;Country&lt;/Label&gt;
              &lt;Input type="text" name="country" id="country" value={group.country || ''}
                     onChange={handleChange} autoComplete="address-level1"/&gt;
            &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
            &lt;FormGroup className="col-md-3 mb-3"&gt;
              &lt;Label for="country"&gt;Postal Code&lt;/Label&gt;
              &lt;Input type="text" name="postalCode" id="postalCode" value={group.postalCode || ''}
                     onChange={handleChange} autoComplete="address-level1"/&gt;
            &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;FormGroup&gt;
            &lt;Button color="primary" type="submit"&gt;Save&lt;/Button&gt;{' '}
            &lt;Button color="secondary" tag={Link} to="/groups"&gt;Cancel&lt;/Button&gt;
          &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
        &lt;/Form&gt;
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
};

export default GroupEdit;
</code>   

<p>The <code>useParams()</code> hook is used to grab the ID from the URL and <code>useNavigate()</code> allows you to navigate back to the <code>GroupList</code> after adding or saving a group.</p>

<p>Modify <code>app/src/App.js</code> to import <code>GroupEdit</code> and specify a path to it.</p>

   <code>import GroupEdit from './GroupEdit';

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;Routes&gt;
        ...
        &lt;Route path='/groups/:id' element={&lt;GroupEdit/&gt;}/&gt;
      &lt;/Routes&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  )
}
</code>   

<p>Now you should be able to add and edit groups!</p>

<p></p>

 Add authentication with Okta 

<p>It’s pretty cool to build a CRUD app, but it’s even cooler to build a secure one. To achieve that, you’ll want to add authentication so users have to log in before viewing/modifying groups. To make this simple, you can use Okta’s API for OIDC. At Okta, our goal is to make <a href="https://developer.okta.com/product/user-management/">identity management</a> a lot easier, more secure, and more scalable than what you’re used to. Okta is a cloud service that allows developers to create, edit, and securely store user accounts and user account data, and connect them with one or multiple applications. Our API enables you to:</p>

 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/product/authentication/">Authenticate</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/product/authorization/">authorize</a> your users 
   Store data about your users 
   Perform password-based and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/social-login/">social login</a> 
   Secure your application with <a href="https://developer.okta.com/use_cases/mfa/">multi-factor authentication</a> 
   And much more! Check out our <a href="https://developer.okta.com/documentation/">product documentation</a>

 Spring Security + OIDC 

<p><a>Spring Security added OIDC support in its 5.0 release</a>. Since then, they’ve made quite a few improvements and simplified its required configuration. Add the Okta Spring Boot starter to do OIDC authentication.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.1.5&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>This dependency is a thin wrapper around Spring Security’s OAuth and encapsulates the following dependencies:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-config&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-oauth2-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-oauth2-jose&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

 Create an OIDC app in Okta 

<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and use <code>http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8080</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



 Configure Spring Security for React and user identity 

<p>To make Spring Security React-friendly, create a <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> file in <code>src/main/java/.../jugtours/config</code>. Create the <code>config</code> directory and put this class in it.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.config;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;
import org.springframework.security.web.csrf.CookieCsrfTokenRepository;
import org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.HttpSessionRequestCache;
import org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.RequestCache;
import org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.SimpleSavedRequest;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -&gt; authz
                .antMatchers("/**/*.{js,html,css}").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/", "/api/user").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .csrf((csrf) -&gt; csrf
                .csrfTokenRepository(CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse())
            )
            .oauth2Login();
        return http.build();
    }

    @Bean
    public RequestCache refererRequestCache() {
        return new HttpSessionRequestCache() {
            @Override
            public void saveRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
                String referrer = request.getHeader("referer");
                if (referrer != null) {
                    request.getSession().setAttribute("SPRING_SECURITY_SAVED_REQUEST",
                        new SimpleSavedRequest(referrer));
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This class has a lot going on, so let me explain a few things. The <code>RequestCache</code> bean overrides the default request cache. It saves the referrer header (misspelled <code>referer</code> in real life), so Spring Security can redirect back to it after authentication. The referrer-based request cache comes in handy when you’re developing React on <code>http://localhost:3000</code> and want to be redirected back there after logging in.</p>

   <code>@Bean
public RequestCache refererRequestCache() {
    return new HttpSessionRequestCache() {
        @Override
        public void saveRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
            String referrer = request.getHeader("referer");
            if (referrer != null) {
                request.getSession().setAttribute("SPRING_SECURITY_SAVED_REQUEST",
                    new SimpleSavedRequest(referrer));
            }
        }
    };
}
</code>   

<p>Configuring CSRF (cross-site request forgery) protection with <code>CookieCsrfTokenRepository.withHttpOnlyFalse()</code> means that the <code>XSRF-TOKEN</code> cookie won’t be marked HTTP-only, so React can read it and send it back when it tries to manipulate data.</p>

<p>The <code>antMatchers</code> lines define what URLs are allowed for anonymous users. You will soon configure things so your React app is served up by your Spring Boot app, hence the reason for allowing web files and “/”. You might also notice an exposed <code>/api/user</code> path. Create <code>src/main/java/.../jugtours/web/UserController.java</code> and populate it with the following code. This API will be used by React to 1) find out if a user is authenticated, and 2) perform global logout.</p>

<p>You’ll also want to add user information when creating groups so that you can filter by your JUG tour. Add a <code>UserRepository.java</code> in the same directory as <code>GroupRepository.java</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.jugtours.model;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;User, String&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Add a new <code>findAllByUserId(String id)</code> method to <code>GroupRepository.java</code>.</p>

   <code>List&lt;Group&gt; findAllByUserId(String id);
</code>   

<p>Then inject <code>UserRepository</code> into <code>GroupController.java</code> and use it to create (or grab an existing user) when adding a new group. While you’re there, modify the <code>groups()</code> method to filter by user.</p>

<p>To magnify the changes, they’re in the <code>groups()</code> and <code>createGroup()</code> methods. It’s pretty slick that Spring JPA will create the <code>findAllByUserId()</code> method/query for you and <code>userRepository.findById()</code> uses Java 8’s <a href="http://www.baeldung.com/java-optional">Optional</a>.</p>

   <code>@GetMapping("/groups")

 Modify React to handle CSRF and be identity-aware 

<p>You’ll need to make a few changes to your React components to make them identity-aware. The first thing you’ll want to do is modify <code>src/index.js</code> to wrap everything in a <code>CookieProvider</code>. This component allows you to read the CSRF cookie and send it back as a header.</p>

   <code>import { CookiesProvider } from 'react-cookie';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;CookiesProvider&gt;
      &lt;App /&gt;
    &lt;/CookiesProvider&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;
);
</code>   

<p>Modify <code>app/src/Home.js</code> to call <code>/api/user</code> to see if the user is logged in. If they’re not, show a <code>Login</code> button.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import AppNavbar from './AppNavbar';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Button, Container } from 'reactstrap';
import { useCookies } from 'react-cookie';

const Home = () =&gt; {

  const [authenticated, setAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [user, setUser] = useState(undefined);
  const [cookies] = useCookies(['XSRF-TOKEN']);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    setLoading(true);
    fetch('api/user', { credentials: 'include' })
      .then(response =&gt; response.text())
      .then(body =&gt; {
        if (body === '') {
          setAuthenticated(false);
        } else {
          setUser(JSON.parse(body));
          setAuthenticated(true);
        }
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, [setAuthenticated, setLoading, setUser])

  const login = () =&gt; {
    let port = (window.location.port ? ':' + window.location.port : '');
    if (port === ':3000') {
      port = ':8080';
    }
    window.location.href = `//${window.location.hostname}${port}/private`;
  }

  const logout = () =&gt; {
    fetch('/api/logout', {
      method: 'POST', credentials: 'include',
      headers: { 'X-XSRF-TOKEN': cookies['XSRF-TOKEN'] }
    })
      .then(res =&gt; res.json())
      .then(response =&gt; {
        window.location.href = `${response.logoutUrl}?id_token_hint=${response.idToken}`
          + `&amp;post_logout_redirect_uri=${window.location.origin}`;
      });
  }

  const message = user ?
    &lt;h2&gt;Welcome, {user.name}!&lt;/h2&gt; :
    &lt;p&gt;Please log in to manage your JUG Tour.&lt;/p&gt;;

  const button = authenticated ?
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Button color="link"&gt;&lt;Link to="/groups"&gt;Manage JUG Tour&lt;/Link&gt;&lt;/Button&gt;
      &lt;br/&gt;
      &lt;Button color="link" onClick={logout}&gt;Logout&lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; :
    &lt;Button color="primary" onClick={login}&gt;Login&lt;/Button&gt;;

  if (loading) {
    return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;
  }

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;AppNavbar/&gt;
      &lt;Container fluid&gt;
        {message}
        {button}
      &lt;/Container&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>There are some things you should be aware of in this component:</p>

 
   <code>useCookies()</code> is used for access to cookies. Then you can fetch a cookie with <code>cookies['XSRF-TOKEN']</code>. 
   When using <code>fetch()</code>, you need to include <code>{credentials: 'include'}</code> to transfer cookies. You will get a 403 Forbidden if you do not include this option. 
   The CSRF cookie from Spring Security has a different name than the header you need to send back. The cookie name is <code>XSRF-TOKEN</code>, while the header name is <code>X-XSRF-TOKEN</code>. 
 

<p>Update <code>app/src/GroupList.js</code> to have similar changes. The good news is you don’t need to make any changes to the <code>render()</code> method.</p>

   <code>import { useCookies } from 'react-cookie';

const GroupList = () =&gt; {

  ...
  const [cookies] = useCookies(['XSRF-TOKEN']);

  ...
  const remove = async (id) =&gt; {
    await fetch(`/api/group/${id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'X-XSRF-TOKEN': cookies['XSRF-TOKEN'],
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      credentials: 'include'
    }).then(() =&gt; {
      let updatedGroups = [...groups].filter(i =&gt; i.id !== id);
      setGroups(updatedGroups);
    });
  }
  ...

  return (...)
}

export default GroupList;
</code>   

<p>Update <code>GroupEdit.js</code> too.</p>

   <code>import { useCookies } from 'react-cookie';

const GroupEdit = () =&gt; {
  
  ...
  const [cookies] = useCookies(['XSRF-TOKEN']);

  ...
  const handleSubmit = async (event) =&gt; {
    event.preventDefault();

    await fetch(`/api/group${group.id ? `/${group.id}` : ''}`, {
      method: group.id ? 'PUT' : 'POST',
      headers: {
        'X-XSRF-TOKEN': cookies['XSRF-TOKEN'],
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(group),
      credentials: 'include'
    });
    setGroup(initialFormState);
    navigate('/groups');
  }

  ...

  return (...)
}

export default GroupEdit;
</code>   

<p>After all these changes, you should be able to restart both Spring Boot and React and witness the glory of planning your very own JUG Tour!</p>

 Configure Maven to build and package React with Spring Boot 

<p>To build and package your React app with Maven, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin">frontend-maven-plugin</a> and Maven’s profiles to activate it. Add properties for versions and a <code>&lt;profiles&gt;</code> section to your <code>pom.xml</code>.</p>

<p>While you’re at it, add the active profile setting to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>

   <code>spring.profiles.active=@spring.profiles.active@
</code>   

<p>After adding this, you should be able to run <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pprod</code> and see your app running on <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

 Learn more about Spring Boot and React 

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this tutorial on how to do CRUD with React, Spring Boot, and Spring Security. You can see that Spring Security’s OIDC support is pretty robust, and doesn’t require a whole lot of configuration. Adding CSRF protection and packaging your Spring Boot + React app as a single artifact is pretty cool too!</p>

<p>You can find the example created in this tutorial on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-react-crud-example">https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-react-crud-example</a>.</p>

<p>There is a classic juxtaposition within security controls. Organizations need to make data and services available, but if it’s too easily accessible, too open, then a data breach can occur. On the other hand, if data and services are too restricted then the controls are marginalized and ignored. Organizations struggle with balancing the risk between easy access and advanced controls. Whichever approach is taken impacts the user experience, and both can lead to less than desirable results if done poorly.</p>
<p>I’ve asked many IT professionals if they consider the end user when implementing a new security protocol. Surprisingly the answer is often, they don’t. The reasoning for my question is simple. If you know more about the users being asked to perform the task, the task can be implemented with less friction.</p>
<p>Friction, or the user experience, is a critical consideration to security. To achieve the desired security outcome, IT organizations must understand and develop with their customers’ motivations and behaviors in mind. In doing so, the intended ask will be met with less resistance and higher adoption, therefore improving overall security.</p>
 Why SSO Is Still A Must 
<p>Let’s clarify with something first – SSO is still a must in an enterprise infrastructure stack.</p>
<p>An end user will not type in their credentials for every access point. But, SSO in its current form and with 2FA or MFA as part of the access flow does not meet Zero Trust standards. And this construct ties back into what I started with above. Organizations need to balance the risk between easy access and advanced controls.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a proactive security approach that continuously verifies users, devices, and services before trusting them. This approach is commonly summarized as “never trust, always verify”. Essentially, Zero Trust assumes that anything connecting to a system is a potential threat that should be verified before earning trust. But to do that security teams need to know as much about the identity accessing the resources as possible. Without this fundamental knowledge of identity, security is more hope-based than fact-based and impacts the effectiveness of a Zero Trust architecture.</p>
<p>On its own, the Zero Trust sounds like it will cause friction at the time of user access, a poor user experience. But that doesn’t have to be the case. Many of the access types that are in existence are here because the end users are creating poor passwords. These passwords can be hacked or even phished. So the transition to a Zero Trust architecture can be an opportunity for organizations to improve the user experience and implement technologies that improve security and improve user experience at the same time.</p>
<p>How can that be done? With Identity. What does identity have to do with Zero Trust architecture? It’s a pillar of the Zero Trust architecture because when you verify user identity at each point of access, you proactively verify users before a breach can happen. This is in line with the “never trust, always verify” core principle of Zero Trust. But to securely authenticate a user, one must first implement an indisputable identity proofing process. Because an indisputable proofed ID must involve the triangulation of a user claim with biometrics. Implementing this element of identity management will ensure that every access attempt is tied to a trusted and verified identity.</p>
<p>The result is a secure access infrastructure that is based on verified identities tied to the user’s biometrics. So instead of using passwords and trying to secure them with additional authentication methods, the user’s identity becomes the access method.</p>
 1Kosmos Supports Zero Trust and a Better User Experience 
<p>The 1Kosmos BlockID platform ensures that individuals are who they claim to be by using an identity-based approach to authentication. We bring identity into the security forefront so that organizations implementing a Zero Trust infrastructure know with certainty who is accessing IT assets and online services.</p>
<p>This means we have a quick and convenient way for users to self verify their identity using government, telco, and banking credentials. Then, once verified, workers, citizens, and customers use their digital identity to be utilized at login or transaction approval. This identity pre proofing injects a level of trust into the Zero Trust implementation and provides users with a frictionless experience. Organizations will implement their Zero Trust deployment with a significantly improved access user experience and high level of identity assurance for the identity on the other side of the digital connection.</p>

<p>Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears. Vinay Gupta the coordinator of the 2015 Ethereum public launch has some thoughts on the state of the industry&nbsp;today.</p><p>Once again, crypto winter is upon us. Depending on how you count this is my fifth or eighth. Back in the 1990s there was ITAR and the crypto wars, where the US Federal Government basically killed the industry in America, back when crypto was a thing you did to emails not a shorthand for privately issued anonymous digital cash. The early days of bitcoin, when it hit thirty-something dollars then crashed to four and stayed there. The 2016 DAO crisis. I’ve seen it&nbsp;all.</p><p>I want to talk about how we wound up where we are today, and how we get off this nightmare ride of boom-and-bust cycles which are psychologically trashing our industry and making it so hard to build enduring value. We can stop the bleeding, but we have to be&nbsp;smart.</p><p>First of all though, here’s a bunch of stuff that might help with the deep background to all this if you want to orient yourself before plunging in; you don’t need to go through it to understand what follows, but a lot of the context is&nbsp;here:</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1486147735212470274">@leashless</a></p></blockquote>  <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-blockchain-sleep-of-reason-b28f3bd3f83b">THE BLOCKCHAIN SLEEP OF REASON</a>  <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/">The Ethereum Launch Process</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable blockchains in context: Ethereum’s future, by Vinay Gupta</a>   The psychology of the boom-bust innovation cycle. <p>Here’s <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/2018-year-in-preview-the-future-of-cryptocurrency-b99110480ff0">the piece I wrote in 2017 about the 2018 crypto winter</a>. Some of you may remember it. It lays out the same basic case I’m going to make here: crypto wins by solving problems that nobody else can solve, profitably. It has to win at three levels to&nbsp;survive:</p>  Ordinary people have to use&nbsp;it  It has to generate actual value, not just move value&nbsp;around  Governments have to tolerate it or use it themselves — either one will&nbsp;do  <p>If we can’t hit all three of those criteria WANGMI. We’re building a technology that needs a billion regular users to survive. The constants are huge: big engineering teams, big marketing budgets, complex legal and regulatory work. It all costs money and the only thing that can sustain the industry is real economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>It is still <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/16/warren-buffett-invested-1-billion-crypto-bank/">Warren Buffet</a>’s world — literally, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/berkshire-hathaway/marketcap/">he owns it</a>. His way of analysing the world is to look at the fundamental valuation and profitability of assets. He’s so good at it, his company has roughly the same market cap as Ethereum had a couple of years ago. But Buffet’s company doesn’t 10x up and 4x down every couple of years: it’s plodded along fairly reliably for decades, incrementally growing&nbsp;value.</p><p>Now, you’ve gotta ask yourself, “why can’t Warren Buffet see crypto?” And it’s not because he’s old or doesn’t get tech. No, it’s because he’s smart about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundamentals.asp">financial fundamentals</a>.</p><p>That’s all that boring stuff&nbsp;like:</p>  How much food will come out of the&nbsp;ground?  What’s the global market for machine tools going to look like next&nbsp;year?  How fast are people moving to the&nbsp;cities?  <p>Thinking about this stuff really carefully is how you figure out when a real-world asset is under-valued.</p><p>Buying things which are under-valued is how Warren Buffet makes&nbsp;money.</p><p>But Warren Buffet won’t buy bitcoin at any price. So we have to think about that. What do we know that Warren Buffet&nbsp;doesn’t?</p><p>Now let me introduce another big thinker about finance: <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/people/carlota-perez">Carlotta Perez</a>. Perez is good at valuing bubbles. Specifically, she’s good at thinking about how bubbles create value in the long run even though they all pass through horrible periods like&nbsp;this.</p>Source: <a href="https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/">https://avc.com/2015/02/the-carlota-perez-framework/</a>Source: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oaqKjHbgsoqEXBMZ2/s-curves-for-trend-forecasting</a><p>What Perez says, roughly, is that bubbles build infrastructure. There’s a massive surge of irrational enthusiasm during which water flows uphill, capital flows into the most improbable things, and the future seems so close you can touch it. Warren Buffet hates this stuff because it involves guessing about the future. During that initial lift, during the innovation burn period, the G-force is like sitting in a plane at take-off. It hits you right in the base of your spine. Here we&nbsp;go!</p><p>Then a little later nearly everyone goes bankrupt.</p><p>Then a bunch of grown-ups who know how to run business move in, buy up all the assets cheap, and turn all of this technological potential into profitable businesses.</p><p>It’s a fundamental change in the nature of the people that run the industry: it goes from innovators to operators. Risk tolerance goes way down because the technology already works but it needs people who can operate it profitably.</p><p>My company, <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> is in the middle of that process of transformation right now as our business team takes more and more responsibility for running the business, and the original innovators are now more integrated into product development and sales. Usually companies don’t make that transition under their own power — somebody has to come in and fire the CEO — but in our case we knew enough about how businesses really run to make those changes under our own power (without anyone firing&nbsp;me).</p><p>I’ll introduce a few members of our new senior leadership team in another Medium post&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>So we’ve been through basically six rounds of the Perez cycle in crypto in the past 15 years. These things come on each-other thick and fast. An enormous amount of underlying technological, financial and even social innovation has happened.</p>  Bitcoin  Altcoins  Ethereum  ICOs  Defi  NFTs  <p>And at the end of that we’re left with a rough copy of about a third of the global financial system. You could just about put together a mortgage loan and buy a house as an NFT if you really put your mind to it. It would take work and connections, but you could just about buy real estate as an NFT today, with financing. Mattereum is of course going to make that a lot easier real soon, but let’s deal with things as they are rather than as they’re going to&nbsp;be.</p><p>So in every one of these rounds of the Perez cycle we can see the future as clearly as all the folks who went bust installing “dark fiber” optic cables in the ground. About 20 years ago companies ploughed billions into the ground to lay fiber optic cables that nobody needed or would pay for. It was THE FUTURE. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/11/fiber-optic/">Then everybody went bankrupt</a>, grown ups bought the assets for a song, and slowly started to operate the fibre profitably. Same thing happened with airlines: again and again and again Southwest Airlines acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Southwest_Airlines">bankrupt airlines for a song</a>, with planes and routes, and operated them profitably.</p><p>In crypto we run this cycle super fast and with the same people in the room on each cycle. But the field keeps growing and changing, and all these ups and downs result in a most “interesting” phenomena: the All Time&nbsp;High.</p><p>During the All Time High, at crypto events, every single person in the room has made money. Everybody. You bought in yesterday, you’ve already made $5. You bought in six months ago and you look like a genius. The money just seems to take care of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>During a dip the “newbies” have lost money; the least socially connected 10% or 20% of the people in the room bought, then it dipped, and the old hands are buying at the current price. The newbies are a bit twitchy but the old hands are all looking greedy rather than fearful, and life goes&nbsp;on.</p><p>During a crash, and all-importantly after a crash, 70% of the people in the room have lost money. Some of them have lost 70% of what they invested: they took real money out of bricks-and-mortar assets and bought hype tickets, and then got rekt, to use current parlance. And in these periods the old hands aren’t buying anything; they’re sitting on their winnings and waiting for the rally somewhere on down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>The NFT space is now in this condition. I don’t know what <a href="https://www.nft.nyc/">NYC.NFT</a> is going to feel like later in June 2022, but I expect the mood to be mordant. People have lost a lot of money, and they wonder if they’re ever going to make it back. Remember 2018, Ethereum people? The ICO craze had blown over because the massive promises made by those projects had failed to materialise, and people were gloomy as all hell. A long time passed until <a href="https://oecdonthelevel.com/2022/01/31/from-defi-summer-to-crypto-winter-leverage-liquidations-and-policy-implications/">Defi Summer</a> in 2020, and then the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million">2021 NFT take-off a year&nbsp;ago</a>.</p><p>Most of the new folks in the space haven’t seen crypto winter before. 70% or so of the people in the room have lost money. The mood is down, down,&nbsp;down.</p><p>Welcome to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital">Perez Cycle</a>, kids. I’m sorry to be seeing you down here in the gutter one more time, but you’ll find a lot of old friends here, survivors of previous rounds of the&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>We stick together.</p> The rebuild: real world utility, or bust&nbsp;(again). <p>Around 2017 I was looking at starting a VC fund. I didn’t know exactly how to do it: I’d worked in a fund in the 1990s but there was a lot about the business I did not understand at the&nbsp;time.</p><p>As part of the research, I put about 100 people through their first VR experience. I wanted to figure out if it was time to invest in VR projects. It was market research.</p><p>I came to the conclusion that we were years away from VR being a workable technology. The hardware was clearly ready: Oculus Rift was a little clunky but it was the Apple IIe of VR: the thing that tells you The Revolution is Coming. That was&nbsp;fine.</p><p>But the software was appalling. Back in the day they made movies by putting a camera on a tripod and doing a stage play in front of it. It took decades to make movies. A whole new art form (cinematography) had to be invented. Shocking and amazing things happened decade after decade for a century to get us to where cinema is now. Those changes were often driven by technology, but they were delivered by actors and directors portraying the human experience in new ways, creating ever-more-compelling works. VR is not ready for artistic reasons, far more than for technical ones. I could go on about this for some hours, but the lack of a “virtual cinematography” makes most VR experiences as compelling as watching CCTV footage of mall parking lots. It does not matter if I’m looking at the wheat fields of Gondor and scouting for Nazgul, if it’s not telling me a story I don’t want to&nbsp;know.</p><p>Also violence is overwhelmingly overpowering in VR. It’s literally just too much and reducing the violent content of our video games to the point that it doesn’t traumatize people to play (Arizona Sunshine, I’m looking at you here) is also going to take&nbsp;time.</p><p>So my prediction is this: the Metaverse is going to fail. At least for a while. It’s still too early. The pandemic is more-or-less over, people are back out in the world again, and everybody loves this place! The stay-at-home culture which VR is fundamentally rooted in doesn’t provide the lived experiences which people want. There is something very much like VR which people do want, but until VR has solved the artistic problems of storytelling in the virtual medium it’s just chat rooms with better graphics. I have an Meta Quest II, and it’s gathering dust: there’s just nothing to *do* in&nbsp;there.</p><p>Not yet.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/w0000CE0/status/1537401568328404993">@w0000CE0</a></p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, we have inflation.

It is devastating. In theory wages adjust to keep up with inflation, and interest rates too.

If we re-inflate the tech-hype bubble around the metaverse, it’ll produce a brief flare of innovation, some very inflated prices for assets which are inherently extremely volatile, and another flame-out like the one that we’re in, just a couple of years down the road (at most.) I quite liked <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/axie-infinity-axs-price-risks-deeper-losses-despite-90-drawdown-already">play to earn as a concept</a>. It didn’t seem inherently bonkers to me that the age-old practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming">gold farming</a> could be modernised by crypto into something that allowed essentially independent operators to do it in a defi way. But it’s stuck in the Perez spin cycle, along with everything else, and people in developing world countries are losing their entire livelihood in this&nbsp;chaos.</p><p>We have to change how this&nbsp;works.</p><p>We have to take the hard path now: we have to start building the kind of wealth that Warren Buffet can understand, the rebuilding that outfits like Southwest Airlines specialised in.</p><p>We have to learn how to make&nbsp;money.</p> Shovels and gold&nbsp;mines <p>During a Perez Cycle there is one very predictable way to make money: be the exchange. This is one form of the old saw about “<a href="https://medium.com/@transitprotocol/business-modelling-why-selling-shovels-during-a-gold-rush-is-the-surest-way-to-make-money-8fdf41f5bc1b">during a gold rush, sell shovels</a>.”</p><p>In the recent loops,&nbsp;that’s:</p>  Coinbase in its Bitcoin, altcoins, Ethereum, and ICOs&nbsp;phases  Uniswap (and all the rest) during the Defi&nbsp;phase  OpenSea during the NFT&nbsp;phase  <p>OpenSea got <a href="https://www.banklesstimes.com/news/2022/03/15/has-the-nft-bubble-popped-opensea-revenue-drops-97percent/">2.5% of everything</a>. Pushing $400,000,000 a month in fees at one&nbsp;point.</p><p>That’s no joke. That’s real money. But it’s essentially a toll road, and if the cars go somewhere else you don’t get a cut. <a href="https://nft.coinbase.com">Coinbase is doing NFTs</a> but it’s going to have a hard time catching OpenSea. Maybe <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2022/simple-nft-purchasing-on-nft-marketplaces/">this deal with Mastercard</a> will&nbsp;help.</p><p>But, really, this is just a tax on bubbles. You want to get into the bubble, you pay the gatekeepers. It’s generating real wealth by skimming a little on other people’s speculative activities. In a casino, this is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigorish">the vig</a>. In roulette, it’s the green “00” where the house wins and takes all the money on the&nbsp;table.</p><p>In crypto it’s the commissions going to the people selling access to the speculative market. This is not a bad business to be in for the winners. It’s real&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>But it’s not actually wealth generating.</p><p>So how does crypto actually generate&nbsp;wealth?</p><p>Here’s the first argument: crypto is monetary policy as a service. Crypto makes money by literally making money. Bitcoin miners pull the stuff out of thin air, with enormous energy costs, and sell it. Money is a product. Now this argument was always solid, but the counter-argument was “but Bitcoin is worse money than the US&nbsp;dollar.”</p><p>And here we get into a&nbsp;thicket.</p><p>Bitcoin was a worse, more expensive, more volatile version of the US dollar for a long time. But the price, on average, kept going up. Bitcoiners would talk about scarce supply and historical inevitability, and the good and right-thinking people of the world would roll their eyes and say “but it isn’t really money” and move on, while the bitcoiners continued to be wrong and get&nbsp;rich.</p><p>The thing that kept the Bond Villains in the loop on bitcoin was the underlying fear that the US dollar was inevitably going to start inflating eventually. The 2008 bust had left the economy in a fickle, precarious position and the vultures knew it was only a matter of&nbsp;time.</p>Source <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart">https://www.macrotrends.net/2015/fed-funds-rate-historical-chart</a><p>Well, that time is now. 12% inflation is one hell of a thing. It was a global crisis that last time inflation was that high. It’s a global crisis&nbsp;now.</p><p>And the bitcoiners are clearly and visibly right about Bitcoin being “monetary policy as a service” while, at the same time, losing money hand-over-fist right now as the current Perez Cycle bubble they are in bursts (again… for like the 5th time). They were making money when they were wrong. Now they’re losing money when they are&nbsp;right.</p><p>There’s no justice. But there is inflation.</p><p>For our younger readers: inflation means there’s too much money chasing not enough stuff. The price of the stuff starts to rise, and year-on-year everything gets more expensive. If wages rise at the same price as stuff, the people who lose are people with money in the bank. If wages don’t rise at the same price as stuff, the working class gets poorer and poorer, and the landlords get all the money. This was last a thing in the 1970s, and it led to the 1980s. What a disaster. And as for keeping wages rising through an inflationary period, who’s in a union these&nbsp;days?</p><p>So “monetary policy as a service” in bitcoin means this: by restricting the supply of money to below the availability of goods and services, the amount of goods and services a given amount of money can buy will keep going up. This is known as “deflation” — prices go down every year instead of up. Well, sure enough, with 12% inflation and worse on the way probably (stagflation! secular stagnation! contagion!) for the dollar economy, the bitcoin (and soon, Ethereum) “hard money claim” begins to look pretty good. There’s no doubt it’s a plausible model of the future: in-between the massive Perez cycle crashes, there is a massive on-going infrastructure built out and fundamental economic wealth creation from making and selling hard money during an age when all the governments will sell you is increasingly-soft money.</p><p>Back when the market cap of Bitcoin was around $500m USD people used to say to me “why is Bitcoin worth anything at all?” and I’d say “given the state of the world, does a $500m hedge against the dollar going horribly wrong seem unreasonable to you?” and usually they’d go “Ah. Hm. Alright then, sure.” It made a difference to their understanding of the situation.</p><p>So the argument here is that, even though Bitcoiners are losing money on the current Perez Cycle, they’re also right about inflation. Selling wealth preservation as a service is inherently profitable (if you’re any good at it) — just ask any professional wealth&nbsp;manager.</p><p>The long term trajectory here is WAGMI: Satoshi’s analysis of the inability of governments to control inflation in the long run was accurate, and the apocalypse that they predicted is&nbsp;here.</p><p>But Bitcoin prices are still going down because the <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/09/remain-solvent/">market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent</a>, as they say in finance. It’s a hard&nbsp;life.</p><p>So that’s one half of “during a gold rush, sell shovels.” Bitcoin is the selling the gold part. I won’t say that’s going well, but it’s going as expected. There are huge issues, as always with bitcoin, but the nation state’s money isn’t all roses either: defense spending vs. bitcoin mining, you know? It is the same sort of spending: protecting value.</p><p>Here’s the other&nbsp;half.</p><p>Protecting wealth from inflation is only one kind of protection we&nbsp;need.</p><p>The other kind of protection we need is environmental protection.</p><p>Now here you say “but Bitcoin has horrible environmental externalities” and I’m not saying you’re wrong. It does. There is a paradox here, at no mistake, and we all have to live with it regardless of what position we take relative to Bitcoin. I’m very pro Proof of Stake systems including Avalanche and whatever we’re calling ETH2 these days, and have been for&nbsp;years.</p><p>Environmental protection is a big deal. The existing economic architecture of the world makes it essentially impossible to protect nature. I could go on for some time about how the key function of colonialism is to convince rich people that it isn’t unceasing violence that maintains their wealth but, at the end of the day, you either know how this world works or you don’t. I used to get into trouble for saying “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CTCrWNYGTE">what is the point of Free Software running on hardware manufactured by slaves</a>” at open source conferences. You know&nbsp;me.</p><p>A system of sound money, no matter how outlandish or mainstream, is not going to save us alone. There is nothing about bitcoin that will stop us destroying ourselves with CO2 emissions, indeed many would argue (and I’m among them) that Bitcoin has done immense damage in this&nbsp;way.</p><p>We need a comprehensive overhaul of how things are done while the global system is in shock: there is a window of opportunity to start a reorganisation of trade the likes of which hasn’t been seen in about five hundred years. We need hard asset accounting to deal with fraud and asset bubbles, and we need to start counting environmental and social externalities on the same kind of basis that we account for payments. And it has to be the same system. (to read more about what an integrated blockchain-based environmental economics backbone would look like, see this Medium&nbsp;piece)</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">Can the World Computer Save the World? Part 3: Building an Economy with a Future</a></p><p>But back to the hard asset economics. Here’s the core issue in a nutshell.</p><p>Nobody trusts anybody else’s&nbsp;money.</p><p>If you’re in China and signing a deal for 12 months in the future, what do you think the dollar is going to be&nbsp;worth?</p><p>So being able to see exactly what is going on with your counterparties is an increasingly good idea. If I’m being made promises about a supply chain, I want to be able to inspect it. Are you really going to be able to deliver me 1200 PC laptops at 200 a month, or is your vendor going to crap out? If you do fail me, can I get my money&nbsp;back</p><p>Uncertainty is high. All time high. Trust is low. All time low. The global system is stressed.</p><p>We restore trust by making the system transparent: visibility into our counterparties’ supply chains enables us to make a better guess about whether or not they’re going to be able to deliver. This kind of trust problem on trading and delivery is breaking out all over the place, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/06/london-metal-exchange-sued-cancelled-trades-elliott-management">previously-unprecedented ways</a>.</p><p>The answer, inevitably, is to use less volatile things to pay for less volatile&nbsp;things.</p><p>Absolute certainty about hard assets and their value is a precondition for being able to do trade. But you also need certainty about the value of money, and the risks of the goods not being delivered because of supply chain problems. No system can solve all of this, but strategically deployed cryptographic assets can. If I have a crypto token which translates to four ounces of gold in the form of a gold bar, and you have every reason to trust that token, I can use it to pay for two laptops priced in gold. If you prefer SDRs to gold, and you want to bake in some terms for inflation to index-link the price of the contract, no reason that can’t be done&nbsp;too.</p> Turning the&nbsp;corner <p>The crypto industry has two fundamental ways of making money: “scarcity as a service” to protect wealth from governments printing currency. That mode of wealth production should be strongly reinforced by 12% per year US inflation and similar rates in other wealthy countries. But 50% drops that apparently come out of nowhere make it hard unnecessarily hard to make that&nbsp;case.</p><p>The other, complimentary, approach is to get stuck in to the hard work of getting physical asset trade on chain. There are a huge range of benefits to tokenizing physical assets as NFTs or representing them as&nbsp;ERC20s.</p>  support for environmental economics  lowered fraud&nbsp;rates  guarantees there’s no slave labour in your&nbsp;stuff  circular economy benefits to reduce raw material&nbsp;usage  easier sales because people trust the stuff they are&nbsp;buying  <p>All this together turns the blockchain itself into the marketplace for the entire world. That’s how we win: we get the real estate, the gold, the land, the wine, the cars, the clothes and furniture and everything else flowing over the magnificent complex infrastructure that has been built up by the last 6 rounds of the Perez Cycle in the blockchain space.</p><p>We have world-changing infrastructure. Now we have to use it to change the&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-is-new-in-the-world-of-blockchain-64b482e1f9d7">What is New in the World of Blockchain?</a></p><p>My company, Mattereum, derisks physical assets as they are turned into tokens. We make Mattereum Asset Passports (MAP) which enable people to vouch (with their money) for the condition of physical goods, ranging from fine artwork to real estate. We combine cutting edge legal developments with blockchain technology so we can partner with merchants to add a MAP to every transaction — the MAP is a digital smart contract that legally binds the identity of an item being sold to its detailed specifications and value. Within the asset passport, each specification is backed by a warranty that is legally enforceable in more than 160 jurisdictions. This means it is no longer necessary to have to just rely on trusting the seller to tell the truth about an item, solving the problem of the lack of a trusted third party in sales on the blockchain. For the first time it enables purchasers to fully trust in the value, integrity and authenticity of on-chain merchant sales, which is of critical importance for the growth of metaverse and NFT transactions that will dematerialise and financialise the world’s physical assets, and allows an avenue for recompense if your on-chain asset is stolen. In addition, through engaging as a warrantor, brands and manufacturers can participate in recurring revenue streams from secondary market transactions.</p><p>Using MAPs we’ve helped our customers sell everything from gold bullion to a world-famous <a href="https://timmytrumpet.story.xyz/#/">DJ’s trumpet</a>. We are hard core economic realists: Vinay Gupta (CEO) spent years as a consultant on failed states; Anton Shelupanov (Managing Director) saw the economic troubles in former Soviet countries in the 1990s and early 2000s from an extremely difficult position: working alongside justice systems he witnessed the outcomes of economic collapse, which included uncontrolled hyperincarceration, leading to an amplification of the TB and HIV pandemics and the resultant harm to societies. It took respective governments and international organisations years and in some cases decades to put in place strategies to begin to recover from that&nbsp;harm.</p><p>We’re building the technologies, teams, and know-how to run the global economy in an era of unprecedented pressure. We have a <a href="https://mattereum.com/circular-economy/">circular economy service</a> to make the physical goods we have work harder. We’re working on a large-scale scale play to take gold bullion from around the world and decentralize gold custody. We’re working on real estate, both so you can use real estate as collateral more easily, but also to make it possible to transfer real estate faster and with more certainty which minimises exposure to fluctuating purchasing power and interest rates. We’re getting stuff digitally tagged so you know exactly what you are buying. Soon, all kinds of machineries like futures and options on physical assets: the full Defi toolkit applied to the real world. And because we really believe in and understand ecological economics, because the assets we help sell have estimates of their environmental impact and integrated CO2 offsets, this is all Refi: “Regenerative Finance.” Documenting real things, including the environmental externalities, is critical to our model of the world. You can’t know the real value of a thing unless you fully understand and know its environmental externalities. And knowing real value is what we are all&nbsp;about.</p><p>I want to encourage all of you to join us. The real asset revolution is how crypto really generates wealth.</p><p>How, you say? Right now the global economy offers us no reliable global way to buy and sell things of substantial value around the world, with strong legal protections for both buyers and sellers, and excellent risk management to make sure people get paid if something goes wrong. We don’t gather and collect the information necessary for environmental economics and right-pricing of assets, discounted by any environmental damage they are causing. We know only the cost of everything, but the value of nothing, and it’s really harming&nbsp;us.</p><p>TradFi destroyed the world through systemic fraud of the kind that led to the 2008 financial collapse. It’s working on destroying the future through funding climate change. Defi built the tools for doing some amazing things, but underpriced risk to a scary degree. Refi is both “regenerative finance” but also, critically, Re-al Finance. Finance fully grounded in the real world, including all that messy environmental, social and governance stuff that TradFi and Defi conveniently left out of the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Everything that we can do to make transactions faster, more certain, more trustworthy, higher in information content, more international — all of that — generates real wealth by moving transactions from inefficient and data-losing rails (have you tried buying a house recently?) on to dramatically more functional infrastructure for the future of world&nbsp;trade.</p><p>And this is how we make the blockchain space valuable in an operational way, rather than a speculative way. This is how we move from a series of bubbles to enduring, stable wealth. We get into the real world, and we solve the transparency, accountability and trust problems which dominate real world trade and financial markets. This is the way&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Mattereum is up and running and open for business, creating MAPs for an ever-growing variety of assets.

 Technology and System — Which is the primary productive force?  Hope, Confusion, and Practice of&nbsp;Web3 <p>Having recently launched the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-decentralized-society-own-your-value-c5be7088ac95">OWN Infrastructure</a> template for the building of Web3, it gives us great pleasure to welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy the first edition of OWN Insights, from Ontology Founder, Li&nbsp;Jun.</p><p>For most of history, “technology” and productivity have always been closely linked, and “concepts” are the driving force for the transformation of production relations. Therefore, people usually think of productivity as technological progress, and link production relations to group thinking models. Although changes in technology sometimes promote or affect the organization of production relations, the direct goal or direct impact of most technologies is still the improvement of productivity. But there is one technology that seems a little different. Its proposition has always been not to solve a single productivity problem, but to build a new collaborative organization. From this point of view, it is more like a mix of “technology” and “concept”. Its “concept” brings people hope and even imagination, and this “technical” practice is constantly facing the dilemma of overlapping hopes and troubles. It is the blockchain “technology” and the Web3 “concept” behind it that alternate between hopeful fanaticism and misunderstanding disputes.</p> Technology and System — A Timeless&nbsp;Topic  The Productivity Myth <p>In a conventional context, many daily discussions of productivity are involuntarily linked to hard technology, big bangs, machinery equipment, etc.</p><p>Indeed, from an intuitive point of view, the progress of technology, including the progress of manufacturing technology and the progress of production capacity, has indeed directly promoted the development of the whole society. However, no matter if it is from a historical point of view, or from a global perspective, there is another question that is equally important. That question is why these technologies were born, and why they were born here, not there. This has become an important issue of technological development.</p><p>Going further with the comparison of productivity, macroscopically speaking, the production capacity of the whole human being can be represented by the most advanced regions, the most advanced groups, the most advanced countries or the most advanced companies in human production. However, from the micro level, everyone of us&nbsp;, every country, every organization, as small as each individual, is actually more concerned about its own productivity, its advantages in this big competition, and its own productivity in the competition.</p><p>Therefore, the commonly used indicators for evaluating the productivity of different regions, organizations and countries are using a total factor productivity, which is not common. The development capability of science and technology that we are accustomed to think about, also includes organization and collaboration, etc. and other dimensions and evaluations.</p><p>“Total factor productivity refers to the “efficiency of production activities in a certain period of time”. It is a productivity indicator that measures total output per unit of total input, that is, the ratio of total output to total factor input. The growth rate of total factor productivity is often seen as indicative of scientific and technological progress, its sources include technological progress, organizational innovation, specialization and production innovation. The general meaning of factor productivity is the efficiency of the development and utilization of resources (including human, material, and financial resources). From the perspective of economic growth, productivity and capital, labor and other factor inputs will all contribute to economic growth. From the perspective of efficiency, productivity is equivalent to the ratio of the output of the national economy to the total input of various resource factors in a certain period of time. Essentially, it reflects the ability and effort of each country (region) to eradicate poverty, and increase economic development in a certain period of time, and it is a comprehensive reflection of the role of technological progress on economic development. Total factor productivity is an indicator used to measure production efficiency. It comes from three sources: first, efficiency improvement; second, technological progress; third, scale effect. In terms of calculation, it is the “residual value” after removing the input of labor, capital, land and other factors. Since the “residual value” also includes factors that have not been identified to bring about growth, conceptual differences and measurement errors, it can only relatively measure the extent to which benefits improve technological progress.</p><p>From this evaluation dimension, although there are three elements, it can be regarded as the common collaboration of two elements. The first is the advancement of technology and science, and it is also the way we are familiar with productivity advancement. The other can be included as the efficiency of organizational collaboration, and the improvement of scale. The last element can be regarded as the improvement and progress of production relations, so from an overall perspective, the ability of an organization is the simultaneous progress of technology and production relations.</p><p>If we call one of these two elements technology, the other can be summed up as a system. The system here does not refer to a narrow political system or some corporate system, but refers to the organizational forms and forms of organizational cooperation in various activities. These two factors constitute the total factor productivity indicator of productivity. Now, we need to go deeper and ask another question, whether these two factors develop independently or depend on each other, whether they promote each other, or come one after one. This question has been debated in all economic discussions.</p> Technology and System: Which one is the Chicken-Which one is the&nbsp;Egg <p>The systems discussed in this paper do not refer to political systems in a narrow sense, but to various cooperative mechanisms in a broad sense. In the debate on the importance of technology and systems, there are basically two viewpoints, one is that technology promotes changes in systems, and the other is that systems incubate technology。</p><p>For example, the industrial revolution in history is an obvious technological revolution from an intuitive point of view. The technological innovation represented by the steam engine has brought industrial production to a new height. The process of revolution is not a technological breakthrough at a certain point in time, but small technological changes throughout a long period of time, a cumulative technological change. The people who were in the middle of industrial civilization at that time, were not going through some sudden breakthrough technological change. Many things are slowly accumulating and coming into life naturally. It can be said that even if there is no Watt, a steam engine will be born at that point in time, but it may be that another person or several other people appear at the same time. The fact is that many new inventions and breakthroughs in basic science and technology at that time were invented by different people in different parts of Europe at the same time, which proves that the accumulation of science, technology and culture in Europe at that time had reached a certain level. New technologies and new models emerge naturally.</p><p>But there is another question, in what region are these new technologies born and developed? Is it accidental or inevitable? Or is it the result of the influence of other factors behind it? It can be compared in a narrow sense to the level of science and technology. Although the industrial revolution has always been considered to have appeared in the United Kingdom, when comparing the level of science and technology, the UK was not absolutely the leader. France on the other side of the strait also had very deep basic scientific and technical talents, but most of the technological innovations of the industrial revolution were ultimately based in the UK as the main foothold and source of development. What was the reason behind&nbsp;this?</p><p>A large number of studies on the history of the industrial revolution have found that the advantages of Great Britain in the construction of systems and cooperation mechanisms helped to incubate the birth of the industrial revolution, such as its patent system, and its social and political system dominated by industry and commerce. These all allowed more technologies to be born and incubated or to be moved to the UK to thrive. Therefore, from this perspective, the collaborative mechanism or system is an important catalyst for technology and an environment for growth. Although technology is a kind of knowledge shared by all mankind, where this technology occurs, where it is used, and even where it is controlled is very important.</p><p>However, because of this analysis, it is easy to fall into the comparative advantage of the political system in the narrow sense, so that many subsequent constructions emphasize the political system as the core element. This leads to thinking that as long as certain advanced political systems are adopted, all other development progress happens naturally, but looking back, in the end, many countries with very similar political systems also have great differences in economic development and technological development. Some countries with completely different political systems have also developed very well, and have different iterative paths of economic development and technological development.</p><p>Therefore, everyone gradually realized that the system is a good foundation and incubator for technological and even economic development, but much attention only focuses on the narrow political system. For the organization, it is the construction of organizational rules and structure in a narrow sense. It is felt that the adoption of some advanced political system or corporate governance structure will naturally bring about technological development or economic development.</p><p>Historically, this process has encountered a lot of contradictions, and many good top-down plans and good designs have ultimately failed to achieve the expected results, and even brought negative catastrophic effects. What is the core reason? In the development of technology, productivity, and society, there are a large number of uncertain elements and uncertain environments. A single top-down plan will play a catalytic role at certain points in time, but it cannot achieve long-term, continuous, and perfect control and&nbsp;design.</p><p>Therefore, there is a new concept that the system or cooperation mechanism is not designed, but emerges from the bottom up from the society&nbsp;itself.</p><p>More than 100 years ago, Alexis deTocqueville, a young French political scientist, made his first inspection of American democracy and wrote the book “Democracy in America”, which introduced the democratic system construction in the United States in a systematic way, but emphasized that the the spirit of society, civic spirit, social cooperation and participation in social governance are the key elements to ensure the integrity of this system and its sustainable operation.</p><p>Another American sociology book, “Bowling Alone” by Robert D. Putnam, observes from another angle and finds that because of new technologies, such as television and the Internet, people’s communication has become more independent. The result is that in the physical world, there is less and less participation in social governance around the community and organizations. It is also pointed out with concern that such a trend is a threat to the American political and democratic systems, because its underlying bottom-up system is becoming weaker and more fragmented.</p><p>Therefore, many people soon found that just designing a good collaboration system, according to a template, cannot solve the problem once and for all. Because in actual collaboration and social development, there are a large number of new scenarios, new collaboration methods, new business processes, and new social governance needs in social and economic development, which will continue to emerge. The so-called perfect system is difficult to solve long-term problems once and for all. Even in the new situation and environmental changes, such a perfectly designed system may actually hinder development.</p><p>So, this brings up a new question, how can a bottom-up social system that can iterate, adjust and even innovate itself be&nbsp;born?</p> Social Capital: Creating The Right Conditions <p>The previous section mentioned the bottom-up nurturing environment of a society. There have been many studies in this area, including the aforementioned civic community and social studies in the United States, and also crowd’s behavioral culture are studied in the intersection of sociology or anthropology in China, etc. The concept of “social capital”, which has been very popular in recent years, is also an important point of view in this regard. Social capital is a measure of the quality of a society’s resources.</p><p>The earliest narrow concept of social capital refers to the resources available to individuals in society. Subsequently, many sociologists have proposed that social capital is a characteristic of the infrastructure of the whole society, and it is the social resources and social capital required for the development of organizational cooperation, economic development, and social governance. The following is one of the broad definitions of social&nbsp;capital.</p><p>“The similarity in the connotation of social capital is reflected in the fact that researchers view social capital as either a productive resource that promotes cooperation among actors within a social network, or as an ability to facilitate individuals to obtain resources and benefits in a social network. Scholars will add the social and cultural essentials of network, trust and regulation into the framework of social capital theory, enriching the connotation of “social capital”.”</p><p>From the broad definition of social capital, it can be seen that social capital is a comprehensive evaluation index, which includes a social culture, organization, collaboration methods, the concept of citizens, and the perfection of various infrastructures, etc. Simply speaking, it is the measure of progressive fertility of the society in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>Just like farming, when you have a very fertile land, or a better ecological environment, you can naturally grow into a place with ecological diversity, and the types of animals and plants will be very rich, and they promote and affect each other, forming a positive cycle. Putting it into the real society, this also eventually brings prosperity and development of regional or national corporate organizations.</p><p>From this point of view, going back to the previous discussion regarding the industrial revolutions, Britain first sprouted before the European continent. It was also because in the hundreds of years before the industrial revolution, Britain’s cultural, political, and economic development had nurtured the formation of such social potential.</p><p>The social capital that has nurtured the system that is conducive to technological innovation and technological development is not only a single system factor. Just like in the UK, a better patent system will emerge, because of its previous concepts/values, culture and social capital naturally formed the system and&nbsp;concept.</p><p>From this perspective, social capital can be seen as an upgraded version of the system, a root, and a soil component that grows towering&nbsp;trees.</p><p>The complementary relationship between so many technologies and systems have been discussed above, which brings us to the question: what is the relationship between Web3 and&nbsp;them?</p><p>Web3 is a special product, in the eyes of some people it is technology, in the eyes of others it is a system and a concept, so it is a bit like the wave-particle duality of light. From here, we are more willing to define Web3 as a comprehensive product of technology and&nbsp;systems.</p> Web3: An Hybrid of Technology and&nbsp;Systems <p>I talked about the integration and incubation relationship between so many technologies and systems. From the perspective of Web3, it wants to create an environment that encourages free iterations and innovations — social capital or grassroots soil. But as mentioned before, whether it’s the glorious revolution promoted by the British industrial and commercial capital to the service of the industrial revolution, or the formation of the social mechanism and civic spirit of the American social system, it is more or less spontaneous, driven by history and religion, culture and other reasons. Web3 is a bottom-up, free collaboration infrastructure that wants to be realized for&nbsp;society.</p><p>What are the core elements of Web3? Some people may mention decentralization, and of course decentralization also has degrees, so this single element may not be enough to fully summarize Web3. From my personal point of view, the core element of Web3 is to give people the “tools” and “ideas” to collaborate freely without relying on third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Historically, various collaborations in various major commercial societies will have certain dependencies on third parties. New collaboration systems, collaboration tools, and collaboration platforms need to be supported by different providers, and this provider will be embedded in the collaboration process like a&nbsp;link.</p><p>Without Internet companies, we may not be able to do social networking, e-commerce transactions and a large number of online jobs. Without the services of financial companies, we would not be able to do more large-scale transactions and capital collaboration, etc. These are all made possible with third party’s collaborative support, which of course is not free and will inevitably become part of the transaction cost. In addition, because the third party controls information, data, matching power, etc. in the intermediary link, a series of problems such as monopoly and privacy are derived. Further, you can only choose existing third-party services to complete your collaboration. If your collaboration tasks are special or do not have third-party support, many of them will not be able to get effective support even if they are willing to pay the&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Therefore, the concept of Web3 also arouses people’s hope, love and vision from the two aspects of technology and system. Technically, it is indeed possible to use a series of technologies to allow everyone to have a general decentralized collaboration tool, although it is still in the early days, but in constant iterations, everyone can do all kinds of collaborations. In terms of concepts, it has brought you a new concept of free collaboration, free combination, and self-control, a free combination of free people, which has formed a special&nbsp;concept.</p><p>Of course, you will also see some confusion in the process. First, Web3 itself is a concept that advocates bottom-up emergence, bottom-up free composition and decentralized collaboration, but Web3 has not yet been applied to the mainstream on a large scale. The concept of Web 3 itself comes from the planning of big ideas, the vision planning of Web3 is also based on concept first principles. How to find a balance between top-down planning and bottom-up emergence? That path is the main driver for the next phase of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>In addition, between free collaboration and core promotion, when you only have free collaboration, you do not have the ability to execute effectively, and you cannot provide more effective services to society. Concepts touch many people, but often when it is time to actually use services or even definitions, concepts and interests conflict, and sometimes there are obstacles, and not everyone is willing to pay for new concepts.</p><p>At this stage, the concept of Web3 itself is more like a concept proposal. There is even a top-down design of such a decentralized collaboration concept, so its birth has a certain bottom-to-bottom effect. Because, frankly speaking, Web3 has not been widely used in a large number of mainstream application scenarios, and is still in the early stage of exploration and concept development, there will be many new hopes, contradictions, confusions, and uncertainty, we will discuss these issues of Web3 in the next part of this&nbsp;series.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of general blockchain basic protocols and products provided by Ontology for Web3 applications. Basic components including data and reputation, etc., and general-purpose tools such as a Web3 wallet, etc. Web3 applications can choose different basic components according to different scenarios for easy integration. It saves Web3 applications from developing basic functions from scratch, and thus can quickly develop applications. Individual users can also quickly access Web3 applications by using OWN basic products.</p><p>This first blog, written by Ontology Founder Li Jun, is the first in a series of OWN Insights. These publications, Twitter Spaces, and much more, will provide insight into the Web3 space from a collection of industry leaders and experts. Our final goal is to bring you the best Insights, and allow you to OWN your&nbsp;value.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/technology-and-system-which-is-the-primary-productive-force-a6f8c4869ba9">Technology and System — Which is the primary productive force?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>According to Directive no. 2014/40/EU, cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco produced or imported into the EU must be marked with a unique identifier code to prevent and combat any smuggling and illicit sales phenomena.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each Member State shall appoint an entity (the ID issuer) responsible for generating and issuing unique identifiers.&nbsp; For example in Italy the Customs and Monopolies Agency is in charge to generate and verify the regular affixing of those codes on the individual packages of tobacco products placed on the market and the relative routes of the goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each ID issuer shall make&nbsp;available to operators two services, one for registration and &nbsp;the other for requesting unique codes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the operators will need to get a qualified electronic digital signature to register themselves in the system and then ask for the unique identification codes that must be affixed to the individual packages.&nbsp;</p>



 How InfoCert can support the European System for Tobacco Tracking and Tracing&nbsp; 



<p>As European leader of Digital Trust, InfoCert can issue qualified digital signature certificates helpful in several industries in order to allow different subjects to respect the European regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, InfoCert can release remote qualified certificates for automatic usage, that allow Tobacco’s companies to track any single package with a unique code, by allowing the correct tracing in any phase of the Tobacco supply chain. Thanks to InfoCert Signing APIs, a Tobacco Company can:&nbsp;</p>



  easily integrate the qualified digital signature in their existing applications  apply the requested XADES&nbsp; signature formats with a completely automatic process&nbsp;  avoid the need for a signing authorization by the owner of the certificate&nbsp;  



<p>The entire process is easy and secure, all the involved actors can apply digital signature on any documents in just few seconds. Finally, the use of Infocert’s fiduciary services allows companies to outsource the responsibility of the entire signing process.&nbsp;</p>

Source: <a href="https://www.moneylaundering.com/">MoneyLaundering.com&nbsp;:: Changes in Bank Regulations, Financial Compliance Regulations, Regulation Banks, Money Laundering Cases, Anti Money Laundering, Money Laundering Training</a> The European Union &amp; North America, are strengthening their anti-money laundering laws to prevent illicit activities.  Key Takeaways <blockquote>- The United Kingdom recently introduced “<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1082704/MLRs_SI_2022_-_Consultation_Response.pdf">Amendments to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 Statutory Instrument 2022.</a>”</blockquote><blockquote>- The amendment mentions that, subject to legislation, the Travel Rule will be enforced in the UK from 23rd September 2023.</blockquote><blockquote>- The threshold value for the Travel Rule compliance in the UK will be €1000, which may change to £1000 after the MRLs&nbsp;review.</blockquote><p>The United Kingdom is among the most important countries in the global financial ecosystem, with London being one of the only two <a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/microsites/geography/gawc/gawcworlds.html">Alpha++</a> cities worldwide. Alpha++ is the highest category according to a city as per its standing in the global financial industry. This ranking system is from a think tank known as the Globalization and World Cities Research Network&nbsp;(GaWC).</p><p>Speaking of digital assets, they have become a hot topic among the global financial circles, including in the United Kingdom. Due to the pseudo-anonymous nature of crypto-related transactions, there are concerns that illicit actors and sanctioned entities and individuals, including terrorist organizations, will turn to digital assets to circumvent the sanctions. Thus, countries, especially in the European Union &amp; North America, are strengthening their anti-money laundering laws to prevent such instances.</p><p>Recently, the United Kingdom introduced “<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1083351/MLRs_SI_2022_-_Consultation_Response_final.pdf">Amendments to the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds</a> (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 Statutory Instrument 2022.” And the country is also mandating compulsory Travel Rule compliance nationwide from 23 September 2023. Thus, subject to final legislation the UK is closing all the loopholes illicit actors and sanctioned individuals and businesses can leverage to access the country’s financial infrastructure and services.</p><p>So, let’s look at what the recent amendment to the UK’s AML/CFT provisions has in store for the virtual asset service providers.</p> Crypto-Specificity <p>Respondents who shared their opinion on a proposal to extend FATF’s recommendations over wire transfers to digital assets agreed that a crypto-specific approach is a must. Thus, the Fund Transfer Regulations (FTR) provisions that will apply to the digital assets industry must be explicitly catered to&nbsp;it.</p><p>The respondents also brought attention to the uniqueness of the virtual assets industry. They mentioned that the words “Payer” and “Payee” do not fit within the context of the virtual assets. And instead, the terms “Originator” and “Beneficiary” should be&nbsp;used.</p> Costs <p>Although the government believes there will be a considerable increase in the cost of integrating new technologies to comply with the rules, on top of regular expenses because of ongoing compliance-related procedures, the benefits outweigh the risks. After all, complying with the Travel Rule will make the crypto industry better regulated. Thus, the crypto assets will become attractive to institutional and mainstream investors.</p> Grace Period <p>Most respondents agreed that a grace period of six to twenty months must be given to the firms to begin complying with the Travel Rule. Government, too, believes that businesses will need a grace period for ease of compliance. Thus, the Travel Rule will be enforced in the UK from 23 September 2023.</p> Data Privacy <p>Respondents from the industry expressed concerns about the breadth of personally identifiable information (PII) they will have to furnish to comply with the Travel Rule. After all, coupling the information that is publicly available on the blockchain with a user’s personal information, such as date of birth, name, address, and government ID number, among other things, can expose the user’s identity and spending&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Despite the industry’s reservations around data privacy and safety, the government has decided to make no changes to the type of information required from the originator and beneficiary of a crypto transaction.</p><p>The government also clarified that it is impossible to make unilateral changes to FATF’s recommendations. After all, FAFT’s recommendations are global in nature. Besides, most countries will fully comply with the Travel Rule and demand all the information that FATF has recommended. Thus, if the UK makes any changes to Travel Rule-related compliance requirements, it will severely impact cross-border transactions.</p><p>Also, the proposal does not indicate that the personally identifiable information (PII) during cross-border crypto-asset transfers should take place on-chain. Instead, it means that data transfer should be through other publicly-inaccessible mechanisms. And in such systems, data safety can be&nbsp;ensured.</p> Intermediaries = Crypto Asset Exchanges &amp; Custodial Wallet Providers <p>In the government’s opinion, the term “intermediary” is not too broad and is rather apt for crypto exchanges and custodial wallet providers. Thus, service providers like software developers do not come under the ambit of the Travel Rule, but third-party custodial wallet service providers do.</p> An Exemption for Exchange of Crypto Assets Between UK-based&nbsp;VASPs <p>When crypto-asset transfers take place between crypto exchanges located within the United Kingdom, it won’t come under the Travel Rule. Hence, for intra-country transactions, there won’t be any need to share the personal data of users involved in the transaction.</p> Threshold Amount <p>The government has kept the minimum threshold for Travel Rule at 1,000 Euros (rather than GBP). That said, there is a possibility of changing the threshold value to pounds from euros after the MRLs&nbsp;review.</p><p>Fiat and crypto-asset transactions will be treated separately to calculate the minimum threshold value. And the fiat currency transfers will be subject to Fund Transfer Regulations (FTR) provisions.</p> Unhosted Wallets <p>When it comes to unhosted wallets, the government will only mandate the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) when the risk of illicit financial activity is higher. The government has not entirely done away with this requirement, as this move would otherwise become an attractive incentive for criminals to undermine the current protocol.</p> Summary <p>All in all, the 2023 implementation of the Travel Rule in the United Kingdom has both positive and negative aspects. The positive aspect is that VASPs have a clear deadline to prepare themselves before the implementation of the Travel Rule. And the negative aspect is that the VASPs outside the UK will find it challenging to comply with the Travel Rule if they do business with the&nbsp;country.</p><p>Well, there’s a solution to this problem. Veriscope! First, it is a highly-secured Travel Rule Service Provider that can act as a safeguard against data privacy-related risks. Veriscope is special because it does not store PII, and the transfer of personal information is exclusively VASP to VASP. At no point does Veriscope access the data. Besides, Veriscope allows VASPs to obtain explicit consent from their users to prevent data&nbsp;mining.</p><p>And second, VASPs with counterparties in the United Kingdom can submit their request for information now, and once the UK-based VASPs come online, they will respond to their requests. Thus, solving the puzzle of the “Sunrise issue” in the process. All thanks to Veriscope “Historic Look-back” feature. So, all VASPs need to do for now is sign up for Veriscope and start submitting requests for information from UK-based&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>As the date for implementing the FATF Travel Rule in the United Kingdom has been announced, VASPs must plan accordingly and be prepared beforehand. The first thing that VASPs must do is choose a Travel Rule Service Provider (TRSP). Speaking of TRSPs, <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope </a>is the best solution in the market, and is already compliant to FATF and proposed-UK standards. After all, with Veriscope, you don’t have to worry about VASP data discovery, data privacy and security, Know Your VASP, and payment screening-related challenges.</p><p>Visit our website to know more about Veriscope: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">https://www.veriscope.network/</a> and <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/contact">contact our BizDev team</a> for a discussion.</p><p>Also, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShyftNetwork">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork">Medium</a> to get regular updates on the evolving regulatory landscape in the world of digital&nbsp;assets.</p>

<p>OAuth is an abbreviation for Open Authorization. It’s an open standard that anyone can implement. More specifically, OAuth is a standard that apps can use to provide client applications with "secure delegated access." OAuth works over HTTPS and authorizes devices, APIs, servers, and applications with access tokens rather than credentials.</p>
 
 
<p>In the old days (2006), websites used to prompt users for their Gmail credentials, so they could invite their contacts to use the website. Users often provided credentials, but there was no proof that the website didn’t store them for later use. OAuth was developed so users don’t have to provide credentials. Instead, users provide an access token from a trusted identity provider.</p>
 
 
<p>You can think of OAuth like hotel key cards, but for apps. If you have a hotel key card, you can get access to your room.</p>
 
 
<p>How do you get a hotel key card? You have to do an authentication process at the front desk to get it. After authenticating and obtaining the key card, you can access other resources across the hotel.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>OAuth 2.0 is not an authentication protocol.</p>
 
 
<p>OpenID Connect (aka OIDC) is an authentication protocol. I’ll cover that in another post.</p>
 
 
<p>OAuth 2.0 has many flows and <a href="https://oauth.net/2.1/">OAuth 2.1</a> is an in-progress effort to consolidate and simplify the best flows for developers. In a nutshell, OAuth 2.1 requires Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for authorization code flows and implicit and password credential flows are removed.</p>
 
 






You can learn more about PKCE by reading <a>Use PKCE with OAuth 2.0 and Spring Boot for Better Security</a>.



 
 
<p>If you’d like to play with OAuth 2.0’s flows, you can try the <a href="https://www.oauth.com/playground/">OAuth 2.0 Playground</a> (built by <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronpk">Aaron Parecki</a>).</p>
 
 
 
<a href="https://www.oauth.com/playground/"></a>
 
 
 
 
 
 Can you do OAuth without a browser? 
 
 
<p>Developers often wonder, is it possible to do an OAuth flow without a browser in the mix? The short answer is No.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/briandemers/status/1520104453155835905">A browser is required</a>. The browser doesn’t need to be on the same device. There are basically three options if a user is involved:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Web app: handle a redirect</p>
 
 
<p>CLI, TV, etc: use the Device Grant (browser on another device), app uses REST</p>
 
 
<p>Native app: use a custom URL handler</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Java’s OAuth 2.0 support 
 
 
<p>Java, the language, does not have built-in OAuth support. In fact, the JDK doesn’t even contain APIs to write a web app. The basic building blocks for constructing web apps are provided by the <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/">Servlet API and Jakarta EE</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The Servlet specification has a <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/5.0/jakarta-servlet-spec-5.0.html#security">security section</a>, but there’s no OAuth in it. The <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/security/3.0/">Jakarta Security 3.0</a> (still under development at the time of this writing) does mention that OpenID Connect and OAuth did not make it into the specification. To me, it seems strange that the "enterprise edition" of Java doesn’t have support for delegated authorization or federated identity. Hopefully, we can work as a community to fix this in the future.</p>
 
 
<p>On the upside, Java 18 does contain a <code>jwebserver</code> you can use to <a href="https://inside.java/2021/12/06/working-with-the-simple-web-server/">serve up static files</a>. That’s about all the "web" you’ll find in the JDK.</p>
 
 
 OAuth in Java frameworks 
 
<p>When SAML was first invented in 2005, Java web frameworks were experiencing their peak popularity. There were hundreds of Java web frameworks, and developers would make fun of this embarrassment of riches like they did with JavaScript frameworks in the late 2000s.</p>
 
 
 
<a></a>
 
 
 
<p>This History of Web Frameworks Timeline image is <a href="https://github.com/mraible/history-of-web-frameworks-timeline">maintained on GitHub</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible">@mraible</a></p>
 
 
<p>Most Java web frameworks supported a form of MVC and others were component-based. All of them rendered their UIs on the server-side.</p>
 
 
<p>Fast-forward to 2022, and Java is mainly used for APIs, while JavaScript is often used for UIs.</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
I do find it ironic that there are now several JavaScript frameworks that provide developers joy with server-side rendering. It’s like the Java MVC frameworks of old but relatively new to JavaScript. History repeats itself, eh?
</blockquote>
 
— Matt Raible
 
 
 
<p>One of OAuth’s key patterns is a resource server. A resource server accepts an access token. If the token is valid, it gives a client access to the resource owner’s data. In this example, a client is an app, the resource owner is a user, and the resource server is the Java API you develop.</p>
 
 
<p>In the section below, I’ll show you how you can use OAuth and set up a resource server with the most popular Java frameworks. You might think that Spring Boot is the de facto standard, and you should just use it. However, there’s a lot of innovation happening elsewhere, and I think it’s good to be aware of other options.</p>
 
 
 
 MicroProfile JWT authentication 
 
<p>When Java EE stagnated in the early 2010s, the Java EE community did too and eventually created MicroProfile in 2015. MicroProfile is a standards-based effort to group the parts of Java EE that can be used to create a microservice architecture.</p>
 
 
<p>As part of MicroProfile, there is a JWT Auth specification. Even though it doesn’t mention OAuth, it’s very much a viable way to implement an OAuth 2.0 resource server.</p>
 
 
<p>Suppose you’re using a Java framework that supports MicroProfile. In that case, you can likely add the framework’s JWT authentication dependency, plus a couple of properties to define the issuer and JWKS (JSON Web Token Key Signatures) location. The key names are standardized and can be used in frameworks like Helidon and Quarkus.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>What annoys me about this configuration is that <code>issuer</code> is an OpenID Connect concept that allows you to find all the endpoints for an identity provider, including the location of the JWKS keys. If you go to <code>${issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration</code>, it has the location of the public keys in the <code>jwks_uri</code> value!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>I really wish MicroProfile made things easier on the developer so you only have to specify the issuer.</p>
 
 
<p>The good news is you should be able to refer to one property from another.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default
mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=${mp.jwt.verify.issuer}/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>&lt;rant/&gt;</p>
 
 
 
 
 Quarkus 
 
<p>If you want to use MicroProfile JWT authentication with Quarkus, you need to add the properties above and a single dependency.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-smallrye-jwt&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Helidon 
 
<p>Helidon is very similar to Quarkus. The only difference is its dependency’s coordinates.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.helidon.microprofile.jwt&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;helidon-microprofile-jwt-auth&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I’ve already mentioned Helidon and Quarkus. What about the other popular Java API frameworks?</p>
 
 
 
 
 Micronaut 
 
<p>Micronaut has support for OAuth and good documentation on how to configure it with IdPs like <a href="https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-oauth2-okta.html">Okta</a>, <a href="https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-oauth2-oidc-google.html">Google</a>, and <a href="https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-oauth2-github.html">GitHub</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Micronaut requires many more lines of configuration than MicroProfile, but it’s mostly YAML’s fault. It takes you 11 lines to configure an OAuth 2.0 resource server.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>micronaut:
  security:
    enabled: true
    token:
      jwt:
        enabled: true
        claims-validators:
          issuer: https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default
        signatures:
          jwks:
            okta:
              url: https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>As you can see, Micronaut also requires you to specify the JWKS location, even though it can be looked up from the issuer. <code>:shakes-fist:</code></p>
 
 
 
 Spring Boot 
 
<p>Spring Boot uses Spring Security by default, and it’s the only framework that allows you to configure a resource server with one line of code.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=https://dev-13337.okta.com/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Of course, you could use YAML instead. That would be a bad life choice. Then it would require six lines of code. Don’t be that person. 😉 Spring Security is smart enough to look up the JWKS location from the issuer.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot will <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/252cf9433252b08d8af6dc2457dea57b99658d6b/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/security/oauth2/resource/servlet/OAuth2ResourceServerJwtConfiguration.java#L100-L112">auto-configure Spring Security’s filter chain for a resource server</a>, so that’s all the code you need!</p>
 
 






If you use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">Okta Spring Boot Starter</a>, you’ll also have <code>oauthClient()</code> and <code>oauth2Login()</code> <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/blob/ba1f203bdfc9ae7e969b7b5bc1cba211b38d9cc7/oauth2/src/main/java/com/okta/spring/boot/oauth/OktaOAuth2AutoConfig.java#L76-L90">auto-configured</a>.

 Watch OAuth 2.0 in action with Java frameworks 
 
 
<p>I’ve created a few screencasts to show how to build a REST API with Quarkus, Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Helidon. These videos also show how to secure each API with OAuth 2.0.</p>
 
 
   
    
   
   
    
   
   
    
   
   
    
   
 
 
<p>At the end of each video, I show how the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> allows you to create working examples for each framework with the <code>okta start</code> command.</p>

 Java web frameworks without OAuth support 
 
 
<p>You might get away with saying that JSF and Wicket don’t have OAuth support. However, they both build on the Servlet API, so it is possible to use them with some of Java’s independent-minded security frameworks.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s possible your favorite framework doesn’t have a dedicated security plugin for OAuth, but that’s not important if you can get something to work, IMHO.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Java security frameworks 
 
 
<p>A few Java security frameworks aren’t tied to a specific web framework. I like to call them independent-minded, but honestly, they seem to struggle as volunteer-driven versus funded open source projects.</p>
 
 
 Apache Shiro 
 
<p>Apache Shiro expects to operate in a servlet environment and can work with any framework based on servlets and filters. It has many <a href="https://shiro.apache.org/integration.html">integrations</a>—such as Play, Wicket, and Lift—but most are dated and unmaintained.</p>
 
 
<p>Shiro can be adapted to work with OAuth 2.0, as demonstrated by Brian Demers in <a>Build a Secure Java Application with Apache Shiro and OAuth 2.0</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 Pac4j 
 
<p>Pac4j is a security framework with many sub-projects implementing OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and many others, like SAML.</p>
 
 
<p>A gentle reminder:</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>"SAML is to OIDC as SOAP is to REST." -- <a href="https://twitter.com/jf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jf</a></p>— Matt Raible 🌴 (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1379871695163510795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2021</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>When a framework doesn’t have OAuth support, I’ve been able to use Pac4J successfully. For example, with <a>Play framework</a> and <a>plain ol' Java EE</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>You don’t hear much about Pac4J in the Java ecosystem. I’m not sure why that is. I’ve heard its quality isn’t that great, and I also believe it suffers because it’s not tied to a popular framework.</p>
 
 
<p>It’s kinda like the every-language-needs-a-framework concept. Maybe every security framework needs a web framework to help it succeed?</p>
 
 
 
 Spring Security 
 
<p>Spring Security has excellent integration with Spring Boot and it depends on the Spring Framework. However, you can use it to secure a <a>Java EE app that uses filters</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>It has <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/index.html">OAuth 2.0</a>, <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/login/index.html">OpenID Connect</a>, and even <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/index.html">SAML</a> support.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>It’s a shame Spring Security has to support SAML. 😞</p>
 
 
<p>Apparently, there’s a demand for SAML from Spring Security customers and users. Or maybe it’s just misinformed decision-makers? Are developers still implementing SOAP APIs? I hope not! If not, why are developers still using SAML?!</p>
 
 
<p>OIDC does it better. Just use it!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 OAuth 2.0 authorization servers 
 
 
<p>Up to this point, all the things I’ve talked about are OAuth clients. They require an identity provider to do OAuth flows. An identity provider has OAuth 2.0 authorization servers. Most of the prominent providers have their own proprietary implementation.</p>
 
 
<p>However, there are a couple of open source Java-based authorization servers you can use:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloak</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-authorization-server">Spring Authorization Server</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://github.com/wso2/product-is">WSO2 Identity Server</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Since I work for a company that is an OAuth 2.0 identity provider, it’s my duty to inform you that using one of these is called "building your own." We recommend buying instead. From us, of course. 😉</p>
 
 
<p>In reality, if you’re a developer, you’re always going to build your own somewhat. Even if you use a library like Spring Security, you can’t just add it to your project and expect everything to work without writing any code. Granted, it might only require ten lines of code, but you’re still building something.</p>
 
 
<p>You can’t just buy Okta and secure a Java API with it without writing code.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What about JavaFX? 
 
 
<p>JavaFX is often touted as an excellent way to build desktop apps. The folks that recommend it are typically JavaFX experts and Java enthusiasts that hate JavaScript.</p>
 
 
<p>JavaFX’s OAuth support is virtually non-existent, and there don’t seem to be many folks interested in fixing that.</p>
 
 
<p>As one of the few Java Champions that likes JavaScript, I poked the bear several weeks ago.</p>
 
 <blockquote><p>If <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JavaFX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JavaFX</a> is better than <a href="https://twitter.com/electronjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@electronjs</a> for desktop apps, why are there no good OAuth or OIDC libraries for it?<br><br>To be fair, there is a library from Microsoft, but it requires Oracle's JDK 8, doesn't work on Windows, and the project is no longer maintained.<a href="https://t.co/53kcnRKrKJ">https://t.co/53kcnRKrKJ</a></p>— Matt Raible 🌴 (@mraible) <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1520048029641986048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2022</a></blockquote>

 
 
<p>My guess is this won’t be solved anytime soon. I’d love to be wrong.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Do Scala and Kotlin support OAuth? 
 
 
<p>Scala was all the rage in the mid-2010s. When the Play framework team announced they were writing Play 2 in Scala, the JVM world rejoiced. I was interested in it too. I took a course from Martin Odersky, learned a ton, and reached the top of Hacker News when I <a href="https://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/play_2_0_a_web">live-blogged about it</a> at Devoxx Belgium in 2011.</p>
 
 
<p>Since then, Play’s popularity has waned, Spring Boot has taken over, and Kotlin is a JVM language that many developers admire.</p>
 
 
<p>The good news for these languages is they have excellent Java interop. In theory, you should be able to use any Java security library for your Scala or Kotlin app. However, each language has its own web frameworks, so it might not be that easy.</p>
 
 
<p>The most popular Scala web framework is still Play and it does have <a href="https://www.playframework.com/modules/oauth-1.0/home">OAuth support</a>. Kotlin has Ktor, and it has easy-to-use <a href="https://ktor.io/docs/oauth.html">OAuth support</a> too.</p>
 
 
<p>We published a tutorial about <a>Ktor and Okta</a> in late 2020.</p>

<p>Dr Ashley joined Warren Anderson, CEO at Discreet Labs, and Moushmi Banerjee, Senior Software Architect at Okta Inc. at the conference, which attracted hundreds of privacy tech and Web 3.0 key players.</p>



<p>Each panellist described recent privacy developments in the Web 3.0 space, which largely center on decentralized identity (DI). Dr Ashley spoke about digital wallets, verifiable data registries, verifiable credentials and identity hubs.&nbsp;Moushmi Banerjee added to verifiable credentials and explained zero knowledge proofs, while Warren Anderson looked at Discreet Lab’s work in building scalable privacy systems for Web 3.0 and the Findora public blockchain.</p>



<p>If you’re fairly new to Web 3.0 and DI, you might appreciate this context:</p>



 



 What is Web 3.0? 



<p></p>



<p>Web 3.0 is the latest iteration of the internet that’s arriving even as Web 2.0 still consumes us. It will shake up data privacy and change the data economy as we know it. Here’s a quick history:</p>



  Web 1.0 was the “read only” web, with static web pages connected with hyperlinks.  



  Web 2.0 is the “interactive; anyone can author and share content” web. It has e-commerce and social media and is&nbsp;highly centralized, with web sites and services collecting users’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a> in exchange for access (think Meta, Google et al. knowing everything about us). This centralized model has led to&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>&nbsp;(the data economy) and the trade of highly profitable personal data for serving up&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">personalized ads</a>&nbsp;and influencing decisions, which in turn has led to widespread&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data abuse</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/the-growing-risks-to-business-and-their-customers-from-the-dark-web/">misuse</a>&nbsp;– and the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">global data privacy crisis</a>&nbsp;we currently face.  



  Web 3.0 promises to solve the privacy and security challenges of its predecessor by flipping the model to&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;and returning control over personal data to users. It has been&nbsp;<a href="https://au.pcmag.com/help/92462/what-is-web3-and-how-will-it-work">called</a>&nbsp;a “decentralized digital infrastructure” because it uses blockchain technology and decentralized identity technology to give users digital identities that aren’t connected to their personal identity (just as Anonyome Labs’&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identity has done for years now). In doing so, Web 3.0 moves the user away from being the “product” as a result of their information sharing to being the “owner” of the information they share: they control which pieces of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;(name, date of birth, phone number, SSN etc.) they share in any given context. This essentially means paper and plastic IDs are replaced with digital versions housed in a digital wallet on a user’s device and completely under their control (no centralized authority storing or verifying). On Web 3.0, the user controls where to be identified and where to be anonymous.  



 What is decentralized identity? 



<p></p>



<p>If Web 3.0 will shake things up, then decentralized identity will be doing a lot of the shaking.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs has long foreseen that, to work, Web 3.0 will depend on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;(DI) technologies and standards to&nbsp;verify and exchange private information and develop trusted, secure digital relationships between users and services. DI is what will make digital identities being completely under the user’s control possible.</p>



<p>We believe DI delivers everything an effective Web 3.0 application needs:&nbsp;<br></p>



  Verifiable – allows authorities to issue statements about a subject (e.g. to prove their identity&nbsp;  Trustless – no requirement on the user to place their sole trust in any one third party in order for a network or payment system to function  Self-governing – allows users to retain full control over their personal information&nbsp;  Permissionless – no restrictions, and no central authority or administrator controls participation&nbsp;  Distributed and robust – stored on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">blockchain</a>&nbsp;technology, a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network (as used in cryptocurrency)  Stateful – all transactions are immutable and stored in the distributed database of the network  Native built-in payments – facilitates the exchange of payment information  Standards-based and open source – sets “rules” to enable interoperability across web sites and services.&nbsp;

<p>Since Web 3.0 will depend on decentralized identity as its privacy-enhanced identity layer, Dr Paul Ashley was an obvious choice for the TROPT inaugural panel on the intersection of Web 3.0 and priv tech.&nbsp;Decentralized identify fits easily with Anonyome Lab’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identity model, which is helping to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/04/part-1-how-the-sudo-digital-identity-can-help-stop-the-attack-on-personal-privacy%ef%bf%bc/">stop the full-scale attack on personal privacy</a>, and is available alongside a range of decentralized identity capabilities through our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;SDKs, to help enterprises rapidly develop and deploy customer privacy solutions.</p>



<p>We have written a lot about decentralized identity, including our 5-part blog series which starts&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/04/how-your-business-can-rapidly-deliver-customer-privacy-solutions-with-the-sudo-platform-a-5-part-series%ef%bf%bc/">here</a>.</p>



 Beyond Sudo Platform, Anonyome Labs supports the ongoing development of decentralized identity by: 



  helping to run three decentralized identity-focused blockchains  being an active contributor to the decentralized identity standards organizations  contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community.

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

<p>RapidLEI has been a fast growing organisation identity service since being launched by Ubisecure in 2018. RapidLEI was designed from the ground-up to utilise automation, a global partner network and close business registry relationships to better support the broad range of Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) use cases. The goal, to dramatically grow LEI usage by organisations and improve how businesses identify each other in cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>With the significant growth in the uptake of LEIs, over 2 million of these organisation identifier codes have been registered to date. The Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF) has predicted that 20 million LEIs will be in use by 2027. The challenge is to encourage every organisation to have an LEI – whether voluntarily or led by regulatory mandates. This will be down to education, but also is where our simple and quick LEI issuance platform can help to increase the number of companies with LEIs. Once all organisations have LEIs this will improve transactions and onboarding processes, eliminating the delay of applying for an LEI.</p>
 What is an LEI? 
<p>An LEI is a 20-digit alphanumeric code, which acts as a global identifier to represent an organisation’s identity. It was created to better identify companies in cross border transactions, as different countries have historically used different identifiers. After the 2008 financial crisis, the G20 agreed that the introduction of LEIs could solve the global lack of corporate transparency and answer the critical questions of “who is who” and “who owns whom”. Organisations must complete an annual verification process, which is globally standardised, to gain their LEI, providing a greater level of transparency about the organisation. There are over 116 different <a href="https://rapidlei.com/lei-regulation/">regulations that either require or recommend the use of LEIs</a>.</p>
 KYC and LEIs 
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) is the process of verifying the identity of a customer (or client) and is usually undertaken by organisations that require a highly-assured level of trust about who they are doing business with (such as banks). KYC covers both individuals and businesses, also known as KYB (Know Your Business).</p>
<p>Ubisecure believes that the LEI should be central to KYC/KYB. LEI in KYC provides the ideal technology to streamline KYC and onboarding. LEIs are verified organisation identities, that represent important KYC data points such as historical legal names, incorporation jurisdictions, entity status and much, much more. As the LEI issuer we also maintain verified information on parental and child structure, company officers etc. To make the LEI provide benefits in the KYC use case, we built the technology and commercial solution to allow for LEI registrations to be built directly in KYC workflows and applications.</p>
<p>The GLEIF is also a vocal advocate of the benefits that the LEI brings to KYC, and reported that: </p>
<blockquote><p>“Today, the global banking sector spends around U.S.$40 billion on client onboarding annually. That’s an estimated U.S.$54m per bank, U.S.$31m of which is ‘people’ cost. Productivity improvements gained through LEI usage could generate cross-sector cost reductions of between 5-10% annually.” </p></blockquote>
<p>We see the LEI adding a lot of value to KYC . It is a standardised identifier, centrally maintained in the Global LEI System, a free-to-use database of organisation identities. The LEI maintains historical changes in organisation data and attributes, and acts as a live record, so information is always up to date.</p>
<p>The Global LEI Foundation and McKinsey published a <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/gleif-identifies-that-over-half-of-salespeople-in-banking-spend-27-of-their-working-week-onboarding-new-client-organizations">report</a> stating that in banking alone, senior salespeople can spend up to 1.5 days of their week onboarding new clients. This can lead to serious economic impact. Without LEIs, banks use many different identifiers. This can lead to inconsistencies alongside there being a considerable admin overhead and customer service impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">LEI Everywhere</a> from Ubisecure is a programme designed for Banks and other financial institutions, which democratises availability of LEIs by lowering costs and allowing LEIs to be issued within existing onboarding or transaction processes to avoid interrupted of service. LEI Everywhere provides an API for fully integrated LEI lookup, registration, and renewal into KYC applications. Reduced fees also make it feasible for Banks to register LEIs on behalf of clients. Both aiding the KYC process and reducing the risk of regulatory non-compliance when transacting on behalf of clients.</p>
 Why RapidLEI? 
<p>Ubisecure gained its LEI issuance accreditation from GLEIF in 2018, allowing us to become an LEI Issuer through our RapidLEI brand. Becoming an LEI issuer has complemented the Ubisecure solution portfolio, proving us as a leading provider of strong organisation identities, and supporting our greater mission within the Identity &amp; Access Management space.</p>
<p>Ubisecure brought innovation to the LEI market by automating LEI issuance. Revolutionising how quickly and effectively an LEI can be registered. While improving data accuracy along the way by connecting directly to business registries globally. This innovation has helped RapidLEI to become the #1 LEI Issuer globally, issuing about 1 in 4 new LEIs monthly, in just 3 short years.</p>
<p>Ubisecure will continue to work towards the challenge of ensuring that every organisation has an LEI. To achieve this, along with the GLIEF and other LEI ecosystem stakeholders, we believe LEIs should be closely tied to KYC to both streamline and support existing KYC processes.

Also, in the online world, the creation of an ID has become more flexible. One person can create different emails in their name, for example, without a great amount of bureaucracy — but which of those IDs can be trustworthy?”</p><p>In Web2, identity mainly refers to information surrounding ancestry and real-life occupations. In the Web3 era, identity is endowed with richer connotations. For users to carry out various activities on-chain, they need a digital identity in the form of an address. Many people may think that the activities on-chain mainly focus on financial activities, such as transfers and pledges, but this is not the case. The most important element is the users themselves. Based on blockchain technology, the required data and information will go hand in hand, accompanied by a valid on-chain user who has been verified by KYC from beginning to&nbsp;end.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-june-7-13-2022-973508710903">Ontology Weekly Report (June 7–13, 2022)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introducing Sign-in with Web3 — Building a Non-Custodial World <p>In a much needed multi-chain extension to Sign-in with Ethereum, users will now be able to control their digital identity with their Ethereum/ENS, Solana, and Starknet accounts instead of relying on traditional/custodial profiles.</p><p>Importance of building a non-custodial future</p><p>In crypto, there is a saying that goes “Not your keys, not your crypto ‘’ exemplifying the importance of non-custodiality, — the need to shift the dynamic of ownership from entities to the end-user. The principle also extends beyond just the crypto you hold to your very identity itself. While traditional Web2 entities have done a tremendous job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive but that has also come at a cost — the cost of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There is excessive monetization of the users’ activity and their residing information on the web. Security compromises even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly common. As the average user is becoming more and more aware of these tradeoffs, the voice to safeguard their identity is growing louder by the day. We at Web3Auth firmly believe that non-custodiality is the future and we want to lead the way in making it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Sign-in With Web3 — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity</p><p>Web3 has to a large extent cracked the code for the user privacy problem. The power of public and private keys, enabled by crypto technologies, allows users to own their username, and profile data, and use their accounts across different applications. This is the fundamental on which built Web3Auth was built — to leverage the power of threshold cryptography to shift the dynamic of power from entities to individuals. When the Ethereum Foundation announced Sign-in with Ethereum, it was not only an important(albeit silent) innovation for the internet, it was also a solid validation and acknowledgement of our core&nbsp;values.</p><p>Sign-in with Web3 adds on to that innovation with a powerful multi-chain twist. It extends that innovation to some of the biggest chain ecosystems. Starting today, users on the Ethereum, Solana, and Starknet chains can log in to any Web2 application using their web3 identities thereby bringing the security and privacy of Web3 authentication to&nbsp;Web2.</p><p>What Does Sign-in With Web3&nbsp;Solve?</p><p>Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms and thus naturally, there arises a need to have a standard specification for authentication with Web3 identities. This led to the birth of<a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md"> CAIP-74</a> which allows for creating a chain-agnostic Object Capability (CACAO), based on a signing message as an IPLD object. Sign in with Web3 endeavours to maintain compatibility with CAIP-74, thereby adhering to a chain agnostic standard.</p> Supported Chains<a href="https://siww.web3auth.io/#supported-chains">​</a> <p>Currently, Sign-in with Web3&nbsp;supports</p>  Ethereum  Solana  Starknet  <p>**Support for more chains coming&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Do check our<a href="https://siww.web3auth.io/"> documentation</a> for a step by step guide on how to build a Sign-in with Web3 flow to navigate the authentication logic. Feel free to reach out to us in case you have questions on our<a href="https://t.me/web3authdev"> Telegram&nbsp;Chat</a></p><p>Additionally, Web3Auth, the creator of Sign-in with Web3, offers a dedicated <a href="http://docs.web3auth.io">suite of authentication</a> tools for all Web3 Developers.

  <p>The NIS Directive aimed at achieving a common standard of network and information security across all EU Member States, with a focus on operators of essential services, is scheduled for an update. Suppliers of utilities, healthcare, transport, communications, and other services need to know what changes are coming and what they need to do to comply.</p>
<p>Since the NIS Directive was adopted in 2016, network and information systems have developed into a central feature of everyday life, driven by digital transformation. This has led to an expansion of the cybersecurity attack surface. In response to these challenges, the proposed NIS 2 Directive repeals and builds on the existing NIS directive.</p>
<p>Join this session with two spokespeople from Duo Security, part of Cisco Secure: Advisory CISO Richard Archdeacon, and Head of Solution Engineering, Andy Mayle, and Mike Small, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole for a discussion about what changes are coming, why they are being introduced, and how the scope is widening.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/changing-scope-nis2"></a>

 Nuggets and iProov Partner To Bring Biometrically Verified Self-Sovereign Identity and Payments to Web 2 and&nbsp;Web3 <p>The strategic partnership combines Nuggets’ self-sovereign ID with iProov’s biometric face verification, enhancing user privacy and security.</p><p><a href="https://nuggets.life/">Nuggets</a> has integrated with <a href="https://www.iproov.com/why-iproov/the-problem-we-solve/genuine-presence">iProov’s Genuine Presence Assurance®</a> and <a href="https://www.iproov.com/iproov-system/technology/liveness-assurance">Liveness Assurance™</a> technology to ensure compatibility with Self-Sovereign principles and open standards, including W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p><p>The integration enables users to own and control their <a href="https://www.iproov.com/iproov-system/iproov-products-for-biometric-authentication/iproov-face-verifier">biometric template</a>, which can then be used to authenticate transactions using iProov in a private and secure manner. Nuggets have implemented iProov’s technology in conjunction with its own NFC Passport onboarding and re-verification to enable truly trusted transactions.</p><p>This extra step ensures that the user behind an identity is always who it should be, above and beyond the device biometrics. iProov’s Genuine Presence Assurance and Liveness Assurance technologies enable organizations to verify that an online user is the right person and a real&nbsp;person.</p><p>In doing so, Nuggets protects users and businesses by preventing stolen or forged identities from being used for new account fraud and account takeover fraud. iProov’s award-winning technology is device and platform agnostic, working across any computer, tablet, or cellphone with a user-facing camera.</p><p>Driven by emerging regulations such as Europe’s <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281&amp;from=EN">eIDAS 2.0</a> for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), the collaboration looks to service the global demand for robust, empowering digital identity services. Increasingly, consumer needs are moving towards self-sovereign, user-controlled digital identities that are reusable, interoperable, decentralized, and powered by blockchain technology.</p><p>There is also a clear demand for such services from direct digital attestation end-users — such as passport offices and driver and vehicle licensing bodies in the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202110/new-mobile-driving-license-initiatives-unveiled-in-europe-and-the-u-s">US, EU</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dvla-strategic-plan-2021-to-2024/dvla-strategic-plan-2021-to-2024">UK</a>. Along with other civil and private registration services, these organizations highlight the need for increased provision of private and secure digital identities combined with biometric verification across a host of Web2-centric end-user implementations.</p><p>Nuggets’ platform-agnostic, non-custodial identity solution can service this demand, functioning as a reusable, interoperable Self-Sovereign ID (SSI) with a merit-based digital user reputation that travels with the user across Web 2.0, Web3, and Metaverse applications. Nuggets enables trusted transactions, with verified digital identities for every transaction.</p><p>Alastair Johnson, co-founder and CEO of Nuggets, said: “With services increasingly operating within a virtual environment, the need for a reusable and interoperable self-sovereign identity has never been greater. By combining Nuggets and iProov in a Self-Sovereign manner, we enable a high level of biometric verification that is now owned and controlled by the user for the first time. This will bring a new level of privacy, security, and confidence to both users and businesses in markets requiring eIDAS 2.0 (EU), GPG45 (UK), and NIST (USA) in the&nbsp;future.”</p><p>Andrew Bud, Founder and CEO of iProov, said: “We are delighted that iProov’s face biometric verification and authentication technologies have been chosen by Nuggets. It is vital that only the right person should ever be able to control and use their digital wallet, so that user-owned digital identity solutions can be trusted by users and by the organisations that rely on them. This will be of crucial importance as we approach eIDAS 2.0 and the implementation of digital wallets in the UK and throughout the European&nbsp;Union.”</p><p>If you’re a business looking to implement reusable digital identity, and for better ways to protect customer data, you can now enable Nuggets worldwide.</p><p>Get in touch and find out how at <a href="mailto:partners@nuggets.life">partners@nuggets.life</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/nuggets-and-iproov-partner-to-bring-biometrically-verified-self-sovereign-identity-and-payments-to-b23c03946452">Nuggets and iProov Partner To Bring Biometrically Verified Self-Sovereign Identity and Payments to…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/">Cosmos DB</a> is a cloud database product from Microsoft that offers scalable and high-performance services. The core product runs on a proprietary NoSQL database that should look familiar to experienced MongoDB developers. Microsoft offers several APIs in addition to the core Cosmos DB API. These include APIs for:</p>

 
   SQL 
   MongoDB 
   Gremlin 
   Cassandra 
 

<p>The shift to serverless database operations is one of the most obvious advantages of migrating. Cosmos DB can automatically scale your throughput based on load, rather than the traditional provisioning of throughput in advance.</p>

<p>As developers, we need to be mindful of how we can protect data at rest. In this article, you will learn how Cosmos DB helps to protect data at rest and what you can do to remove sensitive data like personally identifiable information (PII) from data that you intend to store in Cosmos DB.</p>

 A secure application for PII 

<p>One of my first jobs in development was writing applications that would perform a <code>scrubbing</code> process on personal data coming from clients. Effectively we would receive data that included the person’s name, social security number, and address. This data would then be sent out for verification to a consumer reporting corporation,  and that company would return a result letting us know if the address was current and if the information we’d received was correct. Once the data returned we could import the result into our software and if the scrub came back successful then the account was a valid contact.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will do the same process. You will build an ASP.NET Core web application on .NET 6 that accepts a CSV file with a person’s name and social security number. You will send that to a dummy scrub service. Then you will record the results in a Cosmos DB account. But the word has come from your boss that you cannot store the social security number. So you will learn how to remove that information from your data model before storing it in Cosmos DB.</p>

<p>To continue you will need:</p>

 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2022</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0">.NET 6</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">free Okta Developer Account</a> (to handle your OAuth needs) 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
   An <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure account with a subscription</a> 
 

<p>Of course, if you just want to see the code feel free <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta_dotnet_cosmosdb_example">to view it on Github</a>.</p>

 Cosmos DB overview 

<p>Like most Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings, Cosmos DB provides many features for security and performance. There are too many to list here. Finding the documentation on Microsoft’s endless labyrinth of docs is challenging enough. But I do want to touch on a few highlights.</p>

<p>First, as a PaaS, Microsoft takes responsibility for network controls, host infrastructure, and physical security. They share application-level controls and identity access with you as well as the data classification. Endpoint protection is your responsibility.</p>

<p>It is important to note though that <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/faq#:~:text=Is%20Azure%20Cosmos%20DB%20HIPAA,of%20individually%20identifiable%20health%20information">Azure is HIPPA compliant</a>. Ultimately, the data that you choose to store is your responsibility and subject to laws and regulations that are out of scope for this article.</p>

<p>You should also take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Cosmos DB resource model. I won’t go into it too deeply here, but the short version is that a <code>database account</code> owns a <code>database</code>. The <code>database</code> contains <code>containers</code>. <code>Containers</code> can contain <code>items</code>, <code>stored procedures</code>, <code>triggers</code>, and other objects. In this tutorial, you will create the database account on the Azure portal, but you will create the database, container, and items from your web application.</p>

<p>The last thing I want to mention is that different Cosmos DB APIs have different methods for removing or encrypting data. In this tutorial, you will work with the core Cosmos DB API, but I encourage you to explore the other APIs.</p>

 Create your Okta application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select ASP.NET Core. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback</code> and use <code>http://localhost:5001/signout/callback</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the TCP port 5001 must be the same used by the application. You can see it in the messages displayed in the terminal when you start the application with <code>dotnet run</code>.</p>
</blockquote>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/aspnetcore3/create-okta-application/">Create a ASP.NET Core App</a> for more information.</p>



 Create a Cosmos DB account 

<p>As I mentioned before, the logic for creating your database, container, and items will be in your application. However, you do need to create a database account to connect to.</p>

<p>Navigate to <a href="https://portal.azure.com">the Azure portal</a> and select Create a resource. Search for <code>Azure Cosmos DB</code> and select the option. Follow the prompt and select Create on the Azure Cosmos DB marketing page.</p>

<p>Next, you will see a page asking which API best suits your workload. Find Core (SQL) - Recommended and press Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Create Azure Cosmos DB Account - Core (SQL) page provides the details about your subscription and resource group. Make sure you select <code>Apply</code> under the Apply Free Tier Discount then press Review + create.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your web application 

<p>Now you can turn your attention toward creating your web application. Open Visual Studio and press Create a new project. Find the template for ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller) and press Next. Name your application <code>Okta_CosmosDb</code> and press Next. Finally, select .NET 6.0 (Long-term support) from your framework and press Create. Allow Visual Studio a moment to scaffold the project.</p>

<p>Next, you can install the two packages you will need in your project.</p>

   <code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 4.1.0
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos -Version 3.26.1
</code>   

<p><code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> will do all the heavy lifting of connecting your web application to Okta using middleware provided by Okta. This package will just require a quick configuration using the values output to <code>.okta.env</code> from your application set up earlier.</p>

<p><code>Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos</code> provides the core libraries for accessing the Cosmos DB API. You will use this package to create your database, add a container to it, and insert items into the container.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and replace the code there with the following.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "Domain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}"
  },
  "CosmosDb": {
    "Account": "{yourCosmosDbUri}",
    "Key": "{yourCosmosDbPrimaryKey}",
    "DatabaseName": "oktacosmos",
    "ContainerName": "Results"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>You can find the Okta values in <code>.okta.env</code> produced by the CLI when you initialized your Okta application. To find your Cosmos values, navigate to your Cosmos DB account page and open the <code>Settings &gt; Keys</code> tab. Here you will find the <code>URI</code>, <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>, and other values you may need down the line.</p>

<p>Next, replace the code in <code>Program.cs</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

builder.Services.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =&gt;
{
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
})
.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
{
    // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
    OktaDomain = builder.Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
    ClientId = builder.Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
    ClientSecret = builder.Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
    Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
    PostLogoutRedirectUri = "/"
});

builder.Services.AddScoped&lt;Okta_CosmosDb.Services.IScrubService, Okta_CosmosDb.Services.ScrubService&gt;();
builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;Okta_CosmosDb.Services.ICosmosService&gt;(Okta_CosmosDb.Services.CosmosService.InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync(builder.Configuration.GetSection("CosmosDb")).GetAwaiter().GetResult());

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
if (!app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
    // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
    app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.UseRouting();

app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Much of this code is boilerplate from the Visual Studio scaffolding process but you are adding a few extra items.</p>

<p>First, you need to configure your authentication to use <code>AddOktaMvc</code> and provide the configuration values from your <code>appsettings</code> file.</p>

<p>Next, you are setting up the dependency injection for a couple of custom services that you will write soon. These are the <code>IScrubService</code>, which will handle your scrubbing process, and the <code>ICosmosService</code>, which will handle communication to your Cosmos DB account.</p>

<p>Finally, you are calling <code>InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync</code>, which will set up your database and container if they do not exist. Then it will return the <code>CosmosService</code> as a singleton.</p>

 Create your application services 

<p>Create a new folder in the project root and name it <code>Services</code>. You will add the following four files to this directory.</p>

 
   <code>ICosmosService.cs</code> 
   <code>CosmosService.cs</code> 
   <code>IScrubService.cs</code> 
   <code>ScrubService.cs</code> 
 

<p>Start by replacing the code in the two interfaces. First, replace the code in <code>ICosmosService.cs</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public interface ICosmosService
    {
        Task SaveResultAsync(Models.ScrubResult result);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, replace the code in <code>IScrubService.cs</code> with the code below.</p>

   <code>namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public interface IScrubService
    {
        Task&lt;Models.ScrubResult&gt; ScrubAsync(Models.Person person);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now you can implement these interfaces in their respective classes. First, open <code>CosmosService.cs</code> and update the code there with the code below.</p>

   <code>using Okta_CosmosDb.Models;
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public class CosmosService : ICosmosService
    {
        private Container _container; 
        
        public CosmosService(
            CosmosClient dbClient,
            string databaseName,
            string containerName)
        {
            this._container = dbClient.GetContainer(databaseName, containerName);
        }

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// Creates a Cosmos DB database and a container with the specified partition key. 
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
        public static async Task&lt;CosmosService&gt; InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync(IConfigurationSection configurationSection)
        {
            string databaseName = configurationSection.GetSection("DatabaseName").Value;
            string containerName = configurationSection.GetSection("ContainerName").Value;
            string account = configurationSection.GetSection("Account").Value;
            string key = configurationSection.GetSection("Key").Value;

            CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(account, key);
            CosmosService cosmosDbService = new CosmosService(client, databaseName, containerName);
            DatabaseResponse database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync(databaseName);
            await database.Database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync(containerName, "/id");

            return cosmosDbService;
        }

        public async Task SaveResultAsync(ScrubResult result)
        {
            await this._container.CreateItemAsync&lt;ScrubResult&gt;(result, new PartitionKey(result.Id));
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This service does two tasks. First, it stores data in Cosmos DB using the <code>SaveResultAsync</code> method. This simply calls the container you are operating on and creates an item in that container.</p>

<p>This class also contains the static <code>InitializeCosmosClientInstanceAsync</code> method, which your <code>Program.cs</code> called to return the service. Anytime you attempt to access an <code>ICosmosService</code> your application will return a singleton using this method. This method will ensure your database and your container are created before passing the instance of the <code>CosmosService</code> to the consumer to be used.</p>

<p>Next open <code>ScrubService.cs</code> and replace the code there with this implementation.</p>

   <code>using Okta_CosmosDb.Models;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Services
{
    public class ScrubService : IScrubService
    {
        public async Task&lt;ScrubResult&gt; ScrubAsync(Person person)
        {
            var task = Task.Run(() =&gt; { return new ScrubResult(person, new Random().Next(2) == 0); });
            return await task;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This class serves to mock a true scrub service. The method here is <code>async</code> because in a real-world environment that would be the case, but since you are just mocking the service you can wrap the login in <code>Task.Run</code> to simulate an <code>async</code> method.</p>

 Create your models 

<p>Next, you will need a couple of data models to facilitate your views and to pass in your application. In your <code>Models</code> folder add a file for <code>ScrubResult.cs</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Models
{
    public class ScrubResult
    {
        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "id")]
        public string Id { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "person")]
        public Person Person { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "success")]
        public bool Success { get; set; }

        public ScrubResult(Person person, bool success)
        {
            Person = person;
            Success = success;
            Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now add the file and code for <code>Person.cs</code> in your <code>Models</code> folder.</p>

   <code>using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Models
{
    public class Person
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [JsonIgnore]
        public string SSN { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>There are a couple of things going on here that you should understand. First, you are going to store the <code>ScrubResult</code> object in your Cosmos database. Each property is explicitly given a name using the <code>JsonProperty</code> attribute, however you do not need to do this. You do need a field called <code>id</code>.  The <code>JsonProperty</code> attribute helps keep your C# code consistently <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase">Pascal case</a> while keeping your Cosmos DB property names camel case.</p>

<p>The real kicker here is that the API is using the <code>Newtonsoft.Json</code> package to serialize the objects into JSON strings. This means you can use any of the features that come with the Newtonsoft package to manipulate your data. This is what you did on the <code>Person</code> object where you use the <code>JsonIgnore</code> attribute to hide the SSN.</p>

<p>While <code>JsonIgnore</code> is the simplest way to remove the SSN from this object, there are many other approaches. You could even create a custom attribute using the <code>Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization.DefaultContractResolver</code>, and hash, encrypt, or otherwise translate the field into something less sensitive.</p>

 Add the controller logic 

<p>Now you can add your controller logic to your application.</p>

<p>Start by adding a class to your <code>Controllers</code> directory named <code>ImportController.cs</code>. Replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Controllers
{
    [Authorize]
    public class ImportController : Controller
    {
        Services.IScrubService _scrubService;
        Services.ICosmosService _cosmosService;

        public ImportController(
            Services.IScrubService scrubService,
            Services.ICosmosService cosmosService
            )
        {
            _scrubService = scrubService;
            _cosmosService = cosmosService;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Upload(IFormFile csvFile)
        {
            List&lt;Models.Person&gt; persons = new List&lt;Models.Person&gt;();

            using (var stream = csvFile.OpenReadStream())
            using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(stream))
            {
                while (!sr.EndOfStream)
                {
                    string[] rows = sr.ReadToEnd().Split(Environment.NewLine);          
                    
                    for(int i =0; i &lt; rows.Length; i++)
                    {
                       if(i == 0)
                        {
                            //header row
                            continue;
                        }

                        var row = rows[i].Split(',');

                        persons.Add(new Models.Person()
                        {
                            Name = row[0],
                            SSN = row[1]
                        });
                    }
                }
            }

            List&lt;Models.ScrubResult&gt; results = new List&lt;Models.ScrubResult&gt;();

            foreach(var person in persons)
            {
                results.Add(_scrubService.Scrub(person));
            }

            foreach(var result in results)
            {
                _cosmosService.SaveResultAsync(result);
            }

            return View(results);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This controller will serve as a view for the import page. It will also accept a CSV file, convert the file into a list of <code>Person</code> objects, and then run the scrub process against each person. Once the scrub process is complete it will save the results to your Cosmos DB account using the database you set up earlier.</p>

<p>Next, you will want a controller for logging users in and out. Add a controller called <code>AccountController.cs</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult SignIn()
        {
            if (!(HttpContext.User?.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false))
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Import");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult SignOut()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(new[] { OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                                         CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>This controller contains methods for <code>SignIn</code> and <code>SignOut</code> implemented per Okta’s recommendation.</p>

<p>Finally, replace the code in <code>HomeController.cs</code> with the code below.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Okta_CosmosDb.Models;
using System.Diagnostics;

namespace Okta_CosmosDb.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; _logger;

        public HomeController(ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            if ((User?.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false))
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Import");

            return View();
        }

        [ResponseCache(Duration = 0, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.None, NoStore = true)]
        public IActionResult Error()
        {
            return View(new ErrorViewModel { RequestId = Activity.Current?.Id ?? HttpContext.TraceIdentifier });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Here you have the <code>Index</code> method but the logic is replaced to redirect authenticated users to the Import screen.</p>

 Add and edit your views 

<p>The first view to edit is the <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> in your <code>Views/Shared</code> folder.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;

    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-toggleable-sm navbar-light bg-white border-bottom box-shadow mb-3"&gt;
            &lt;div class="container"&gt;

                    &lt;span class="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex justify-content-between"&gt;
                    &lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;
                        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
                            &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
                        &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                    @if ((User?.Identity?.IsAuthenticated ?? false))
                    {
                        &lt;form asp-action="SignOut" asp-controller="Account" method="post"&gt;
                            &lt;button type="submit" href="Account/Logout" class="btn btn-primary my-2 my-sm-0"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
                        &lt;/form&gt;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        &lt;a href="Account/SignIn" class="btn btn-primary my-2 my-sm-0"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
                    }

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;main role="main" class="pb-3"&gt;
            @RenderBody()
        &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;footer class="border-top footer text-muted"&gt;
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
            &amp;copy; 2022 - &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Most of the boilerplate layout is fine but it doesn’t include <code>Login</code> or <code>Logout</code> buttons. You added these to the navbar and displayed the appropriate one based on the user’s authentication status.</p>

<p>Next, replace the <code>Home\Index.cshtml</code> code with the following.</p>
   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
    A small tutorial on protecting PII in Microsoft's &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/"&gt; Azure Cosmos DB&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;br /&gt;Secured by &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/free-trial/"&gt;Okta.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
    Written by &lt;a href="https://github.com/nickolasfisher"&gt; Nik Fisher.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is just a little home page with some information about the tutorial.</p>

<p>Finally, create a new folder (if one wasn’t created already) for <code>Import</code> in your <code>Views</code> folder. Add a file called <code>Index.cshtml</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>@(ViewData["Title"] = "Import Clients")

&lt;form method="POST" asp-controller="Import" asp-action="Upload" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
    &lt;input type="file" name="csvFile" class="btn-outline-primary btn" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Import" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>This simple page provides an opportunity for the user to import a CSV file and submit it to the server.</p>

<p>Next, add a file for <code>Upload.cshtml</code> that will display the results as they come back.</p>

   <code>@model List&lt;Okta_CosmosDb.Models.ScrubResult&gt;
@(ViewData["Title"] = "Scrub Results")

&lt;table class="table table-bordered"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Result&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        @foreach (var result in Model)
        {
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;@result.Person.Name&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;@result.Success&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        }
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code>   

 Test your application locally 

<p>With your application complete you can now start debugging. You should be greeted with the home screen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on Login and follow the login page to Okta and then back to your import page. Download the <a href="https://github.com/nickolasfisher/Okta_Cosmos/blob/master/Okta_CosmosDb/TestData/SampleFile.csv">CSV File found here</a> and upload this to your server using the application page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Your application will then process this file and save the results to Cosmos DB. You can navigate to your Cosmos DB portal using the <code>Data Explorer</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You will note that the social security number does not appear in the data you sent to Cosmos DB.</p>

 Conclusions 

<p>As developers, we always need to be thinking about protecting users’ data. The rise of PaaS and SaaS platforms has decreased risk when used properly. But along with these new platforms, we must make sure we use best practices and keep an attentive eye on the data we choose to retain.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you learned how to store data in Cosmos DB from an ASP.NET Core application. You learned how to set up your Cosmos DB account and how to set up your application to create databases and containers to store your items. Finally, you used the JSON functionality to remove sensitive data from your data model before storing it.</p>

 Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap (June 6 — June&nbsp;10)  A quick review of past week’s most important news and updates on crypto regulation. <p>Welcome to the second edition of Veriscope’s Weekly Regulatory Recap. Amid the current crypto market turmoil, the regulatory landscape is heating up even further. So, let’s dive straight into it. We hope you enjoy&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> Japan may Soon Approve a Proposal to Seize Stolen Virtual&nbsp;Assets <p>With the crypto space experiencing considerable growth, the number of hacking-related too experienced an uptick. Reports suggest that crypto thefts amounted to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/crypto-scammers-took-a-record-14-billion-in-2021-chainalysis.html">$14 billion</a> in 2021 compared to $3.2 billion in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Japan, one of the most important markets in the crypto world, is among the most-affected countries in terms of crypto hacks. For example, Liquid, a Japanese crypto exchange, lost <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58277359">$100 million</a> to hackers in mid-2021.</p><p>Despite increasing incidents of crypto-related hacks, there are no laws that empower Japanese authorities to seize stolen digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Well, that is about to change, as per Nippon, a local media outlet. <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/news/yjj2022060600835/japan-may-revise-law-to-seize-illegally-gained-crypto-assets.html">Nippon reported</a> that Japan’s Ministry of Justice is contemplating approving a proposal to confiscate stolen digital&nbsp;assets.</p> US Senators Kirsten Gillibrand &amp; Cynthia Lummis Unveiled the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” Aimed at Regulating Digital&nbsp;Assets <p>After a long wait, two US Senators, Kirsten Gillibrand &amp; Cynthia Lummis, have finally introduced a bill to regulate digital assets in the country. Officially titled “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” or “Lummis-Gillibrand,” the bill was announced by Senator Gillibrand through a press&nbsp;release.</p><p>Senator Gillibrand believes the “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” will bring the same success at the federal level that her home state, Wyoming, has experienced, thanks to its crypto-friendly approach.</p><p>The bill has a lot in the store for the nascent crypto space. For instance, if the bill comes into force, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will become the go-to authority of virtual currencies. It will also make it easier to identify the digital assets that are securities and the ones that are commodities.</p><p>Stablecoins, too, will be brought within the regulatory net. The bill states that stablecoin issuers must meet strict reserve requirements before issuing the asset-backed digital assets. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/us-senators-kirsten-gillibrand-cynthia-lummis-introduces-the-responsible-financial-innovation-e75c238bacbb?source=user_profile---------1----------------------------">Click here</a> to read more about what aspects are covered under the Lummis-Gillibrand bill.</p> Lithuania to Crack Down on Digital Assets, Will ban Anonymous Accounts <p>To prevent misuse of Lithuania’s lax regulations around digital assets, the country’s various ministries came together to approve the legal amendment to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) provisions, as <a href="https://finmin.lrv.lt/lt/naujienos/kriptoturto-sektoriuje-skaidruma-didinantys-istatymo-pakeitimai">announced</a> by the Ministry of&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>Once approved, it will effectively outlaw anonymous accounts and further strengthen the user identification mechanism. The bill will also implement strong regulatory requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges.</p><p>For instance, the company operating the crypto exchange must have a minimum capital of €125000. And the company’s senior executive management must only consist of Lithuanian citizens.</p> South Korean Exchanges may Soon Have to Comply With Guidelines for Listing &amp; Delisting of Digital&nbsp;Assets <p>The Terra-Luna debacle initiated a chain of regulatory events worldwide, especially in South Korea. First, the country announced that it would establish a new regulatory body to oversee the digital assets&nbsp;market.</p><p>Now, <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/south-korea-eyes-guidelines-for-crypto-bourses-after-terra-crash-1.1775883">reports</a> indicate that South Korean authorities have asked crypto exchanges to prepare guidelines on the listing &amp; delisting of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Yun Chang-Hyun, a South Korean Lawmaker from the virtual assets committee, has called for a second meeting with Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, the top-most crypto exchanges in the country. The main theme of the discussion would be the guidelines.</p><p>Although the crypto market is experiencing a downturn at the moment, the regulators are in no mood to let the nascent industry stay outside of the regulatory framework any longer. Thus, country after country is coming up with regulations to ensure that sanctioned individuals and entities do not turn to digital assets to circumvent the sanctions.</p><p>Thus, now is the right time to begin complying with the current regulations, if you haven’t already. It will enable you to stay clear of any possible violations now or in the future. Start with FATF’s Travel Rule, as it is the most significant piece of global regulation around digital assets&nbsp;today.</p><p>You will need a robust Travel Rule Service Provider (TRSP) to begin complying with the rule.

<p>On June 15th, starting &nbsp;from 10:am (CET), InfoCert will take part in one of biggest international virtual conference about eIDAS regulation, hosted by Bitkom the Germany’s digital association who represent more than 2,000 companies of the digital economy.</p>



<p>Daniele Citterio – InfoCert Chief Technology Officer – is taking a speech during the international stage at 3:35 pm, about the topic: “Growing decentralized identity ecosystem before the EIDAS2 revolution”.</p>



<p>The future is already here and about that, during his presentation, Mr Citterio will talk about <a>Dizme:</a> the blockchain technology-based App that promotes Self Sovereign Identity principles for distributed management of personal identity and information. Dizme allows all to create an ecosystem in which the anyone become the true “owner” of his proper digital identity.</p>



<p>Thanks to the participation of an InfoCert guest: Goran Stojadinovic – Enterprise Sales (B2B) and ICT Solutions Director @ A1 Serbia; there will be a pratical demonstration of how Dizme decentralized identity ecosystem empowered A1 Serbia to kick off a new business model.</p>



 Digital Identities &amp; ID Wallet 



<p>How is it possible to digitise your ID and wallet? And what potential do digital identities hold for the industry? The ID Wallet is a digital wallet for self-managed identities to identify yourself online and offline – but without cards and papers – for example at the hotel check-in or to proof your driver’s license. At the eIDAS Summit we will discuss what the ID wallet looks like, what it can do, and which chances and challenges are associated with the topic of digital identity.</p>



 Fill the gap between Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and eIDAS compliance. 



<p>Dizme is the first decentralized identity network that combines the benefits of the SSI world as well as the compliance to eIDAS regulation perimeter. Organizations rely on exchanging information with customers, suppliers, partners, employees, and many others, but verifying and certifying identity and data needs investments, takes time, and exposes the company to the risk of fraud.</p>



 <a href="https://www.eidas-summit.de/en">Get your free ticket for #eidas22</a> 



<p>Would you like to fully process your contracts electronically, eliminate paper-based work and optimize your business processes with digital identities? Get to know the eIDAS regulation! On 15 June 2022, you will have the opportunity to discover the novel application of digital trust and identity in business.</p>

 Let’s take a look at OceanONDA V4 Market and how to publish your first data&nbsp;NFT <p>OceanONDA V4 has brought a whole host of awesome new upgrades — data NFTs, Safer Staking, and a lot more flexibility in setting fees when running your own data marketplace. For most of us, we’ll be interacting with these updates through Ocean Market — so let’s take a look at what’s new. In this article, we’ll summarize some of the main changes in the market and then run you through a step-by-step guide on how to publish your first data&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>A lot of the changes in the V4 version of Ocean Market are based around the introduction of data NFTs, so before we get onto the details, let’s quickly ask — what is a data NFT? A data NFT is the representation of the intellectual property on-chain, we call this the base-IP. Data NFTs sit in your wallet, just like any other NFT, and they can be transferred directly from your wallet, meaning that you’re now able to sell or transfer your base-IP on-chain. You can also make use of all the awesome NFT tools in the rapidly growing NFT ecosystem — there are so many possibilities to&nbsp;explore.</p><p>If you’re looking for some more detail on how all the V4 updates work, we would highly recommend reading the following articles that we’ve recently published:</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/what-is-a-data-nft-5804a2d88671">What is a data&nbsp;NFT?</a>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/how-to-make-money-from-ocean-v4-477b3decad51">How to make money from OceanONDA V4</a>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-one-sided-staking-93988f65e378">One-sided staking blog&nbsp;post</a>   So what’s&nbsp;new? <p>The headline news is all about data NFTs and we’re very excited to show you how to publish your first one — but let’s first look at the changes in Ocean Market V4. We have a cool new publish flow, changes to how the pools work, updates to the asset detail page, and an awesome NFT image generator.</p> New publish&nbsp;flow <p>Ocean V4 was always going to be a serious upgrade and we felt it would be fitting to give serious consideration to how we could make a new publish form that was suitable for the new journey — publishing a data&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>If you’re thinking publishing an NFT must be super complicated — you’re in for a nice surprise, we’ve got a new wizard-style form that makes it fabulously easy. The whole process, including setting up pricing, is simplified down to 5 steps. It also gives you the opportunity to review everything that you’ve entered, so you can make sure you’re happy before you start signing transactions.</p><p>We’ll take you a more detailed look at the publish form in the step-by-step guide&nbsp;below.</p> Data NFT Image Generator <p>We know how cool it is when you can see the unique visualization of an NFT in your wallet and we felt like it was really crucial to include this in the new V4 version of Ocean Market. We’re giving you the opportunity to choose your image within the publish form — keep clicking refresh and see the alternative styles, it’s fun to play around with. This image will forever remain associated with the data NFT so make sure you’re happy with it before proceeding.</p><p>The SVG generator was developed from the ground up for Ocean Market V4. We have our friends at <a href="https://www.delta-dao.com/">Delta DAO</a> to thank for all the hard work they put into this great feature, they did an awesome&nbsp;job.</p> Data NFT image on Asset&nbsp;Page <p>What’s the point of having these cool Ocean wave pictures if you can’t see them anywhere? Well, we wouldn’t miss out on that opportunity — we’ve got them displayed in prime position on the asset page. This is a nice detail that adds an individual touch to each&nbsp;page.</p> Updates to the pool&nbsp;tab <p>If you’ve been keeping up with all the OceanONDA V4 updates, you will have heard of our one-sided staking improvements that make it safer to contribute liquidity to pools — no more need to worry about rug pulls. This is one of the upgrades that we’re most proud&nbsp;of.</p><p>Essentially, we have introduced a one-sided staking bot that ensures that the ratio of base tokens (e.g. Ocean Tokens) to datatokens in each pool is always kept in balance. When you add liquidity to the pool, the one-sided staking bot will mint datatokens and add them to the pool to match your additional liquidity. Alternatively, if you remove your liquidity, the one-sided staking bot will burn the equivalent number of datatokens to keep the ratio in the pool unchanged. It’s a fantastic solution to a serious problem — we don’t like seeing people losing money to rug-pulls.</p><p>Now, as you can imagine, all of that clever logic sits in the smart contracts so the changes here in the market are more subtle. Our goal here was to remove any unnecessary figures and make it all a lot clearer. We’ve simplified the views of liquidity and total value locked so that it only shows the number of Ocean tokens in the pool — that’s the only token you add after&nbsp;all.</p> How to publish your first data&nbsp;NFT <p>So now, let’s run through the process of publishing your first data NFT. There are a few things that you will need before you’re able to&nbsp;proceed.</p><p>Firstly, you will need a dataset — for the purpose of following along with this guide it’s perfectly fine to give it a go with a test dataset. There are a bunch of example csv files <a href="https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html">here</a>. However, it’s good to start thinking about what data you might like to try and sell, possibly you have something in mind already or maybe you have lots of data but aren’t sure what’s valuable.</p><p>Next up, you’ll need a browser wallet (we recommend <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>), some Ether and some OCEAN tokens. Now if any of that sounds unfamiliar we’d recommend taking a quick look at these guides on our&nbsp;docs:</p>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets/">Wallet Basics</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/">Set Up MetaMask&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/wallets-and-ocean-tokens/">Use Your Wallet to Manage OCEAN&nbsp;Tokens</a>  <p>To keep things simple (and free) we suggest publishing on the Rinkeby testnet for the first couple of times while you get used to the process. You can get 1000 free Ocean Tokens on Rinkeby from our <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com/">faucet</a>. And if you need some Ether on Rinkeby you can get that from the <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.io/">Rinkeby&nbsp;Faucet</a>.</p> Step 1 — Connect your&nbsp;wallet <p>This first step is the same as it was in our V3 version of Ocean Market. You need to start by connecting your wallet. This is essentially the equivalent of logging into a traditional (Web2) application.</p><p>In the top right corner, you’ll see the button that says “Connect Wallet”. If you click that it will give you three different options — you’ll want to select MetaMask (assuming that’s the wallet you’re&nbsp;using).</p><p>You’ll now get a pop-up from MetaMask asking you if you would like to connect your account, you can click next and proceed to connect your&nbsp;account.</p> Step 2 — Setting the&nbsp;Metadata <p>At this point, you’re ready to get started with filling out the publish form, so click on the “publish” link at the top navigation if you haven’t done so already. Here you can see the cool new wizard-style form that we mentioned above.</p><p>This first tab on the publish form is all about the metadata for your data asset, so you’ll need to give it a title and description. This section of the form also asks for the author and tags (these help people discover and search for your data&nbsp;asset).</p><p>This is also the part of the form where you get to play around with our fun new SVG generator to select the image that you would like to represent your data&nbsp;NFT.</p> Step 2 — Defining the&nbsp;Access <p>Now, on the second page of the form, you’ll have to make an important decision about how you would like people to be able to access your data. You’ve got two options here — “download” or “compute”. Providing “download” access is the most straightforward, it’s exactly as it sounds — people will be able to download the dataset and have access to the raw data. This will be great for many situations but if your data is super sensitive and you don’t want people to be able to see the raw data then you’ll be better off choosing “compute”.</p><p>If you choose to provide “compute” access, it means that users will be able to run algorithms on your dataset behind a firewall but they will never gain access to the raw data. We call this model “compute-to-data” and it’s one of the features that make Ocean unique. If you’re interested in learning more about compute-to-data then we’d recommend reading our docs, where we’ve got a bunch of useful&nbsp;guides:</p>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-architecture/">Compute-to-data architecture overview</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-minikube/">Running a Compute-to-Data Environment</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-algorithms/">Writing Algorithms for Compute to&nbsp;Data</a>  <p>On this page, you’ll also have to enter the URL where your dataset is hosted. You can host your dataset on any centralized or decentralized storage provider — it could be stored anywhere from an on-premise server to IPFS. All that’s required is that there is a URL where it is possible to access the dataset. We often get asked questions like “What’s the maximum file size?” or “What file types are accepted?” — we don’t handle the hosting of the data, so we don’t impose any limitations here. The maintenance and hosting of the dataset are your responsibility.</p><p>You’ll also notice that there is a field for inputting a sample dataset, this could be a subset of the actual dataset or a sample file that replicates the same format. This can be very useful for customers who wish to gain a better understanding of the data that you’re selling before they make a purchase.</p><p>This is also the stage where you can select the datatoken name and symbol. The datatoken is the token on the blockchain that grants access to your dataset — consumers have to purchase the datatoken to access the dataset. The name of the datatoken doesn’t really matter, it’s just important it’s unique, so it’s fine to keep the default or click refresh a couple of times until you see something you&nbsp;like.</p><p>The last field on this page is the timeout. You can decide how long you would like users to have access to the dataset after their initial purchase by choosing the timeout. If you’re constantly updating your dataset you may wish to have a shorter timeout so that customers come back to purchase the latest&nbsp;copy.</p> Step 3 — Creating&nbsp;Pricing <p>At this point, we’re almost done. You now need to turn our attention to how the asset will be priced. You’ve got three options here: dynamic pricing, fixed pricing, and free! It is important to think carefully about which one is appropriate for your data asset. Once you set the pricing type you will not be able to change it, although you will still be able to change the&nbsp;price.</p><p>Let’s take a look at each&nbsp;one:</p> Fixed pricing <p>Fixed pricing is fairly self-explanatory, you set the price and that’s what customers pay to access your data. You can change the price at any time and customers will always have to pay the amount that you&nbsp;set.</p> Dynamic pricing <p>Dynamic pricing is a little more complicated as the price is determined by an automated version of an order book. This concept is called an Automated Market Maker (AMM). Under the hood, Ocean uses a modified version of the <a href="https://balancer.fi/">Balancer</a> AMM&nbsp;pools.</p><p>If you would like to create dynamic pricing you will need to provide OCEAN tokens as liquidity to start the AMM pool. The price that the customer pays is set by the ratio of OCEAN tokens to datatokens within the pool. As more people purchase the datatokens, the ratio changes and the price increases.</p><p>Anyone can add liquidity to the pool you have created, they are known as liquidity providers. Liquidity providers earn a share of the transaction fees when the datatoken is purchased, this acts as an incentive for them to provide liquidity.</p><p>Free!</p><p>This is a new option available in the V4 market — you can offer your datasets for free, although gas fees still apply. We had a bunch of requests for the free pricing option, and it was already in use in some forks of the V3 market, so we decided to include it in the V4 version of Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> Step 4 — Preview and&nbsp;Review <p>There were quite a few steps there so you might want to double-check that you’re happy with everything that you inputted. We’ve added a handy preview page so that you can review everything before you start signing any of the transactions.</p> Step 5 — Submit and Sign Transactions <p>We pushed ourselves to make the submitting process a lot more user-friendly here. We’ve added information on how many transactions you need to sign and an explanation of what each one is&nbsp;for.</p><p>After clicking submit. presented with a series of MetaMask pops. There are three transactions that you need to sign: creating the pricing, minting the datatokens, and then allowing Ocean Market to use them (i.e. selling them on your&nbsp;behalf).</p><p>Once you have confirmed each of these transactions you will see the success message. Your dataset has now been published and you’ll be able to see it for sale in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> All done! <p>We have covered a lot in this article so kudos for making it all the way to the end. We’ve looked at some of the cool new features in the V4 version of Ocean Market and run through step by step on how to publish your first data&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>Hopefully, you see now that publishing a data NFT is a straightforward process.

Anyone who wishes to retrieve his/her XPX tokens will need to prove ownership of that account by sending a message, “Wish to swap over” to the sink account&nbsp;below:</p><p>ND7WVWPWNTJR75CYC3D73LSVP7WIL7BL77QNT7NZ</p><p>Our team will then verify and cross-check the account against our records; if a swap over is found to have been been made before, it will be disqualified. However, if no swap over was made previously, it will be processed and the account holder will receive his/her corresponding XPX accordingly. All swaps will be processed in batches once a month, hence each swap will take a maximum of 31 days for the XPX to be sent to the Sirius&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>We have not put a time limit for this swap to finally end, but it is advised that everyone should swap as soon as possible to avoid any loss of XPX in the future. Until the cut-off date of 30th June 2022, XPX holders can continue to swap over from NIS1 to Sirius blockchain using the normal <a href="https://www.proximax.io/en/wallet">procedure</a>.</p><p>Need help?

 The Way Things Used to Be 
<p>During the pandemic, life and work changed rapidly. Appointments needed to be conducted remotely, which resulted in some employees never even meeting each other in person. At 1Kosmos we were sure to have regular video conferences and virtual happy hours to provide company updates and foster personal connections. However, the virtual working model posed its share of challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a large organization and a rapidly shifting economy, working together purposefully and seeing accurate results is tricky.&nbsp; All companies slowed down or halted during this time because company culture and working together is essential for ensuring your company’s success.&nbsp;</p>
 Coming Together 
<p>During the pandemic, our motto was “come together.” It was essential to remind our team that we need to work together still and rely on one another no matter what. Although we successfully stuck together during the most challenging times, nothing beats finally feeling the spark of collective and creative energy when finally working together again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zoom and video conferencing make it easy for us to communicate regularly, but there’s no substitute for meeting in person when collaboration and understanding each other is critical. Sitting in the same room together, you can know the person, learn what they like, and whiteboard and brainstorm ideas that can be easily missed over the phone or via video chat.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sitting with the team over a couple of days gave so much insight into what our employees would like out of our company, how we can increase productivity, and help with more interactions between the teams.</p>
<p>In addition to employees, our interactions with our customers in India have also been limited.&nbsp; This face-to-face interaction with your customer base is crucial, and the pandemic damaged many company-customer relationships.&nbsp; The market in India is moving at a rapid speed and adopting a digital identity and security is at the forefront there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our core values is “Service to our customers”. Having an opportunity to meet our customers in India, learn about their environments, and get their feedback was refreshing. Meeting with our prospects face-to-face allows us to better tap into exactly where we need to provide value as a company.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Takeaways 
<p>Recently, we invited all our employees who lived across India to visit our office for an entire week. In addition, we also got a chance to meet some of our customers and prospects in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part of this trip was when we held a day-long company session. In this session, we took the time to re-introduce the company to our team and exchange ideas on collaborating better in a hybrid environment.&nbsp; This was exciting, and so many of the team members shared incredibly insightful questions and thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most interesting questions was: “I believe the 1Kosmos culture and values have been upheld well and resonate strongly with our customers. But with such a fast-growing organization, how do we maintain our culture and prioritize employee enablement? ”</p>
<p>The answer, in my opinion, is pretty simple – encourage asking questions. The simple mantra here is that a person learns more by asking questions rather than knowing the answers. To that extent, we have fostered multiple platforms/calls where we share information and encourage questions to be asked.</p>
<p>The more asked questions mean that everyone is on the same page about areas the company needs to continue to grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this day-long event, we also learned so much about our team through the team-building activities. Usually, we tend to focus on the individual through interviews, and we try to understand what a person is best at in their day.&nbsp; Instead, we focused on team building and how to best effectively work as a team. This is another reason why a hybrid work environment is essential for new growth as a company.&nbsp;</p>
 Shifting Towards a New Hybrid Work Environment 
<p>We’ve learned that the best work environment is a hybrid of both in-person and remote activities. You can’t have a great company culture without teamwork and operating together.&nbsp; Although all employees successfully continued working through remote work during the pandemic, this isn’t sustainable for long-term growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hybrid work environment allows for reflection and creativity both alone and together.&nbsp; It is proven that a better balance between home and work life results in increased productivity and satisfaction. Working completely remote did have its benefits. We want to continue reaping those benefits while also adding back that crucial team collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pandemic forced us to take a step back and prioritize exactly what is most important in our lives.&nbsp; This was health, family, or personal growth for many of us.&nbsp; A hybrid work environment provides the right balance between taking care of yourself and prioritizing your health and wellness while also beginning to lean back into growing together in a fast-paced world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unique digital identifiers will ensure authenticity across multiple chains to prevent counterfeits</p><p>10 June 2022, Austin, TX and London — Today at the Consensus conference, myNFT and B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a developer of applications for KILT Protocol, announced the launch of AssetDIDs, a new type of identifier that can be used with multiple asset classes from fungible and non-fungible assets like&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>A DID or decentralized identifier functions like a digital fingerprint does for people. A DID can be created for machines, services, and anything that identities can be attached to, including assets. Verifiable credentials can be attached to AssetDIDs, which uniquely describe an asset on any given blockchain. By connecting credentials to these entities, AssetDIDs can transparently ensure authenticity and other properties of both physical and digital assets like NFTs across multiple&nbsp;chains.</p><p>A unique AssetDID for an NFT is generated from four existing datapoints about the&nbsp;asset:</p>  The NFT identifier issued by the&nbsp;creator.  The NFT standard that was used to create the NFT (there might be two NFTs with the same NFT identifier, but from different standards).  The identifier of the issuing instance (e.g. smart contract, blockchain, person, which might not be&nbsp;unique).  The identifier of the blockchain (there might be different chains with common asset-issuing logic).  <p>All together, these uniquely describe an&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>An AssetDID is public by default, as anyone can gather the information and build the identifier. Therefore, it is not necessary to store the AssetDID on a blockchain. Unlike normal DIDs, the AssetDID does not have private keys, because objects like NFTs cannot sign messages or transactions.</p><p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing anonymous and verifiable credentials and DIDs. Credentials and DIDs created with KILT applications are under the control of the owner, who can then decide who to share them with. The DID can also be linked to an easily readable <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How_To_Guide_web3name_link_address_Full_May22.pdf">web3name</a> (like w3n:alice) and used to represent the owner online, with public credentials adding an extra trust&nbsp;layer.</p><p>Anyone can create KILT credentials to certify properties of any NFT and link them to an AssetDID by storing the credentials publicly on the KILT blockchain. In this way, KILT credentials can be assigned to NFTs stored on any blockchain ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://www.mynft.com/">myNFT.com</a> is an upcoming multi-chain NFT marketplace built on the Moonbeam parachain that is introducing a wide range of exciting features such as new auction technology, best in class UX, low gas architecture, fiat onramps and cross-chain NFT migration.</p><p>As a marketplace, myNFT wants to ensure that customers on their platform are able to easily distinguish between counterfeit and legitimate NFTs. AssetDIDs combined with myNFT’s internal verification system represent a critical step in helping customers navigate the NFT&nbsp;market.</p> AssetDIDs for&nbsp;NFTs <p>Any NFT owner could create their own credentials using the <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a> wallet and <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> applications built on KILT. They could then link their credentials to an Asset DID by storing them publicly on the KILT blockchain, to certify properties of their&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>For example, Alice could mint an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain and choose an NFT marketplace to sell her art. The NFT marketplace could attest that she is the artist. The AssetDID would then be composed of existing information about the NFT, including the blockchain, type of NFT, smart contract number and NFT ID. A credential that includes this AssetDID could then be generated and stored on KILT certifying that Alice is the creator of the NFT. This credential would be linked to the NFT via the AssetDID. Any potential buyer could then check the KILT blockchain for any credentials related to this AssetDID, to make sure that they are buying the original NFT and not a&nbsp;copy.</p><p>This adds an extra layer of security and can be particularly useful to address ownership and counterfeit issues in digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>‘’Right now one of the biggest problems in the NFT industry is the high number of scams and counterfeit NFTs circulating due to how easy it is to create copycats of original projects. This is where AssetDIDs built on KILT can really help us solve this problem,’’ said Guillaume Gonnaud, CTO and co-founder of&nbsp;myNFT.</p> Asset DIDs for physical&nbsp;assets <p>AssetDIDs may also be used to certify properties of physical items. For example, a watch manufacturer could issue a unique NFT for each watch it makes. The smart contract of the NFT can be used to record changes of ownership on the blockchain. KILT credentials that include the AssetDID can be generated to record properties of the watch — gold content, limited edition number, etc. — and these credentials can be attached to the NFT. If the watch is stolen, the ownership represented by the NFT still remains with the original owner. The thief will have a harder time reselling the stolen watch because he cannot prove the ownership of&nbsp;it.</p><p>This could also be applied to ownership of other physical property such as a house. A notary service could issue an NFT to show ownership of the house. A credential showing the AssetDID and the properties of the house — size, location, etc. — could be notarized on the KILT blockchain and attached to the NFT. The smart contract could track ownership with each sale. Thus, ownership of physical items could be transferred digitally in a transparent and cost-effective way.</p> Cross-chain Interoperability <p>Using the Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM) in the Polkadot ecosystem, an NFT created in a smart contract, e.g. on Moonriver, could send an extrinsic to KILT via the Kusama Relay Chain to trigger the creation of a KILT credential proving its authenticity. Once the credential is created, any external marketplace application could read it and verify that the NFT is authentic. With AssetDIDs, NFTs live on two blockchains by default, making this a prime use case for cross-chain interoperability.</p><p>“AssetDIDs bridge the physical world with the NFT world. Adding verifiable credentials to uniquely identifiable NFTs brings enormous power and huge opportunities to the NFT ecosystem. Ownership of physical assets can be represented by a verifiable credential”, said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH. “If this credential is attached to an NFT, and the NFT then changes ownership on a smart contract, the credential and all values associated with it would travel with the NFT. There are thousands of use cases for attaching physical goods with&nbsp;NFTs”.</p><p>BTE is working with a number of NFT partners to introduce AssetDIDs, and collaborating with Parity Technologies to incorporate AssetDIDs into a pallet that will become part of the Substrate framework. KILT founder Ingo Rübe will introduce AssetDIDs during the Polkadot ecosystem track at Consensus on Saturday 12 June starting at 11am&nbsp;CST.</p> About myNFT <p>myNFT is a new multi-chain NFT marketplace that is owned by Perpetual Altruism Ltd, a UK company that was founded in London by three university friends in 2018 and that specializes in the development of NFT technologies. myNFT will eventually allow people to buy and sell any NFT on any blockchain in any currency (crypto or fiat) and allow people to fully migrate their NFTs between blockchains. Customers will also be able to sell their NFTs using their patent pending <a href="https://www.gbm.auction/">GBM</a> auction technology with very low gas costs and in a very user friendly fashion. myNFT’s long term mission is to make the NFT market accessible to everyone and to educate and introduce the technology to all the new industries around the world where it can be&nbsp;applied.</p><p>[myNFT The Multi-Chain NFT Marketplace With An&nbsp;Edge]</p><p><a href="http://www.mynft.com/">www.mynft.com</a> | <a href="https://www.instagram.com/my_nft/">@my_nft</a> (Instagram) | <a href="https://twitter.com/MYNFT">@mynft</a> (Twitter)</p> About B.T.E BOTLabs Trusted Entity&nbsp;GmbH <p>B.T.E.

<p>The German and overall DACH (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) Online Gambling market is an emerging one, but it is also one of the largest in Europe. Recognizing this, new regulations legalizing Online Gambling in Germany added to an already existing and sizable legal gambling market.</p>



<p>Overall, Germany’s gambling market is forecast to grow from €2.2bn in 2019 to €3.3bn in 2024, with the legalization of Online Gambling no doubt playing a key role. Meanwhile, Austria’s online gaming market was the fastest-growing gambling sector in the country in 2017, <a href="https://europeangaming.eu/portal/latest-news/2018/06/05/21065/lack-of-regulations-hinders-austrian-igaming-market/">growing by 11%</a> Switzerland is also expanding its Online Gambling market share since it became legal in 2019.</p>



<p>Currently, all DACH countries have legalized online betting markets, with lottery, casinos, and sports betting being the most popular. The regulatory and KYC compliance requirements are strict and , each of these countries feature different requirements. For example, Germany requires a deposit limit of €1000 for all players, stake limits, and a range of other player-protection requirements.</p>



<p>On the whole, regulations are a mixed bag for the DACH market. The gambling markets are forecast to grow, with legalization allowing players to move away from black market gambling and into a safer, regulated environment. However, there are limitations, such as the aforementioned regulations in Germany, as well as a myriad of different rules in different countries. In particular, limits to advertising and promotions can have an impact on operators’ growth.</p>



 Why Online Gambling needs to be regulated in DACH 



<p>Regulation is crucial for the Online Gambling market in the DACH region. It’s beneficial to both operators and players, with the core focus of regulations being the safety of all parties. This is done through regulations that promote fraud prevention, anti-underaged gambling processes, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-mules/">Money Muling</a>.</p>



<p>With Online Gambling being easily accessible, each of these things and more have become vital. It’s easy for underaged users to claim to be of any age, thus regulations such as ID verification and other anti-underaged gambling tools were introduced. In the same light, using Online Gambling to ‘clean’ money is a common criminal practice, and many regulations focus on Anti-Money Laundering processes.</p>



<p>It’s also important to consider how sports events affect Online Gambling and why regulation is vital in that aspect. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ensure-player-friendly-id-verification/">Euro 2020 saw an incredible increase in player verification</a>, with millions being waged throughout the tournament. It’s easy for fraudsters to attempt to slip through the cracks in such a busy period, where operators may be overwhelmed with player signups – so it is vital for emerging markets like Germany to be ready.</p>



 Online Gambling in the DACH market 



<p>Online Gambling in the DACH market varies from country to country. In Germany, individual states act as regulators, with the Glücksspielstaatsvertrag (or the State Treaty on Gambling in Germany) providing many of the current rules and regulations in the country.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Austria and Switzerland follow a more traditional regulatory format, key regulatory bodies being set up to overview the gambling sector. In Austria, the Ministry of Finance is mostly responsible for regulating the sector, following the Law on Games of Chance. However, the country is making plans to create a new regulatory body.</p>



<p>Switzerland currently has two regulatory bodies, the Eidgenössische Spielbankenkommission (or Swiss Federal Gaming Board) which handles casino gaming and the Interkantonale Geldspielaufsicht (or Swiss Gambling Supervisory Authority) which regulates lottery, sports betting, and skill games (such as poker). These regulators follow the Federal Gaming Act.</p>



<p>When it comes to Online Gambling regulations in Germany, few are more important than the identity verification rules. These state that robust age verification solutions need to be implemented by operators, using an approved age verification system that checks players’ names, addresses, date and place of birth, as well as nationality.</p>



<p>The goal of this is to combat illicit actions, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">Underage Gambling</a> and fraud. These <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a> have a big impact on both players and operators, forcing players to submit documents and wait for verification before gambling. Meanwhile, operators not only have to invest time and money to put these systems into place, but also overcome customer issues like users not understanding the verification process, or simply getting bored while waiting for verification.</p>



 Changes by the Glücksspielvertrag in Germany 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielvertrag</a> brings many changes to Online Gambling in Germany. Most importantly, it is now legalized in all of the country’s states, and operators need to obtain a permit to offer Online Gambling services.</p>



<p>There are many limitations, however, including enforced deposit limits, extra player protection, limitations to advertising and promotions, as well as robust verification requirements. Overall, these regulations seem to bring a promising future for Germany’s Online Gambling market – players can now safely seek regulated Online Gambling services, rather than having to resort to black market or offshore sites.</p>



<p>Of course, there is a lot for operators to do to keep, especially in terms of KYC requirements, however, players and operators alike are set to reap the benefits of an open and regulated market.</p>



 How to get a license as a gambling operator in DACH 



<p>Receiving a license as a gambling operator in DACH can be challenging. There are many requirements, and each country has its own specific rules which must be followed. In Germany, this includes following new Glücksspielvertrag regulations, which includes things like limiting monthly deposits of players, limiting activity on virtual slot machines, following KYC requirements, and more.</p>



<p>Things are a bit more complex in Switzerland. In order to receive a license for a casino, operators must follow regulations set out by the Swiss Federal Gaming Board. Additionally, an active land-based casino license is required to open an online casino. When it comes to betting, operators need to follow regulations set out by the Swiss Gambling Supervisory Authority, however, only two companies currently have a license.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in Austria, operators must be compliant with laws set out by the Law on Games of Chance, as well as regulations put in place by the Ministry of Finance and potentially local governments.</p>



<p>Check also our overview page: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">Online Gambling regulations in EU &amp; UK</a></p>



<p>Overall, there are many rules and regulations for operators to overcome to attain compliance and it can be a real challenge, especially when it comes to stringent technical aspects like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a>.

We’d create this subject to demand — so if this sounds useful, then please let us know via email (<a href="mailto:annette@darkmatterlabs.org">annette@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) or Twitter (@AnnetteDhami or @DarkMatter_Labs).</p><p>This blog intends to summarise the report’s contents — we welcome any insight or feedback, and use and adaptation of ideas; all of these materials are licenced under a Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0</a> International Licence.</p><p>The ideas shared here draw together a range of insights from interviewees, informal conversations, reading and the thoughts of many. A breakdown of contributions is shared in the Report introduction; the Report also includes a series of case studies which we encourage you to&nbsp;explore.</p><p>There are four ‘propositions’ in the report; they are tailored approaches based on tried-and-practised learning. Our intention is to gather insight from a range of organising and governance methods and propose a draft model of what a more appropriate grantmaking system might look like. It was never our intention to prescribe a fixed model or template, and we fully expect that governance models, in practice, will be formed in response to — and tailored to — unique contexts.</p><p>The next stage for us — and anyone else interested in experimenting with ideas shared here — is to create a working model and to learn from what evolves. We believe that the deep foundation of learning upon which the propositions sit means that these ideas are ‘safe enough to&nbsp;try’.</p><p>Proposition 1</p><p>An exploration and critique of the governance logics that can underpin funding methods for public value creation, recognising that the contexts being explored are influenced by many factors, only some of which are within an actor’s ability to influence.</p>Internal mapping that was developed to help us to see the landscape of the questions we are looking at and their interconnections.<p>After lightly tracing a history of philanthropy and contracting, we propose that an X+Y=Z logic, combined with a single-point definition of ‘value for money’ creates a race to the bottom and sets us up to provide little more than symptom response.</p>Adapted from the ‘Cone of Plausibility’ (Charles Taylor, 1988), grantmaking governance often involves projecting a desired destination (Z), predetermining the actions that will lead to it (X+Y), and then distributing funding on the basis that the actions are executed (and the destination reached) for the lowest possible cost (‘value for&nbsp;money’).<p>Although this can create order and control — it fails to accurately consider how complex systems function, and as a result, creates significant negative&nbsp;impacts.</p>This rough and stylised causal loops map seeks to illustrate some of the ways that these funding norms cascade across a system; it also seeks to highlight the other ‘rules’ in the broader systems that they take part in, and how these also play a role in locking in or reimagining these&nbsp;norms.<p>We propose an alternative logic of governance that can underpin funding stewardship.</p>Alternative logics: an unfurling approach towards a broader mission and agreement space, developed from multiple perspectives.<p>We propose that — if conditions are in place, including sufficient structure to assist navigability and to shed light on dynamics in the system — the impacts of this type of approach could dramatically improve the efficacy of our shared attempts to create public&nbsp;value.</p>This alternative stylised causal loops map seeks to illustrate some of the ways that alternative norms could cascade across a&nbsp;system.<p>Proposition 2</p><p>Adopting this new logic, we propose a draft outline of a governance model to orchestrate finance across a complex system, and exploring examples of how elements of this approached are already being lived and practised in various settings.</p>A visual depiction of the systems orchestration method outlined in Proposition 2<p>Proposition 3</p><p>An outline of five strategic areas for a systemic funding approach. It invites us to continue responding to symptoms; while investing in the discovery and systemic incorporation of emergent public value; growing capacity and capability of actors across the system; addressing imagined orders and narratives and building desire for change; while changing the hard rules in law, regulation and policy in order to overcome problematic lock-ins.</p>A visual depiction of the systemic funding approach outline in Proposition 2.A shared compass for actors to see how their work sits alongside others’, and collectively to check that various parts in the system are being addressed.<p>Proposition 4</p><p>Explores the behaviours and crafts that can be developed within any current system of funding governance, drawing upon insights from inspiring grantmakers and grantees.</p><p>We’ve summarised some of these shifts&nbsp;as:</p><p>Rebalancing and distributing your system of governance</p>  Recentering voices of embodied knowledge  Devolving assets for community governance  Shifting narratives through self-told stories  Wielding positional power to influence the wealth inequality that creates institutional philanthropy  <p>Addressing your organising crafts</p>  Supporting systemic legibility and compounded learning  Softening your boundaries and inspecting the way you&nbsp;organise  <p>We end the report with a nod to a reality ‘Beyond the Rules’ of philanthropy, and how it might look radically different if we are successful in transforming how we create&nbsp;change.</p><p>In this&nbsp;future:</p>  the formation of capital has been decentralised and all communities have access to capital formation and the ability to invest&nbsp;it  financing has moved beyond requiring existing capital to mitigate risk and is less reliant on underwriting assets accumulated in the&nbsp;past  discounting of future value has been adjusted so that longer-term investments are no longer so high&nbsp;risk  externalities of interventions are better incorporated into the core accounting models, shifting incentive systems  <p>The report ends with a series of case studies from the following groups, who are already each manifesting ways of organising and governing that provided inspiration for these propositions:</p>  Global Greengrants Fund&nbsp;UK  Guerilla Foundation  FundAction  BD Giving  An Untold Story&nbsp;Voices  <p>If you are interested in how we organise and govern within systems then you are invited to take part in the conversation. To subscribe to updates, we suggest filling in<a href="https://dark-matter-labs.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1"> this Typeform</a>&nbsp;. Over the next year, we’ll host a range of open learning sessions to further explore this topic together. We will also link up with the Transformative Governance group who are facilitating peer learning cohorts on this topic. The Democratic Society will be working deeply with a number of groups looking to shift their existing&nbsp;systems.</p><p>If you are a grantmaker and are interested in manifesting some of these ideas in your context, we will begin experimenting with a small group of grantmakers to build this approach in practice over the coming months. The intention is to set up a #BeyondtheRules Fund, which will, in turn, fund consecutive work by many actors developing practice on governing and organising in&nbsp;systems.</p><p>If you are interested in taking part please contact Annette Dhami on <a href="mailto:annette@darkmatterlabs.org">annette@darkmatterlabs.org</a> and Joe Doran on <a href="mailto:joe@lankellychase.org.uk">joe@lankellychase.org.uk</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/grantmaking-beyondtherules-8dfc752df3da">Grantmaking #BeyondtheRules</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Its membership consists of global remittance and payment companies, including MoneyGram, M-Pesa(by Vodafone), UPT, Trustly, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Together with IAMTN, we aim to use the MetaMUI blockchain to advance existing payment infrastructure and lead the way into a new era of international payment systems. While transferring money with current remittance service providers is expensive and time-consuming, on top of the MetaMUI blockchain, money can easily be transferred through a simple Internet connection without any intermediary currencies. As a result, global remittance fees and transaction costs can be significantly lowered, and money transfer times substantially reduced to a matter of seconds, regardless of where it is sent from or received.</p><p>With the potential to revolutionize the whole cross-border payments and international remittance industry, we are looking forward to working closely with IAMTN and its partners.</p><p>More about&nbsp;us</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>Identity plays a critical role in supply chains. Stakeholders place value on unambiguous identifiers for governments, organizations, people, devices, and assets. As supply chains grow more complex, we mitigate risks by codifying the relationships between these stakeholders and the actions they have taken over time into identifiers using shared terms to assess&nbsp;value.</p><p>We will explore the relationship between identity terms and supply chain using the purchase of organic strawberries as an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Introduction to Identity: A Strawberry Story</p><p>Identity in daily practice is shorthand for every action we&nbsp;take.</p><p>Bob buys fruit at the grocery&nbsp;store.</p><p>Each element in that sentence combines identifiers, claims, knowledge, logic, and likely several credentials to provide key stakeholders with the confidence they need to ensure a stable and trustworthy supply chain. Using organic strawberries as an example, a crop that grossed almost <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/Organics/organics_1_006%20_006.pdf">US $321 million in sales in 2019</a>, how those terms are defined and applied demonstrate the tangible value of identity in the supply&nbsp;chain.</p> Identifiers <p>What is the difference between an identity and an identifier?</p><p>Identifiers are labels for identities, or a way to recognize and establish identity.</p><p>In the context of supply chains, prudent stakeholders establish identifiers to avoid harm that might come from confusion over identity and protect value that is derived from certainty regarding identity and provenance. In practice, we mostly use identifiers as a way to describe separate entities and their interactions.</p><p>When we write policy, we mean for it to apply to identities, but when we convert that policy to software, it can end up applying only to identifiers. Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US government placed <a href="https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/country-guidance/russia-belarus">stringent export controls on Russia</a>. That policy is written using the English language identifier for Russia, but it is meant to enforce all language identifiers for Russia, including Россия. Software designed to implement the policy effectively should account for all identifiers associated with the restricted identity.</p><p>In the sentence about Bob’s shopping trip, there are multiple identifiers that can be added or altered that change nothing for the subjects of the sentence.</p><p>Robert buys strawberries at&nbsp;S-Mart.</p><p>In this way, identity is an abstraction used to communicate sameness, a way to say that two or more things are in fact the same&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Person = Robert,&nbsp;Bob</p><p>Goods = fruit, strawberries</p><p>Vendor = grocery store,&nbsp;S-Mart</p><blockquote>Zooko’s Triangle and&nbsp;Identity</blockquote><blockquote>Names as identifiers highlights one of the most challenging aspects of applying identifiers to supply chains, or any network protocol, often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko’s triangle</a>, an identity trilemma that maintains no single name can achieve more than two of: human-meaningful, secure, and decentralized.</blockquote><blockquote>In supply chain use cases, this triangle has often been addressed by trading decentralization for human readability, typically through the use of registries managed by trusted entities, for&nbsp;example:</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis">GS1 EPCIS</a> — Relies on a standards process for describing supply chain activity.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.sigstore.dev/">Sigstore</a> — Relies on email addresses and a centralized database.</blockquote><blockquote>Identifier registries solve for global uniqueness and discoverability by sacrificing privacy and decentralization, but there are many use cases where this trade off makes a lot of sense, for&nbsp;example:</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers">IANA Root&nbsp;Servers</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEA_number">DEA Numbers</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/advisories">GitHub Advisory&nbsp;Database</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM/ECF">Case Management/Electronic Case&nbsp;Files</a></blockquote> Claims Help Us&nbsp;Choose <p>Identifiers and claims are meaningless without each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Knowing who said something is just as important as what they said, or about whom they said&nbsp;it.</p><p>Most often, we encounter two kinds of&nbsp;claims:</p> Self Attested <p>Self attested claims are when an identity claims something about itself or something it controls. When you “agree to terms of service”, you are claiming to have read and understood the terms of service. The consequences of self attested claims are generally individualized, and the more valuable claims in the supply chain are made by reputable third&nbsp;parties.</p> Third Party&nbsp;Attested <p>Third Party Attestations are claims about a subject (identity) made by a different identity. In some US states to acquire a driver’s license, you need to present a physician’s signature to approve your medical authorization to drive because the state does not trust you to make these claims by yourself. Third party attestations are a common building block for establishing trust, and removing conflicts of interest.</p><p>One of the most common types of claims is a claim about the relationship between identifiers. Email verification to complete actions like signing up for a newsletter or establishing a new social media account helps the newsletter service links two of your personal identifiers together around your identity.</p><p>Third party attestations solve for Zooko’s triangle where we must associate a secure globally unique identifier with a human readable identifier. Leveraging a third party attestation for this allows us to get the benefits of multiple identifier formats at the cost of trusting the identity provider to make claims of equivalence.</p><p>Supply chain stakeholders can request third party attestations like an independent audit of a manufacturing or food producing facility; a third party security review of a cryptography library; or an independent review of a company’s financials before it can be bought or&nbsp;sold.</p><p>Bob buys organic strawberries at&nbsp;S-Mart</p><p>In this example, the claim is that the strawberries are organic. All strawberries carry the same identifier, but Bob prefers the strawberries that claim to be&nbsp;organic.</p> Logic Applied to Identifiers and&nbsp;Claims <p>“<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/logic">Logic is a particular way of thinking, especially one that is reasonable and based on good judgment</a>.”</p><p>Claims that leverage identifiers and logic, are better than claims that don’t. Not every identifier-claim pairing can be taken at face value because they don’t all map to logical assumptions.</p>  If there is a conflict of interest to misreport a value, it’s not logical to accept self attested claims regarding that&nbsp;value.  If the identifier for a subject might not be unique enough, how will we know which identity is making the&nbsp;claim.  <p>By taking care to design claims that leverage identifiers and their critical properties as noted by Zooko, we can remove ambiguity, reduce the chances of human errors that arise from confusion and poor communication, and increase the ability to process claims using automated systems that can exploit&nbsp;logic.</p><p>Bob buys organic strawberries at&nbsp;S-Mart.</p><p>Because claims can quickly become too complex to verify, it can be helpful to use logic to navigate a claim’s construction. If we apply logic to the claim that the strawberries are organic, we can immediately identify questions that verify or increase our confidence in the claim, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Where do the strawberries come&nbsp;from?  Is the organic claim made by the producer (labeled on the packaging) or S-Mart (unlabeled)?  Does S-Mart have a history of selling organic&nbsp;produce?  Does the product carry the USDA certified organic&nbsp;label?   Knowledge as&nbsp;Context <p>Knowledge comprises all the information about an identity, including identifiers, claims, and the results of applied&nbsp;logic.</p><p>It’s important to agree to common representations for knowledge so that claims can be understood with context. Shared vocabularies and ontologies can help remove ambiguity and reduce the possible complexity of claims, which in turn can unlock more efficient knowledge processing.</p><p>In the context of supply chains, we require knowledge about the details of each transaction in order to proceed safely and profitably:</p>  A container with a weight of 667 with no units can’t be safely loaded onto a&nbsp;ship.  An outstanding invoice of 100.50 with no currency can’t help us answer questions about how much in USD we&nbsp;owe.  <p>Instead of processing all invoices and containers in all possible currencies and physical units, supply chain stakeholders share knowledge by agreeing to a subset defined in a specific document. By rejecting data that does not meet those agreed-upon knowledge requirements, they can improve the quality of the data that is processed, and save on expensive and possibly dangerous normalization computations.</p><p>Not every supply chain system can use knowledge management to limit claims. For example, when processing real world data in many languages, you cannot just ignore claims in other languages. If you are dealing with historical data, there could be documents which you must process which may have complied with regulations at the time, but which are not compliant with current regulations.</p><p>Just as claims can change over time, so too can knowledge management systems.</p><p>Bob’s knowledge about his organic strawberry purchase could be augmented by S-Mart claims to source their strawberries from a local farm; a comparison between the cost of conventional versus organic strawberries at S-Mart; or an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/us/hepatitis-a-us-canada-strawberries.html">outbreak of hepatitis</a> caused by strawberries.</p> Credentials for Efficiency and Protection <p>When a claim is made by an identifier (issuer), in such a way that it can be attributed to the issuer’s identity, and is protected from being tampered with, some call it a credential, certificate or&nbsp;license.</p><p>Credentials about products are only meaningful when you trust the identity making the claim. If you are importing or exporting products that might have a national security, environmental or social impact, you probably need a special credential from a government to engage in that activity. When the stakes are that high, the most valuable credential comes from a reputable, mutually agreed upon third&nbsp;party.</p><p>If you learn you are interacting with an identity which has lost their license several times in the past few years, you search for a new vendor or evaluate if the price of the goods or service is worth the risk to your business.</p><p>Supply chain credentialing in the form of bills of lading, certificates of origin, or letters of credit is used to protect honest parties and their merchandise from being confused with dishonest parties or entities that are engaged in unethical practices, such as environmental destruction, or forced&nbsp;labor.</p><p>The best credential Bob can look for in the United States is the USDA organic sticker on his strawberries. But it’s not just a helpful credential for Bob. Producers who violate the USDA’s organic terms face up to <a href="https://attra.ncat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/nop_organiccertification.pdf?">$11,000 per violation and a revocation of the producer’s organic certificate</a>.</p><p>To incentivize the credentialing process for producers, obtaining USDA certification opens doors to participating in an <a href="https://attra.ncat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/nop_organiccertification.pdf?">organic trade agreement</a> where Canada, the EU, Japan, and Taiwan also recognize the USDA’s organic certification. The US producer that <a href="https://www.solidaritycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Strawberry-Global-Supply-Chains-in-Mexico.March-2021.pdf">controls 60 percent of the organic strawberry market</a> — Driscoll’s — made US $473 million in&nbsp;2018.</p><p>The value producers, consumers, and trade partners place on credentialed identifiers for this single commodity demonstrates the necessity for defining and securing identity terms across the entire supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicatacka/">Jessica Tacka</a>, Product Marketing Manager Transmute</p>

 The Cause to support Jolocom 



<p>Digital identification and verification is still a rare occurrence for some, and becoming common place for others. Fact is digital identities will become ubiquitous in just a few years. This is why the European Union, along with many other national lawmakers, are currently developing their positions on how to regulate this growing space and market, why a lot of the Big Tech actors are moving into the digital identity space, and why demand for digital identity infrastructure is steadily increasing.</p>



<p>The good news is: a lot of innovation is happening and things are developing at amazing speeds.</p>



<p>The vulnerable aspect is: the infrastructures we implement will have a decisive influence on who will own our individual data in the future. Will it be citizens and individuals themselves? Or large corporations or governments? How will this affect our freedoms, expressions of self and democratic processes?</p>



<p>Jolocom can offer identity infrastructure for users, entities and authorities that keeps data solely in the hands of the data subject, but also allows for controlled, self-sovereign exchange of select data with trusted partners. In order to get this infrastructure to production readiness, we now need to scale a lot faster than we have before, in order to forcefully compete with the federated or centralized identity infrastructures of GAFA &amp; Co. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting today, <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/5885/internet-archive">make a small donation</a> through Gitcoin and have an enormous impact for the production-readiness of SSI, through <a href="https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;grant=&amp;match=1000">Gitcoin’s quadratic funding</a>. The funding round closes on June 20th, 2022.</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/">Gitcoin Grant Round 14</a>&nbsp;is open now, supporting advocacy groups around the world. When you donate even 1 EUR worth of crypto to Jolocom, it will be multiplied through the matching pool. Quadratic funding rewards the number of community members who give, along with the amount. So many small donations can really have an enormous impact.</p>

<p>Why the blockchain works for the young and old people hate&nbsp;it</p><p>By Vinay Gupta, CEO, Mattereum</p><p>The younger generation suck at explaining the blockchain. No wonder there’s so much fear, uncertainty and doubt in the space right now. Let me explain what’s going on, but this time we’re going to leave the really important parts of the picture in the&nbsp;frame.</p><p>You’ve got to start in 2008 with the global financial collapse. Since then, interest rates have hovered around zero as government pumped cash into the global economy to keep it running. For a long time, no inflation. The extreme medicine was working. Then covid, and 5% inflation.</p><p>During that period with no inflation, and tons of money printing, there was very little economic growth. If there had been, inflation would have started then — the economy picks right up, credit risk goes down because lending is less risky, and prices start to rise on the&nbsp;cash.</p><p>So what happens to people who are turning 20 or graduating college in 2009? Nothing. Nobody will lend them money to start businesses, VC becomes extremely conservative and risk-averse, and Silicon Valley starts to consolidate. Life is slowly getting harder, and young are v.&nbsp;poor.</p><p>Actually take a look at this&nbsp;thing:</p><p>There’s just a titanic concentration of wealth in the hands of older people, and the young are living on scraps. This is absolutely brutal: feels like civilization is going backwards. The young are terrified.</p>(<a href="https://on.mktw.net/3muGpZu">https://on.mktw.net/3muGpZu</a> )<p>So in this situation what the young need is economic opportunity and THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET IT IN ANY RESOURCE POOL THAT THE BOOMERS CONTROL.There’s just no room to expand: whatever you want to do, there’s a tax: boomers control media distribution, VC finance, real estate. Most of the easy niches in the dotcom world are already taken: people shop, they read the news, they listen to music, they date — and big dotcoms are already in all of those niches. Nobody is going to overthrow reddit and FB anytime soon; they’re solidly locked into place now. This is a simple problem of access to capital: land, patents, intellectual property, distribution networks for physical products (Target, Walmart). The young don’t have enough cash to BUY INTO THE SYSTEM. They’re so poor they can’t even get exploited.</p><p>Now do you see Bitcoin’s’s fix? Bitcoin allows its adherents an escape from the boomer-ridden conventional economic landscape. What is bitcoin’s core feature? IT’S TOO HARD FOR BOOMERS TO USE. So you can build an economy for the young, a parallel state to the Boomer Dollar dominated US political landscape.</p><p>This is one of those Voice, Loyalty and Exit things. The young complain: nobody hears them. They try and tough it out in existing cultural blocs: still can’t make rent. But to exit the boomer-controlled old economy into the btc/web3 space? Wow: a huge self-financed bubble grows.There is practically no boomer control of bitcoin or web3. I’m 50, and I’m one of the oldest people in the space — Ian Grigg, David Chaum, Joe Lubin, Don Tapscott, a handful of others — but the old guys are rare and (apart from Joe) not that powerful.</p><p>Young blockchain frontier. Now, young people, they are not so smart. I was young myself. They make mistakes. Big ones. Now we have Oh So Many young people running around with a huge pile of capital that they basically created by believing each-other’s stories. It’s a creative pact. A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT.</p><p>So this New Social Contract (NSC), let’s examine things like Bored Apes. In this contract, kids who grew up with an ipad in their hand acquiring virtual property in games and trading it with friends, go from renting virtual property from Farmville to creating and owning it. Why is an Ape valuable? The younger generation decided it was valuable. Why isn’t this golf course valuable? The people that thought golf was at the centre of the universe are all too old to play much. This is a generational turnover of wealth, an escape from a locked-up world.</p><p>Because there’s practically no law in (for example) defi or the NFT game. The ICOs ran afoul of old school financial regulation. But the NFTs are bang in the middle of open ground: you draw a thing, the government says you own it outright if it isn’t Mickey Mouse. You sell it. So now you have tons of cultural production — young people making art for young people — but the distribution channel is OpenSea, and that’s also owned by… young people. And their fees are light. The younger generation are Exiting the Boomer Machine to live on their own terms. 25 years ago, John Perry Barlow (I met him once!) wrote The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace:</p><p>Does any of this sound familiar to&nbsp;you?</p><p>Now let’s discuss the New Social Contract’s critics.Who’s getting so het up here? Why all the hatred for Web3 these&nbsp;days?</p><p>Let me tell you where the action is: it’s the people who are waiting around to inherit their parent’s houses who are telling you that this NFT thing is no good and YOU SHOULD GET BACK INSIDE OF THE MACHINE WHICH WILL ONE DAY PAY MY PENSION. Because this “defection” hurts them. The more the young define their own system with their own rules, the more the old are missing out on the deal. But they’re mostly not watching this: Warren Buffet is an exception, and he called BTC “rat poison” remarkably early.</p><p>But he’s the&nbsp;rat.</p><p>But mostly the old missed it. Then the bridge generation, the one doing the complaining, clogging the airwaves with NFT hate and trying to coerce artists and brands into staying&nbsp;away.</p><p>What do they have to&nbsp;lose?</p><p>The answer is: they’re late to the party, and were hoping to WIN AT THE OLD GAME in the future. The well positioned chattering classes, the media and academics, want to inherit the system that the young are refusing to join and actively working to undermine. They don’t have real power yet but they know if the system stays up, in 20 years they’ll run the next TED/Davos. And these slightly younger defenders of the Status Quo are fighting like hell to defend the Status Quo only because they expect to inherit&nbsp;it.</p><p>If the cultural production system burns to the ground before they inherit, they get&nbsp;nothing.</p><p>All the value’s skipping a generation. So when you see somebody wailing on NFTs, ask the hard question: “how old are they, and what is their stake in the old&nbsp;system?”</p><p>This is not to say that NFTs and crypto are perfect: young people made them without much reference to the Old Social Contract and they worked very fast. I was under 30 in the 1990s when I got involved in cryptocurrency. By the time Ethereum rolled round I was one of the oldest members of the team: a stabilizing influence, perhaps. But I was on that side because I had nothing to lose: I had no property, no stake. Open Source guy! Now I’m plotting a global environmental and economic reform which, even if it works, I will not likely see the end of unless I live for a very long&nbsp;time.</p><p>I’m working for future generations now. <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/can-the-world-computer-save-the-world-part-3-building-an-economy-with-a-future-5d4156f06a04">(medium.com/humanizing-the…)</a></p><p>I should probably also mention <a href="http://myhopeforthe.world/">http://myhopeforthe.world/</a> which is a rough summary of how I spent my life before lucking into Ethereum and becoming the Launch Coordinator for the 2015&nbsp;launch.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-blockchain-sleep-of-reason-b28f3bd3f83b">THE BLOCKCHAIN SLEEP OF REASON</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology Web3 Network (OWN) Infrastructure <p>Web3 is here to revitalize the way in which our entire society operates, ushering in a new era of trust and collaboration. With its outstanding advantages in the fields of technology and economy, users now have more autonomy in the online world, with data no longer in the hands of a few tech giants. As more people participate in common governance, principles such as rights, information privacy, and copyright can be better protected.</p><p>This new type of production relationship also exposes certain problems, which are mainly manifested in decentralized scenarios such as content creation during social collaboration, community governance, and on-chain transactions. These actions still rely on centralized platforms; over-collaterailization is still not very mainstream in financial activities in the DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>The reality is Web3 social relations still lack the basic elements needed to create real trust. With the right infrastructure, we will remove bottlenecks in current systems, creating a long-term, effective social trust and collaboration within&nbsp;Web3.</p> Trust Infrastructure  The Underlying Layer: Providing a Solid Foundation <p>A high-performance and fully scalable underlying public chain is essential to building long-term growth of the on-chain trust ecosystem.</p><p>Ontology Web3 Network (OWN) Infrastructure provides an efficient, compatible and secure public chain at the base layer. The development of decentralized applications, network congestion, high transaction fees, and long transaction confirmation times can often affect user experience. In contrast, the OWN infrastructure helps solve these problems through its own Verifiable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (VBFT) consensus mechanism and Optimistic Rollup’s Layer2 solution. With this, the platform can process more than 5,000 on-chain transactions per&nbsp;second.</p><p>In terms of platform scalability, OWN supports multiple languages ​​and protocols. Following the EVM integration, it has realized support for 4 types of contracts, as well as multi-chain and cross-chain collaboration. In practice, if a project party builds an application based on OWN, it can easily migrate to the Ethereum platform. Its data can also be synchronized on multiple chains to achieve overarching integration across multiple&nbsp;chains.</p> The Protocol Layer: Enriches Identity Connotation <p>The underlying protocol layer is an important bridge for promoting trust cooperation. In Web2, identity mainly refers to information surrounding ancestry and real-life occupations. In the Web3 era, identity is endowed with richer connotations. For users to carry out various activities on the chain, they need a digital identity in the form of an address. Many people may think that the activities on the chain mainly focus on financial activities, such as transfers and pledges, but this is not the case. The most important element is the users themselves. Based on blockchain technology, the required data and information will go hand in hand, accompanied by a valid on-chain user who has been verified by KYC from beginning to&nbsp;end.</p><p>Therefore, the protocol layer technology that supports trust collaboration also plays a key role. Academic fraud, impersonation, and online fraud are all manifestations of blind spots in trust and cooperation. For example, tools such as the SDK in the ONT ID decentralized identity protocol can help solve issues such as academic&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>By issuing a Verifiable Credential (VC) the institution can view the signature and validity period of the credential to ensure it is trustworthy information. For the issuer, the VC can also be used to mark the status of the individual’s license for the verifier. These VCs can be bound with decentralized identities, created and managed by users, to be selectively displayed in line with the needs of various scenarios.</p><p>Once we have addressed issues surrounding identity, there will be a higher demand for reputation and data processing management. As such, Orange and POD can further provide solutions to help reputation and data processing reach their full potential.</p><p><a href="https://www.orangeprotocol.io/">Orange</a> is a protocol based on decentralized reputation. It uses a range of algorithms to calculate the data related to the user’s decentralized identity in different blockchain ecosystems, integrates the user’s reputation across the wider web, and can be used and circulated anywhere in&nbsp;Web3.</p><p><a href="https://poddb.io/">POD</a> is a Web3 on-chain data middleware for data collaboration that enables metadata processing across multiple blockchain networks. It helps to solve data management across the board, from obtaining the data, to correlation and utilization. In turn, POD makes it easier for developers, builders, and users to work with metadata and build a richer ecosystem when it comes to managing all metaverse data within a single interface.</p><p>The exploration of protocol layer technologies continues to develop. Both <a href="http://ONT.ID">ONT ID</a> and other community projects within the OWN network provide solutions to solve pain points and promote the construction of a more efficient and transparent trust cooperation mechanism. With the continuous development of Web3, there will be more object-oriented authentication requirements, and more innovative solutions will&nbsp;emerge.</p> The Application Layer: Effectively Connecting Users <p>In the Web3 production relationship dominated by the token economy, the public is prone to fall into a misunderstanding that trust collaboration is only related to financial activities. Yet, this is not the case. As the widespread adoption of crypto continues to rise, so does the appetite for data control and security of users’ assets. As such, asset management applications alone are no longer enough. <a href="http://ONTO.APP">ONTO Wallet</a> not only provides basic on-chain asset management functions, but also leads the way towards innovative functions that can meet wider Web3 needs, including decentralized identity. Each wallet user can create their own decentralized digital identity through the mobile client or desktop plug-in application. The assets that the user owns and the transactions on the chain will be recorded in the KYC-verified identity, and the individual can then independently manage their data. ONTO Wallet is regarded as a “Web3 gateway” and currently supports up to 25 chains, constantly expanding to meet the needs of a wider range of Web3&nbsp;users.</p><p>Additionally, users can generate corresponding credit points based on their on-chain behavior by using ONTO Wallet. The DID (ONT ID) owned by a user in ONTO Wallet represents their social relationship and can be used as a reference point when interacting with other users or applicants. In practice, a user with a high credit score (OScore) can rent a vehicle through the digital wallet without a deposit. The individual’s educational background, qualifications, and other key information are also closely related to the DID and stored on the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In OWN, the related ONT ID protocol-level products also include a suite of other protocols: ONT Login, the decentralized login component which optimizes the user login experience; ONT TAG, which provides KYC services; and Mercury, a peer to peer communication protocol for Web3 applications. Together, these products create sufficient channels for all parties to provide or use Web3 services, as well as to assist and accelerate the construction of decentralized applications.</p> Common and Compatible Infrastructure <p>When working towards creating total social trust, the base layer, the protocol layer, and the application layer become one. Together, they play a multi-dimensional role in laying a solid foundation and providing an advanced experience. The token model, node economy and identity authentication promotes the prosperity and development of the entire ecosystem.</p><p>In this regard, OWN fully reflects its versatility, specifically in:</p><p>- Multi-language support: OWN supports multiple languages ​​such as Java and GO, offering developers sufficient choice and insisting on an open source&nbsp;code;</p><p>- Multi-chain support: After the integration of EVM, 4 contracts, Native, NeoVM, WasmVM and EVM are now supported. With this, developers can migrate on-chain at a lower cost to achieve full integration with the Ethereum ecosystem and share with&nbsp;users;</p><p>- Multi-asset support: ONT is OWN’s native asset, while ONG is the on-chain fee that provides the Ontology Bridge to support the conversion of multiple&nbsp;assets;</p><p>- Multiple development tools: OWN offers users multiple development tools such as Web3 API, smart contracts, and blockchain browsers, with detailed documentation for developers’ reference.</p><p>The decentralized digital identity represented by ONT ID in OWN allows users to perform multiple functions such as asset management, on-chain governance, dApp, wealth management and&nbsp;lending.</p> Scenario-Based Trust Collaboration  The Trust of&nbsp;DAO <p>Identity-related solutions in the OWN infrastructure will play an important role when it comes to screening member structures in DAOs. Firstly, it can help to set the entry threshold. Users who want to become DAO members must pass KYC verification and achieve a high credit score before they can formally participate in any voting. This will filter out a large number of fake accounts and ensure that there is activity from users on the chain. In turn, the development of a DAO can be closely integrated with the services provided by Orange in OWN and reduce problems caused by centralization. This is achieved by determining the weight a vote carries in line with the user’s reputation. Users’ with high participation and a good credit score will have relatively greater rights to participate in governance.</p> NFT Circulation <p>Whilst assets are typically interchangeable, there is another non-fungible asset class that is typically represented by NFTs. From the earliest game props of CryptoKitties, to the series of avatars created by platforms such as the Bored Apes Yacht Club, NFTs have become a central product in the Web3 field, attracting a large number of creators and buyers. NFTs go through a series of circulation processes from generation, to attribution, and even destruction. Due to the value attached to NFTs, copyright, metadata, and attribution rights must be reviewed and defined. To this end, POD features methods for storing, organizing, managing, and using on-chain metadata to achieve entity-based storage, definition, and cross-platform data consistency.</p> DeFi Innovation <p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a remake of traditional finance in the blockchain field. Most notably, DeFi prevents the risk of malicious acts by centralized financial platforms. Among the many forms of DeFi, decentralized lending has become a key component. Decentralized lending lowers the high threshold for participation enforced by centralized institutions, as users do not need to provide a series of personal identification certificates. Instead, individuals only need to provide asset mortgages in the form of over-collateralization to complete loans. Evidently, over-collateralization is not an advanced financial resource allocation method. However, credit lending in the form of “borrowing” has begun to take shape through decentralized lending.</p><p><a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing Finance</a> was the first DeFi project for credit lending when the Inclusive Pool and OScore scoring system were launched. When users independently authorize OScore to read their own digital asset transaction records, holdings, KYC (real-name authentication) status, default, historical credit data, they will automatically generate their own OScore&nbsp;scores.</p><p>In order to ensure that credit lending is entirely secure, Inclusive Pool has established a risk control mechanism synchronously. Once a user defaults it will be included in OScore’s default list, but the defaulter’s private information is hidden and protected. At the same time, there are mechanisms such as liquidation and fines that allow users to complete credit lending through the OWN infrastructure while protecting their privacy. Individual users can also participate in governance to varying degrees based on their own reputation on the&nbsp;chain.</p> Metaverse Imagination <p>The metaverse refers to a virtual world parallel to the real world, creating monumental transformations of content production, economic systems, user experience, and physical world content. It builds an economic system based on blockchain technology, closely integrating the virtual world and the real world in the economic system, social system, and identity system.The metaverse presents a wide variety of manifestations, including games, virtual characters, and more, which have proven to be vastly popular across the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>The way in which users connect their real-world identities to the metaverse, while protecting their rights and personal assets, should be at the forefront of these rising innovations. ONT ID can help users to connect on-chain and off-chain identities, confirm the ownership of virtual assets, issue certificates, and further attribute them to users’ identities. These features will become an essential component for users to safely interact with each other in the metaverse, further promoting the establishment of trust and collaboration in virtual&nbsp;worlds.</p> Trust Collaboration will Come&nbsp;True <p>Decentralized trust collaboration will become crucial across all industries in order to eliminate the drawbacks of previous methods and bring true cost-free trust collaboration.</p><p>As the general blockchain infrastructure provided by Ontology for the Web3 ecosystem, OWN offers comprehensive infrastructure support, including basic blockchain underlying technologies, blockchain protocol-level technologies, and general-purpose tools. Moreover, OWN provides project parties with a platform that supplies developers with well-equipped tools and helps them to achieve faster results with less effort. These features, along with catering to the core demands of individual users, allow them to have independent control over their assets and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Trust infrastructures, such as OWN, can’t be built overnight. It is essential to ensure that the framework is flexible enough to function independently and when combined with other components to create a variety of different outcomes.

 216M $OCEAN program to unlock an Ocean of data, with up to 125%&nbsp;APY  1. Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean</a> Data Farming (DF) is launching. DF incentivizes for growth of data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards OCEAN to pool liquidity providers (stakers) as a function of consume volume and liquidity. It’s like DeFi liquidity mining, but tuned for data consumption. DF’s aim is to achieve a minimum supply of data for network effects to kick in, and once the network flywheel is spinning, to increase growth&nbsp;rate.</p><p>Expected APY can get up to 125% for any given week. To max out APY, you’ll need to work to help drive data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).</p><p>DF has these&nbsp;phases:</p>  DF Alpha. Counting starts Thu June 16. 10K OCEAN rewards are budgeted per week. Rewards are distributed at the end of every week, for the activity of the previous week. It runs 4 weeks. The aim is to test technology, learn, and onboard data publishers.  DF Beta. Counting starts Thu July 14. Rewards are up to 100K OCEAN per week. It runs up to 20 weeks. The aim is to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology.  DF Main. Immediately follows DF Beta. Rewards are up to 718K OCEAN per week. It runs for decades; at least 215.7M OCEAN total is committed. Expected APY is 125% over many months (once fully ramped), staying generous over the long&nbsp;term.  <p>The rest of this post is organized as follows. Section 2 gives specific instructions on how to earn, by staking and claiming rewards. Section 3 describes the reward function. Section 4 describes DF phases and future evolution. Section 5 describes OCEAN emitted and expected APYs. Section 6 concludes. The appendices have further&nbsp;details.</p><p>It’s time to farm.🧑‍🌾🚜</p> 2. How to Earn in&nbsp;DF  2.1 Introduction <p>DF rewards depend on data consume volume (DCV) and stake. The higher DCV, the higher the reward. The higher the stake, the higher the reward. (Section 3 elaborates.)</p><p>This section describes how to earn. First we focus on the more passive parts of DF: staking and claiming. Then, we will describe how high APYs will take active&nbsp;work.</p>If you want to earn, you’ve got to put in the work. Left: seeding. Right: harvesting 2.2 How to&nbsp;LP <p>To provide liquidity, towards earning DF&nbsp;rewards:</p><p>1a. Go to <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>&nbsp;webapp</p><p>1b. Find data assets that have consume volume (or that you expect will get consume&nbsp;volume)</p><p>1c. Add liquidity, i.e.&nbsp;stake</p>Where to add liquidity (stake) from <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>&nbsp;webapp. 2.3 How to Claim&nbsp;Rewards <p>At the end of the weekly cycle (Thursday), the DF core team computes rewards for LPs using <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py">this code</a>. Rewards are sent to the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/df-py/blob/main/contracts/DFRewards.sol">claims contract</a>, deployed to each <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">Ocean-supported network</a> (Eth, Polygon,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>As an LP, here’s how to claim&nbsp;rewards:</p><p>2a. Go to <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">DF webapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal</p><p>2b. Connect your&nbsp;wallet</p><p>2c. For each network: select network, click “Claim”, sign the tx, get rewards:)</p><p>Rewards will accumulate over weeks, so you can claim rewards at your leisure. If you claim weekly, you can re-stake your rewards for compound&nbsp;gains.</p>Claim Portal of <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">DF Webapp</a>. It’s linked directly from <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">oceanprotocol.com</a>. 2.4 Active work to drive&nbsp;APY <p>Data Farming is not a wholly passive activity. The name of the game is to drive data consume volume (DCV). High APYs happen only when there is sufficiently high DCV. High DCV means publishing and consuming truly useful datasets (or algorithms).</p><p>Thus, if you really want to max out your&nbsp;APY:</p>  create &amp; publish datasets — or work with people who&nbsp;can  consume them — or work with people who&nbsp;can  go stake on them, and finally claim the&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Driving DCV for publishing &amp; consuming is your challenge. It will take real work. And then the reward is APY. It’s incentives all the way&nbsp;down:)</p> 3. Reward Function&nbsp;Info  3.1 Who Receives&nbsp;Rewards <p>Pool liquidity providers (LPs) receive rewards based on the reward function.</p> 3.2 Reward&nbsp;Function <p>The reward going to an LP for a given pool depends on LP’s liquidity (stake) and how much that dataset is being consumed ($ volume). Reward&nbsp;is:</p><p>RFij = Sij *&nbsp;Cj</p><p>where</p>  Sij is LP i’s stake in pool&nbsp;j  Cj is data consume volume for pool j, in&nbsp;$  LPs receive rewards pro-rata according to&nbsp;RFij  <p>There are rewards only on pools where the data has consume volume. The higher the consume volume, the more the rewards. The more you stake, the more the rewards. If you want to max out rewards, find pools that people find useful and consume. Even better, publish your own datasets:)</p><p>For a given week, OCEAN rewarded is bounded by the OCEAN budget, keeping APY ≤ 125%, and dis-incentivizing “wash consuming”. The Appendix has&nbsp;details.</p><p>This is the reward function for DF Round 1 (DF1). Based on learnings, we can expect it to evolve in rounds that follow DF2, DF3,&nbsp;etc.</p> 3.3 Pools that&nbsp;Qualify <p>It’s data pools that receive DF rewards. A data pool contains Ocean datatokens for given data service. That data service may be of any type — dataset (for static URIs) or algorithm for Compute-to-Data.</p><p>To qualify for DF, a data pool must follow these criteria:</p>  Asset &amp; pool must have been created by Ocean smart contracts, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/v4main/addresses/address.json">deployed</a> by OPF to production networks  Asset &amp; pool must be visible on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>  Pool must use OCEAN or H2O as basetoken  Asset can’t be in <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory/blob/main/policies/README.md">purgatory</a>   3.4 Clarifications <p>Q: What’s the difference between staking in Ocean Market, and Data&nbsp;Farming?</p><p>You can stake your OCEAN in any data pool in Ocean Market, as of its launch (Jun 8). As a liquidity provider, you get paid a % cut of all swap&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Then, DF is an extra incentive: it gives rewards based on amount staked and the data’s $ consume volume. This post elaborates on&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Q: when exactly does counting start and finish, for a given&nbsp;week?</p><p>The counting starts at 12.01am on Thursday, and ends at 11.59pm on the following Wednesday.</p><p>Q: I staked for just one day. What rewards might I&nbsp;expect?</p><p>At least 50 snapshots are randomly taken throughout the week. If you’ve staked just one day, and all else being equal, you should expect 1/7 the rewards compared to the full 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>Q: The datatoken price may change throughout the week. What price is taken in the DCV calculation?</p><p>The price is taken at the same time as each consume. E.g. if a data asset has three consumes, where price was 1 OCEAN when the first consume happened, and the price was 10 OCEAN when the other consumes happened, then the total DCV for the asset is 1 + 10 + 10 =&nbsp;21.</p><p>Q: Can the rewards function change during a given&nbsp;week?</p><p>No. At the beginning of a new DF round (DF1, DF2, etc), rules are laid out, either implicitly if no change from previous round, or explicitly in a blog post if there are new rules. This is: rewards function, bounds, etc. Then teams stake, buy data, consume, etc. And LPs are given DF rewards based on staking, DCV, etc at the end of the week. Overall cycle time is one&nbsp;week.</p><p>Caveat: it’s no at least in theory! Sometimes there may be tweaks if there is community consensus, or a&nbsp;bug.</p> 4. DF Phases &amp; Evolution <p>This section elaborates on DF phases, and how DF will&nbsp;evolve.</p> 4.1 Phase: DF&nbsp;Alpha <p>DF Alpha runs for 4 weeks. The budget is 10K OCEAN per week. This is a conservative amount <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">by design</a>, as the primary aim is for everyone to&nbsp;learn:</p>  For data publishers to publish datasets (and pools), and finding consumers of their&nbsp;data.  For Data Farmers — anyone staking in an eligible pool — to learn more about Data Farming process, and to observe how rewards are received.  For the DF Core team to identify issues in the DF process, and resolve them before the stakes are&nbsp;high.  <p>While the budget is conservative, APY may still hit 125% in scenarios with low or moderate&nbsp;stake.</p> 4.2 Phase: DF&nbsp;Beta <p>DF Beta aims to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology.</p><p>It will run at least 10 weeks, and up to 20 weeks. The budget is at least 10K OCEAN per week, up to 100K OCEAN per&nbsp;week.</p><p>The DF Core Team will decide the amount each week, based on learnings so far. The aim is allocate OCEAN efficiently to activities that drive data consume volume in a beneficial way, rather than to mal-intentioned actors gaming the system. We hope to ramp to 100K OCEAN quickly and to complete in minimal time; but let’s&nbsp;see.</p><p>APY may hit up to&nbsp;125%.</p> 4.3 Phase: DF&nbsp;Main <p>DF Main is designed to give an APY of 125% until the amount staked gets super-high, with a cap according to the Bitcoin-like curve described below.</p><p>Here’s where the funds come from. OCEAN total supply is <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/https-blog-oceanprotocol-com-ocean-tokenomics-ii-faf05854314b">1.41 billion tokens</a>. Ever since Ocean was launched, <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/tech-whitepaper.pdf">51% of total OCEAN supply</a> (719M OCEAN) has been earmarked for the Ocean community; 30% of this will go directly to DF Main (=15.3% of total supply, or 215.7M&nbsp;OCEAN).</p><p>The baseline emissions schedule determines the weekly OCEAN budget for this phase. The schedule is like Bitcoin, including a half-life of 4 years. Unlike Bitcoin, there is a burn-in&nbsp;period:</p>  The curve initially gets a multiplier of 10% for 0–12&nbsp;months  Then, it transitions to multiplier of 25% for 0–6&nbsp;months  Then, a multiplier of 50% for 0–6&nbsp;months  Finally, a multiplier of&nbsp;100%.  <p>Each transition is made under control of a multisig by&nbsp;OPF.</p><p>The burn-in period <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-verifying-token-based-systems-c33eca757ecf">ratchets up value-at-risk over time</a>. It gives us time to learn and for future scope to get built, before full-blown emissions.</p><p>APY may hit up to 125%, especially for weeks where the OCEAN budget is comparatively high relative to the amount of&nbsp;stake.</p> 4.4. DF Evolution <p>With each weekly cycle, the DF core team may tune the Reward Function or make other changes based on learnings.</p><p>After DF Main is shipped, the DF core team will expand scope. Current plans&nbsp;are:</p>  DF Partners Program — While other DF rewards come from the baseline OCEAN budget, these are additional token rewards coming from Ocean’s collaborators: H2O stable asset, storage networks, L1 chains, and more. APY will sum across these; it may go much higher than the target 125% from baseline&nbsp;OCEAN.  Add rewards for fixed-price data.  Add rewards for free/open data.  DF Crunch Program — <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a>-style data science competitions. Initially, there will be a weekly reward to the best predictor of&nbsp;OCEAN.  Over time, DF changes will slow. Then, we will move to automate DF further <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/">towards full decentralization</a>.  <blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1534824753231544322">@trentmc0</a></p></blockquote> 5. Walk-Through Numbers <p>This section walks through example numbers. The first subsection describes OCEAN disbursement with the most aggressive possible schedule; the subsection after describes a conservative schedule. The likely scenario is somewhere in between. A third subsection describes possible&nbsp;APYs.</p> 5.1 OCEAN Schedule with Aggressive Ramp <p>Here’s a scenario that goes through DF the most aggressively: DF Beta takes 10 weeks and emits 100K OCEAN per week, and each multiplier in DF Main time takes 0 time (goes to 100% multiplier immediately). All plots are computed from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1SUpImOxVY8lVEinExzTVHQRjKev7519sWkzMiCCB4/edit#gid=0">this Google&nbsp;Sheet</a>.</p><p>The image below shows the first half-year for the aggressive-ramp scenario. The y-axis is OCEAN released each week. It’s log-scaled to easily see the differences. The x-axis is time, measured in weeks. We can see the distinct phases for DF Alpha, DF Beta, then DF&nbsp;Main.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 0.5 years, aggressive ramp<p>The image below is like the previous, but now shows for the first five years. DF Main starts at week 14 with full-blown OCEAN emissions. Recall that DF Main emission follows a Bitcoin-style curve where the rewards decrease according to an exponential with a 4-year half-life. With each DM main multiplier taking 0 time, it means that half of all the DF Main rewards are distributed in its first 4&nbsp;years.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 5 years, aggressive ramp<p>The image below shows the total OCEAN released by DF for aggressive-ramp scenario. The y-axis is log-scaled to capture both the small initial rewards and exponentially larger values later on. The x-axis is also log-scaled so that we can more readily see how the curve converges over&nbsp;time.</p>Total OCEAN released to DF — long term, aggressive ramp 5.2 OCEAN Schedule with Conservative Ramp <p>Here the opposite-extreme scenario, having a highly conservative ramp of DF rewards. DF Alpha runs at 10K OCEAN per week, over four weeks. DF Beta runs at 10K OCEAN per week, over 20 weeks. DF Main starts at the 10% multiplier, transitions to 25% at 12 months, to 50% at 18 months, and to 100% at 24 months. The image below shows the first five&nbsp;years.</p>OCEAN released to DF per week — first 5 years, conservative ramp<p>The image below shows the total OCEAN emitted for DF. The y-axis is log-scaled to capture both the small initial rewards and exponentially larger values later on. The x-axis is also log-scaled so that we can more readily see how the curve converges over&nbsp;time.</p><p>DF Beta starts at week 8, where the curve gets steeper. DF Main starts at week 20, where the curve is again more gradual. The curve gets steeper with each multiplier ratchet at weeks 48, 72, and 98, finally arriving at a shape just like the Bitcoin exponential curve.</p>Total OCEAN released to DF — long term, conservative ramp 5.3 Example&nbsp;APYs <p>The table below explores possible APYs, calculated from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_1SUpImOxVY8lVEinExzTVHQRjKev7519sWkzMiCCB4/edit#gid=187527164">this Google Sheet</a>. We assume 2.2M OCEAN staked in week 0, OCEAN staking growth initially 20% per week, growth rate reduces by 5% relative per week, and aggressive ramp.</p><p>Here are the highlights. In the first week that DF gets generous, APY is 125%. It stays pegged at 125% from week 8 until week 27. After that the amount of OCEAN staked has become sufficiently high that OCEAN released is the limiting factor to APY. APY gently reduces over time, to 66% one year in, and is still at 21.68% five years in. This APY does not account for other positive-APY factors such as OCEAN price rising; or negative-APY factors such as impermanent loss.</p>Expected APYs (aggressive ramp) 6. Conclusion <p>Ocean Data Farming incentivizes for data consume volume in the Ocean ecosystem. It gives expected APYs of up to 125%, and is designed to last for many&nbsp;decades.</p>Seed, harvest, then fill your bins. Image: #McConaghyFarms Appendix: Who are Data&nbsp;Farmers <p>A Data Farmer is anyone who adds liquidity (stake) to a qualified data pool, to receive&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Various actors in the Ocean ecosystem are therefore Data Farmers, each with their own unique advantages.</p>  Data Publishers can be Data Farmers. You’ve published a dataset, added liquidity, and got the dataset to be qualified for DF. Now, your liquidity will count for DF rewards. Your advantage is your understanding of how much a dataset might get consumed, as you published the&nbsp;dataset.  Data Curators / Stakers can be Data Farmers. You don’t have to publish data or consume data to get DF rewards. Just simply stake on the datasets eligible for DF rewards that you believe will offer you the best returns, ie datasets with good consume volume and where you can get a decent proportion of liquidity.  Data Consumers can be Data Farmers. If you only bought and consumed a dataset without adding liquidity, you’re not eligible for DF rewards. However as by consuming the dataset, you know its usefulness better than most, and are therefore well positioned to predict its consume volume. You can capitalize on this knowledge by staking on the most promising and eligible datasets, making you eligible for DF&nbsp;rewards.  Data Traders can be Data Farmers. If you’re just buying and selling data assets without staking, you’re not eligible for rewards. However if you’ve worked to understand the relative value of datasets enough, you can capitalize on this knowledge by staking on the most promising eligible datasets, making you eligible for DF&nbsp;rewards.  <p>We are all Data Farmers.&nbsp;👩‍🌾</p>You, Data Farmer. Image: #McConaghyFarms Appendix: Wash Consume&nbsp;Attack <p>DF addresses “wash consume” attacks by making them unprofitable once real DCV is high enough. Here are&nbsp;details.</p><p>Wash trading is where a malicious actor trades with themselves to fake trading volume, in cases that they are rewarded for high trading&nbsp;volume.</p><p>The equivalent in Ocean is wash consuming, where people buy and consume datasets for themselves, to get rewarded for high data consume volume. There are many possible ways to combat this; most require manual intervention.</p><p>Our solution is: knowing that there’s a maximum x% APY, then set a rule: for a data asset to be eligible for DF, it must have a % consume fee of y%. Our current calculations put this value around 3%; therefore this is the value of <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/fees/#ocean-community-fee">Ocean Community Order Fee</a>. This fee goes to the Ocean community every time a data asset is consumed.</p><p>This doesn’t eliminate wash consume. Rather, it makes wash consume unprofitable once real DCV gets big enough. Other material referenced in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Ocean Data Farming Series</a> elaborates.</p> Appendix: Reward Function&nbsp;Details  Candidate Reward&nbsp;Function <p>This section describes the reward function — a measurable formula that each actor can individually optimize&nbsp;for.</p><p>The initial reward function is given in the next subsection. Here’s the thought process that led to&nbsp;it.</p><p>What if the reward function was simply for the number of datasets added? Here’s the problem: people would create large numbers of random or garbage datasets. This doesn’t add value, of&nbsp;course.</p><p>What if it was the trading volume of a dataset, measured in OCEAN or $? This has two problems. First, most volume is speculative. This isn’t real value creation from a data perspective, it’s just money sloshing around in a (nearly) closed chamber. Furthermore, high trading volume of a token may not be a great proxy for value creation of that token, as we’ve seen with several scam-coins in&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>Where is the value creation for data? We’ve arrived at: it’s when people are actually consuming a data asset. Here’s an example. Researchers may have data for thousands of people; for each person there is genetic information, age, and whether the person has Parkinson’s. From this, the researchers build a model mapping genetic information and age to the chance of getting Parkinson’s. Then general practitioners use this model for early-stage screening. The model can report the chance of someone getting Parkinson’s; if it’s high they can take measures to slow the onset. This is an example of value creation, via consuming data. There are countless examples across many verticals.</p><p>We’ve established that consuming data is useful to aim for. What should be the specific measure? A first approach is the number of consumes of a data asset in a time period. But that doesn’t capture that some assets may be far more expensive than others. For example, compare a $1 dataset is bought and sold 1000 times, versus a $1000 dataset bought and sold 1000 times. Under this measure, all else being equal, both datasets would lead to the same reward. This is not desirable.</p> Towards a Chosen Reward&nbsp;Function <p>Better yet is consume volume, expressed in $ or OCEAN. Ocean Market uses OCEAN so we will focus on that. Then: consume volume = (# times a data asset was consumed in a time interval) * (price of that data asset, in OCEAN). This accounts for some assets being more valuable than others, yet avoids speculation volume.</p><p>Thus, consume volume (in OCEAN) is the key measure to incentivize for.</p><p>We can refine the incentive further. Ocean V3 introduced datatoken pools. These enabled automatic discovery of the price of data, and helped curation of data (higher liquidity in a pool is a useful signal). More liquidity in a datatoken pool means lower slippage when buying datatokens. In short, more liquidity is&nbsp;good.</p><p>Therefore liquidity of datatoken pools (in OCEAN) is the secondary measure to incentivize for.</p> Chosen Reward&nbsp;Function <p>We combine consume volume and liquidity into an overall DF Reward Function.</p><p>RFij = Sij *&nbsp;Cj</p><p>where:</p>  RFij = relative reward going to LP i in pool&nbsp;j  Sij= LP i’s relative stake in pool j = (LP’s $-value stake in pool j) / (total $-value stake in pool j). We express in $ terms, to allow for for pools with OCEAN or H2O as basetoken.  Cj = consume volume of data asset in pool j, spread among pools with that asset = (price of datatoken j in $ terms) * (# of consumes during the week) / (# pools with that data&nbsp;asset)  <p>Actors receive rewards pro-rata according to RFij, subject to the bounds described below.</p><p>We considered log() of each term, to incentivize for a variety of assets. Alas, this causes Sybil&nbsp;attacks.</p> Bounding Reward <p>For a given week, the OCEAN rewarded is bounded&nbsp;by:</p>  OCEAN budget for that week. E.g. for DF Alpha, this is 10K per&nbsp;week  APY bounded to ≤ 125%. An annual percent yield (APY) of 125% means a weekly percent yield (WPY) of 1.57171%.  Ensuring that wash consuming is unprofitable.  <p>Implementation of these bounds includes:</p>  Total OCEAN rewards distributed for that week = min(OCEAN_budget_week, total_staked *&nbsp;WPY)  APY ≤ 125% for each LP at each&nbsp;pool  3% consume fee that goes to the Ocean community  And more.  <p>For a given week, any OCEAN in the budget that was not distributed due to bounds will be saved in the DAO treasury for future DF rewards or other related community initiatives.</p> Appendix: Why&nbsp;Now? <blockquote>Q: DF was first <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">announced</a> right after Ocean V3 launch, more than a year ago. Why is it only shipping&nbsp;now?</blockquote><p>Here’s the answer. A pre-requisite for DF was for V3 to be hardened / stabilized further. Then, rug pulls happened in V3. Staking wasn’t safe enough to incentivize on with&nbsp;DF.</p><p>OceanONDA V4 <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-one-sided-staking-93988f65e378">One-Sided Staking</a> solved this.

<p><a href="https://collab.land/">Collab.Land</a>, a user-friendly, tokenised, community-management system, has announced a partnership with <a href="https://nuggets.life/">Nuggets</a>, a self-sovereign verified digital identity and payment platform, to allow users greater portability, interoperability, and control over their web3 reputation and DAO participation based on&nbsp;merit.</p><p>The integration will ultimately enable the portability of web3 verified credentials (VCs). While VCs typically refer to cryptographically verified, tamper-resistant credentials such as a passport or ID, web3 VCs can represent anything from Discord server badges to tokenised attestations of skills, character traits, membership or accomplishments.</p><p>Nuggets’ introduction comes amid a growing appetite from community members to build their web3 reputation and digital identity and port it across various online communities. By integrating Nuggets’ ID system, Collab.Land bypasses the need for users to have to rebuild their reputation from scratch each time they join a new community or&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Collab.Land started as a means for anyone to build tools to manage their community via bot integrations and has since snowballed. The service — which recently announced plans to decentralise and become a DAO — now boasts over 3.5 million users across its various communities including <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie infinity</a>, <a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a>, and <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/">NBA Top Shot</a>. As it stands, over 100 new communities are adding Collab.Land every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Decentralised, portable reputation is something that’s necessary for fulfilling the promise of web3, as well as being able to onboard DAO members based on merit. Reputation is everything when it comes to DAO governance, therefore, being able to attach a users’ DAO admittance, privileges, and voting rights to their Nuggets ID via SSI, which can be used across platforms and DAOs demonstrates how portable reputation is coming to life&nbsp;today.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamessyoung/">James Young</a>, Founder and CEO Collab.Land commented: “Our partnership with Nuggets illustrates a critical step in our journey to decentralise. Giving users control of their online reputation and allowing them to go beyond the confines of centralised platforms fits perfectly with that goal. Reputation and community can unlock many opportunities in web3, from DAO participation through to content moderation, and being able to verify standing in this space represents a significant boon for&nbsp;users.”</p><p>Nuggets enables individuals to secure their digital identity and associated finances through a self-sovereign identity and payment solution that serves as a reusable, interoperable and verified digitalID for Web 2.0, web3 and as a non-custodial cache for digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>This information can be ‘shared’ with the required parties without revealing any personally-identifying information. This is achieved via zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic technique that allows one party to verify data to another party without disclosing any information beyond the capacity to verify said&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alastairijohnson/">Alastair Johnson</a>, Founder and CEO at Nuggets, Said: “Reputation is paramount in web3. Being able to provide cryptographic proof of your credentials in a way that safeguards privacy and provides security perfectly aligns with the ethos of web3, and we’re thrilled to be working with Collab.Land to be making this a reality.”</p><p>If you’re a business looking to implement reusable digital identity, and for better ways to protect customer data, you can now enable Nuggets worldwide.</p><p>Get in touch and find out how at <a href="mailto:partners@nuggets.life">partners@nuggets.life</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/collab-land-enables-nuggets-verified-self-sovereign-digital-identity-8f99f35a13cf">Collab.Land enables Nuggets’ verified self-sovereign digital identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>False assumptions and misconceptions circulate in the media about the potential and risks of SSI. In this article, we address some of those misconceptions and summarize the most important core aspects of SSI. By doing so, we create a clear picture of what SSI is and, above all, what SSI is not and should not be.</p>



<p>Can SSI data be stolen and used without my knowledge? Is SSI enabling a data market and further misuse of our data?</p>



<p>The focus of SSI lies on self-determined use and simultaneous data security for the individual. At the same time, data economy is important: the user should only ever have to disclose the necessary minimum of information about himself that is necessary for the use of a service. In summary, with SSI you can only decide who you give your data to, but not what happens to it – which is not a technical question, but is due to the trust frameworks and the implementation of policies. This is regulated via certification and approval, as this creates trust in the involved actors of the ecosystem. SSI itself does not offer any general protection against data misuse. Nevertheless, it represents the possibility of managing one’s own data securely and independently using the principle of decentralization. The services to which personal data is transmitted are ultimately also bound by the General Data Protection Regulation. You can not only decide to whom you give the data, but also how (e.g. as ZKP or as VP).</p>



<p>Why does SSI offer more privacy than current systems?</p>



<p>Because we don’t outsource our data to hundreds of platforms, but manage it centrally. Ideally, hacking a service would not result in the capture of thousands of user profiles with sensitive data, only worthless peer-to-peer connects. This creates more privacy and personal responsibility for personal data. Christopher Allan’s first article on SSI already says: The user can and should decide for himself who he or she shows personal data to and for what purpose. The prerequisite for this is interoperability and portability of identities. In a way, this idea is the core of SSI. But the statement that as a user I have complete sovereignty over my digital identity is often misunderstood and is wrong in this form.</p>



<p>Does SSI make me loose my anonymity?</p>



<p>Which data a service requests depends on the service and the legal requirements. If the service provider is not bound by a real name obligation, i.e. not obliged to query and check a real name, he cannot demand this from the user either (according to the General Data Protection Regulation). If he does this anyway, the user must agree and a specific reason must be given.</p>



<p>Why does SSI have nothing to do with blockchain?</p>



<p>SSI is often equated with blockchain technology. This creates the impression that SSI can only work together with blockchain. However, this is not the case. We have summarized a comprehensive explanation here: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/">https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Aside from the convergence of decentralized and centralized identities and the return of policy-based access controls, here is my #3 on the list of hot topics at EIC 2022: Identity proofing &amp; fraud reduction. These are two closely related topics, with fraud covering not only the initial proof of an identity, but also the recurring access and user behavior.</p>
 Massive market uptake 
<p>We have seen a massive uptake in both fields, with identity proofing also having a close link to decentralized identities and the reusable proofs in identity wallets. Identity proofing as the reliable verification of the identity of someone, e.g., via video identification, has seen a significant uptake, as well as the number and maturity of fraud reduction solutions, which we refer to as FRIP (Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms).</p>
<p>To find out more about these topics, have a look at this webinar on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/facilitating_business_with_state_of_the_art_identity_proofing_solutions">Facilitating Business with State-of-the-Art Identity Proofing Solutions</a>, this video on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/iam-essentials-identity-proofing-verification">IAM Essentials: Identity Proofing and Verification</a>, this webinar on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/choosing_the_right_fraud_tool">Choosing the Right Fraud Reduction Intelligence Tool in a Digitally Evolving Economy</a>, and this Leadership Compass on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80127/fraud-reduction-intelligence-platforms">Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms</a>.</p>
 Mainstream technologies 
<p>The most important trend, though, is that both technologies are becoming mainstream. Identity proofing, so far, has been mostly used in heavily regulated use cases such as the finance industry or by telcos for mobile phone contracts. The majority of FRIP use cases still is also in the finance industry and in some fields of retail. This is about to change. We observe an uptake in interest and adoption in other industries, for workforce and business partner fraud analytics, and for identity proofing, e.g., for the remote workforce.</p>
<p>HR and IAM processes can become modernized and optimized by applying such technologies, as the security posture can be increased. It is time for every organization to put more attention on the potential of these technologies for their processes and security.</p>
