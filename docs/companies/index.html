             February 2024   
	 
		 
			 Why Do Asset Managers Embrace Tokenization? 
 
<p>I’m excited to share some exciting news from our side, as we proudly participated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/businesses/digital-assets?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4#tokenization">Citi’s tokenization use case to test the ERC-3643 token standard</a>&nbsp;for enforcing compliance on-chain. This showcased how tokenized securities can thrive in a decentralized infrastructure while maintaining compliance and control.</p>
<p>Another significant news is Blackrock’s recent statement on tokenization, positioning it as the next step after the cryptocurrency spot ETFs. Now, let’s delve into why asset managers are eagerly embracing tokenization. According to PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/library/asset-wealth-management-trends.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">research</a>, the top priorities for asset managers in the next two years include&nbsp;accessing new segments and clients, increasing market share, and mitigating risks through product diversification. Below, I will explain how tokenization helps asset managers to achieve these strategic goals.</p>
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenization opens the door for asset managers to gain new capital sources from untapped segments&nbsp;– new regions, and new types of investors such as High Net Worth (HNW) investors and family offices, to meet market demand and gain market shares. Illuminating this potential, EY’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/financial-services/tokenization-in-asset-management?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;underscores a significant trend: 61% of HNW investors plan to invest in tokenized assets in 2024. Tokenization enables asset managers to tackle the historical challenges rooted in manual, time-consuming processes, and fragmented systems through programmability and shared infrastructure. It empowers them to acquire the capability to efficiently handle a large number of clients and unlock a potential&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/how-tokenization-can-fuel-a-400-billion-opportunity-in-distributing-alternative-investments-to-individuals/?utm_medium=social_advocacy&amp;utm_source=LinkedIn-dysi&amp;utm_content=659945e8-bafb-4474-abae-0cdb8cd50411&amp;utm_term=147236&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">$400 billion revenue opportunity</a>, according to Bain &amp; Company.</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/asset-wealth-management/high-net-worth-investor.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">survey</a>&nbsp;shows that 66% of HNW investors desire increased personalization in their wealth management relationship. This trend towards personalized models is also highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2024/jan/asset-management-trends-for-2024.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;“10 Asset Management Trends for 2024,” suggesting opportunities for asset managers to compete with wealth manager home offices. Tokenized securities embed asset data, enabling such customization.&nbsp;By offering tailored tokenized portfolios based on clients’ risk profiles, asset managers can attract and retain clients.&nbsp;Tokenization can even combine with AI to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/the-new-financial-world-ai-meets-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">AI to analyze, and blockchain to execute</a>, creating another level of personalized experience.</p>
<p>Regarding risk management, thanks to transparency, automation, and availability of asset data, asset managers can&nbsp;automatically rebalance portfolios to migrate risks&nbsp;based on predefined risk conditions. For instance, setting up a smart contract to trigger a sell-off when the risk rating level transitions from AAA to AA.</p>
<p>Lastly, as highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s report, a notable trend in the private market is the&nbsp;surge in Limited Partner (LP) secondaries and the emergence of net asset value (NAV-based) lending.&nbsp;These have gained momentum as the return on capital slows, and investors increasingly seek liquidity.&nbsp;Tokenization emerges as a powerful solution, offering diversified products and cultivating liquidity. Tokenized securities, carrying both compliance rules and asset data, enable instant compliant transferability, support peer-to-peer transactions, and integrate seamlessly with third-party trading applications. This enables global and flat distribution. Furthermore, lending smart contracts can be easily launched to allow LPs to pledge their tokenized securities for borrowing.</p>
<p>This emphasis on liquidity is also our primary focus as&nbsp;we build distribution rails to expand the DINO distribution network for tokenized securities, as discussed by Xavi Aznal, our Head of Product, in&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-2024-products-building-the-distribution-rails-of-the-tokenized-economy/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">the last Product Focus newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>We anticipate witnessing the launch of tokenization projects by at least 5 out of 10 of the largest asset managers this year.</p>
<p>Let’s stay tuned for this exciting moment.</p>

 The invisible pull of universal ID&nbsp; 
<p>We’ve been <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">writing about the new Australian Government Digital ID System</a> (AGDIS) and <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14477065-a-big-little-step-australia-shifts-from-digital-identity-to-digital-id">talking about it the Making Data Better podcast</a>. We’re reading press reports, speaking to commentators, and finding some ambiguity about whether this thing is might be a new ID or attribute.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister Katy Gallagher, responsible for the Digital ID Bill, says she is not in the business of producing a new national ID. We believe her.</p>
<p>Yet many still believe AGDIS must be producing some sort of new attribute. It could provide a new way to do KYC checks when opening a bank account, or proving how old we are when we buy alcohol online.</p>
<p>A lot is left to the imagination: Does AGDIS really mean a new attribute, a de facto ID?</p>
<p>The invisible pull of universal ID is strong! </p>
<p><a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/">In our latest short conversation</a>, <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/george-peabody/">George</a> and I try to clarify what AGDIS could be delivering.</p>
 How do we think about the prospect of new attributes? 
<p>We’ve been celebrating the fact that with the Digital ID Bill,<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/rip-trusted-digital-identity-but-whither-australias-tdif/"> the government is not talking about “digital identity” anymore</a>.</p>
<p>But the term Digital ID in the public mind could be construed as a new identifier or national ID, and many don’t like that idea.</p>
<p>The good people of Australia, the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand — the Common Law system countries — are famously allergic to National ID. So, there are some optics to be concerned about.</p>
<p>But much more important is the question of how relying parties use any ID, be it old or new. It’s the relying parties that actually make use of IDs and take a risk on them. We’ve seen over and over around the world that the success of digital identification is in the hands of relying parties.</p>
<p>The critical problem with a new digital ID is that the relying parties’ existing systems don’t know how to consume it.</p>
<p>They will not have seen it before. They won’t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>Even if lawyers and risk officers gave it the all-clear, a new ID needs to be incorporated into subsystems and business processes that have operated for years around driver’s licenses, birth certificates and Medicare numbers. Subsystems include onboarding routines, user interfaces, databases, risk assessments, and call centre processes. They would all need updating for a new ID.</p>
 The need for flexibility in identification 
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) has a bad reputation and it’s far from perfect, but it works in familiar ways, drawing on sets of well-established IDs which can be put together in different ways to onboard new customers.</p>
<p>Every bank actually does KYC differently. KYC conventions allow for variations. </p>
<p>This is critical. Think of the challenge of “low doc” customers — individuals without the affordances of passports or driver licences who still have the same right to participate in the finance system. To accommodate customers with diverse personal documents, banks can vary their KYC processes.</p>
<p>Banks know their own way business environments and rightly have the discretion to customise their identification processes. </p>
<p>When KYC draws on lists of established IDs, it allows for flexibility, and compensatory controls when identification pathways need to be varied.</p>
<p>But if we throw a new attribute into the ecosystem — especially one that is supposed to be better or preferred — then we force the banks back to square one to work out what to do with it.</p>
<p>We know perfectly well from the <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/fractional-identity-an-alternative-to-nstic-federated-identity-models/">failure of grand Identity Federations</a> that trust isn’t transitive. That is, the work done by one party to manage its risks is not going to satisfy other parties.</p>
<p>Instead of any new IDs or bundles of attributes, we need to make better data available to established identification processes. The Australian Digital ID System can do that simply through verifiable credentials that make it impossible for ID data to be replayed by fraudsters.</p>
<p>Let’s move away from plaintext presentation of IDs and adopt device-bound presentation just like we have with our chip payment cards and digital wallets, where hardware and software work together to make each presentation unique and non-replayable.</p>
<p>The golden opportunity we have now comes from so many people having computers in their hands that can present and release data in a far more secure way than filling out a form.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, we understand why people can suspect that Digital ID going to be a new ID, but it’s not. No new ID is needed.&nbsp;To fix online identification, we can conserve all the IDs we know today and make the move from plaintext to device-bound smart presentation.</p>

   Moving towards a passwordless future is crucial for cybersecurity. So many high-profile breaches highlight the vulnerability of relying on passwords. Embracing passkeys, digital credentials tied to user accounts, and applications, offers a more secure and user-friendly alternative. Organizations should advocate for enhanced security, cost savings, and smoother user experience. In the meantime, imp

<p>Why isn’t the world moving more quickly towards passwordless tech?</p>



<p>Passwords have long been the bedrock of cybersecurity, but let’s face it, they aren’t a great solution, especially when personal and financial data is at risk. If you show me a news article about a high-profile breach, I’m probably going to point to reliance on passwords as one likely cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In 2020, Ticketmaster <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ticketmaster-pays-10-million-criminal-fine-intrusions-competitor-s-computer-systems-0">pleaded guilty</a> to a charge of repeatedly and illegally accessing competitors’ computers. How? They had an employee who used to work for a rival company. That employee was able to the login credentials for multiple corporate accounts at that rival company to steal information.&nbsp; 



 Also in 2021, the New York City Law Department ended up <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyberattack-on-nyc-law-department/">exposing the personal data</a> of thousands of city employees. This included evidence of police misconduct, medical records for plaintiffs, and more. All because of a single employee’s stolen email account password. 



 23andMe, in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/15/23andme-hack-data-genetic-data-selling-response">exposed data</a> for millions of users, thanks to hackers using all the bad passwords they could find to run what’s called credential stuffing attack that got them into the systems where they could harvest data to their dirty little hearts’ content. 
 



<p>What’s so wildly frustrating about all this is that there are better ways to secure accounts! We just have to get companies to support them.</p>



<p>So, let’s look at a more secure alternative.</p>



 The Case for Going Passwordless&nbsp; 



<p>Older passwordless solutions, like hardware tokens and smart cards, definitely offer enhanced security. You have to physically have a thing in order to access a thing. Combine that with something like biometrics, and suddenly you have two-factor authentication: something you have and something you are. I’ll be the first to admit, though, that diving straight into requiring a physical … something … to log in is not going to be the solution for everyone. It’s an extra step, and it involves someone buying that physical thing. There is always cost associated with security that may outweigh the data you are trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The really good news here is that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">cute little hardware tokens</a> that you are going to lose, or, if you’re like my friend Sarah, will need to put on a pair of earrings so you don’t lose them, are no longer your only option for going passwordless. Enter in, stage left, passkeys!</p>



 About Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys are a technology that feels almost too good to be true, because they can work with your mobile device OR with a hardware token. What you use to store your passkey depends a lot on what security model you’re following: super duper high levels of security, or a casual, please don’t access my New York Times subscription model. If you want the full gory details of how passkeys work, I suggest you go down the rabbit hole at the FIDO Alliance website. They’ve got a great primer at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 No, really, what is a passkey? 



<p>So, what is a passkey? A passkey is a digital credential, like an electronic key in this case, tied to both a user account and a website or application. Users can authenticate without having to enter a username or password, or provide any additional authentication factor, because they have this key, which is entirely under their control and can’t be shared or stolen the way a password can. When a user is asked to sign-in to an app or website (basically unlocking access with the key), the user approves the sign-in with the same biometric or PIN that the user has to unlock the device the passkey is stored on (whether that device is a phone, computer, or hardware key).&nbsp; It’s really just that easy to use. If my cats had phones, they could totally do this.</p>



<p>One of my favorite things about passkeys, when they comply with the FIDO standards that define them, is that they can’t be phished. Anyone spoofing an email, phone call, or SMS asking for your password or the code you received in a text message is out of luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we have something that’s actually easier to use than a password because we don’t have to type anything in AND is more secure. So let’s talk about making the business case.&nbsp;</p>



 Crafting Your Business Case 



<p>I’m going to suggest that to advocate for passwordless systems, you need emphasize the benefits: enhanced security, potential cost savings, and a smoother user experience. What organization doesn’t find that attractive? I’m also going to go ahead and recognize that if you are working in a regulated industry like banking, a lot of this is already old news to you. Why? Because if you’re in the US, the Federal Trade Commission has required MFA since 2021 through its <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/09/2021-25736/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information">Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information</a>. If you’re in the EU, you have similar requirements not to mention the recommendations in <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-eIDAS-2-how-digital-identity-verification-plays-a-key-role">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS 2 directive</a>.</p>



<p>But, for the rest of us, yay, let’s emphasize the benefits! But who are you emphasizing the benefits to? If you’re in the IT security department, you probably don’t need to be convinced. But there are a variety of other stakeholders in an organization that you can get on your side. If you’re in a big company, your HR, Legal, PR, and Financial departments might have a thing or two to say about protecting the company’s reputation by avoiding being lit on fire in the news because of a cybersecurity breach. They might also be really fond of the idea of having an argument to lower the tech insurance costs. And if you’re in a regulated industry like banking, healthcare, or are handling government contracts, then this is an obvious requirement to pass those audits. So, yep, lots of positive reasons to make these changes.</p>



<p>Whether your company is in the business of IT or not, better security is critical. If you have an Internet presence, if your employees log in to something to do their work, and especially if you have consumers, there are a lot of business cases you can make for moving away from a pure password model into something a bit more technologically sexy and secure.</p>



 Embracing Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Jumping straight to a passwordless world might be a bit too much to expect, and look a little too much like arcane magic to your executives. There are still things you can do to make your reliance on passwords a little less fraught with peril! And that’s requiring multi-factor authentication. MFA, which also encompasses two-factor authentication, requires at least two out of the following three things:</p>



 
 something you know 



 something you have 



 something you are 
 



<p>So, like a password, a physical token, or your biometrics. In some cases, you may want to require all three! It depends on what you’re trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More systems are ready to support MFA than they are to support passkeys. One of your limiting factors in convincing your organization to support passkeys is that the software you use might not support it yet. OK, I get it, but if your software or services doesn’t support MFA yet, you really need to have some stern words with your vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a lot of information out there about best practices when it comes to how to deploy MFA. I want to highlight two articles from the IDPro Body of Knowledge that should be required reading in this space:</p>



 
 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/49/">Designing MFA for Humans</a> – Nishant Kaushik 



 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/92/">Multi-factor Authentication</a> – Khaled Zaky and Dean H. Saxe 
 



<p>When your organization considers rolling out MFA or starts to evaluate MFA as part of their vendor evaluations, these articles will give you some really good things to think about when it comes to balancing what individuals need versus what’s the best shiny object for cybersecurity professionals, and what is best practice all around. Go read them.</p>



 Transition Strategies and Best Practices&nbsp; 



<p>You’ve made the case. You’re going to start with pushing MFA as a little less scary, a little more supported. But there are a few of your vendors or services ready to dive straight into the passwordless universe. That’s brilliant! However, as much as I love MFA and passkeys, and I want you to get there, I’m telling you right now, don’t just throw your user base into this brave new world and think that’s going to work for you.</p>



<p>Start with pilot programs, evaluate feedback, and scale up. You’re going to need to convince some people that the magic of passkeys is really more secure. You’re going to need to get them to understand that yes, their account even though they are just a junior staffer in the PR department, using MFA is important. You’ll need different arguments for different stakeholder groups, and that’s ok.</p>



<p>For your executives, cite successful case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of MFA or passkeys with existing systems. A basic Google search will net you several examples; if you’re using a vendor like Ping or Okta, they almost certainly have more. For your line managers, they might be more compelled if you pointed them to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-do-you-train-your-employees-use-multi-factor">thread on LinkedIn</a> about “How do you train your employees to use multi-factor authentication securely and effectively?“ where their peers talk about the benefits of MFA.</p>



<p>There are other organizations that are paving the way. <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys">Google Identity</a> has some great developer documentation about passkeys. Okta has some <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/8-steps-for-effectively-deploying-mfa/">pretty good stuff</a> about MFA.</p>



 The Road Ahead 



<p>it’s going to take time for your organization to actually move, especially if you’re just starting to make the case for this change. This is good, because there is still one rather important kink to work out, and that’s account recovery. If, or more to the point, when, you lose your hardware token, phone, or whatever device you have your passkey on, you have a problem, and it’s not one a helpdesk can easily help you solve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least at the moment, some of the best advice in high-security situations is to make sure you’re protected against losing your hardware tokens, have more than one hardware token. Not the best model ever, to be honest. There are other points to consider as well, and for all of those fine points about account recovery, I’m going to point you right over to the article on <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/64/">Account Recovery</a> by Dean Saxe over in the IDPro Body of Knowledge.</p>



<p>The journey to a passwordless future is ongoing. Stay informed about emerging technologies, educate your team, and be a proactive advocate for advanced security solutions in your organization.</p>



 Wrap Up&nbsp; 



<p>There you have it: my thoughts on how you can and should advance towards a passwordless future while bolstering security with multi-factor authentication. This post is purely a place for you to start; it should inspire you to encourage change both in how you handle your own accounts and how you take action for organizational change.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu">The General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR), the European Union’s landmark <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-privacy">data privacy</a> law, took effect in 2018. Yet many organizations still struggle to meet compliance requirements, and EU data protection authorities do not hesitate to hand out penalties.</p>



<p>Even the world’s biggest businesses are not free from GDPR woes. Irish regulators <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/22/facebook-fined-mishandling-user-information-ireland-eu-meta">hit Meta with a EUR 1.2 billion fine</a> in 2023. Italian authorities are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/italy-regulator-notifies-openai-privacy-breaches-chatgpt-2024-01-29/">investigating OpenAI</a> for suspected violations, even going so far as to ban ChatGPT briefly.</p>



<p>Many businesses find it hard to implement GDPR requirements because the law is not only complex but also leaves a lot up to discretion. The GDPR puts forth a litany of rules for how organizations in and outside of Europe handle the personal data of EU residents. However, it gives businesses some leeway in how they enact those rules.</p>



<p>The details of any organization’s plan to become fully GDPR compliant will vary based on the data the organization collects and what it does with that data. That said, there are some core steps that all companies can take when implementing the GDPR:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Inventory personal data 



 Identify and protect special category data&nbsp; 



 Audit data processing activities 



 Update user consent forms&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Create a recordkeeping system 



 Designate compliance leads 



 Draft a data privacy policy 



 Ensure third-party partners are compliant 



 Build a process for data protection impact assessments 



 Implement a data breach response plan 



 Make it easy for data subjects to exercise their rights 



 Deploy information <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/security-controls">security measures</a> 
 



 Do I need to implement GDPR?&nbsp; 



<p>The GDPR applies to any organization that processes the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/pii">personal data</a> of European residents, regardless of where that organization is based. Given the interconnected and international nature of the digital economy, that includes many—maybe even most—businesses today. Even organizations that don’t fall under the GDPR’s purview may adopt its requirements to strengthen data protections.</p>



<p>More specifically, the GDPR applies to all data controllersand data processors based in the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA includes all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A data controller is any organization, group, or person that collects personal data and determines how it is used. Think: an online retailer that stores customers’ email addresses to send order updates.</p>



<p>A data processor is any organization or group that conducts data processing activities. The GDPR broadly defines “processing” as any action performed on data: storing it, analyzing it, altering it, and so on. Processors include third parties that process personal data on a controller’s behalf, like a marketing firm that analyzes user data to help a business understand key customer demographics.</p>



<p>The GDPR also applies to controllers and processors that are located outside the EEA if they meet at least one of the following conditions:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The company regularly offers goods and services to EEA residents, even if no money changes hands. 



 The company regularly monitors the activity of EEA residents, such as by using tracking cookies.&nbsp; 



 The company processes personal data on behalf of controllers in the EEA.&nbsp; 



 The company has employees in the EEA. 
 



<p>There are a few more things worth noting about the GDPR’s scope. First, it is only concerned with the personal data of natural persons, also called data subjects in GDPR parlance. A natural person is a living human being. The GDPR does not protect the data of legal persons, like corporations, or the deceased.</p>



<p>Second, a person does not need to be an EU citizen to have GDPR protections. They merely need to be a formal resident of the EEA.</p>



<p>Finally, the GDPR applies to the processing of personal data for virtually any reason: commercial, academic, governmental, and otherwise. Businesses, hospitals, schools, and public authorities are all subject to the GDPR. The only processing operations exempt from the GDPR are national security and law enforcement activities and purely personal uses of data.</p>



 GDPR implementation steps&nbsp; 



<p>There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all GDPR compliance plan, but there are some foundational practices that organizations can use to guide GDPR implementation efforts.</p>



<p>For a list of the key GDPR requirements, see the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/gdpr-compliance-checklist/">GDPR compliance checklist</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Inventory personal data&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>While the GDPR does not explicitly require a data inventory, many organizations start here for two reasons. First, knowing what data the company has and how it is processed helps the organization better understand its compliance burdens. For example, a business that collects user health data needs stronger protections than one that collects only email addresses.</p>



<p>Second, a comprehensive inventory makes it easier to comply with user requests to share, update, or delete their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A data inventory can record details like:</p>



 
 Types of data collected (usernames, browsing data) 



 Data populations (customers, employees, students) 



 How data is collected (event registrations, landing pages) 



 Where data is stored (on-premises servers, cloud services) 



 The purpose of data collection (marketing campaigns, behavioral analysis) 



 How data is processed (automated scoring, aggregation) 



 Who has access to data (employees, vendors) 



 Existing safeguards (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">encryption</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>)&nbsp; 
 



<p>It can be difficult to track down personal data that is scattered throughout the organization’s network in various workflows, databases, endpoints, and even <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/shadow-it">shadow IT assets.</a> To make data inventories more manageable, organizations can consider using data protection solutions that automatically discover and classify data.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ibm-guardium-data-protection">Learn how IBM Guardium® Data Protection automatically discovers, classifies, and protects sensitive data across major repositories like AWS, DBaaS, and on-premises mainframes.</a></p>



 Identify and protect special category data&nbsp; 



<p>When inventorying data, organizations should make a note of any especially sensitive data that requires extra protection. The GDPR mandates added precautions for three kinds of data in particular: special category data, criminal conviction data, and children’s data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Special category data includes biometrics, health records, race, ethnicity, and other highly personal information. Organizations usually need a user’s explicit consent to process special category data.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Criminal conviction data can only be controlled by public authorities and processed at their direction.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Children’s data cannot be processed without parental consent, and organizations need mechanisms to verify the ages of data subjects and the identities of their parents. Each EEA state sets its own definition of “child” under the GDPR. Cut-offs range from under 13 to under 16 years old. Companies must be prepared to comply with these varying definitions.&nbsp; 
 



 Audit data processing activities&nbsp; 



<p>During the data inventory, organizations record any processing operations the data undergoes. Then, organizations must ensure that these operations comply with GDPR processing rules. Some of the most important GDPR principles include the following:</p>



 
 All processing must have an established legal basis: Data processing is only acceptable if the organization has an approved legal basis for that processing. Common legal bases include obtaining user consent, processing data to execute a contract with the user, and processing data for the public interest. Organizations must document the legal basis for every processing operation before beginning. 
 



<p>For a full list of approved legal bases, see the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu">GDPR compliance page.</a></p>



 
 Purpose limitation: Data should be collected and used for a specifically defined purpose.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Data minimization: Organizations should collect the minimum amount of data necessary for their specified purpose.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Accuracy: Organizations should ensure that the data they collect is correct and current.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Storage limitation: Organizations should securely dispose of data as soon as its purpose is fulfilled.&nbsp; 
 



<p>For a complete list of GDPR processing principles, see the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/gdpr-compliance-checklist/">GDPR compliance checklist</a>.</p>



 Update user consent forms&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>User consent is a common legal basis for processing. However, consent is only valid under the GDPR if it is informed, affirmative, and freely given. Organizations may need to update consent forms to meet these requirements.</p>



 
 To ensure that consent is informed, the organization should clearly explain what it collects and how it will use that data at the point of data collection. 
 



 
 To ensure that consent is affirmative, organizations should adopt an opt-in approach, where users must actively check a box or sign a statement to signal consent. Consents cannot be bundled, either. Users must agree to each processing activity individually.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 To ensure that consent is free, organizations can only require consent for data processing activities that are genuinely integral to a service. In other words, a business cannot force users to disclose their political opinions to buy a t-shirt. Users must be able to revoke consent at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 Create a recordkeeping system&nbsp; 



<p>Organizations with more than 250 employees, and companies of any size that regularly process data or handle high-risk data, must keep written electronic records of their processing activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, all organizations may want to keep such records. Not only does this help track privacy and security efforts, but it can also demonstrate compliance if an audit or breach occurs. Companies can lessen or avoid penalties if they can prove that they made a good-faith effort to comply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data controllers may want to keep particularly robust records, as the GDPR holds them accountable for the compliance of their partners and vendors.&nbsp;</p>



 Designate GDPR compliance leads&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>All public authorities and any organizations that regularly process special category data or monitor subjects on a large scale must appoint a data protection officer (DPO). A DPO is an independent corporate officer in charge of GDPR compliance. Common responsibilities include overseeing risk assessments, training employees on data protection principles, and working with government authorities.</p>



<p>While only some organizations are required to appoint DPOs, all may want to consider doing so. Having a designated GDPR compliance lead can help streamline implementation.</p>



<p>DPOs can be employees of a business or external consultants who offer their services on contract. DPOs must report directly to the highest level of management. The company cannot retaliate against a DPO for doing their duties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations outside the EEA must appoint a representative within the EEA if they regularly process the data of EEA residents or handle highly sensitive data. The EEA representative’s main duty is coordinating with data protection authorities on the company’s behalf during investigations. The representative can be an employee, an affiliated company, or a hired service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DPO and the EEA representative are different roles with different responsibilities. Notably, the representative acts at the organization’s direction, while the DPO must be an independent officer. An organization <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-32018-territorial-scope-gdpr-article-3-version_en">cannot appoint one party</a> to serve as both DPO and EEA representative.</p>



<p>If an organization operates in multiple EEA states, it must identify a lead supervisory authority. The lead supervisory authority is the main data protection authority (DPA) overseeing GDPR compliance for that company throughout Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically, the lead supervisory authority is the DPA in the member state where the organization has its headquarters or conducts its core processing activities.&nbsp;</p>



 Draft a data privacy policy&nbsp; 



<p>The GDPR requires that organizations keep people informed about how they use their data. Companies can meet this requirement by drafting privacy policies that clearly describe their processing operations, including what the company collects, retention and deletion policies, user rights, and other relevant details.</p>



<p>Privacy policies should use plain language that anyone can understand. Hiding important information behind dense jargon can violate the GDPR. Organizations can ensure that users see their policies by sharing privacy notices at the point of data collection. Organizations can also host their privacy policies on public, easy-to-find pages on their websites.&nbsp;</p>



 Ensure third-party partners are compliant&nbsp; 



<p>Controllers are ultimately responsible for the personal data that they collect, including how their processors, vendors, and other third parties use it. If partners are noncompliant, controllers can be penalized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations should review their contracts with any third parties who have access to their data. These contracts should clearly spell out the rights and responsibilities of all parties with respect to the GDPR in a legally binding way.</p>



<p>If an organization works with processors outside the EEA, those processors still need to meet GDPR requirements. In fact, data transfers outside the EEA are subject to strict standards. Controllers in the EEA can only share data with processors outside the EEA if one of the following criteria is met:</p>



 
 The European Commission has deemed the country’s privacy laws adequate 



 The European Commission has deemed the processor to have sufficient data protections 



 The controller has taken steps to ensure that the data is protected 
 



<p>One way to ensure that all partnerships and data transfers comply with the GDPR is to use standard contractual clauses. These prewritten clauses are preapproved by the European Commission and freely available for any organization to use. Inserting these clauses into a contract makes it GDPR compliant, provided each party abides by them. For more information on standard contractual clauses, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj">see the European Commission website</a> (link resides outside ibm.com).</p>



 Build a process for data protection impact assessments 



<p>The GDPR requires organizations to conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) before any high-risk processing. While the GDPR offers a few examples—using new technologies, large-scale processing of sensitive data—it does not exhaustively list every high-risk activity.</p>



<p>Organizations may consider conducting a DPIA before any new processing operation to be safe. Others may use a simplified pre-screening to determine whether the risk is high enough to warrant a DPIA.</p>



<p>At a minimum, a DPIA must describe the processing and its purpose, assess the necessity of the processing, evaluate risks to data subjects, and identify mitigation measures. If the risk remains high after mitigation, the organization must consult with a data protection authority before moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/guardium-insights/data-compliance">Learn how IBM Guardium® Insights can help streamline compliance reporting with preconfigured workflows for GDPR, CCPA, and other key regulations.</a></p>



 Implement a data breach response plan&nbsp; 



<p>Organizations must report most personal <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach">data breaches</a> to a supervisory authority within 72 hours. If the breach poses a risk to data subjects, such as identity theft, the company must also notify the subjects. Notifications must be sent directly to victims unless doing so would be infeasible. In that case, public notice is sufficient.</p>



<p>Organizations need effective <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/incident-response">incident response</a> plans that swiftly identify ongoing breaches, eradicate threats, and notify authorities. Incident response plans should include tools and tactics to recover systems and restore <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/information-security">information security</a>. The faster an organization regains control, the less likely it is to suffer serious regulatory action.</p>



<p>Organizations can also take this opportunity to strengthen <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-security">data security</a> measures. If a breach is unlikely to harm users—for example, if the stolen data is so heavily encrypted that hackers can’t use it—the company does not need to notify data subjects. This can help avoid the reputation and revenue damage that can follow a data breach.</p>



 Make it easy for data subjects to exercise their rights&nbsp; 



<p>The GDPR grants data subjects rights over how organizations use their data. For example, the right of rectification lets users correct inaccurate or outdated data. The right to erasure lets users have their data deleted.</p>



<p>Generally speaking, organizations must comply with data subjects’ requests within 30 days. To make requests more manageable, organizations can build self-service portals where subjects can access their data, make changes, and restrict its use. Portals should include a way to verify subjects’ identities. The GDPR puts the burden on organizations to verify that requesters are who they say they are.</p>



 Automated decisions and profiling&nbsp; 



<p>Data subjects have special rights regarding automated processing. Specifically, organizations cannot use automation to make significant decisions without a user’s consent. Users have the right to contest automated decisions and request that a human review the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations can use self-service portals to give data subjects a way to contest automated decisions. Companies must also be prepared to appoint human reviewers as needed.&nbsp;</p>



 Data portability&nbsp; 



<p>Data subjects have the right to transfer their data anywhere they want, and organizations must facilitate those transfers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to making it easy for users to request transfers, organizations should store data in a shareable format. Using proprietary formats can make transfers difficult and impede users’ rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a full list of data subject rights, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/gdpr-eu">see the GDPR compliance page</a>.</p>



 Deploy information security measures 



<p>The GDPR requires that organizations use reasonable data protection measures to close system vulnerabilities and prevent unauthorized access or illegal use. The GDPR doesn’t mandate specific measures, but it does state that organizations need both technical and organizational controls.</p>



<p>Technical security controls include software, hardware, and other technology tools, like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/siem">SIEMs</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-loss-prevention">data loss prevention solutions</a>. GDPR heavily encourages encryption and pseudonymization, so organizations may want to implement these controls in particular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizational measures include processes like training employees on GDPR rules and implementing formal <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-governance">data governance</a> policies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The GDPR also directs companies to adopt the principle of data protection by design and by default. “By design” means that companies should build data privacy into systems and processes from the start. “By default” means that the default setting for any system should be the one that maintains the most user privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/data-security">Learn how IBM data security and protection solutions secure data across hybrid clouds and simplify compliance requirements.</a></p>



 Why GDPR compliance matters&nbsp; 



<p>Any organization that wants to operate in the European Economic Area (EEA) must comply with the GPDR. Noncompliance can have serious consequences. The most significant violations can result in fines of up to EUR 20,000,000 or 4% of the organization’s worldwide revenue in the previous year, whichever is higher.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-compliance">data compliance</a> isn’t just about avoiding consequences. It has benefits, too. Aside from the fact that GDPR compliance lets organizations access one of the world’s largest markets, GDPR principles can significantly strengthen data security measures. Organizations can stop more data breaches before they happen, avoiding an average cost of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">USD 4.45 million per breach.</a></p>



<p>GDPR compliance can also boost a business’s reputation and build trust with consumers. People generally prefer to do business with organizations that <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/telecommunications/connectivity-mobile-trends-survey/2023/data-privacy-and-security.html">meaningfully protect customer data</a>.</p>



<p>The GDPR has inspired similar data protection laws in other regions, including the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ccpa-compliance">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> and India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act. The GDPR is often considered one of the strictest of these laws, so complying with it can position organizations to comply with other regulations as well.</p>



<p>Finally, if a company does run afoul of the GDPR, demonstrating some level of compliance can help soften the repercussions. Regulatory bodies weigh factors like existing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity controls</a> and cooperation with supervisory authorities when determining penalties.</p>

<p>Actually, Holochain 0.2 has been with us for a long time — since last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">May</a> — and developers have been actively building hApps on Holochain 0.3 for a while as well. But for developers who are new to Holochain, we’ve still been recommending 0.1 up until this point. That’s because 0.2’s new networking layer introduced a few <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">performance</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-6-maintenance-release/#holochain-02-progress-building-comprehensive-diagnostic-capacities">regressions</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">peer discovery</a> issues, and we wanted to be confident that the user experience was reasonably smooth before recommending it.</p><p>Today is the day we're now recommending Holochain 0.2.6 for all existing and new projects.</p><p>You'll notice that this release has been out for a few weeks, and there have been a number of unannounced releases since 0.2.1. In recent months we’ve adopted a new process for public releases. Here’s how it looks:</p>  The core dev team cuts a release candidate (RC).  The release candidate is ‘smoke tested’ to make sure it works with a few mature apps that exercise a lot of its functionality, particularly <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">Talking Stickies</a> and HoloFuel.  If the smoke test passes, the RC designation is removed and the commit is promoted to a proper release.  The dev tooling (client libs, scaffolding, etc) are updated to the new release.  A ‘soak test’ is performed, in which an app is run for a couple weeks in order to discover long-term performance and discoverability issues.  If the soak test passes with reasonable performance, the commit is promoted to the latest recommended release and we spread the news.  <p>It’s been a long time coming, but Holochain 0.2.6 is finally the first release in the 0.2 series to pass the above checks to our satisfaction. Let’s get into what’s new.</p> Holochain 0.2.6: Recommended for all developers <p>Release date: 6 February 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x</p><p>The changelog from Holochain 0.1.6 is too long to repeat here, but here are the highlights:</p>  New networking layer based on WebRTC, which lets us use off-the-shelf session negotiation and NAT hole-punching techniques. The QUIC protocol, which we built 0.1’s&nbsp; networking layer on, was great, but it forced us to build a lot of network tooling from scratch.  Many performance improvements and fixes for peer discovery, function calls, signals, and gossip; apps feel much faster (and we’re working on making it faster still).  A small number of breaking changes in the conductor APIs and the WASM host API.

<p>Today, people don’t just prefer instant communication; they expect it. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) leads the charge in breaking down barriers between businesses and their audiences. This class of AI-based tools, including chatbots and virtual assistants, enables seamless, human-like and personalized exchanges.<br><br>Beyond the simplistic chat bubble of conversational AI lies a complex blend of technologies, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing</a>&nbsp;(NLP) taking center stage. NLP translates the user’s words into machine actions, enabling machines to understand and respond to customer inquiries accurately. This sophisticated foundation propels conversational AI from a futuristic concept to a practical solution.</p>



<p>Several natural language subprocesses within NLP work collaboratively to create conversational AI. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/natural-language-understanding">natural language understanding</a>&nbsp;(NLU) focuses on comprehension, enabling systems to grasp the context, sentiment and intent behind user messages. Enterprises can use NLU to offer personalized experiences for their users at scale and meet customer needs without human intervention.</p>



<p>Natural language generation (NLG) complements this by enabling AI to generate human-like responses. NLG allows conversational AI chatbots to provide relevant, engaging and natural-sounding answers. The emergence of NLG has dramatically improved the quality of automated customer service tools, making interactions more pleasant for users, and reducing reliance on human agents for routine inquiries.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">Machine learning</a>&nbsp;(ML) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning</a> (DL)&nbsp;form the foundation of conversational AI development. ML algorithms understand language in the NLU subprocesses and generate human language within the NLG subprocesses. In addition, ML techniques power tasks like speech recognition, text classification, sentiment analysis and entity recognition. These are crucial for enabling conversational AI systems to understand user queries and intents, and to generate appropriate responses.</p>



<p>DL, a subset of ML, excels at understanding context and generating human-like responses. DL models can improve over time through further training and exposure to more data. When a user sends a message, the system uses NLP to parse and understand the input, often by using DL models to grasp the nuances and intent.</p>



<p>Predictive analytics integrates with NLP, ML and DL to enhance decision-making capabilities, extract insights, and use historical data to forecast future behavior, preferences and trends. ML and DL lie at the core of predictive analytics, enabling models to learn from data, identify patterns and make predictions about future events.</p>



<p>These technologies enable systems to interact, learn from interactions, adapt and become more efficient. Organizations across industries increasingly benefit from sophisticated automation that better handles complex queries and predicts user needs. In conversational AI, this translates to organizations’ ability to make data-driven decisions aligning with customer expectations and the state of the market.</p>



<p>Conversational AI represents more than an advancement in automated messaging or voice-activated applications. It signifies a shift in human-digital interaction, offering enterprises innovative ways to engage with their audience, optimize operations, and further personalize their customer experience.</p>



 The value of conversational AI 



<p>According to <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/conversational-ai-market-A13682">Allied market research</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside IBM.com), the conversational AI market is projected to reach USD 32.6 billion by 2030. This growth trend reflects mounting excitement around conversational AI technology, especially in today’s business landscape, where customer service is more critical than ever. After all, conversational AI provides an always-on portal for engagement across various domains and channels in a global 24-hour business world.</p>



<p>In human resources (HR), the technology efficiently handles routine inquiries and engages in conversation. In customer service, conversational AI apps can identify issues beyond their scope and redirect customers to live contact center staff in real time, allowing human agents to focus solely on more complex customer interactions. When incorporating speech recognition, sentiment analysis and dialogue management, conversational AI can respond more accurately to customer needs.&nbsp;</p>



 Distinguishing between chatbots, conversational AI and virtual assistants&nbsp; 



<p>AI&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-agent">virtual assistants</a>&nbsp;represent two distinct types of conversational AI. Traditional chatbots, predominantly rule-based and confined to their scripts, restrict their ability to handle tasks beyond predefined parameters. Additionally, their reliance on a chat interface and a menu-based structure hinders them from providing helpful responses to unique customer queries and requests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two main types of chatbots:&nbsp;</p>



 
 AI-powered chatbots:&nbsp;Use advanced technologies to efficiently address basic queries, saving time and enhancing customer service efficiency.&nbsp;<br> 



 Rule-based chatbots: Also known as decision-tree or script-driven bots, they follow preprogrammed protocols and generate responses based on predefined rules. Optimal for handling repetitive, straightforward queries, they are best suited for businesses with simpler customer interaction requirements.&nbsp; 
 



<p>In contrast, a virtual assistant is a sophisticated program that comprehends natural language voice commands and executes tasks for the user. Well-known examples of virtual assistants include Apple’s Siri, Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, primarily used for personal assistance, home automation, and delivering user-specific information or services. While organizations can integrate conversational AI into numerous systems, such as customer support bots or virtual agents for companies, virtual assistants are typically used to offer tailored assistance and information to individual users.</p>



 What makes a good AI conversationalist? 



<p>Combining ML and NLP transforms conversational AI from a simple question-answering machine into a program capable of more deeply engaging humans and solving problems. Sophisticated ML algorithms drive the intelligence behind conversational AI, enabling it to learn and enhance its capabilities through experience. These algorithms analyze patterns in data, adapt to new inputs, and refine their responses over time, making interactions with users more fluid and natural.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NLP and DL are integral components of conversational AI platforms, with each playing a unique role in processing and understanding human language. NLP focuses on interpreting the intricacies of language, such as syntax and semantics, and the subtleties of human dialogue. It equips conversational AI with the capability to grasp the intent behind user inputs and detect nuances in tone, enabling contextually relevant and appropriately phrased responses.</p>



<p>DL enhances this process by enabling models to learn from vast amounts of data, mimicking how humans understand and generate language. This synergy between NLP and DL allows conversational AI to generate remarkably human-like conversations by accurately replicating the complexity and variability of human language.</p>



<p>The integration of these technologies extends beyond reactive communication. Conversational AI uses insights from past interactions to predict user needs and preferences. This predictive capability enables the system to directly respond to inquiries and proactively initiate conversations, suggest relevant information, or offer advice before the user explicitly asks. For example, a chat bubble might inquire if a user needs assistance while browsing a brand’s website frequently asked questions (FAQs) section. These proactive interactions represent a shift from merely reactive systems to intelligent assistants that anticipate and address user needs.</p>

<p>This week, as thousands of network operators, technology vendors, and mobile device providers from all over the world converge on Barcelona for <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/">Mobile World Congress</a>, it’s the perfect time to discuss how IBM® is shaping the future of network operations and telecommunications.</p>



<p>Outside the glitz of new phones, connected cars and 5G with everything, there are some real challenges the industry must address. Top of mind for me are three key challenges, and opportunities, to which we must all pay attention, should we expect our industry to remain healthy.&nbsp;</p>



 Accelerating AI adoption and skills for the telecoms sector 



<p>The AI skills gap is very real: executives estimate that 40% of their workforce will need to reskill as a result of implementing AI and automation over the next three years. The telecom industry is no exception.</p>



<p>That’s why, alongside the GSMA, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gsma-and-ibm-collaborate-to-accelerate-ai-adoption-and-skills-for-the-telecoms-sector-with-launch-of-generative-ai-training-program-and-industry-challenge-302047328.html">IBM recently announced</a> a new collaboration to support the adoption of and skills for generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the telecom industry through the launch of GSMA Advance’s AI Training program and the GSMA Foundry Generative AI program.</p>



<p>Our vision is to prepare telco leaders and practitioners for the AI-era by equipping members with skills and knowledge to help effectively leverage gen AI technologies. Obviously, IBM has a huge stake in the success of AI with &nbsp;watsonx™, our AI and data platform with AI assistants. By equipping and sharing AI knowledge and best practices, we help ensure successful and safe adoption of AI across the industry.</p>



<p>Generative AI holds tremendous potential to help improve all manner of operations and customer engagement. Through their commitment to developing generative AI skills and training for the telecom industry, the GSMA and IBM want to enable mobile operators to provide better services and, ultimately, help more people benefit from digital connectivity.</p>



 Deriving value from modern application architecture with hybrid cloud connectivity 



<p>One of <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/themes#:~:text=Game%20Changers&amp;text=Extended%20reality%20is%20breaking%20the,continue%20to%20grow%20and%20change.">the major themes</a> for this year’s Mobile World Congress Barcelona, “Connecting Everything” aligns with IBM’s work to help companies streamline application connectivity with products that that are simple, secure, scalable, and seamless to deploy. Easy to say, hard to do – at least without the right toolsets.</p>



<p>Enterprises continue to adopt edge, hybrid, and multicloud architectures with applications and data assets spread across public and private clouds while also supporting a remote, dynamic userbase. This creates a consistent issue: IT teams struggle with delivering secure, predictable network connectivity that is required by their applications, and often have no idea how applications are connected to each other because they no longer control or manage the network resources.</p>



<p>At IBM, we’re committed to helping ensure that enterprises are putting connectivity at the center of their application-centric strategies and regaining control of network connectivity across a multi-cloud environment they don’t own. In December, we announced the general availability of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/app-centric-connectivity-a-new-paradigm-for-a-multicloud-world/">IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh</a>, our multicloud networking solution that can support IT in their journey to optimize application performance with reliable network connectivity. Keeping up with business-critical application performance spread across complex networks is now an issue of the past.</p>



<p>Additionally in 2023, we expanded our accessibility of IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh to the&nbsp;<a href="https://deploy.equinix.com/product/bare-metal/">Equinix Metal</a>&nbsp;platform to enhance our customers’ ability to take advantage of the extensive Equinix infrastructure footprint to choose where to deploy and connect their enterprise applications in a flexible and efficient way.

 Eliminating network complexity and bolstering application connectivity 



<p>In a world where consumers expect the best possible experience when interacting with an organization’s offerings, DNS continues to serve an important role in how we transact through applications and data. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly a year ago, IBM made the strategic <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Plans-to-Acquire-NS1-to-Help-Enterprises-Drive-Network-Agility-in-their-Hybrid-Cloud-Environments?utm_content=239812657&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-1482690138">decision to acquire NS1</a>, a leading provider of network automation SaaS solutions and authoritative DNS, with the intent of leveraging NS1 technology to improve our clients’ network resiliency and performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s why we’re excited to have &nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect">IBM NS1 Connect®</a>, a premium DNS solution that leverages the power of NS1 technology to deliver fast, reliable connectivity for applications and websites across the globe, available to customers. With IBM NS1 Connect, we’re delivering a customer experience that can help businesses drive revenue, lower customer churn, and improve the agility of network teams. With IBM NS1 Connect, we’re delivering a customer experience that can help businesses drive revenue, lower customer churn, and improve the agility of network teams.</p>



<p>Perhaps hidden from view for most users, you’ve likely used IBM NS1 Connect multiple times today. As it constantly finds the highest performant, lowest latency way for you to receive web and streaming traffic from many of the largest global content providers, banks, and retailers.</p>



<p>IBM NS1 Connect combined with&nbsp; <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-05-17-IBM-Announces-Launch-of-IBM-Hybrid-Cloud-Mesh-to-Help-Enterprises-Regain-Control-of-their-Multicloud-Infrastructure">IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh,</a>&nbsp; create enormous value as an end-to-end solution for application connectivity, because it combines the ability to manage how traffic is delivered over an infrastructure you don’t control,</p>



<p>We’re also <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-ibm-is-using-real-user-monitoring-and-dns-to-deliver-premium-global-server-load-balancing-for-business-critical-applications/">proud to offer</a> a new approach to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/global-server-load-balancing">modern GSLB</a> (Global Server Load Balancing). With IBM NS1 Connect technology, we’re placing authoritative DNS in the center of the load balancing equation and providing enterprises with an end-to-end offering that supports a cost-efficient approach for managing and influencing traffic flows.</p>



<p>Organizations are already running DNS and some sort of load balancing solution, but don’t have the full visibility that is needed to make important decisions around their applications and workloads in real time—especially in that last mile of connectivity.</p>



<p>We’re pairing Real User Monitoring (RUM) data with IBM NS1 Connect DNS to provide a more holistic and actionable way to steer traffic that’s never been done before. This uplevels GSLB to be used as a strategic service for connectivity versus a tactical load balancing solution.</p>



<p>To get a better sense of how DNS + RUM work together in our GSLB solution, <a href="https://ibm.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1655189&amp;tp_key=cfa4e8567b">join our webinar</a> on March 5 to see how companies can use this new approach to best inform application and workload connectivity.</p>



 Let’s continue the conversation 



<p>It’s great to be back in Barcelona for Mobile World Congress 2024, and I invite you to join us and learn more about how you can apply AI and intelligent automation to help your organization unlock new revenue, optimize network operations, and achieve application-centric connectivity. We hope you’ll join us at booth #2H20.</p>

<p>With a vast amount of technology training and education available today, it’s difficult to know what deserves your attention and what’s just a marketing ploy. Furthermore, most training and education in technology is only offered through text or video, meaning that the learner doesn’t have an opportunity to apply the theory that they are learning. This naturally reduces the effectiveness of the training. Few programs offer to integrate and weave new training into the pre-existing training that is offered within participating organizations.</p>



<p>If your organization is on the cusp of adopting new technologies, you are likely considering the aspects that go along with such a major investment. One aspect that is often overlooked is the importance of high-quality training. Holistic, comprehensive training includes hands-on, real-world experience that teaches your technical staff how to carry out their full mission.</p>



<p>This approach to training integrates into your onboarding process and allows your new engineers to grow their skillsets and understand the full scope of their responsibilities while growing their own capabilities. Ultimately, this is training that supports the mission of your organization.</p>



<p>The opportunity cost of poor selection in training is too large when you’re adopting new technologies. Training is a necessary part of the due diligence.</p>



<p>Recently, a large multinational electronics company underwent a major transformation, leaving behind technologies and processes from the 1990s to adopt cutting-edge replacements. The company engaged IBM® as their training partner and incorporated training at the leading edge of their extraordinary transformation. They upskilled 3,000 software engineers for DevOps and cloud-native technologies. With a co-created custom curriculum that is designed to supplement their standard DevOps and cloud native offerings to ensure the content aligned with the client’s new technology stack.</p>



<p>As part of this training program, IBM Cloud Native Academy delivered monthly cohorts for technical staff including text, video, and classroom-based learning. In conjunction with hands-on labs that provided real-world experience not found anywhere else. The client completed over 7,000 hands-on labs and logged over 2500 learning hours. With training on the forefront, the company was able to drive forward many new initiatives with great speed and success.</p>



<p>If you are considering options for training to support your organization’s growth, IBM is here to help. Whether you want our full training package, self-paced labs, or customized training, IBM is ready to partner with you in designing the perfect program to fit the needs of your organization.</p>

<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-new-software-developer-kit-sdk-makes-creating-and-customizing-digital-wallets-for-any-application-quick-and-easy/">recently announced</a> the new <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">Indicio Proven mobile SDK</a> which enables any organization to build digital wallet functionality right into their existing applications. This allows any existing mobile application to hold and share verifiable data and identity, which leads to faster, more secure information sharing and a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>Recently I sat down with the developers behind the project, Patrick Kenyon (PK) and Kolby Kunz (KK), to learn more about their thought process and how this new piece of technology was created. You can watch the full interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuXNHa07izw">here.</a></p>
<p>The following are a few excerpts from that conversation that have been edited for comprehension:</p>
<p>TS: Could you please break down just what is an SDK quickly for us?</p>
<p>PK: An SDK stands for software development kit, to be more specific, oftentimes if you have a feature that someone wants to implement in an app, an SDK will just be a library or an aid focused on implementing that specific feature in other applications.</p>
<p>TS: So for the proven mobile SDK it implements features of proven and digital wallet functionality specifically correct?</p>
<p>PK and KK: Yes.</p>
<p>TS: What problem were you given to solve that led to the creation of the SDK?</p>
<p>KK: We had resources that were limited just to react native, and we really wanted to be able to target native applications and go from taking native applications and targeting other Frameworks like react native or flutter that can consume native code and get it all in one place and one solid API that everyone can work with.</p>
<p>PK: The alternative would be to use multiple other libraries across multiple different apps, like if they’re trying to use a different platform. So say they’re developing for Android native and iOS native they’ have to get two separate applications or libraries that don’t exactly always line up and so with ours it does line up across all of the platforms we support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TS: What was your approach and how did you get started&nbsp; with the actual build?</p>
<p>KK: That was a lot, and we sat down for a long time with team leads and had a lot of discussion multiple meetings of what are we going to do, and I think originally we set out and we’re like “hey we’re gonna have to develop this in Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS and we’re going to have to try to make sure that they mirror each other” and we ended up finding a solution where we could develop just in one code base and cross compile to another and that really made it a lot simpler for us to be able to have like a unified API or application interface so that everything was the same whether you are on Android or iOS developing and using this SDK.</p>
<p>TS: Are there any features you’re particularly proud of?&nbsp;</p>
<p>PK: One of the features about the SDK that I’m happy about, that we’ve recently done, is the react native rapper, because we were able to take our SDK and prove that it works in both IOS and Android react native. We were also able to create the API so that the SDK stays the same between Android iOS and react native, and so if you’re building a different application or using a different platform you only have to learn the SDK once and it stays the same. It’s really sweet.</p>
<p>KK: I’m particularly proud of the proofs module, proofs as far as a decentralized identity concept is a very difficult concept to develop for, and there are a lot of pitfalls that can come with it, and I feel like our solution to get there is fairly robust. It’s a little verbose on the end consumption, but it gives the user a lot of power for being able to submit proofs and fulfill proof requests, so I was pretty proud of getting that one through the finish line.</p>

  <p>Like any other service, Microsoft Entra ID is not immune to human errors, accidental deletions, or malicious attacks that could result in the loss of important data. Therefore, it is essential to have a Microsoft Entra ID recovery strategy, especially for the objects that are hard deleted when removed from the service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard deletion means the object is permanently erased and cannot be restored by any means. The good news is that many objects support soft deletion, which means the object is marked as deleted in the service and moved to the recycle bin but not actually removed. The advantage of soft deletion is that the object can be recovered with its original configuration and dependencies, such as membership, assignments, and permissions, within 30 days. Therefore, it’s important to monitor and manage the soft-deleted objects in Microsoft Entra ID and decide whether to restore or permanently delete them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Users, Microsoft 365 Groups, (not security or distribution groups), and application registrations support soft deletion and can be restored using both the Microsoft Entra admin center and Microsoft Graph API. &nbsp; 
 Service principals and administrative units can also be restored from the recycle bin but only via the Microsoft Graph API.  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while synchronized user objects also support soft deletion, they should be backed up and restored at the source (Active Directory). Re-synchronization will automatically trigger the restoration of soft-deleted objects from the recycle bin. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Tracking deletions using Entra ID audit logs &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Every object deletion will trigger an event depending on the deletion type. For example, a soft-deleted user will trigger an event with the activity “Delete user” and a hard deletion will generate a “Hard Delete user” for a group that would be “Delete group” and “Hard Delete group” and so on, as shown in figure one below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra ID audit logs view</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the table below, delete, hard delete, and restore activities are listed for objects that support soft deletion, as they are seen in the audit log.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Deletion Activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard deletion activity &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore activity &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete group &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Group &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete user &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore user  &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard Delete application &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore application &nbsp;</p>




<p>Delete administrative unit &nbsp;</p>


<p>(hard delete not possible) &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore Administrative Unit &nbsp;</p>




<p>Remove service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Hard delete service principal &nbsp;</p>


<p>Restore service principal &nbsp;</p>




<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also be mindful of the following when working with events in the audit log: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Notice minor differences in activity naming, as Kusto Query Language (KQL) is case sensitive. You might have unexpected results when using strict “==” equality operators. &nbsp; 
 For any object type that does not support soft deletion, only "Delete objectType" events will be logged, meaning a hard deletion. For example, Delete conditional access policy. &nbsp; 
 For some object types, there’s an option to perform operations in bulk, providing a .csv file as input. For such bulk operations, there are additional events logged for start and finish, but there are still individual events for every object on the list. For example, (started (bulk) / Bulk restore deleted users - finished (bulk)). &nbsp; 
 When a synchronized object is moved out of sync or deleted in Active Directory, then it will be soft deleted in Microsoft Entra ID with a corresponding event.   &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Examples of queries for monitoring deletions with Microsoft Sentinel &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID works well with Microsoft Sentinel, our cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM), platform that is built on cloud technology and offers extensive threat detection and response features. If you use Microsoft Sentinel or Log Analytics to collect and analyze Microsoft Entra ID logs, here are some KQL query examples that can help you with investigating and alerting object deletion events from Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users that were soft deleted more than 25 days ago, will automatically be hard deleted soon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where OperationName in ("Delete group", "Delete user", "Delete application", "Delete administrative unit",  "Remove service principal")  
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(29d) .. ago(25d))  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 50 objects hard deleted in the past 10 minutes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(10m)  
| where OperationName in ("Hard Delete group", "Hard Delete user", "Hard Delete application", "Hard delete service principal")  
| summarize count()  
| where count_ &gt; 50  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User deletion is followed by hard deletion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let queryfrequency = 1h;  
let queryperiod = 2h;  
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(queryfrequency)  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| project-rename HardDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
| join kind=inner (  
    AuditLogs  
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)  
    | where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
    | extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
    | project-rename SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
) on UserId  
| extend TimeDelta = HardDeletion_TimeGenerated - SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated  
| where  TimeDelta between (time(0s) .. queryperiod)  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queries above are provided as examples, and real detection logic and thresholds will be different for each organization. One approach could be building a Sentinel workbook to visualize data and establish deletion/restoration/hard deletion baselines that will eventually help with the creation of detections. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reviewing deleted objects &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with monitoring, it’s recommended to perform reviews of deleted objects. Reviews can be done regularly or prompted by some of the detection events discussed above. This can be done using the Microsoft Entra admin center, audit log-based queries, or Microsoft Graph API.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra admin center / Azure Portal&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to examine “recycle bins” for deleted users, groups, or applications is by administering Microsoft Entra ID in the Microsoft Entra <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#home">admin center</a> or Azure portal. However, this method has limitations, as the interface varies slightly depending on the object type, and for administrative units and service principals, there is no graphical experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Deleted objects experience for users, groups, and applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs</p>
<p>Audit logs can also be used to generate a soft deleted items report that shows all the deleted objects for the last 30 days, excluding those that have already been restored or hard deleted.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a sample query for User objects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let Users = AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(30d)  
| where Category == "UserManagement";  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Restore user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While audit logs is not a completely reliable method, they might be useful while building workbooks or reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph API</p>
<p>By calling the Microsoft Graph API using PowerShell and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.DirectoryManagement/?view=graph-powershell-beta">Microsoft.Graph module, </a>you can get a list of all the objects currently in the recycle bin. The sample code below will generate a single report for all the object types, and when needed, it can be easily adjusted to perform restores using the Restore-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItem cmdlet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph  
Connect-MgGraph   

$deletedUsers = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsUser  
$deletedServicePrincipals = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsServicePrincipal  
$deletedGroups = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsGroup  
$deletedApplications = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsApplication  
$deletedAUs = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsAdministrativeUnit 

$deletedItems = @()  

$deletedItems += $deletedGroups  
$deletedItems += $deletedApplications  
$deletedItems += $deletedUsers  
$deletedItems += $deletedServicePrincipals  
$deletedItems += $deletedAUs  

if ($deletedItems.Count -eq 0) {  
    Write-Host "No soft deleted objects found." -ForegroundColor Green  
}  
else {  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Users: $($deletedUsers.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Service Principals: $($deletedServicePrincipals.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted M365 Groups: $($deletedGroups.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Applications: $($deletedApplications.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Administrative Units: $($deletedAUs.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  

    $report = foreach ($item in $deletedItems) {  
        $deletedDate = Get-Date($item.DeletedDateTime)  
        $now = Get-Date  
        $hardDeletedInDays = 30 - ($now - $deletedDate).Days  

        [PSCustomObject]@{  
            Id                  = $item.Id  
            UserPrincipalName   = $item.UserPrincipalName  
            DisplayName         = $item.DisplayName  
            Deleted             = $deletedDate  
            HardDeletionIn      = $hardDeletedInDays  
        }  
    }  
    $report | Sort-Object 'Display Name' | Select-Object Id, DisplayName, Deleted, HardDeletionIn | Format-Table   
    $report | Export-Csv -Path "C:\temp\softDeletedObjects.csv" -Encoding UTF8 -NoTypeInformation  
}  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This script will generate a .csv file and provide a summary output:</p>

 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking deletions in Microsoft Entra ID can be useful for several reasons. These include identifying and recovering any objects that were accidentally or maliciously deleted, to monitoring and auditing changes in the directory and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations, and to optimizing license usage by removing any unnecessary or obsolete objects. Make sure to enable monitoring of deletions using queries above as a starting point and perform regular reviews of deleted items to be able to catch any potentially unwanted deletions while objects are still available for restoration.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming society, including the very character of <a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/how-artificial-intelligence-transforming-national-security">national security</a>. Recognizing this, the Department of Defense (DoD) launched the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) in 2019, the predecessor to the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO), to develop AI solutions that build competitive military advantage, conditions for human-centric AI adoption, and the agility of DoD operations. However, the roadblocks to scaling, adopting, and realizing the full potential of AI in the DoD are similar to those in the private sector.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters">IBM survey</a> found that the top barriers preventing successful AI deployment include limited AI skills and expertise, data complexity, and ethical concerns. Further, according to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/responsible-ai-ethics">IBM Institute of Business Value</a>, 79% of executives say AI ethics is important to their enterprise-wide AI approach, yet less than 25% have operationalized common principles of AI ethics. Earning trust in the outputs of AI models is a sociotechnical challenge that requires a sociotechnical solution.</p>



<p>Defense leaders focused on operationalizing the responsible curation of AI must first agree upon a shared vocabulary—a common culture that guides safe, responsible use of AI—before they implement technological solutions and guardrails that mitigate risk. The DoD can lay a sturdy foundation to accomplish this by improving AI literacy and partnering with trusted organizations to develop governance aligned to its strategic goals and values.</p>



 AI literacy is a must-have for security 



<p>It’s important that personnel know how to deploy AI to improve organizational efficiencies. But it’s equally important that they have a deep understanding of the risks and limitations of AI and how to implement the appropriate security measures and ethics guardrails. These are table stakes for the DoD or any government agency.</p>



<p>A tailored AI learning path can help identify gaps and needed training so that personnel get the knowledge they need for their specific roles. Institution-wide AI literacy is essential for all personnel in order for them to quickly assess, describe, and respond to fast-moving, viral and dangerous threats such as disinformation and deepfakes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM applies AI literacy in a customized manner within our organization as defining essential literacy varies depending on a person’s position.</p>



 Supporting strategic goals and aligning with values 



<p>As a leader in trustworthy artificial intelligence, IBM has experience in developing governance frameworks that guide responsible use of AI in alignment with client organizations’ values. IBM also has its own frameworks for use of AI within IBM itself, informing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/ai-ethics#Our+positions">policy positions</a> such as the use of facial recognition technology.</p>



<p>AI tools are now utilized in national security and to help protect against <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-breach">data breaches</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattacks</a>. But AI also supports other strategic goals of the DoD. It can <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/augmented-workforce">augment the workforce</a>, helping to make them more effective, and help them <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/reskilling-your-workforce-in-the-time-of-ai/">reskill</a>. It can help create resilient <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-generative-ai-is-revolutionizing-supply-chain-operations/">supply chains</a> to support soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in roles of warfighting, humanitarian aid, peacekeeping and disaster relief.</p>



<p>The CDAO includes five ethical principles of responsible, equitable, traceable, reliable, and governable as part of its <a href="https://rai.tradewindai.com/background-and-guide">responsible AI toolkit</a>. Based on the US military’s existing ethics framework, these principles are grounded in the military’s values and help uphold its commitment to responsible AI.</p>



<p>There must be a concerted effort to make these principles a reality through consideration of the functional and non-functional requirements in the models and the governance systems around those models. Below, we provide broad recommendations for the operationalization of the CDAO’s ethical principles.</p>



 1. Responsible 



<p>“DoD personnel will exercise appropriate levels of judgment and care, while remaining responsible for the development, deployment, and use of AI capabilities.”</p>



<p>Everyone agrees that AI models should be developed by personnel that are careful and considerate, but how can organizations nurture people to do this work? We recommend:</p>



 
 Fostering an organizational culture that recognizes the sociotechnical nature of AI challenges. This must be communicated from the outset, and there must be a recognition of the practices, skill sets and thoughtfulness that need to be put into models and their management to monitor performance. 



 Detailing ethics practices throughout the AI lifecycle, corresponding to business (or mission) goals, data preparation and modeling, evaluation and deployment.&nbsp; The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/zh/spss-modeler/18.0.0?topic=dm-crisp-help-overview">CRISP-DM</a> model is useful here. IBM’s <a href="https://ibm.github.io/data-science-best-practices/project_team.html">Scaled Data Science Method</a>, an extension of CRISP-DM, offers governance across the AI model lifecycle informed by collaborative input from data scientists, industrial-organizational psychologists, designers, communication specialists and others. The method merges best practices in data science, project management, design frameworks and AI governance. Teams can easily see and understand the requirements at each stage of the lifecycle, including documentation, who they need to talk to or collaborate with, and next steps. 



 Providing interpretable AI model metadata (for example, as <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/aifactsheets">factsheets</a>) specifying accountable persons, performance benchmarks (compared to human), data and methods used, audit records (date and by whom), and audit purpose and results. 
 



<p>Note: These measures of responsibility must be interpretable by AI non-experts (without “mathsplaining”).</p>



 2. Equitable 



<p>“The Department will take deliberate steps to minimize unintended bias in AI capabilities.”</p>



<p>Everyone agrees that use of AI models should be fair and not discriminate, but how does this happen in practice? We recommend:</p>



 
 Establishing a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/why-we-need-diverse-multidisciplinary-coes-for-model-risk/">center of excellence</a> to give diverse, multidisciplinary teams a community for applied training to identify potential disparate impact. 



 Using auditing tools to reflect the bias exhibited in models. If the reflection aligns with the values of the organization, transparency surrounding the chosen data and methods is key. If the reflection does not align with organizational values, then this is a signal that something must change. Discovering and mitigating potential disparate impact caused by bias involves far more than examining the data the model was trained on. Organizations must also examine people and processes involved. For example, have appropriate and inappropriate uses of the model been clearly communicated? 



 Measuring fairness and making equity standards <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/a-framework-to-render-ai-principles-actionable/">actionable</a> by providing functional and non-functional requirements for varying levels of service. 



 Using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/">design thinking</a> frameworks to assess unintended effects of AI models, determine the rights of the end users and operationalize principles. It’s essential that design thinking exercises include people with widely varied lived experiences—<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/why-we-need-diverse-multidisciplinary-coes-for-model-risk/">the more diverse the better</a>. 
 



 3. Traceable 



<p>“The Department’s AI capabilities will be developed and deployed such that relevant personnel possess an appropriate understanding of the technology, development processes, and operational methods applicable to AI capabilities, including with transparent and auditable methodologies, data sources, and design procedure and documentation.”</p>



<p>Operationalize traceability by providing clear guidelines to all personnel using AI:</p>



 
 Always make clear to users when they are interfacing with an AI system. 



 Provide content grounding for AI models. Empower domain experts to curate and maintain trusted sources of data used to train models. Model output is based on the data it was trained on. 
 



<p>IBM and its partners can provide AI solutions with comprehensive, auditable content grounding imperative to high-risk use cases.</p>



 
 Capture <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/aifactsheets">key metadata</a> to render AI models transparent and keep track of model inventory. Make sure that this metadata is interpretable and that the right information is exposed to the appropriate personnel. Data interpretation takes practice and is an interdisciplinary effort. At IBM, our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/basics/data">Design for AI</a> group aims to educate employees on the critical role of data in AI (among other fundamentals) and donates frameworks to the open-source community. 



 Make this metadata easily findable by people (ultimately at the source of output). 



 Include human-in-the-loop as AI should augment and assist humans. This allows humans to provide feedback as AI systems operate. 



 Create processes and frameworks to assess disparate impact and safety risks well before the model is deployed or procured. Designate accountable people to mitigate these risks. 
 



 4. Reliable 



<p>“The Department’s AI capabilities will have explicit, well-defined uses, and the safety, security, and effectiveness of such capabilities will be subject to testing and assurance within those defined uses across their entire life cycles.”</p>



<p>Organizations must document well-defined use cases and then test for compliance. Operationalizing and scaling this process requires strong cultural alignment so practitioners adhere to the highest standards even without constant direct oversight. Best practices include:</p>



 
 Establishing communities that constantly reaffirm why fair, reliable outputs are essential. Many practitioners earnestly believe that simply by having the best intentions, there can be no disparate impact. This is misguided. Applied training by highly engaged community leaders who make people feel heard and included is critical. 



 Building reliability testing rationales around the guidelines and standards for data used in model training. The best way to make this real is to offer examples of what can happen when this scrutiny is lacking. 



 Limit user access to model development, but gather diverse perspectives at the onset of a project to mitigate introducing bias. 



 Perform privacy and security checks along the entire AI lifecycle. 



 Include measures of accuracy in regularly scheduled audits. Be unequivocally forthright about how model performance compares to a human being. If the model fails to provide an accurate result, detail who is accountable for that model and what recourse users have. (This should all be baked into the interpretable, findable metadata). 
 



 5. Governable 



<p>“The Department will design and engineer AI capabilities to fulfill their intended functions while possessing the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences, and the ability to disengage or deactivate deployed systems that demonstrate unintended behavior.”</p>



<p>Operationalization of this principle requires:</p>



 
 AI model investment does not stop at deployment. Dedicate resources to ensure models continue to behave as desired and expected. Assess and mitigate risk throughout the AI lifecycle, not just after deployment. 



 Designating an accountable party who has a funded mandate to do the work of governance. They must have power. 



 Invest in communication, community-building and education. Leverage tools such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">watsonx.governance</a> to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/protect-against-model-drift-and-bias-to-ensure-your-ai-is-accurate-explainable-and-governed-on-any-cloud/">monitor AI systems</a>. 



 Capture and manage AI model inventory as described above. 



 Deploy cybersecurity measures across all models. 
 



 IBM is at the forefront of advancing trustworthy AI 



<p>IBM has been at the forefront of advancing trustworthy AI principles and a thought leader in the governance of AI systems since their nascence. We follow long-held principles of trust and transparency that make clear the role of AI is to augment, not replace, human expertise and judgment.</p>



<p>In 2013, IBM embarked on the journey of explainability and transparency in AI and machine learning. IBM is a leader in AI ethics, appointing an AI ethics global leader in 2015 and creating an AI ethics board in 2018. These experts work to help ensure our principles and commitments are upheld in our global business engagements. In 2020, IBM donated its Responsible AI toolkits to the Linux Foundation to help build the future of fair, secure, and trustworthy AI.</p>



<p>IBM leads global efforts to shape the future of responsible AI and ethical AI metrics, standards, and best practices:</p>



 
 Engaged with President Biden’s administration on the development of its AI Executive Order 



 Disclosed/filed 70+ patents for responsible AI 



 IBM’s CEO Arvind Krishna co-chairs the Global AI Action Alliance steering committee launched by the World Economic Forum (WEF), 



 Alliance is focused on accelerating the adoption of inclusive,&nbsp;transparent and trusted artificial intelligence globally 



 Co-authored two papers published by the WEF on Generative AI on unlocking value and developing safe systems and technologies. 



 Co-chair Trusted AI committee Linux Foundation AI 



 Contributed to the NIST AI Risk Management Framework; engage with NIST in the area of AI metrics, standards, and testing 
 



<p>Curating responsible AI is a multifaceted challenge because it demands that human values be reliably and consistently reflected in our technology. But it is well worth the effort. We believe the guidelines above can help the DoD operationalize trusted AI and help it fulfill its mission.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF77 rewards. DF78 runs Feb 22 — Feb 29,&nbsp;2024.  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 77 (DF77) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards.

You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF78 is live today, Feb 22. It concludes on Feb 29. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF78   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF78 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Your data, such as your posts, likes, and follows, needs to be stored somewhere. With traditional social media, your data is stored by the social media company whose services you've signed up for. If you ever want to stop using that company's services, you can do that—but you would have to leave that social network and lose your existing connections.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way! An alternative model is how the internet itself works. Anyone can put up a website on the internet. You can choose from one of many companies to host your site (or even host it yourself), and you can always change your mind about this later. If you move to another hosting provider, your visitors won't even notice. No matter where your site's data is managed and stored, your visitors can find your site simply by typing the name of the website or by clicking a link.</p>
<p>We think social media should work the same way. When you register on Bluesky, by default we'll suggest that Bluesky will store your data. But if you'd like to let another company store it, or even store it yourself, you can do that. You'll also be able to change your mind at any point, moving your data to another provider without losing any of your existing posts, likes, or follows. From your followers' perspective, your profile is always available at your handle—no matter where your information is actually stored, or how many times it has been moved.</p>
<p>Federation lets services be interconnected, so there are a variety of apps and experiences that users can move between as fluidly as they do on the open web. The version of federation that we’re releasing today is intended for self-hosters. There are some guardrails in place to ensure we can keep the network running smoothly for everyone in the ecosystem. After this initial phase, we’ll open up federation to people looking to run larger servers with many users. For a more technical overview of what we’re releasing today and how to participate, check out the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some of our existing features already follow the federated philosophy, including <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">usernames</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">feeds</a>. Today, we’re opening up federation for data hosting. Below, we wanted to answer some common questions about what federated hosting is, what it means for your experience using Bluesky, and why we’re so excited about it.</p>
 How does this affect my experience on Bluesky? 
<p>The short answer is: it doesn’t! If you don’t run your own server, Bluesky will stay the same. Even if you do run your own server, you may be surprised by how little things change. In fact, it should feel so similar that you might have to double check that you’ve logged into the right server.</p>
<p>This is all intentional: we've made self-hosting your own data both easy and affordable, so when you do so, you should be able to get just as good (or better) of an experience than letting Bluesky host your data.</p>
 If my experience doesn’t change, why federate? 
<p>We set out to build a protocol for the future of social media that returns control to users. From the apps you use, the feeds you browse, or the moderation preferences you prefer, your experience on Bluesky is yours to customize. But the abundance of choice and innovation here will be short-lived if it’s dependent on one company. We think that the future of social media needs to be a public good, mutually owned by the people and companies that participate in it. Social media should be as open and reliable as the internet itself.</p>
<p>The ability to host your own data, just as you might run your own website, provides the fundamental guarantee that social media will never again be controlled by only one company. Even if Bluesky were to disappear, if the data is hosted across different sites, the network can be rebuilt. The fact that it requires no permission to set up a new website is what has made the open web such a dynamic and creative force. Larger services, like search engines, have come and gone (anyone remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a>?). But the underlying foundation of independently hosted sites continues to let the web evolve. Making social open in the same way will create a foundation for better public conversations.</p>
<p>Today, we’re taking another step towards the vision of a self-sustaining social web — social media that isn’t controlled by any single company and is free to evolve on its own terms.</p>
 Does this mean Bluesky is going to be like Mastodon? 
<p>Mastodon is another federated social network built on a protocol called ActivityPub. While Bluesky — built on a protocol called the AT Protocol (atproto) — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.</p>
<p>On Bluesky, server choice doesn’t affect what content you see. Servers are only one piece of the protocol — when you browse Bluesky, you see posts that are pulled together from many different servers. This is why you can change your server after signing up without losing your username, friends, or posts.</p>
<p>A summary of some ways Bluesky differs from Mastodon:</p>
 
 A focus on the global conversation: On Mastodon, your “instance”, or server, determines your community, so your experience depends on which server you join. An instance can send and receive posts from other instances, but it doesn’t try to offer a global view of the network. Your Mastodon server is part of your username, and becomes part of your identity. On Bluesky, your experience is based on what feeds and accounts you follow, and you can always participate in the global conversation (e.g. breaking news, viral posts, and algorithmic feeds). You can use your own domain name as your username, and continue participating from anywhere your account is hosted. 
 Composable moderation: Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. We’ve already integrated block and mute lists, and the tooling for independent moderation services is coming soon. 
 Composable feeds: We designed your timeline on Bluesky so that it’s not tied to your server. Anyone can build a feed, and there are currently over 40,000 algorithmic feeds to choose from. Your Mastodon timeline is only made up of posts from accounts you follow, and does not pull together posts from the whole network like Bluesky’s custom feeds. 
 Account portability: We designed federated hosting on Bluesky so that you can move servers easily. Moving hosting services should be like changing your cell phone provider —&nbsp;you should be able to keep your identity and data. Changing servers on Bluesky doesn’t disrupt your username, friends, or posts. 
 
 So how can I self-host and join the network? 
<p>It will become easier to host your own server over time, but at the moment you’ll need a bit of technical know-how to get up and running.

<p>As we see enterprises increasingly face geographic requirements around sovereignty, IBM Cloud® is committed to helping clients navigate beyond the complexity so they can drive true transformation with innovative hybrid cloud technologies. We believe this is particularly important with the rise of generative AI. While AI can undoubtedly offer a competitive edge to organizations that effectively leverage its capabilities, we have seen unique concerns from industry to industry and region to region that must be considered—particularly around data. We strongly believe the influx of data associated with AI will fuel tremendous business innovations, but requires strategic considerations, including around where data resides, data privacy, resilience, operational controls, regulatory requirements and compliance, and certifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With our long history of working with clients across the globe—and especially in highly regulated industries—we understand the unique requirements enterprises are facing and are prepared to help them address their emerging regulatory demands. Whether a client in Europe is considering how they will be able to meet the proposed European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (EUCS) or a client in India needs to keep data in-country, we continue to follow the latest updates from regulatory bodies and monitor draft legislation to support our clients as they make informed decisions based on specific use cases, risk appetite, data type, threat landscape, business drivers, security needs and more.</p>



 IBM’s Enterprise Cloud for Regulated Industries 



<p>Building on our expertise working with enterprise clients in industries such as financial services, government, healthcare and telco, we saw the need for a cloud platform designed with the unique needs of these heavily regulated industries in mind. We introduced <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-07-22-IBM-and-Bank-of-America-Advance-IBM-Cloud-for-Financial-Services-BNP-Paribas-Joins-as-Anchor-Client-in-Europe">IBM Cloud for Financial Services</a>, which includes an ecosystem of partner banks including BNP Paribas and CaixaBank, to help clients as they work to mitigate risk, address regulations, navigate their compliance and accelerate cloud adoption. In just a few years, we have helped some of the world’s leading banks transform. And our work doesn’t stop there. As clients continue to face industry-specific challenges, IBM Cloud is continuously innovating to help them thrive in areas related to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-connected-trade-platform-helps-power-the-digitization-of-trade-and-supply-chain-financing/">trade finance</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/the-next-wave-of-payments-modernization-minimizing-complexity-to-elevate-customer-experience/">payments</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/high-performance-computing?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700074687270184&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAtaOtBhCwARIsAN_x-3LnpqhUhcgG4N36xAQNLCVZ5tQ7fVFlfb7lnRV2958oPbeT-B_F1ngaAvtEEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">high performance computing</a> and more.</p>



<p>At the heart of our enterprise cloud for regulated industries is the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services®, which was created as a common set of preconfigured automated controls in collaboration with financial institutions to help clients as they adapt to emerging industry requirements and compliance obligations and mitigate the cost and complexity in an evolving regulatory landscape. The Framework is informed by the IBM Financial Services Cloud Council—a network of more than 160 CIOs, CTOs, CISOs and Risk and Compliance officers from over 90 financial institutions including CaixaBank, Virgin Money, Westpac and BNP Paribas—and continuously evolved upon to help address emerging risks and opportunities around resiliency, third-and-fourth party risk management, multicloud governance and data sovereignty.</p>



<p>As we help clients in highly regulated industries transform with resiliency, performance, security and compliance at the forefront, we have demonstrated a commitment to strong alignment with key industry standards including our alignment with the <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-12-15-IBM-Helps-Financial-Services-Industry-Manage-Risk-and-Regulations-with-CSA">Cloud Security Alliance’s Cloud Controls Matrix</a>, a cybersecurity control framework for cloud computing.</p>

<p>Building on our longtime work with clients in regulated industries and the continued growth of our enterprise cloud for highly regulated industries, we recognize the growing needs around sovereign cloud—and have been working with partners and clients to support requirements in regions such as the EU, <a href="https://mea.newsroom.ibm.com/2021-09-01-Edarat-Group-Adopts-IBM-Cloud-Satellite-to-Accelerate-Digital-Transformation-for-its-Enterprise-Customers-in-Saudi-Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-09-14-Airtel-and-IBM-to-Work-Together-to-Bring-Secured-Edge-Cloud-Services-to-Indian-Enterprises">India</a>, <a href="https://www.zawya.com/en/press-release/g42-cloud-and-ibm-to-join-forces-to-accelerate-digital-transformation-for-clients-xs3230cs">Abu Dhabi</a> and Africa for years. For example, we are working with <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-09-14-Airtel-and-IBM-to-Work-Together-to-Bring-Secured-Edge-Cloud-Services-to-Indian-Enterprises">Bharti Airtel</a>, a major telecom provider, to offer edge cloud services to organizations in India, helping companies looking to leverage edge services and keep their data in-country by meeting the Ministry of Electronics and IT <a href="https://in.newsroom.ibm.com/IBM_strengthens_Hybrid_Cloud_footprint_in_India">empanelment requirements.</a></p>



<p>As regulations evolve, we are committed to helping enterprise clients navigate their unique country requirements.</p>



 1. Data sovereignty: The importance of privacy and residency 



<p>As clients address data residency requirements, we are helping them as they manage customer data in region and specific geographies, and in the location of their choice. We provide clients with the flexibility of choosing the country or regions where they want to build and host their workloads and continue to expand our global data center footprint with new locations, for example, our new <a href="https://es.newsroom.ibm.com/announcements?item=122781">Multizone Region (MZR)</a> in Madrid, Spain.</p>



<p>We are also committed to helping clients meet their data privacy requirements and offer innovative confidential computing, encryption capabilities and key management controls. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/hyper-protect-crypto">IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services</a> offers “Keep Your Own Key” encryption capabilities, designed to allow clients to have exclusive key control and helping them to address their privacy needs, including meeting their requirements such as GDPR in the EU. Additionally, IBM Cloud clients can utilize the advanced confidential computing data security capabilities to protect data even while in use—leveraging virtual servers built on&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/5-Things-to-Know-How-IBM-Cloud-is-Helping-Drive-Innovation-in-Highly-Regulated-Industries-with-Security-at-the-Forefront">Intel SGX</a>, as well as confidential computing environments provided by IBM Hyper Protect Virtual Servers built on IBM LinuxONE. This allows them to protect what matters most and to host workloads in a secure environment.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/data-security-broker">IBM Cloud Data Security Broker</a> solution is data privacy focused and has field level encryption, tokenization and anonymization at a granular level such as PII data in databases to help shield sensitive data from cloud administration and is designed to help clients with their data privacy needs. With these capabilities, we aim to enable clients to control who has access to their data while still leveraging the benefits of the cloud. IBM Cloud’s enhanced data protection capabilities aim to help strengthen clients’ sovereign posture in the public cloud.</p>



 2. Operational sovereignty: A focus on resilience and operational controls 



<p>At IBM, operational sovereignty is critical to everything we do and we believe it is key to allow clients to have resilience and transparency at all times. For example, the Madrid MZR is designed to deliver European and region resiliency between our Frankfurt MZR and Madrid MZR, and vice versa. For clients using IBM Cloud, any client data provided is stored and processed locally in the selected region—such as our EU-based MZRs in Frankfurt and in Madrid. With the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center, clients can gain operational insights about their security and compliance posture. This includes monitoring of how the deployed workloads and data configurations meet their enterprise security policies, detect any drifts in this configuration posture, as well as workload protection and detection of their deployments—available across cloud native workloads, VMs, containers and cloud services. This includes the recently introduced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/5-things-to-know-driving-innovation-with-ai-and-hybrid-cloud-in-the-year-ahead/">IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Workload Protection</a> capabilities to help clients protect workloads and assess vulnerabilities via quick identification and remediation. We also offer an EU support model that is designed to provide an extra layer of protection for our clients deploying their workloads in Europe.</p>



<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/satellite?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700056326614888&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAmNeqBhD4ARIsADsYfTdHeplnfH3jvUu9hYBN8qErIym32EfjyYTupQzBvxyjCuvKyrhOxdAaAg7IEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">our distributed cloud capabilities</a> are designed to focus on running cloud services and applications where data resides—whether it is an on-premise data center or edge location so that not only data, but also compute can be in customer-controlled locations.</p>



 3. Digital sovereignty: Addressing regulatory requirements and certifications 



<p>We are also working to help clients meet their geographical specific compliance as sovereignty requirements evolve. For example, last year our cloud services in both our MZRs in Frankfurt and Madrid received <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/compliance/ens-spain">Spain’s National Security Framework (ENS) High certification</a>. Similarly, in Germany, our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/announcement/ibm-cloud-expands-c5-compliance/">C5</a> attestation can be used by clients and their compliance advisors to help them understand security controls implemented by IBM Cloud, designed to help them meet their C5 requirements as they move their workloads to the cloud. In Australia, we have completed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-strengthens-compliance-posture-in-australia-expanding-irap-protected-cloud-services">IRAP</a>&nbsp;assessment across a number of key services, as well as being&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-cloud-achieves-ismap-compliance">ISMAP</a> Certified in Japan.</p>



<p>Additionally, the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance center includes <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-predefined-profiles">pre-defined geospecific profiles</a> of controls, based on industry standards, providing clients with the capability for automated monitoring of compliance and security to help them get a unified view of their posture related to different domains of sovereignty such as data privacy, data residency and resiliency. Late last year, we released multiple profiles supporting regional standards, such as ENS High (Spain), BSI C5 (Germany), ISMAP (Japan), industry specific profile like PCI DSS v4 and <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-ai-ict-change-log">AI Infrastructure Guardrails</a>.</p>



 Looking ahead 



<p>Our progress so far and commitment to future-focused initiatives underscore our expertise in building and delivering the most robust and resilient enterprise grade cloud, helping to address the evolving demands of enterprise and government sectors. By implementing these measures, we aim to inject a higher level of transparency into the adoption of cloud services and not only help clients align with, but also exceed the standards set by increasingly stringent regulatory compliance developments.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce this partnership between Holochain and <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>. While we have been interwoven efforts for some time, making it official before heading to <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a> feels like an important step forwards in our collaboration.</p><p>What is Rainlang? Rainlang is a framework that aims to simplify smart contracts and make them more accessible to a wider audience. The aim of making smart contracts accessible to everyone comes from the belief that accessibility is the difference between theoretical and practical decentralization.</p><p>By combining Holochain’s framework for building peer-to-peer apps with Rainlang’s easy to use smart contracts, new groundbreaking solutions in the Web3 space are possible, unleashing opportunities and possibilities for developers, enterprises, and users alike.</p> Fullstack DeFi <p>DeFi has exploded in recent years, but it is still a challenging space, accessible to the few, not the many. Rainlang’s work to make smart contracts more legible is an important step to democratizing this space. But there are still hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p>When we interact with smart contracts, we usually do so through a website. This is a point of centralization that introduces several risks, from phishing to DNS hacks. Plus, nothing stops a website from being taken down, either by the company running it or by a government, DDOS attack, or otherwise. The solution? Truly distributed applications, running on your device, interacting as a network of peers. This is what Holochain provides to DeFi, the opportunity for the infrastructure supporting the EVM to also be decentralized, secure, and verifiable.&nbsp;</p> Orderbook <p><a href="https://docs.rainlang.xyz/orderbook/introduction/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Rain Orderbook</a> is an on-chain orderbook contract that enables users to deploy complex strategies for managing token trades. Using Holochain, the Rainlang team is building a decentralized platform where Orderbook users can share draft trading strategies, simulations, tests of strategies, and even raw financial data. This will make the trading tools of Orderbook more accessible as a community grows around them.&nbsp;</p><p>Building this platform on Holochain enables a collaborative platform that runs directly on user’s devices without data sitting on a third party server. This is a truly decentralized stack that maintains options for privacy where trading groups can make private spaces to share their trading strategies etc. With this user centric design that provides security from many common hacks in the crypto space, we can start to see new potential for Web3.</p> Holochain Apps Using Rainlang <p>For the last several months we have been experimenting with integrating Rainlang contracts into the stack of Holochain applications. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a> demonstrated a Rainlang contract on the Polygon EVM, connected to a Holochain application where users played a collaborative art game. Holo was used to provide read-only access to the game, both for <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fractal-tribute-nov-2?ref=blog.holochain.org">OpenSea</a> to access the art and for a website that allowed for public viewership of the game. </p><p>This is just one demonstration of how Rainlang can be used to connect Holochain apps to the blockchain. We are excited to see what others develop — pairing the financial markets and global consensus of EVMs with the agent-centric networks of Holochain. </p><p>We have more in the works. In the meantime, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">read about more of the solutions we envision</a>, and maybe we’ll see you at <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a>?</p>

<p>In our digital era, presentation, and injection biometric attacks pose an unprecedented threat to the sanctity of identity verification. As we navigate a landscape increasingly dependent on digital transactions, the looming menace of AI-generated deepfakes demands innovative strategies to combat identity fraud. Gartner Analysts Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja affirm this urgency, stating, “Identity verification leaders must understand this emerging threat and take a proactive approach to secure their solutions*.”</p>
<p>*Emerging Tech: The Impact of AI and Deepfakes on Identity Verification – Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja</p>
<p>Presentation attacks, also known as spoofing or imitation attacks, involve attempts to deceive biometric authentication systems using fake biometric samples, such as photos, videos, or other replicas of the genuine user. With the advent of deepfakes, the methods used to detect presentation attacks have become outdated as many deepfake videos are very well created to be presented as a live video, with great rendering of an attacker superimposing their image on a live video.</p>
<p>One way to identify genuine users and prevent presentation attacks, like deepfakes, is through “liveness detection.” Liveness detection helps distinguish between genuine, live individuals and manipulated synthetic representations. Here’s how liveness detection helps identify users:</p>
 
 Dynamic Movement Recognition: Liveness detection systems analyze the dynamic aspects of facial expressions, eye movements, and other micro-expressions that occur naturally in live subjects. 
 Response to Stimuli: Liveness detection may involve prompting the user to perform specific actions or respond to stimuli during verification. 
 3D Depth Analysis: Liveness detection often utilizes advanced techniques like 3D depth analysis. By assessing the three-dimensional aspects of facial features, the system can verify the spatial relationships between different facial elements, making it harder for static images or videos to pass as authentic. 
 Texture and Reflection Analysis: Liveness detection examines surface characteristics such as texture and reflections on the face. Natural skin has unique textures and reflects light in specific ways that may be hard to emulate. 
 
<p>All these technology components have been embedded across various liveness detection engines and have effectively prevented a “Presentation Attack” often used to game the system. Most deepfake attacks happen when an attacker injects a fraudulent video to game the liveness detection engine. There are usually three types of injection attacks that occur:</p>
 
 Virtual H/W Camera Injections: Utilizing a virtual camera instead of a real camera to submit a photo or video. Software like Manycams is used to do this. 
 JavaScript Injections: Utilizing browser console to inject spooﬁng JavaScript code to be run instead of existing one on the webpage 
 Client Server Protocol Injections: A fraudster breaks the data channel between the browser and server or Classic IT infrastructure “Man in the Middle” type of attack. 
 
 Defeating Presentation Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>1Kosmos responds to this challenge with LiveID and LiveID+. LiveID leverages the front-facing camera on the mobile device (selfie camera) and records a video of the user. Once LiveID has determined the user is genuine, through a liveness check, LiveID will capture a “selfie” of the user and use it as a biometric reference for authentication. LiveID+ is an advanced SDK client-side solution. By actively identifying and thwarting injection attacks in real time, LiveID+ sets a new standard for security, offering robust protection against the deceptive tactics of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Adding additional capabilities to LiveID with LiveID+ allows organizations to prevent this growing attack vector. The new client-side SDK will catch injection attacks and not permit any identity proofing or authentication attempt if an injection attack is detected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The advent of deepfake technology poses a formidable challenge to identity verification processes. As our digital transactions surge and passwordless biometrics become mainstream, the threat from AI-generated deepfakes will become more pronounced. Liveness detection is a good way of combating presentation attacks. However, the evolution of more sophisticated injection attacks, especially those utilizing injection techniques, necessitates innovative security measures like LiveID and LiveID+.</p>

<p>In this episode we talk with Phil Windley, Sr. Software Development Manager at AWS, Cofounder of IIW, former Chair of Sovrin Foundation. We talked about his experience building and leading the Sovrin Foundation, which at one point was almost synonymous with the term self-sovereign identity. It was set up to be an identity metasystem that would reinvent how identity was done online… and we talk about why it didn’t end up becoming that.</p><p>Phil shares lessons from identity systems that got adopted, like the social login metasystem, as well as from things that didn’t get a lot of adoption, like certain identity blockchains and information cards a decade prior. We hope this an interesting episode. We’re glad we got to tell a small part of the Sovrin story as we think a lot of today’s reusable ID projects have their roots in the movement Sovrin started—including Trinsic.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about Phil you can visit his personal website <a href="https://windley.com/">https://windley.com/</a> where you'll find ways to contact him, and buy his new book.</p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

 An Anatomy of&nbsp;Hype Image generated by&nbsp;Dell-E-2<p>Writing 310 years ago, the essayist Jonathan Swift had this to say on the art of political lying.</p><blockquote>“It often happens, that if a lie be believed only for an hour, it hath done its work, and there is no further occasion for it. Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it, so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too&nbsp;late.”</blockquote><p>Swift’s essay was about how clever, devious people use political lies to get their way, leaving a trail of damage behind&nbsp;them.</p><p>Enter a new political lie about artificial intelligence and NHS&nbsp;data.</p><p>It’s the usual breathless stuff. “The world is undergoing the fastest technological and scientific revolution in the whole history of human civilisation, with profound implications for the United Kingdom,” gush former prime minister Tony Blair and former leader of the Conservative Party William Hague in <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/75ila1cntaeh/3pN0p29FVT0XV1FV9Up4MV/d2eaa86f106369827c3eed1b113c92ff/Tony_Blair_Institute_A_New_National_Purpose_-_Leading_the_Biotech_Revolution_January_2024.pdf">a new report</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>“The challenge of responding to that revolution is so urgent, the danger of falling behind so great and the opportunities so exciting that we urged all political parties to make their response to it nothing short of creating a new national purpose. We set out how the UK could harness the power of technology and reimagine the state and public services by restructuring Whitehall, making better use of&nbsp;data”.</p><p>If ‘weapons of mass destruction’ was the political lie that achieved the objective of regime change (the overthrow of Saddam Hussein), here we have a new type of regime change in sight: deposing health data as a public and personal asset and its mass transfer to the control and benefit of Big&nbsp;Tech.</p> The hype&nbsp;machine <p>Hype is the main tool of the political lie. The trick with hype is to set an agenda by mesmerising people with AMAZING Opportunities!!! while deflecting their attention from on-the-ground realities until they can’t be avoided any&nbsp;more.</p><p>Here are some of the detailed tricks of skilful political lier.</p>  Present one small part — the part you are trying to promote — as if it is the whole picture, ignoring everything that doesn’t fit into your carefully crafted&nbsp;agenda.  Exaggerate the benefits of what you are proposing to the nth&nbsp;degree.  Skim over all its flaws, inconsistencies, risks and loopholes. (Make sure you mention them briefly to give the appearance that you have thought about them, but only to brush them aside as minor, technical details to be sorted out&nbsp;later.)  Use small elements of truth to tell the big&nbsp;lie.  Craft the way you present your arguments so that the conclusions you arrive at are inevitable, given the assumptions you’ve smuggled in along the&nbsp;way.  <p>Tony Blair’s agenda for an NHS data landgrab is a good case study of hype in the service of a political lie.</p> Present a part as the&nbsp;whole <p>If you believe Tony Blair, the future of the NHS — indeed the competitiveness of the country as a whole (!) — depends on the UK taking a lead in AI (see ‘exaggeration’ below). Taking the lead in AI depends on amassing huge amounts of data to train this AI&nbsp;… which means that we simply have to hand over the nation’s health data to the Big Data experts — the Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>Tony Blair writes as if the insights generated by such AI will transform the provision of health and care services. This is nonsense.</p><p>Setting AI to work on big data sets does nothing to change those areas where treatments are already well developed and understood. It does nothing to improve the operational delivery of these treatments. In other words, it will not and cannot touch most of what the NHS actually does, day-to-day. Neverthless, it is being presented as if it is the answer to everything.</p><p>In reality, what the NHS needs to transform itself — to cut costs while improving quality — lies at the opposite end of the data spectrum. It lies in new data logistics capabilities: the ability to get exactly the right personal data to and from the right people at the right times, safely and efficiently, in a privacy protecting way.</p><p>Better data logistics enables better physical logistics — improving the ways in which work is organised; finding ways to reduce time and effort spent while improving outcomes. It’s about the practical, detailed work that takes place on the front line. Nothing to do with the statistical analysis of big sets of&nbsp;data.</p><p>But nowhere in his 72 page report does Mr Blair give this very real opportunity a single mention (or, for that matter, in any of his previous reports). After all, the whole point of the magician with his conjuring trick is to focus peoples’ attention on your trickery; to deflect their attention from what’s really going on behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p> Exaggerate the&nbsp;benefits <p>According to Tony Blair, Artificial Intelligence is “so urgent and important that how we respond is more likely than anything else to determine Britain’s future.” Wow! We had better drop everything else then! Focus everything we’ve got on&nbsp;it!</p><p>But this too is nonsense. AI will never water the Sahara, achieve world peace, feed the hungry or solve the challenge of Climate&nbsp;Change.</p><p>AI currently takes two main forms: machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms and Large Language Processing models like&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>The machine learning form of AI is very good at identifying patterns and correlations in huge amounts of data. That’s great. It can be a useful tool within a well managed research&nbsp;process.</p><p>But&nbsp;… er&nbsp;… that’s about&nbsp;it.</p><p>One drawback of this form of AI is that while it is very good at spotting correlations, a high proportion of them are meaningless false positives. To make things worse, spotting correlations has got nothing to do with understanding causation. Confusing correlation with causation can — and has already — set many damaging hares&nbsp;running.</p><p>Also, this form of AI is bound by the ancient ‘GIGO’ law of computing: Garbage In, Garbage Out. Machine learning outputs are only as good as the data they’ve been trained with (by humans), and very often this data is not very good. In fact, for almost every issue that a machine learning AI is set to work on, there is far more information out there in the world that is not contained in its training sets. This means the ‘insights’ it generates are always partial and contingent.</p><p>In addition, because of the way it works, there is no audit trail as to how it arrives at its conclusions (and it may arrive at different conclusions if it crunches the same set of data a second time). On top of this, no matter how good the analytics might be, what happens in the real world depends entirely on how any resulting actions are implemented. Which has got nothing to do with&nbsp;AI.</p><p>So machine learning isn’t half as transformational as people like Blair are making it out to be. Not by a very long&nbsp;shot.</p><p>The other Large Language Processing sort of AI (the one that drives ChatGPT and its rivals) works by brute number crunching. It analyses previous bits of text (that it has been fed with by humans) to calculate the most probable next letter in a word and the most probable next word in a sentence. It doesn’t understand the meaning of anything it spews&nbsp;out.</p><p>This sort of AI is quite good at providing summaries of conventional wisdoms (e.g. the words used in texts that have already been generated by&nbsp;humans).</p><p>But&nbsp;… er&nbsp;… that’s about&nbsp;it.</p><p>It has no awareness of ideas or information that are not in the data sets it has been trained with. It cannot use its (non-existent) understanding of content to produce any new ideas. Meanwhile, because it works only by brute number crunching without any idea of meaning, it can and does invent ‘facts’ and ‘statements’ that are simply untrue — what AI practitioners call ‘hallucinations’. So, yes, it can be useful for students wanting to cheat with essays or consultants wanting to streamline their report-writing. But change how the real world actually works? Not&nbsp;really!</p><p>AI is just another of a long line of tech bubbles. They all have a common pattern. The promoter’s trick is to dazzle people with promises of wondrous change tomorrow&nbsp;… to undertake a landgrab of today’s available resources. It’s worked many times before, and it’s being tried again&nbsp;here.</p> Skim over the flaws and&nbsp;risks <p>The trick here is to present something that is extremely difficult and fraught with risk as if it were safe and easy. This way, people aren’t put off by a realistic assessment of what’s really involved in making it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Tony Blair’s papers are a masterpiece of such skating on thin ice. He tells us that we don’t have to worry about privacy because all the data will be anonymised. But he doesn’t provide any chapter or verse as to how this will actually work, or if (for example) this data could be de-anonymised as quickly and easily as it was anonymised.</p><p>Meanwhile, many of the promises he makes are based not on the use of anonymised data for statistical analysis but on extreme personalisation. “Over the coming decades,” he says, “AI systems will be created that can understand each individual’s composition and lifestyle, and harness that information to provide highly personalised lifestyle and treatment suggestions on demand, with little marginal cost for each additional patient.” How is that going to work if the data is anonymised?</p><p>Most of his proposals are aimed at giving ‘researchers’ access to data about people. But he never defines what a bona fide researcher is. Cambridge Analytica could have passed themselves off as ‘researchers’.</p><p>Research, he tells us, “serves a dual purpose; it is both a public service enabling technological advances and a commercial opportunity.” He makes a big fuss about the NHS being able to ‘sell’ our data to the private sector, thereby helping to fund the NHS. Really? What proportion of the NHS budget would it cover? And how exactly will this commercial opportunity be realised? By Big Tech companies using NHS data to generate new treatments, and then draining the NHS of cash in charges for access to these treatments?</p><p>Nowhere are such questions worked through. All skimming. All about making it sound both wonderful and easy. All skating on very thin ice&nbsp;indeed.</p> Use a small element of truth to tell a big&nbsp;like <p>For hype to be credible it has to contain an element of truth. People have to be able to recognise what it says and say to themselves “Yes! That makes sense!” As soon as you get their heads nodding you can use their agreement to lure them into the much bigger lie that lies behind your truth-hook.</p><p>Tony Blair’s reports use this trick often. For example, he writes that today’s fragmented system of data collection prevents researchers from “understanding how different features of a patient — their lifestyle, genetics, personality and physiology — relate to one another”. Absolutely spot on. According to the World Health Organisation, 60% of related factors to individual health and quality of life are correlated to lifestyle. And he’s right. Today’s fragmented approach to data collection and use makes it impossible to join the necessary data&nbsp;dots.</p><p>This is why individuals need personal data stores, so that they can collect all this data safely. So it can be used under their control, for their&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>But that, of course, is not what he suggests. The undeniable truth of data fragmentation is just a useful hook to sell his bigger lie. Fragmentation, he continues, “is limiting efforts to generalise beyond the subjects studied and holding back the transformative potential of AI.” (Back to presenting a small part of the picture as if it were the whole). Therefore, rather than addressing this fragmentation by empowering individuals with their own data, we should build a massive new centralised database&nbsp;… and hand it over to Big&nbsp;Tech.</p> Assumption smuggling <p>This entire campaign is based on a particular set of assumptions. A paradigm. This paradigm tells us that wealth can only be created by private companies making products which they sell in markets using money&nbsp;prices.</p><p>But the NHS is living proof that the ‘firms-products-prices-markets-profits’ paradigm is not the only way to create wealth and deliver value. That’s why the Big Tech companies and free market ideologues hate it so much. Because it doesn’t fit into their mental straitjacket and doesn’t serve their vested interests. It’s why all these reports’ recommendations are framed in terms of markets and monetisation: selling (not sharing) the data; ‘commercial opportunities’ (not public service); ‘competitiveness’ (who on earth is the NHS actually ‘competing’ with?)</p><p>The end result is downright insulting. “Countries that are home to frontier laboratories not only provide cutting-edge training but also exert a powerful pull for the next generation of top entrepreneurs, researchers and other globally mobile talent,” the report declares. So what about the millions of people who are not ‘top entrepreneurs, researchers and other globally mobile talent’? In other words, what about the people who actually deliver the service, day in and day out? Clearly, for the hype merchants they amount to&nbsp;nothing.</p> Conclusion <p>Tony Blair’s reports are not particularly unique or special. They are one of a genre, all of which display the same core characteristics. They&nbsp;display:</p>  unquestioning obedience to the mythology that monetisation and markets are the only way to create&nbsp;wealth  a studied indifference to the day-to-day operational realities of actually providing services  endless displacement activity that obsesses with The New! And The Cool!!! where the further they are away from day-to-day operational realities the&nbsp;better  barely disguised contempt for the people who actually produce and use the services in&nbsp;question  all for the promotion of the barely-concealed agenda of asset stripping to line the pockets of the already rich and&nbsp;powerful  <p>All bandwagons flourish by presenting a part as if it were the whole, by exaggerating the part’s benefits and by making light of the difficulties. Bandwagoneers use this heady mix to manipulate people to their own ends — to spread political lies. Today, the message that ‘AI is our saviour’ is one such political lie.</p><p>We ended our last blog on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/beware-a-new-data-bandwagon-is-rolling-5eebf8501a42">the NHS data bandwagon</a> by saying the people of this country deserve better than this. They do. They deserve and need to be equipped with their own data and data tools to make their lives better — not to have their data and tools to be handed over to parasitic monopolists.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-an-anatomy-of-hype-be617e1d65a9">AI — An Anatomy of Hype</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Remember the wise words of Charles Darwin? "It's not the strongest of the species that survives," he declared, "nor the most intelligent [...] – it is the one that is most adaptable to change." This rings especially true in today's financial services landscape, where digital disruption is no longer a whisper on the wind, but a full-blown hurricane tearing through legacy systems and traditional business models. Digital-first providers, including challenger banks, neobanks, fintechs, insurtechs and most recently, techfins, have morphed into formidable competitors, delivering seamless, personalized experiences that leave many incumbents gasping for air. And it comes as no surprise that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/ebooks/3952-unlock-power-digital-identity-financial-services.html">digital identity in financial services</a> underpins this very paradigm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the rapid evolution of the financial services industry has shown throughout history, the most adaptable inherit the future. While the rise of digital-first providers across the industry presents undeniable challenges, so too it creates extensive opportunities for incumbent providers to raise their game, gain access to cutting-edge fintech/techfin innovation, and most importantly of all: deliver new streamlined, secure, and scalable experiences to their customers, while having them coming back for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This explains why the most progressive (and successful) financial institutions continue to increase their investments in converged identity and access management (IAM) to drive hyper-personalization, adaptive security, and business model expansion at scale.</p>

 From romance fraud to investment scams, there are a multitude of ways that fraudsters use social media to target victims. Here, we explore some of the most common and speak to one man who almost lost it all. 



 



<p>In 2024, it’s safe to say that if you use the internet, you’re more than likely to also use social media. In fact, of the 5.35 billion active global internet users, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">5 billion are regular social media users.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you want to look at photos of somebody you haven’t spoken to in 15 years, swipe on photos of somebody you’d like to speak to for the next 15 years, read about the latest conspiracy theory, or apply for a job, there’s a specific social media platform to connect with old and new friends alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beauty of social media is how easily you can connect with people. Unfortunately, the danger of social media is also how easily you can, without any substantial identity verification check, create an account and claim to be whoever you want to be. Simply choose a name, select a photo and hey presto – you have an account. With just a few clicks, you’re free to contact with anyone on the internet. Free to share cat photos, argue why the moon is made of cheese, send your CV, or steal money from a complete stranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 It starts with a click. 



<p>In the first six months of 2023, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers#1">$2.7 billion was lost through social media fraud</a>. Massive numbers compared to the next most common fraud channel: website and apps, which claimed $2 billion, or emails, which were responsible for the comparatively low figure of just $900 million. Little wonder, then, that for one in four people who’ve been defrauded since 2021, the initial communication began on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, it’s likely that you have already been contacted via a scammer, and you may not even know it. Here are the top three types of social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 Romance scam. 



<p>Romance fraud is a type of scam initiated through social engineering, where emotional relationships are created to obtain financial gain or services. Romance scammers often use dating apps, but reports show that social media platforms are becoming even more common. While some dating apps, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/20/tinder-is-expanding-id-verification-to-the-us-uk-brazil-and-mexico/">Tinder are beginning to introduce identity verification</a> steps into onboarding, many do not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Discover how one woman is exposing romance scams in our blog,<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/"> ‘What’s love got to do with it? Exposing the romance scammers, with Becky Holmes.’</a>]&nbsp;</p>



 Social media account takeover fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>37% of UK adults worry about social media fraud, according to our recently released <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024</a>. This fear is well founded, as someone who has access to your social media account can gather valuable information and photos about you and your family and friends for future fraud attacks. They can also post phishing attacks and links to investment scams from your account, lending the scam a convincing air of credibility and authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



 Investment scam / pig butchering scam.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most common forms of social media fraud. Investment scams are typically ‘long con’ techniques that take place over a series of weeks or months, with the fraudster slowly establishing trust before presenting the victim with an investment opportunity. Although the website and payment portals shared may look genuine, any money that the victim sends is being transferred directly to the scammer. A variation of the investment scam is the pig butchering scam, which combines elements from romance scams, investment schemes, and crypto fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 “We just clicked.”&nbsp; 



<p>Anyone can be targeted by social media fraud. Young or old. Blue or white collar. After reading our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">‘Welcome to the fraud factory: Home of the pig butchering scam.’</a> IDnow was contacted by a German entrepreneur who realized that he had been defrauded. Below, we share his story:&nbsp;</p>



 Background. 



<p>I am an executive of a tech startup based in Europe, and 2023 marked a significant turning point for our company as it transitioned into a stock corporation. As the CEO, my primary responsibilities included securing financing, managing investor relationships, and selling shares to fuel the growth of the company. The second quarter of 2023 was particularly challenging, filled with numerous investor meetings and a determined push to promote our investment opportunities through Google Ads. It was during this period that I was contacted by a seemingly enthusiastic investor over LinkedIn, setting off a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the company and my personal life.&nbsp;</p>



 The encounter.&nbsp; 



<p>In early May 2023, I received a message on LinkedIn from a young lady expressing her interest in investing in our stock corporation. Intrigued by her enthusiasm and apparent financial success, I engaged in a conversation with her. We quickly transitioned from LinkedIn to Telegram, and eventually she asked to switch to WhatsApp, and we exchanged phone numbers. She presented herself as a 37-year-old, successful investor in the art industry, with numerous investments in art galleries, including one in Hamburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As our conversations continued, she began sharing details about her immense wealth and philanthropic endeavors, especially her interest in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nft-non-fungible-tokens-new-art-money-laundering/">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs</a>). She frequently flaunted her account balance, boasting of having millions of USDT (cryptocurrency with a value that mirrors the US dollar) at her disposal. She assured me that investing in digital artwork would be a profitable venture for our struggling company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under her influence, I started investing in digital artwork on a platform called [removed], which frequently changed its domain. As she gained my trust, she probed for information about my net worth and assets, believing she was dealing with a financially stable partner. In reality, though, our company was facing dire financial straits, and I was desperate to secure the necessary financing to prevent bankruptcy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The ‘golden opportunity.’ 



<p>Then came the golden opportunity. She suggested purchasing a highly valuable piece of digital artwork, similar to the popular ‘bored ape’ NFTs, with the intention of putting it up for auction. I agreed to the purchase, spending $850,000, with the expectation that it would be sold for a substantial profit. A week later, it was indeed sold for $8,129,000, bringing immense relief as it seemed like a way to recover our company’s financial troubles and my personal investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the moment I attempted to withdraw the funds, my joy turned to despair. I was asked to transfer 20% of the auction price, amounting to over $1.6 million, to a different wallet. Subsequently, they demanded an “advanced certification audit,” requiring me to provide extensive personal information, including bank statements, the source of my funds (my house and other assets), and a copy of my passport. A few days later, I received the shocking news that my account had been frozen due to suspicion of money laundering. To regain access, I was told to pay an additional $547,000 fee with a promise of a refund upon a positive outcome of the audit. Late September marked the realization that I had fallen victim to a complex and devastating scam known as pig butchering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The aftermath. 



<p>Despair took hold, and I sought help from white hat hackers in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth and recover my investments. Unfortunately, I encountered fraudulent individuals who claimed to be white hat hackers and extorted thousands of dollars from me under the pretence of uncovering the fraud. Today, the company faces imminent administrative shutdown, forcing the dismissal of all employees, and I am left with no choice but to file for insolvency.&nbsp;</p>



 What happened next? 



<p>The anonymous reader lost €900,000 in total. In the months since discovering the deception, he has contacted lawyers, forensic hackers and the police, all to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The lawyer offered to trace and try to find the responsible company, but as you know, they are typically not registered and change their domains every three months.”</p>



<p>Although the forensic hackers did manage to locate the Wallet that contained the funds, they were unable to crack it, due to its Advanced Information Management Security Computer System (AIM), which was installed by a cyber security group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is therefore looking unlikely that he will ever be able to recover the funds, so for the time being, he is focusing on recovering and staying positive.</p>

 What’s so social about social media fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>With <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWiv_-gKiEAxUDUUEAHatSAXcQFnoECCUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F04%2F12%2Flinkedin-rolls-out-ways-to-verify-your-identity-and-employment-without-a-price-tag%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OOaCHGFxTZi5nUbm6kAb_&amp;opi=89978449">recent steps by LinkedIn</a> to introduce an identity verification step, could the era of social media anonymity, which inarguably leads to the proliferation of social media fraud, be coming to an end? Considering LinkedIn’s step is only encouraged and not mandatory, the answer is probably “no, not yet…”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flaws and loopholes also exist in X (formally Twitter) and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj2osmUgaiEAxUgV0EAHR9SAcUQFnoECCcQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hootsuite.com%2Fmeta-verified%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Vp0omcgNlBwL9v3MzxTnu&amp;opi=89978449">Meta’s verification strategies</a>, with only paid subscribers able to become verified. Identity verification only works if everybody participates; if it is not mandatory then it’s largely pointless. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">Becky Holmes, the ‘romance fraud vigilante-turned-author’</a>, the decision to offer verification for a fee is a fraudster’s dream. “Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, what’s stopping a fraudster just paying for the premium service and benefiting from the associated prestige?&nbsp;</p>



 How to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of this year. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are staggering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most industries, including financial services, gambling, mobility, travel, and telecommunications have all embraced the potential of digital identity verification. Some industries, like financial services remain at the forefront of digital identity verification adoption, as they are required by regulations to have certain <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> and identity checks in place. While identity verification can help businesses meet compliance challenges and protect their business and customers from fraud, other industries are motivated more by its ability to optimize processes and scale their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, until social media platforms adopt meaningful and comprehensive identity verification, users should connect with caution. Here are three top tips to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



  Stay aware.  



<p>From the latest terms, like social engineering or deepfakes, it’s important to have a rudimentary understanding of what they include, so that you can remain vigilant, and know what steps to take if you are suspicious of a new contact.</p>



  Don’t just click.  



<p>Never click on links from your social media contacts, especially if they are new ‘friends.’ Only move to encrypted channels when you are totally sure that they are who they say there are, and of their intentions. If you suspect that your friend’s account has been hacked, contact them via a secure platform to make sure it’s them.&nbsp;</p>



  Don’t send.  



<p>Never send money to a social media contact. Regardless of how many times you’ve messaged, how well they know you, or how good the opportunity is. Beware of investment platforms, and crypto payment portals, as criminals are incredibly skilled in creating fake websites.</p>

 IDnow fraud survey reveals: 33% of Brits share sensitive ID documents unprotected online, with youth most at risk. 



 



  33% of Brits have shared scans or photos of an ID card, driving licence or passport via digital channels, such as social media or email, despite knowing that these ID documents could land in the wrong hands  The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about banking fraud  Over half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is, or the role it plays in fraud, with almost half not knowing what deepfakes are  



 



<p>London, February 20, 2024 – A major survey into attitudes and knowledge around fraud in the UK has been unveiled, with findings indicating a lack of knowledge around key tactics used by fraudsters, leaving Brits vulnerable to this crime, which is seeing exponential growth.</p>



<p>Commissioned by IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider, the YouGov survey of 2,264 people has uncovered that almost half (45%) of UK adults were aware that scans or photos of their ID documents could be obtained by criminals to be used to commit fraud – yet sent the documents via digital channels, such as email, social media and messenger apps anyway.</p>



<p>Such activity could lead to identity theft, which IDnow believes should be a concern to the UK public, especially given the rise in deepfake technology. Developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) mean deepfake technology can now be used to create hyper-realistic fake documents, as well as videos. However, the survey found that less than a third (31%) of Britons know what deepfake documents are and are aware of the potential risks posed by digitally generated images of physical documents.</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow, commented: “Many of us have seen the uncanny deepfake videos of celebrities that spread like wildfire across the internet, showing how easy it is to emulate the likeness of someone using AI. But worryingly, this research suggests that the UK public is not as concerned, or aware as they should be, of the risks associated with such digitally generated images or videos.</p>



<p>“The extraordinary leaps in AI technology mean it’s now almost too easy for a fraudster to carry out financial crimes. Consumers shouldn’t make it even easier for fraudsters though. Our advice is always to think twice before sending a scan or photo of your driving licence or passport into the digital ether via unencrypted channels, such as social media or email.”</p>



<p>Interestingly, 48% of 18- to 24-year-olds surveyed have shared ID documents via such risky channels, compared with just 21% of over-55s, highlighting the potential need to better educate the younger generation on digital fraud threats.</p>



 Is fraud front of mind? 



<p>The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking fraud</a>, when asked about the different areas of life where fraud could occur. An additional 37% of Brits are most concerned about fraud via social media channels.</p>



<p>With 54% of Brits unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>, encompassing deceptive tactics such as phishing or smishing, the majority of the population remains vulnerable to potential fraud attempts. Social engineering, one of the most prevalent and hard to catch fraud typologies, sees fraudsters manipulating trust or fear, putting consumers at risk of divulging sensitive information or falling prey to malicious links disguised as trustworthy messages.</p>



<p>In terms of the likelihood of being a victim of crime, a fifth (21%) of Brits believe they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile. In fact, social media was the primary security concern for those aged 18- to 24-years-old, with each remaining age group citing their main worry as someone accessing their bank account through identity fraud.</p>



<p>Hence, for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, three quarters of Brits (75%) would be willing to go through a lengthier online onboarding process, if this made it safer. Doug Pollock, Vice President Customer Success at IDnow, explained: “Our findings show that banks in the UK do not always go far enough to make their customers feel safe and secure. They need to go further in terms of fraud prevention technology to meet their customers’ risk appetite, especially when their money is at stake. Because, and our research confirms this, if banks get it wrong, the majority of people (54%) would consider moving banks were they to become a victim of fraud. </p>



<p>“We hope these findings highlight the massive impact online fraud continues to have on British people. Because fraudsters work across industries, regions and use cases, it’s vital we all work together – financial services, technology providers, government, law enforcement and the public – to identify and stop fraudsters before it’s too late.”</p>



 



<p>About this study</p>



<p>This release is based on data from an online survey conducted by YouGov Germany, in which 2,264 people in the UK took part between 6 and 7 December 2023. The results were weighted and are representative of the UK population aged 18 and over.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The Era of Generative AI is upon us – there is no doubt about that. After over 50 years of academic research in artificial intelligence culminating in the development of neural networks and machine learning algorithms, and then another decade of building cybersecurity products based on those methods and trying to persuade customers to finally put their trust into them… The seemingly out-of-nowhere emergence of ChatGPT has managed to achieve that overnight.</p>
<p>Instead of a grumpy, suspicious crowd not willing to let AI automate their jobs, we now see a public craze that makes the Tulip Mania of the 17th century pale in comparison. Businesses are rushing to implement GenAI capabilities into all their processes and workflows. Vendors are struggling to come up with even more potential use cases to add generative capabilities to their products. But most importantly, literally everyone is happy to consume those capabilities again and again, disregarding potential risks and challenges (including being automated out of their jobs completely).</p>
<p>Even I couldn't resist asking DALL-E to create an illustration for the previous paragraph, and the result is quite impressive...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discussing those risks for business applications of GenAI is a huge topic on its own. We already hear experts talking about lack of transparency, potential biases in training, compliance issues with leaking sensitive information to third parties, to say nothing about the massive costs of running LLM infrastructures. Still, the attempts of some organizations to outright ban ChatGPT usage on their premises have already been proven futile. Just like BYOD, this usage should be controlled by a combination of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/ai-regulation-challenges-and-opportunities">government-level regulation</a> and organizations’ own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-need-ai-acceptable-use-policy-aup-declan-van-esbeck-q9q6e/">acceptable use policies</a>.</p>
 Generative AI for cybersecurity practitioners 
<p>Still, today we want to focus on a more specific question: does the introduction of GenAI capabilities fundamentally change cybersecurity? What practical new functionality do they offer to security experts? And what are the challenges of developing and using security tools that rely on modern GenAI models?</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the most obvious use case doesn’t even require any additional interfaces between you and ChatGPT: it’s continuous education, an absolute must for every cybersecurity practitioner. Having a virtual assistant that can instantly answer any question and free you from doing your own research is a very alluring prospect indeed. You just have to remember that ChatGPT is not smarter than you. In fact, it works much more like a room full of hyperactive monkeys with typewriters, and not everything they produce is necessarily on par with Shakespeare. When an LLM does not know something, it will happily make up a completely wrong but still plausibly-looking answer, and it is entirely your responsibility to check its validity. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Trust but verify</a>!</p>
<p>Another related area is using LLMs for creating various materials for safe simulations of cybersecurity incidents. The idea itself is, of course, not at all new – tabletop exercises, incident response bootcamps and other kinds of training are a big part of every business continuity program, but using Generative AI does not just reduce the cost of such exercises but dramatically increases the degree of their realism – after all, real threat actors are already using very similar tools for their nefarious purposes. Again, just keep in mind that the cost of an error in this business is not at your advantage – a poorly crafted spear phishing mail will only leave a hacker with a bit of lost revenue, yet a poorly designed phishing awareness exercise might leave your entire company unprotected against multiple future attacks.</p>
<p>With the tremendous improvements LLMs are now making in generating not just natural language, but application source code as well, the idea of making new software “secure by design” by replacing human developers (that make so many coding mistakes and are impossible to teach to follow security practices!) with code generated directly by an AI model is getting more and more traction. In a similar way, LLMs can be used to create more sophisticated authorization policies, generate synthetic data for security testing, etc. In a slightly less radical approach, LLMs would not outright replace humans but serve as an additional filter in an existing CI/CD pipeline to improve its coverage and efficiency.</p>
<p>To be honest, looking at the results produced by current-generation tools, I’m somewhat skeptical about AI completely replacing human developers anytime soon, but the situation might change quickly. In any case, however, there is absolutely no reason to treat the code generated by AI as inherently error-free. You’ll still need to keep unit tests, static and dynamic code analysis solutions, and a lot of other security tools included in your development pipeline. Can you delegate all these activities to LLMs? Perhaps, but should you? In the end, it is still someone’s liability, and you cannot put than on AI…</p>
<p>But wait, someone reading this might say, what about arguably the most interesting application of Generative AI – specialized security-trained LLMs built into solutions like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>? Aren’t they the real future of cybersecurity?</p>
<p>Well, I cannot argue with that… to a degree. SIEMs, XDRs, and other security analytics solutions have been relying on various AI technologies for years, and the addition of GenAI does make them better in many ways. Providing better insights by cutting through the noise, helping to make critical incident response decisions faster, improving security analysts’ productivity – all these capabilities are great improvements, but they are not what makes a security tool reliable and scalable. Microsoft’s Copilot would never be so useful without the company’s existing vast telemetry network and threat intelligence database or their own cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Even Charles Babbage, the inventor of the first programmable computer, already understood the principle that later became known as “Garbage in, garbage out” – not even the most sophisticated machine can make right decisions based on incomplete, flawed, or biased input data. For Generative AI, this applies to a much larger extent than anywhere else in IT. Perhaps, when you’re choosing the next best cybersecurity tool for your organization, looking at its GenAI-powered bells and whistles should not be on the top of your list of priorities.</p>
 Tapping into the Wisdom of the Crowd 
<p>In the end, we cannot deny the fact that Generative AI is indeed a game-changer in almost every industry, including cybersecurity. And yet it is critical for everyone to understand that GenAI does not do magic. It is just a tool - an extremely sophisticated, sometimes quite delicate, and very expensive one. A crucial part of integrating these tools into your security strategy is to clearly understand their capabilities and limitations (which tend to change literally on a weekly basis). Even more important is to be aware of how both the trailblazers and ordinary peers within your industry are using them to capitalize on their experience and avoid their mistakes.</p>
<p>And of course, there is no better platform to meet those people than the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">upcoming EIC 2024</a>, Europe’s prime conference on Digital ID, Security, Privacy and Governance in an AI-driven world, which will take place this June in Berlin, Germany. I hope to see you there as well!</p>

<div class='wrap'>


<p>Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) is an automated and continuous software-based approach to offensive security. Similar to other forms of security validation such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/red-teaming-101-what-is-red-teaming/">red teaming</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/penetration-testing">penetration testing</a>, BAS complements more traditional security tools by simulating cyberattacks to test security controls and provide actionable insights.</p>



<p>Like a red team exercise, breach and attack simulations use the real-world attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by hackers to proactively identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by actual threat actors. However, unlike red teaming and pen testing, BAS tools are fully automated and can provide more comprehensive results with fewer resources in the time between more hands-on security tests. Providers such as SafeBreach, XM Cyber, and Cymulate, offer cloud-based solutions which allow for the easy integration of BAS tools without implementing any new hardware.</p>



<p>As a security control validation tool, BAS solutions help organizations gain a better understanding of their security gaps, as well as provide valuable guidance for prioritized remediation.</p>



<p>Breach and attack simulation helps security teams to:</p>



 
 Mitigate potential cyber risk: Provides early warning for possible internal or external threats empowering security teams to prioritize remediation efforts before experiencing any critical data exfiltration, loss of access, or similar adverse outcomes. 



 Minimize the likelihood of successful cyberattacks: In a constantly shifting <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">threat landscape</a>, automation increases resiliency through continuous testing. 
 



 How does breach and attack simulation work? 



<p>BAS solutions replicate many different types of attack paths, attack vectors and attack scenarios. Based on the real-world TTPs used by threat actors as outlined in the threat intelligence found in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mitre-attack">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> and Cyber Killchain frameworks, BAS solutions can simulate:</p>



 
 Network and infiltration attacks 



 Lateral movement 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/phishing">Phishing</a> 



 Endpoint and gateway attacks 



 Malware&nbsp;attacks 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware">Ransomware</a> attacks 
 



<p>Regardless of the type of attack, BAS platforms simulate, assess and validate the most current attack techniques used by advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other malicious entities along the entire attack path. Once an attack is completed, a BAS platform will then provide a detailed report including a prioritized list of remediation steps should any critical vulnerabilities be discovered.</p>



<p>The BAS process begins with the selection of a specific attack scenario from a customizable dashboard. Besides running many types of known attack patterns derived from emerging threats or custom-defined situations, they can also perform attack simulations based on the strategies of known APT groups, whose methods may vary depending on an organization’s given industry.</p>



<p>After an attack scenario is initiated, BAS tools deploy virtual agents within an organization’s network. These agents attempt to breach protected systems and move laterally to access critical assets or sensitive data. Unlike traditional penetration testing or red teaming, BAS programs can use credentials and internal system knowledge that attackers may not have. In this way, BAS software can simulate both outsider and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/insider-threats">insider attacks</a> in a process that is similar to purple teaming.</p>



<p>After completing a simulation, the BAS platform generates a comprehensive vulnerability report validating the efficacy of various security controls from firewalls to endpoint security, including:</p>



 
 Network security controls 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edr">Endpoint detection and response</a> (EDR) 



 Email security controls 



 Access control measures 



 Vulnerability management policies 



 Data security controls 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/incident-response">Incident response</a> controls 
 



 What are the benefits of breach and attack simulation? 



<p>While not intended to replace other <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> protocols, BAS solutions can significantly improve an organization’s security posture. According to a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3762274">Gartner research report</a>, BAS can help security teams uncover up to 30-50% more vulnerabilities compared to traditional vulnerability assessment tools. The main benefits of breach and attack simulation are:</p>



 
 Automation: As the persistent threat of cyberattacks grows year over year, security teams are under constant pressure to operate at increased levels of efficiency. BAS solutions have the ability to run continuous testing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, without the need for any additional staff either on premises or offsite.&nbsp;BAS can also be used to run on-demand tests, as well as provide feedback in real time. 



 Accuracy: For any security team, especially ones with limited resources, accurate reporting is crucial for efficient resource allocation—time spent investigating non-critical or falsely identified security incidents is wasted time. According to <a href="https://www.ponemon.org/local/upload/file/Damballa%20Malware%20Containment%20FINAL%203.pdf">a study by the Ponemon Institute</a>, organizations using advanced threat detection tools such as BAS experienced a 37% reduction in false positive alerts. 



 Actionable insights: As a security control validation tool, BAS solutions can produce valuable insights highlighting specific vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, as well as contextual mitigation recommendations tailored to an organization’s existing infrastructure. Additionally, data-driven prioritization helps SOC teams address their most critical vulnerabilities first. 



 Improved detection and response: Built on APT knowledge bases like MITRE ATT&amp;CK and the Cyber Killchain, and also integrating well with other security technologies (e.g., <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/siem">SIEM</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/security-orchestration-automation-response">SOAR</a>), BAS tools can contribute to significantly improved detection and response rates for cybersecurity incidents. <a href="https://www.safebreach.com/resources/reports/esg-report-the-impact-of-breach-and-attack-simulation-tools-on-security-operations">A study by the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG)</a> found that 68% of organizations using BAS and SOAR together experienced improved incident response times. Gartner predicts that by 2025, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3981104">organizations using SOAR and BAS together will experience a 50% reduction</a> in the time it takes to detect and respond to incidents. 
 



 Breach and attack simulation and attack surface management 



<p>While integrating well with many different types of security tools, industry data indicates a growing trend toward integrating breach and attack simulation and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface-management">attack surface management (ASM)</a> tools in the near future. As Security and Trust Research Director of the International Data Corporation, Michelle Abraham said, “Attack surface management and breach and attack simulation allow security defenders to be more proactive in managing risk.”</p>



<p>Whereas <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vulnerability-management">vulnerability management</a> and vulnerability scanning tools assess an organization from within, attack surface management is the continuous discovery, analysis, remediation and monitoring of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that make up an organization’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface">attack surface</a>. Similar to other attack simulation tools, ASM assumes the perspective of an outside attacker and assesses an organization’s outward-facing&nbsp;presence.</p>



<p>Accelerating trends toward increased cloud computing, IoT devices, and shadow IT (i.e., the unsanctioned use of unsecured devices) all increase an organization’s potential cyber exposure. ASM solutions scan these attack vectors for potential vulnerabilities, while BAS solutions incorporate that data to better perform attack simulations and security testing to determine the effectiveness of security controls in place.</p>



<p>The overall result is a much clearer understanding of an organization’s defenses, from internal employee awareness to sophisticated cloud security concerns. When knowing is more than half the battle, this critical insight is invaluable for organizations seeking to fortify their security.</p>

<p>Data monetization empowers organizations to use their data assets and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to create tangible economic value. This value exchange system <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-to-accelerate-your-data-monetization-strategy-with-data-products-and-ai/">uses data products</a> to enhance business performance, gain a competitive advantage, and address industry challenges in response to market demand.</p>



<p>Financial benefits include increased revenue through the creation of adjacent industry business models, accessing new markets to establish more revenue streams, and growing existing revenue. Cost optimization can be achieved through a combination of productivity enhancements, infrastructure savings and reductions in operating expenses.</p>



<p>In 2023, the global data monetization market was valued at USD 3.5 billion, and experts project it to reach USD 14.4 billion by 2032, demonstrating a <a href="https://www.imarcgroup.com/data-monetization-market">compound annual growth rate of 16.6% from 2024 to 2032</a>.</p>



 Treating data as a strategic asset 



<p>Data is one of the most valuable&nbsp;intangible assets for organizations. Therefore, adopting a holistic approach that prioritizes data-driven business transformation helps optimize value extraction. This transformation harnesses the power of data within the organization, enabling enterprise-wide cost optimization and unlocking net new direct revenue opportunities.</p>



<p>When it comes to data optimization, most organizations focus solely on infrastructure cost reduction. However, those that embrace data-driven business transformation strategies can multiply the benefits by considering revenue growth potential, optimizing costs across infrastructure, development, maintenance and enhancing data security and compliance.</p>



Figure 1: Data driven business transformation



<p>Critical aspects of data-driven business transformation are the overall data monetization strategy and how data products are used. Data insight and AI automation drive cost optimization with predictive maintenance, process automation and workforce optimization. AI automation substantially reduces data security and compliance risks by proactively identifying and analyzing the severity, scope and root cause of threats before they impact the business.</p>



<p>The net effect of data-driven business transformation is increased compliance, productivity and effectiveness via automation across different business units, such as sales, marketing and services. This leads to revenue uplift through opportunities to create new services and channels.</p>



 Identifying data products 



<p>Industries across the board are experiencing a surge in enterprise data volume, presenting both challenges and opportunities. These challenges, along with specific industry needs and use cases, influence the types of data products organizations or markets require.</p>



<p>Data products are assets developed from a company’s internal data sources or by combining internal and public data, augmented with AI to extract unique insights that help drive business decisions. Managed as products, these data assets come with defined service contracts, repeatable delivery methods and a clear value proposition.</p>



Figure 2: The data product lifecycle



<p>The banking industry, for example, faces the following challenges:</p>



 
 Competition from agile and innovative financial technology and challenger banks. 



 High degree of regulatory control. 



 Need to protect sensitive information. 



 Organizational data silos that impede a unified customer experience. 



 Pressure to increase margins and identify new revenue streams. 
 



<p>To address these challenges, organizations create relevant use cases that address their specific needs, as well as the needs of the market at large. The following sample use cases show associated data products and corresponding financial benefits.</p>



Use CaseImprove lending decision-making to reduce riskDrive behavior-based recommendations and personalizationDevelop customer service strategies based on comprehensive customer dataData ProductEconomic climate risk analysisCustomer behavior insightsUnified view of customer economic dataFinancial BenefitsImproved market share predictability and revenue growth. Reduced costs through risk mitigation.Enhanced understanding of customer preferences. Increased revenue growth through personalized product offerings. Improved user experience.Increased customer lifetime value through tailored services. Reusable, integrated data across organizational silos. Scroll to view full table  



<p>Data products can be created for internal use across various functions or business units. When an organization shares its data internally and consistently to improve efficiency and achieve qualitative or quantitative benefits, it is referred to as internal data monetization.</p>



<p>Data products can also be created for wider external consumption across multiple organizations and ecosystems. When data is shared externally to achieve strategic and financial benefits, it is referred to as external data monetization.</p>



 AI-driven data platform economics 



<p>An AI-driven organization is one where AI technology is fundamental to both value creation and value capture within the business model. A data monetization capability built on platform economics can reach its maximum potential when data is recognized as a product that is either built or powered by AI.</p>



Figure 3: Data platform economics



<p>In the collection-led model, data from external and internal sources, such as data warehouses and data stores, is fed into analytical tools for enterprise-wide consumption. At the enterprise level, business units identify the data they need from source systems and create data sets tailored exclusively to their specific solutions. This leads to a proliferation of organizational data and added pipeline complexity, which can pose challenges in upkeep and use for new solutions, directly affecting costs and timeliness.</p>



<p>As enterprises shift from collection-led to product-led models, data products are created by using external and internal data sources, along with analytical tools. Once developed, these data products can be made available to business units within the organization for real-time data sharing and analytics. Also, these data products offer opportunities for monetization through ecosystem partnerships.</p>



<p>In a platform-driven approach, business units build solutions by using standardized data products and combining technologies to reduce work, simplify the enterprise data architecture and decrease time to value.</p>



<p>The data platform offers data-enriched data products that use machine learning, deep learning and generative AI. Those AI-driven data products can virtualize and integrate disparate data sources to create domain-specific AI models using proprietary enterprise data. Data platform services enable data products to be provided as SaaS services, a single data mesh deployed across the hybrid cloud and authenticated, secure and audited data product delivery.</p>



<p>When organizations connect their valuable data and AI assets to wider user groups, they can use the multiplier effect from the consumption and evolution of data products, as well as the market reach from scalable cloud distribution.</p>



 The economic impact of data monetization 



<p>Organizations usually develop a business case spanning 3 to 5 years to gain a comprehensive view of short-, mid- and long-term economic benefits. Successful cases address market demands to remain competitive, foster scalability, and constantly pursue cost optimization and revenue enhancement opportunities.</p>



Figure 4: Economic impact of data monetization



<p>The graph above shows the incremental revenue potential from data monetization over a 5-year period. In an example organization with USD 2 billion in revenue, the baseline revenue from data is USD 5 million (0.25% of the overall revenue). If the organization follows the traditional approach, revenue from data might grow by 10% year-on-year, from USD 5 million to USD 6.7 million in three years, just 1.34 times the baseline revenue.</p>



<p>In contrast, data monetization can act as a force multiplier and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/McKinsey%20Analytics/Our%20Insights/Fueling%20growth%20through%20data%20monetization/Fueling-growth-through-data-monetization.pdf">contribute to upwards of a 1% increase in a company’s revenue</a>. With data monetization capabilities, revenue from data could potentially grow from USD 5 million to USD 20 million in 3 years, representing a fourfold increase compared to the baseline revenue.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.rtinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forrester-PowerPoint-Template-Guidelines.pdf">recent economic impact reports</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/9X4AX5WK">the cost of building</a> a data monetization capability is less than the baseline revenue from data. Therefore, an organization might allocate a portion of its existing data revenue in the first year to build a data monetization capability.</p>



 Getting started with data monetization 



<p>Organizations can start by defining their data monetization strategy and identifying the data products. Then, they can create their data monetization capability by developing an integrated AI-driven data platform. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data">IBM Cloud Pak® for Data</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-integration">IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration</a>, IBM® <a>watsonx.data</a>™ and IBM® <a>watsonx.ai</a>™ provide them with that holistic platform.</p>



<p>We recommend a discovery workshop where you’ll explore your data and AI ambitions to determine your first data product. In a 4 to 6-week sprint, we’ll collaborate to craft a vision for your platform architecture and develop a proof of concept for the first data product design. This comprehensive process includes the development of the initial data product, the creation of a roadmap for future products, and the establishment of a supporting business case.</p>

   In an era of accelerating climate change, evolving technologies can help people predict the near-future and adapt.

<p>In an era of accelerating <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjk-Lu-gZiEAxVSj4kEHQQ1BWEQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Ftopics%2Fclimate-change&amp;usg=AOvVaw3szVX0AYWBbNffiB4v7AEv&amp;opi=89978449">climate change</a>, predicting the near-future can yield major benefits. For instance, when utility officials are aware that a heat wave is on its way, they can <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/mercados-emi">plan energy procurement</a> to prevent power outages. When farmers in drought-prone regions are able to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-and-texas-am-agrilife-provide-data-technology-and-expertise-to-farmers-in-need/">predict which crops are susceptible to failure</a>, they can deploy additional irrigation.</p>



<p>These proactive measures are made possible by evolving technologies designed to help people adapt to the effects of climate change today. But what will the impacts of climate change be in the future? And how will humans adapt to them then?</p>



 Climate models provide answers 



<p>Human activities precipitated changes to the Earth’s climate in the 20th century and will largely determine the future climate. Significant reductions in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a> could help mitigate the climate crisis. Under a higher emissions scenario, however, the 21st century would see much more severe consequences of climate change.</p>



<p>Global climate models have given climate scientists a set of expectations as to what the future could hold, both for the Earth at large and for specific regions. Climate modeling consists of using datasets and complex calculations to represent the interactions between major climate system components—namely, the atmosphere, land surface, oceans and sea ice.</p>



<p>One of the latest climate modeling initiatives come through a partnership between IBM and NASA. The collaboration is currently focused on building an AI-powered <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/weather-climate-foundation-model">foundation model</a> to make climate and weather applications faster and more accurate. The model could potentially be used to identify conditions that raise the risks of wildfires and predict hurricanes and droughts. An earlier model built through the IBM-NASA partnership became a tool to help scientists map urban heat islands in the United Arab Emirates and monitor reforestation in Kenya.</p>



<p>According to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the US’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), “Climate models reduce the uncertainty of climate change impacts, which aids in adaptation.”1</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the models’ predictions for the changing climate as well as how society could adapt.</p>



 Average global temperature increases 



<p>The most well-known sign of climate change, rising surface temperatures—also known as global warming—is a result of the greenhouse effect: the process in which increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases act as a barrier, trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere. According to the European Union climate monitor Copernicus, 2023 was the warmest year on record—nearly 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.66 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than 19th century pre-industrial levels.2</p>



<p>How much higher will temperatures climb? Predictions range as high as 5 degrees Celsius or more by the end of the 21st century, according to the Climate Science Special Report from the U.S. Global Change Research Program. However, sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could cap the temperature rise at 2 degrees Celsius or less.3</p>



<p>While the transition from fossil fuels to clean, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/renewable-energy-history/">renewable energy</a> sources is already underway, accelerating this transition could help further limit emissions, even amid rising global energy needs. The International Energy Agency predicts that a combination of renewable energy and nuclear power will meet more than 90% of increased demand by 2025.4</p>



 More extreme heat and heat waves 



<p>As global warming progresses, heat waves will become more common and more intense. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts people living in Africa, Australia, North America and Europe will face health risks due to rising temperatures and heat waves.5</p>



<p>The Global Disaster Preparedness Center recommends policymakers and others adopt a range of measures to help their regions adapt to higher heat. These include steps to reduce surface temperatures—like establishing more green spaces and designing buildings with vegetative layers on their roofs—to creating cooling centers and spray parks.6</p>



 More intense droughts and water scarcity 



<p>Global warming is causing more intense droughts and affecting water storage on land, decreasing access to freshwater. The IPCC projects that water available for human use will continue to decline in North America, while water security will be at risk in Africa, Asia and South America. Droughts and water scarcity will also impact crop growth, undermining food security. Parts of Africa will be especially vulnerable, with agricultural yields declining by as much as 50% in some areas.7 In addition, drier conditions are extending wildfire seasons around the world.</p>



<p>Nature-based and technological solutions offer some avenues for adapting to drier conditions. Studies show that planting trees combats desertification and triggers greater rainfall,8 while <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/food-security-smallholder-farmers/">artificial intelligence-powered climate forecasts and crop data analysis</a> can help farmers make informed decisions on crop management under challenging circumstances. Around the world, <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-11-16-IBM-Furthers-Commitment-to-Climate-Action-Through-New-Sustainability-Projects-and-Free-Training-in-Green-and-Technology-Skills-for-Vulnerable-Communities?_ga=2.19402744.1984713725.1702473547-1643077335.1670424615&amp;_gl=1*1s6m076*_ga*MTY0MzA3NzMzNS4xNjcwNDI0NjE1*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTcwMjQ4NjEzMy4xMDguMC4xNzAyNDg2MTMzLjAuMC4w">AI-powered climate models and other technologies</a> can help scientists, government officials and utilities providers forecast water access conditions and improve water resource management.</p>



 Evolving precipitation patterns and flooding 



<p>As some parts of the Earth get drier, others will get wetter. Even if the temperature rise is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the IPCC predicts heavy precipitation and flooding to become more frequent and intense in Africa, Asia, North America and Europe. Storms and tropical cyclones are also expected to intensify.</p>



<p>Policymakers are looking to a variety of strategies to mitigate coastal and inland flooding, including the installation of canals, drainage systems and rainwater storage systems, as well as the preservation and restoration of “spongey” natural barriers like dunes, mangroves and wetlands. In some cases, the latter can mean rolling back older flood mitigation strategies. In a city in China, for instance, officials removed a concrete flood wall to make room for plants and overflow ponds.9</p>



 Changing ocean chemistry 



<p>Global warming and greenhouse gas emissions are changing the composition of the world’s oceans and will continue doing so through the end of the century, according to the IPCC. As the global average temperatures rise, ocean oxygen levels will keep declining in what’s known as ocean deoxygenation. Ocean acidification will also continue. Both processes are considered harmful to sea life.</p>



<p>Key to mitigating these changes is reducing carbon emissions, but there are other solutions as well. Runoff and water pollution contributes to deoxygenation; according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Resources, legislation monitoring and limiting run-off could help.10 On the ocean acidification front, some scientists are hopeful about a new technology for removing acid from seawater.11</p>



 Global sea level rise 



<p>Sea levels rose rapidly in the 20th century, largely due to melting glaciers and ocean thermal expansion. That trend is expected to continue: NASA found that since 1993, the average rate of global mean sea-level rise has increased from about 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inches) per year to 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year.12 Ongoing sea level rises may be driven by instability and disintegration of ice shelves and ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. The IPCC predicts that the global mean-sea level will increase as much as 0.29 meters (0.95 feet) by 2050 and by 1.01 meters (3.3 feet) by the end of the century.13</p>



<p>As with flooding, adapting to sea level rise can take the form of both manmade and nature-based solutions, including erecting physical barriers such as seawalls and levees and restoring or preserving natural barriers such as wetlands. Considering rising sea levels during the design of infrastructure and building projects could make those structures more resilient: In California, for instance, transportation officials are planning to lift a portion of a busy highway 30 feet on account of rising sea levels.14</p>



 Ecosystem changes and biodiversity loss 



<p>Changes in earth’s climate system will include changes to ecosystems and wildlife populations. Research shows, for example, that much of the Amazon is approaching the tipping point of transforming from rainforests to savannah due to wildfires and droughts, endangering the species that call the forests home.15 Meanwhile, global warming and resulting marine heatwaves are continuing to imperil coral reefs, with the IPCC projecting a 70% to 90% decline in coral reefs once global average temperatures are 1.5 degrees Celsius higher. Breaching that temperature threshold would also result in 4% of mammals losing at least half their habitat, according to the United Nations.16</p>



<p>Monitoring, conservation and restoration efforts can help save ecosystems and animals. In Europe, policymakers approved a law in 2023 setting nature restoration objectives for the European Union, including binding targets to restore at least 30% of degraded habitats in EU countries by 2030 and 90% by 2050.17</p>

<p>In today’s complex global business environment, effective <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-management">supply chain management (SCM)</a> is crucial for maintaining a competitive advantage. The pandemic and its aftermath highlighted the importance of having a robust <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-risk-management">supply chain strategy</a>, with many companies facing disruptions due to shortages in raw materials and fluctuations in customer demand. The challenges continue: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/tech-and-regionalization-bolster-supply-chains-but-complacency-looms">one 2023 survey</a> found 44% of companies had to make changes in the past year due to issues with their supply chain footprint, and 49% said supply chain disruptions had caused planning problems.</p>



<p>But with the right tools and priorities, each step in the process can run smoothly. Here’s how companies are using different strategies to address supply chain management and meet their business goals.</p>



 Why supply chain management matters 



<p>Supply chain management involves coordinating and managing all the activities involved in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/sourcing">sourcing</a>, procurement, conversion and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-logistics">logistics</a>. It includes everything from product development and strategic decision-making to information systems and new technologies. But perhaps most relevant today are the capabilities within SCM to help mitigate disruption.</p>



<p>Supply chain disruptions are caused by a variety of factors, from pandemics, natural disasters and political instability to supplier bankruptcy and IT failures. To <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-risk-management">mitigate these risks</a>, companies need the resources and technology to develop robust contingency plans.</p>



<p>On top of disruption, companies with global supply chains must also deal with different regulatory environments, cultural norms and market conditions. They need strong SCM practices to help work out the logistics of transporting goods across long distances and through multiple countries without creating longer lead times or delays.</p>



<p>Effective SCM initiatives offer several benefits:</p>



 
 Lower operational costs: By optimizing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/inventory-management">inventory levels</a>, improving warehousing efficiency and streamlining order fulfillment processes, companies can save on storage, labor and transportation expenses. 



 Better customer satisfaction: An <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-optimization">optimized supply chain </a>allows businesses to make sure products are available when and where people want them—which can improve relationships and loyalty with customers. 



 Fewer disruptions: A healthy supply chain mitigates risks and protects against inevitable disruption. By developing contingency plans and resilient supply chains, companies can continue to operate even when unexpected events occur. 
 



 Key strategies for effective supply chain management 



<p>There are a number of ways that companies can better optimize and manage their supply chains. Here are the areas some businesses are focusing on as they refine their overall approach:</p>



 Forecasting and demand planning 



<p>Companies can reduce storage costs and avoid stockouts or overstock with help from accurate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/demand-planning">demand forecasting</a>, which uses historical sales data, market research and economic trends to predict future market demand for products or services.</p>



<p>Big data and predictive analytics are increasingly being used to improve forecasting accuracy, allowing businesses to respond more effectively to changes in customer needs. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/mro-inventory-optimization">Advanced software tools</a> can automate some parts of forecasting, providing real-time updates and alerts when inventory levels are too high or low.</p>



 Automation 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">Automation </a>can streamline supply chain operations, from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/order-management">order fulfillment</a> to inventory tracking. It can take many forms, from automated warehouse systems that pick and pack orders, to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts">blockchain-based smart contracts</a> to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/transaction-manager">software that automates purchasing and invoicing processes</a>. These technologies can significantly reduce manual labor, minimize errors and speed up processes, leading to increased efficiency and cost savings.</p>



 Technology-driven visibility 



<p>AI and machine learning can be used to analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately, providing insights that can improve forecasting, inventory management, and customer service. <a href="https://impact.economist.com/projects/trade-in-transition/">A 2023 survey</a> found that a third of businesses are using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to improve resource and supply chain planning, and more than a third said using digital tools for inventory management was the most effective strategy in cutting overall supply chain costs.</p>



<p>Real-time tracking systems, often enabled by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> devices, help companies monitor their supply chain accurately and immediately. Having visibility into the status and location of goods as they move through the supply chain helps companies monitor supplier performance, identify bottlenecks and respond quickly to disruptions. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/control-towers">supply chain control tower</a> can connect many sources of data-driven information and improve end-to-end visibility.</p>



<p>Moreover, enterprise resource planning (ERP) software can integrate different aspects of a business into one system, providing a holistic view of operations and the metrics needed to streamline supply chain processes. Integrated supply chain analytics software, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics/supply-chain-planning">IBM Planning Analytics</a>, connect complex data sets for more insightful analytics and scenario analysis that can help avoid demand-and-supply mismatches or fulfillment delays.</p>



 Sustainable and ethical sourcing 



<p>Companies are trying to ensure that every stage of their supply chains is adhering to responsible practices. This not only helps satisfy customer desire for sustainability and ethical products but also helps mitigate risks, such as regulatory penalties or reputational damage.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ethical-sourcing">Ethical sourcing</a> involves ensuring that the products and services a company procures are produced under fair, safe and environmentally friendly conditions. This may involve conducting audits of suppliers, implementing codes of conduct and using certification schemes to verify compliance. Sustainable sourcing, meanwhile, focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of the supply chain. This might involve partnering with suppliers who use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a>, reducing packaging or implementing recycling programs.</p>



<p>Blockchain technologies can increase transparency and traceability in the supply chain, helping to prevent fraud and ensure product authenticity. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/food-trust">IBM Food Trust®</a>, a collaborative network of growers, processors, wholesalers, distributors, manufacturers, retailers and others, uses blockchain technology to improve visibility and accountability across the food supply chain.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-33406">Access the Food Trust ebook</a>



 Building strong partnerships 



<p>Strong relationships are a key part of any business strategy. When it comes to supply chains, strong connections with providers, distributors and other key stakeholders in the supply network can help companies improve resilience. Partnerships can facilitate better communication, collaboration and responsiveness, particularly in times of disruption. They can also provide access to new markets, technologies, and expertise, offering a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Because finding the right suppliers can be challenging, some businesses turn to technology to help. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/trust-your-supplier">IBM® Trust Your Supplier</a>, a supply chain risk management software solution, helps ensure suppliers and other partners in the supply chain meet global and industry standards, provides continuous monitoring and risk assessment and uses blockchain-based information management to ensure transparency and traceability.</p>



 Effective supply chain strategy for the future 



<p>Whether it’s through forecasting, automation, sustainable sourcing, strong partnerships or new technologies, there are numerous strategies companies can employ to optimize supply chain planning and execution. By doing so, they can improve profitability, meet customer demand and ensure their business is resilient in the face of disruptions.</p>

			  Fabio Espinosa is Back-End Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>Hello! I’m Fabio, originally from Colombia and currently living in Madrid. I work as a back-end software engineer at Tokeny. I’ve had a lifelong fascination with technology and how it has the potential to change people’s lives. Now, I think it is really cool to be able to work on technology myself.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked as a tech lead at another startup and occasionally freelanced through Toptal.</p>
<p>I recognized a point in my career where my knowledge growth in programming had stagnated. Despite my experience in back-end, front-end, and dev ops, the work became repetitive, offering limited space for new things, and consequently, it was not so interesting anymore. Moreover, I was managing people, which was not giving me much joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was this realization that made me curious to explore something new, particularly related to blockchain. Tokeny presented itself as an exciting opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Also, it’s widely recognized that tokenization is positioned for substantial growth—something that will take off. Such advancements hold significant potential, particularly for early entrants who typically experience disproportionate gains. This trend appears to be unfolding, as we are beginning to see growing interest from new investors wanting to join the market.</p>
<p>As Elon Musk says, “I could either watch it happen, or be part of it”. I chose the latter. </p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>I’d describe it as responsible freedom. The flexible work-from-home policy allows me to work from many locations, provided that expectations are met. This flexibility offers a great work-life balance.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a shared sense among the team that the industry is on the verge of taking off. While the exact timing remains uncertain, we are confident that it will inevitably happen.</p>
<p>Regarding Tokeny, a company is always about its people. In that regard, everyone at Tokeny is super awesome. We know how to have fun, connect, enjoy, share, learn, be there for one another, and share a good meme on the #random channel.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>It’s hard to find the thing I’m most passionate about. I can think of traveling, exploring cultures, writing, skiing, hiking, horse riding, creating things through code, enjoying food, music, spending time with family, and being there for my sisters, trips with friends.</p>
<p>But if I were to choose one, I’d say I’m most passionate about connecting with people. I live for interesting, deep conversations. When someone shares with me a bit of themselves they’d usually keep hidden or a strange, unique way to think about something, I honor it and feel connected.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream has always fluctuated over time. At some point, it used to be about money. I wanted to be as rich as not to have to work anymore and do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I see it differently. I mean, money will always be important, but my ultimate dream is to be constantly at peace with myself and aware enough to be in alignment with what is true to me the most I can.</p>
<p>On my deathbed, I want to look back and know that it wasn’t the external things that moved me, but the internal things, the really important ones.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>I’d say working from home is always a challenge. I’d advise creating an environment where you can both focus, and disconnect to take breaks. It’s funny how sometimes the most productive moments come after a long, nice break when you can look at the code with different eyes.</p>
<p>Let yourself be taken through the ride and try to develop consistency in your pace of work. Everyone is there to help you, so count on anyone; they all want to see you succeed.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>It excites me to work on something different from the usual corporate environment, within a small team, with significant upside potential, and contributing to beneficial technological progress for people.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Graham Williamson</a></p>Efficient, effective management of access controls from infrastructure to applications remains an aspiration for enterprises. The main drivers of this goal include the need for strengthening the cybersecurity posture, efficiency gains in managing access controls, the need for consistency in access controls across multiple solutions and layers, and regulatory compliance. Most organizations today struggle with a mixture of point solutions for managing access controls, many of these relying on static entitlements causing massive work and tending to become inaccurate. A consistent, policy-based solution for managing access controls ensures that the right people have the right access, at the right time, from the right place.

This Leadership Compass features vendors offering policy-based access control solutions and provides guidance on aligning a vendor’s solution to common corporate access control requirements.

				 <p>The Biden administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a change to drop overdraft fees to as low as $3. The average fee for overdrafts is over $26.</p>



<p>Why this matters: Financial institution’s bottom lines will be greatly affected. We are talking about the nation’s largest banks losing roughly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/overdraft-junk-fees-banking-biden-jpmorgan-cb8b19687264c0eed757d84911b44303">$8 billion.</a></p>



<p>Who does this affect: Only “very large” banks, savings associations, and credit unions with assets of $10 billion or more will be affected.</p>



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">CFPB</a>) found that applying these rules to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more covers:</p>



 
 80% of consumer deposits 



 68% of overdraft charges 
 



<p>While smaller FIs won’t be directly affected by this rule, it is crucial to stay vigilant to changes in the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reactions:</p>



 
 The banking industry is gearing up to fight back with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/banking-overdraft-junk-fees-cfpb-jpmorgan-3842af05c0197cba396a9552eb4b099c">multimillion-dollar marketing</a> and lobbying campaign. 



 Banks will need to start implementing new products or campaigns to make up for the revenue loss such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/cyber-safety/">cyber safety</a>, secure ID verification, safe browsing, and other privacy tools. (We’ll cover more on that below 👀) 
 



 Dive Deeper 



<p>The financial landscape is on the brink of change. The new rules will reshape revenue streams for banks and credit unions.</p>



<p>Overdraft lending: “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule”</p>



<p>The “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule” is part of an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">executive order</a> that “Established a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.” This order’s initiatives create change across multiple industries, including health care, finance, technology, and more.</p>



<p>The Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule:</p>



 
 Was presented by The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 



 Wants FIs to use overdraft fees to break even by either:  FIs calculate their own costs and losses using standards outlined in the proposal.  
 
 Using the benchmark overdraft fees of $3, $6, $7, or $14. 
 
 



 Only applies to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more. 



 Change Regulation Z to expand on the definition of open-end credit: “plan” and “finance charge.” 
 



<p><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">👀 You can read the full document from the CFPB here.</a></p>



<p>Other changes for the financial space from the executive order have included:</p>



 
 <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Assessing-the-Impact-of-New-Entrant-Nonbank-Firms.pdf">The U.S. Department of the Treasury submitted a report</a> to the White House Council to show that fintech needs more regulations.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/">The CFPB proposed a new rule to lower credit card late fees.</a> 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/why-were-modernizing-how-we-collect-credit-card-data/">The CFPB is making credit card comparison more accessible.</a> 
 



<p>For all banks and credit unions, these new rules can have significant impact. The CFPB is setting new standards in the FI industry, which consumers will come to expect from all FIs, no matter the size.</p>



 The Overdraft Fee Changes: Making New Revenue Streams 



<p>The proposed regulations can significantly reduce overdraft fee revenue, prompting banks and credit unions to seek alternative revenue sources. While this presents a challenge, it also creates opportunities for proactive innovation and the maintenance of financial well-being.</p>



 Privacy Tools as Revenue Generators: A Win-Win Strategy 



<p>Privacy tools are a great way to start a new revenue stream. By charging a small monthly subscription fee, you will keep your customers safe from fraud and foster customer loyalty.</p>



<p>Here is the suite of privacy tools you could offer your customers:</p>







 Cyber Safety Tools: 



 
 Password Manager: Offer customers a secure way to manage and store passwords, ensuring enhanced cybersecurity. 



 Virtual Private Network (VPN): Provide a VPN service for safe and private online activities. 



 Virtual Cards: Introduce virtual card solutions for secure online transactions, reducing the risk of fraud. 
 







 Secure ID Verification: 



 
 Secure Communications: Enable encrypted communication channels, increasing customer trust in sensitive interactions. 



 Encrypted Voice, Video, Email, and Messaging: Ensure end-to-end encryption for various communication channels, safeguarding customer privacy. 
 







 Safe Browsing: 



 
 Private Browser: Introduce a <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/4-reasons-safe-browsing-and-vpn-combined-can-boost-revenue/">private browsing</a> experience to protect users from tracking and potential cyber threats. 



 Ad &amp; Tracker Blocker and Site Reputation Service: Enhance online safety with tools to block ads, trackers, and assess website reputations.

 The Path Forward: Embracing Innovation 



<p>As FIs face a shifting financial landscape, embracing innovation is necessary for success. Integrating privacy products not only addresses revenue concerns but positions banks and credit unions as committed to customer security and satisfaction.</p>

<p>Back in March of 1950, the FBI added Willie “The Actor” Sutton to their list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. During his tenure as an American bank robber, Sutton stole an estimated $2 million ($25 million in today’s dollars) and was known for using disguises. Police officer, maintenance worker, postal carrier, and telegraph messenger were a few of the roles the fraudster assumed to execute his heists.</p>
<p>When asked why he robbed banks, he replied, “because that’s where the money is.”</p>
<p>For a modern Willie Sutton, real estate seller impersonation might be considered the latest fraud method of choice. Fraudsters are focusing on compromising the identity of property owners to sell real estate they do not own. Their goal is to collect the funds a buyer intends to use for purchasing the property before other transaction participants realize the fraudster is not the legal owner.</p>
<p>Imagine owning a piece of land where you haven’t built anything yet, and one day as you drive past it you discover that there is a construction site on it. As you finally get to speak with the person in charge of the construction, you hear them claiming they rightfully own the land, with a perfectly valid deed of sale as proof.</p>
<p>How is this even possible in 2024, you may wonder? It’s simple: With the explosion of online business transactions over the last five years, technology has made it easy to buy and sell remotely – but not necessarily easy to do it securely.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for a bad actor to find leaked data online, and to spot weak identity verification methods in a remote real estate sales process. Personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to real estate owners, loan applicants, sellers, and real estate agents is valuable to bad actors looking to commit seller impersonation fraud.</p>
<p>Seller impersonation fraud follows a specific methodology, and understanding the nuances is critical in safeguarding your organization. Our latest white paper provides more details about how it happens, the challenges it creates, and best practices you can put in place to prevent these risks without negatively impacting your sales processes.</p>

<p>Biometric spoofing, also known as biometric spoof attacks or biometric presentation attacks, refers to the manipulation or falsification of biometric data to deceive a biometric authentication system.</p>
 What Is Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Biometric spoofing refers to deceptive <a>biometric authentication</a> attempts by presenting fake samples related to fingerprints, facial scans, or iris scans–a “presentation attack.” While <a>biometric identification</a> methods are significantly stronger than password-based systems, this does not make them invulnerable. Modern threats are evolving to bypass such protections. As such, many strong authentication requirements in compliance and regulatory standards require some form of liveness detection that can determine if the credentials presented are real.</p>
<p>In general, liveness detection methods can be classified as active or passive:</p>
 
 Active methods require user interaction, such as performing a specific action. For example, an active detection method might require the user to undertake some action, like smiling or speaking. 
 Passive methods work in the background without the user’s awareness. This method requires no direct interaction with the user. 
 
<p>Broadly speaking, active methods are typically harder to spoof but require more engagement with the user, which can impact usability. Passive methods are smoother and seamless but present more opportunities for fraud.</p>
 What Are Some Types of Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Because different forms of biometric spoofing align with various forms of authentication, each attempt to address the specific weaknesses and opportunities of those methods.<br>
As such, presentation attacks can target various biometric modalities, including:</p>
 Facial Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Attackers may use different techniques to deceive facial recognition systems. Some of the common methods include:</p>
 
 Print Attack: The attack uses a printed photograph of the target person’s face to trick the <a>facial recognition system</a>. This is one of the simplest methods and can be effective against less sophisticated systems (most of which need to be deployed in a context where they would protect important information). 
 Replay Attack: Hackers record a video of the target person’s face and play it back in front of the camera. This approach is often more successful than a print attack since it incorporates motion, which some facial recognition systems may require. 
 3D Mask Attack: The attacker creates a realistic 3D mask of the target person’s face and wears it during authentication. This method can be more challenging to detect, but it’s equally challenging to do effectively without specific skills and equipment. 
 Deep Fake Attack: An attack uses a machine learning/AI program to create a video of the target’s face. Deepfake technology can create convincing facial movements and expressions, making it difficult for some facial recognition systems to differentiate between real and fake. 
 
<p>Facial recognition liveness detection techniques can include analyzing facial movements like blinking or verifying 3D depth information. Additionally, while there isn’t a consensus on how accurate deep fakes are, new technology from Intel can look for artifacts that signal that a video is artificial–rendering deep fakes relatively niche.</p>
 Fingerprint Spoofing Recognition Attacks 
<p><a>Fingerprint verification</a> systems, while generally secure, can still be vulnerable to spoofing if appropriate countermeasures are not in place. Some of the common fingerprint spoofing methods include:</p>
 
 Fake Fingerprints: Hackers create artificial fingerprints using materials like gelatin that replicate the target user’s fingerprint pattern, often taken directly from a fingerprint. The fake fingerprint can then be placed over the attacker’s finger or a dummy finger to deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 Latent Fingerprints: An attacker lifts a target user’s latent fingerprint from a surface using adhesive tape or other methods and then transfers it onto a material that can deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 3D-Printed Fingerprints: A sophisticated attack that involves someone creating a 3D model of the target user’s fingerprint using digital techniques and then 3D printing it with materials that mimic human skin properties. This method can create realistic replicas that can deceive some fingerprint scanners. 
 
<p>Countermeasures against these attacks include measuring finger skin temperature, moisture, or electrical properties to ensure the presented fingerprint comes from a live person.</p>
 Iris Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>While iris recognition is generally considered to be a highly secure biometric modality, it can still be vulnerable to spoofing attacks if appropriate countermeasures are not in place.<br>
Some of the common iris presentation attacks include:</p>
 
 Digital Iris Images: Displaying a digital image or video of the target user’s iris on a device screen, such as a smartphone or tablet, and presenting it to the iris scanner. This method can use different lighting and sharpness settings on devices to fool some biometric scanners. 
 Artificial Eyes or Contact Lenses: Creating an artificial eye or a custom contact lens with the target user’s iris pattern imprinted. These can be harder to detect if the contacts are created well. 
 Physical Eyes: Although a rare and extreme method, using a preserved cadaver eye with the target user’s iris pattern can also deceive the iris recognition system. It would require someone to steal the eye of a dead subject and use it relatively quickly to be effective, which may be its form of deterrence. 
 
<p>To defend against iris presentation attacks, defenders may use techniques like examining the natural movement and contraction of the iris, verifying light reflection patterns, or analyzing the unique texture of the iris surface.</p>
 How Is Liveness Detection Used in Identity Assurance Level (IAL) Verification? 
<p>Identity Assurance Level (IAL) is a classification system used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/verification/">Special Publication 800-63-3</a>, “Digital Identity Guidelines” to categorize the level of confidence in an individual’s asserted identity. These standards are often used to add layers of identity verification to processes involving sensitive government systems or classified data.</p>
<p>IAL2 is an intermediate level of assurance, the second of three levels. At IAL2, an individual’s identity must be verified through remote or in-person proofing processes, which involve validating and verifying identity information against trusted records and sources. Liveness detection plays a role in IAL2 by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of biometric data collected during the identity-proofing process.</p>
 Combating Biometric Spoofing with 1Kosmos 
<p>Biometrics can improve security by replacing passwords, but they can be subject to theft, spoofing, and decision bias. As discussed, bad actors are implementing approaches to bypass biometric assurances with increasing success.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos platform performs a series of checks to prevent biometric-based attacks. For instance, 1Kosmos LiveID can perform both “active” liveness (requiring the user to perform randomized expressions) and “passive” liveness, one without the user’s involvement. Additionally, 1Kosmos utilizes true-depth camera functionality to prevent presentation attacks and offers an SDK to protect against camera manipulation to prevent an injection attack. Alongside these advances, 1Kosmos BlockID also offers the following features:</p>
 
 Anti-Spoofing Algorithms:&nbsp;1Kosmos anti-spoofing algorithms detect and differentiate between genuine biometric data and spoofed data. Our algorithms analyze factors like texture, temperature, color, and movement to determine the authenticity of the biometric sample, catching virtual/hardware camera and JavaScript injections and ensuring the validity of the transmitted identity. 
 Data Encryption:&nbsp;1Kosmos ensures that biometric data is encrypted both during transmission and storage to prevent unauthorized access. Implementing strict access controls and encryption protocols prevents man-in-the-middle and protocol injections, ensuring the validity of the transmitted identity. 
 Regular Audits and Penetration Testing:&nbsp;1Kosmos conducts regular audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities, including access to a user’s biometric data. This helps ensure that security measures are effective and up to date.

To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF77 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Bug fix in reward calculation  5.1 Overview <p>Some Data Farmers were underpaid in the last few rounds. They’ve now been compensated the difference. The rest of this section elaborates.</p> 5.2 The&nbsp;Issue <p>In early February 2024, we identified an issue affecting DF reward calculation. The part of code that limits reward based on DCV (data consume volume) was supposed to limit in units of OCEAN. However it limited in units of USD. This led to Volume DF rewards being lower than intended, starting in DF63 (start of Predictoor DF). There were 69 wallets affected, with a total of 64,501 OCEAN less than it should have&nbsp;been.</p> 5.3 Solution in&nbsp;Code <p>As soon as we discovered the issue, we fixed it by limiting using the correct units (OCEAN, not USD). Then we took steps to reimburse; see next&nbsp;section.</p> 5.4 Reimbursement <p>We always strive to do the right thing. Trust is of utmost importance to us.In this case, that means: ensuring that every DF participant receives the DF rewards they&nbsp;earned.</p><p>We carefully calculated the missed amounts for each affected wallet. Section 5.5 lists each affected wallet, and the amount of OCEAN that was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>We are pleased to announce that these reimbursements have been processed and are now available for claiming. Participants affected by this issue can claim their reimbursement in the same manner as they would typically claim their DF rewards via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>.</p> 5.5 OCEAN Reimbursed, per&nbsp;Wallet  +--------------------------------------------+-----------------+<br>| Address

 Stakers can claim DF75 rewards. DF76 runs Feb 8— Feb 15,&nbsp;2024 <p>[Note: this article was meant to be published on Feb 8,&nbsp;2024].</p> 1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 75 (DF75) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Feb 1, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 8. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF76 is live as of Feb 8, 2024. It concludes on Feb 15. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF76   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF76 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%.

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In Blogs 1–3 of this series we have been exploring the conceptual aspects of an alternative monetary system. In this final blog, we would like to shift gear and channel our thinking into a series of practical next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;four:</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? (B<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">log&nbsp;2</a>)  What could a desirable future scenario actually look like? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-951ca09dd76d">Blog&nbsp;3</a>)  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel&nbsp;system?  <p>Whilst writing this post, we began to feel a niggling sense of doubt. Something about it felt quite anticlimactic. In this initiative we started with a bold vision underpinned by some detailed research of the problem space. Now, as is so often the case we are grappling with the details of how to make things happen on the ground. In the messy reality of managing relationships, roles, time constraints and funding pressures, our suggestions for a way forward seem insubstantial. Rather than trying to pad them out or use technical language to shield the lack of clarity, we have decided to go ahead and share where we actually are, both in our thinking and in our aspiration for this&nbsp;work.</p> Questions we need to begin working&nbsp;on <p>We are publishing this Blog at an early stage of our thinking. At this point our ambitions far outweigh our intellectual ability and team capacity. This is overwhelming, exciting and humbling! To break through this paralysis we are sharing some open questions based on our initial internal brainstorming sessions and responses to the previous blogs (credited below). If you have reflections or questions of your own then then we would really welcome comments:</p>  What would a low tech, minimum viable proof of possibility look&nbsp;like?  How can we use existing technology meaningfully in different contexts (for example a rural area in the Global&nbsp;South)?¹  How can we account for different closed loop systems in their own rights without going down the data rabbit&nbsp;hole?  Can we build on the energy and intelligence of the Geospatial Community to leverage data in a richly contextual yet feasible&nbsp;format?²  How can we ensure that the idea of a Bioregion doesn’t perpetuate a fractured worldview?  How do we decide which cycles or measurements are the most important for a&nbsp;region?  What are we pegging a system’s health against? How can we estimate what the optimal regenerative potential might&nbsp;be?  What can people do with the individual tokens that they receive? Why would anyone want to take part in a&nbsp;project?  How will the main RegenCoins be exchanged both within and outside of the&nbsp;region?  What can we learn from previous attempts to implement local currencies such as those pioneered by the Transition Town Network?³  How can we make sure that the ability for different people to earn tokens is fair? For example, if somebody lives close to a river it might be easier to demonstrate acts of care than for somebody who lives further&nbsp;away.   Existing technology, tools and research that we can build&nbsp;on <p>We are both sure (and hugely relieved) that we are far from the first people to explore this subject. Many of the ideas outlined in the previous blogs have been inspired by the work of others, and we will continue to learn and incorporate as many diverse perspectives as possible. As we move towards our first prototype we have identified a number of initiatives that we think will provide invaluable insights:</p>  Using market based credit platforms as a basis for quantifying living systems: the level of data being collected is already significant. For example the<a href="https://seed-index.com/"> Seed Biocomplexity Index</a> has been developed to link geospatial satellite data with scientific literature. Another example is the <a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> which describes itself as ‘a platform to originate and invest in high-integrity carbon and biodiversity credits from ecological regeneration projects’. Although we are categorically not looking to price elements of the bioregion, the research underpinning some of the Network’s projects (e.g. pollinator health) could be a powerful learning framework. We are also interested to learn from less established initiatives such as land trust tokens being linked to river basin resilience programmes in South&nbsp;Africa¹.  Taxes pegged to positive activities: we hope to learn from proposals for tax incentive schemes that are specifically designed to encourage stewardship activities. An example is the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4524897">Malta Atlantica Restoration Currency</a> that is being proposed in&nbsp;Brazil.  Universal basic income / services pilots: there are a number of live and closed UBI/S pilots that we are intrigued to learn from. Of particular interest is to try to understand how people’s behaviour and perception of value is affected, when the link between monetary transactions and daily activities is less&nbsp;linear.³  Statistical forecasting models used in decision making: there is an exciting body of research emerging in the context of applying <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1128055/full">Bayesian forecasting techniques to environmental modelling</a>. We are imagining that this might link closely to crypto economic research currently being conducted at hubs such as WU Vienna and ETH Zurich⁴. Partnering with an academic centre to bring their research into our prototype will be a priority.  Relational, flow based technology: the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/">Holochain Community</a> has developed a number of different peer-to-peer tools and resources that have strong value alignment with this proposal. In particular, the <a href="https://hrea.io/">hREA value flows specification</a> could provide a scaffold to connect the different activities that we would like to&nbsp;explore.  Currency and token design: community experts such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/artbrock/">Arthur Brock</a> and <a href="https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/">Grace Rachmany</a> have deep knowledge and experience with alternative currency design. We would aim to consult and build on this expertise rather than trying to reinvent the&nbsp;wheel.  Thrutopia storytelling: the novelist and podcast host Manda Scott describes <a href="https://thrutopia.life/">Thrutopias</a> as ‘clear, engaging routes through to a world we’d all be proud to bequeath to future generations’. As we strive to test pathways in the present, we do not want to lose touch with the imaginative potential that we started to engage with in Blog 3. Prominent authors such as Kim Stanley Robinson⁵ and Yanis Varoufakis⁶ have explored ideas such as a carbon coin and free PerCap accounts within sci-fi narratives, and we will seek to engage with emerging writing in this&nbsp;field.⁷   A prototype proposition <p>As an initial call to action, we would like to partner with a community (or a number of communities) to build the foundations for the world’s first decentralised, bioregional bank. To make the project realistic we imagine that the areas involved will need to be small enough to make the data capture manageable. However they will also need to represent a number of different biophysical and social cycles to ensure a meaningful entangled value interaction is captured. It will also be important to engage with a supportive governance and legal environment for some stages of the work, to ground the prototype in the reality of the existing&nbsp;system.</p><p>We would invite interested communities and collaborators to self-select as high levels of trust and value alignment will be fundamental pillars of success. We will therefore be circulating these blogs and having conversations with a number of potential demonstrator locations. It feels important to clearly state that we do not have the financial resources at this point to pay people for their help. This is difficult and at times feels uncomfortable; the fear is that we may unwittingly perpetuate extractive behaviour in the pursuit of a regenerative goal. We are trying to balance our commitment to push this thinking forward, with a deep sense of respect for our ecosystem and will continually review the relationship between the two for signs of&nbsp;stress.</p>Credit: Eunji Kang, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs<p>The prototype will be designed as 6 interlinked stages:</p>  Value mapping: here we will select a number of elements to visualise. The mix will depend on the location but could include a combination of air and water quality, soil health, biodiversity resilience, equity, care and trust. The mapping is likely to combine geospatial data with interviews, surveys and participatory workshops.  Real time sensory data gathering: based on the value mapping we will investigate the best ways of capturing the relational flows that define our selected elements. For some flows, sensors will already be in place whilst for others the process will be participatory.  Multivalent currency design and use: once we have an understanding of how value is being both created and eroded in our ecosystem, we will attempt to design self-regulating currencies to represent these multivalent flows.  Building a probabilistic model based on data inputs: this stage will combine the data and knowledge gained to simulate how the different elements are impacting on each other. The model will be interactive and infer each forecast from an updated understanding of the underlying systems.  Linking the model to governance decisions: this phase will focus on the interaction between the living agents and the value simulation. It will involve using the model to process multiple data inputs to inform a number of decisions. The outputs will be tested with the community to assess how accurately their views and values are being represented.  Creating a feedback loop between decisions and currency levels: as the system becomes more refined, the collective decisions can be used to adjust the currency levels of the base elements.  Grounding the results in regulatory or policy instruments: we will strive to link the multi-sensory decision making capabilities that have been co-developed with the community, to real world impacts. We hope that this might be achieved by testing a cross boundary tax payable in one (or a blend) of the new currencies. Another idea is to link the currencies to specific policy issues to elevate the agency and collective voice of the community. This second point has a strong link to the work that we have been prototyping in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16vmzzaTFMUUyiwkwqVedZRA1QxChJ2UD/view?usp=sharing">Sweden</a>, Scotland and Canada to create multi-sensory, living indicators.  <p>We don’t know the exact details of how the above will be achieved but we are confident that the collective knowledge and tools are already available. The steps need not be taken consecutively and we imagine that different elements can be worked on across multiple contexts and time frames. A big part of this journey will be connecting people, ideas and technologies to work towards this common goal.

<p>The new year is always a time for reflection, and after a year shaped by AI, biometrics, and nation-state attacks there’s a lot to think about. So where are we headed from here? A utopian episode of Star Trek or a more dystopian Terminator 10 movie? The future as they say is up to us and that means reshaping trust and security for the realities of our brave new world.</p>
<p>The intensifying geopolitical landscape characterized by nation-sponsored attacks has made cyber the new battleground. Employing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework">Zero Trust</a> principles is a best practice, but not a cybersecurity guarantee in an era of AI-enhanced phishing, zero-day brokers, and malware-as-a-service. Adopting a term from U.S. Cold War simulations, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-red-teaming.html">red teaming</a> is back in vogue. The red team is a pretend enemy that attempts to mount a cyberattack acting under the direction of the target organization. One such example comes from the <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/european-central-bank-to-put-banks-through-cyber-stress-test-a-24012?rf=2024-01-03_ENEWS_SUB_BIS__Slot1_ART24012&amp;mkt_tok=MDUxLVpYSS0yMzcAAAGQbvkmv4W-kSt1bPEzX98HJHUg04qWbpdOLJZTWjt_FPgrLy6XKsAky0jtvHG2DOrkVD9V66UM28zIenSQA8_0Smm1P_k2nVRNxCR3ykteB8xV6BBlHQ">European Central Bank</a>, which has started to conduct vulnerability assessments and incident response tests on banks to assess their cyber resilience. Whether simulated or real, all organizations should seek to turn cyber breaches into a blueprint for future security with actionable strategies to strengthen their cyber posture.</p>
<p>One particular area of cyber exposure is <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140/">critical infrastructure</a>, from the power grid to water treatment plants to public service providers and beyond. We live in an “everything is connected to everything” world, making critical infrastructure a vulnerable and attractive target to bad actors. In 2024, it’s long past time to get serious about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/iot-security">IoT</a> and Industrial IoT (IIoT) security. As well, AI-enabled biometric identity verification of employees, partners, and customers is increasingly essential to flushing out <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1251094/deepfakes-emerge-as-a-top-security-threat-ahead-of-the-2024-us-election.html">deepfakes</a> and keeping organizations and people safe.</p>
<p>There are also some encouraging signs that regulators around the globe are stepping up to the challenges ahead. Similar to data privacy, consumer protection, and digital identity legislation, Europe is on the vanguard once again with the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>. The White House has also issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> and the bipartisan <a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-kennedy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-provide-more-transparency-on-ai-generated-content">Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act</a> has been tabled. However, being that it’s an election year in the U.S., it’s likely that big tech will be left largely to self-regulate over the next 12 months. That said, the tech sector is stepping up, with seven technology behemoths including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft agreeing to adopt <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">AI safeguards</a> with the Biden administration. As well, ChatGPT maker and close Microsoft collaborator OpenAI has released its <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/openai-formulates-framework-to-mitigate-catastrophic-risks-a-23930">framework to mitigate catastrophic risks</a> like using generative AI to build biological weapons, spread malware, or carry out social engineering attacks. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been busy building out the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework </a> (AI RMF) in close collaboration with the private and public sector to continue to leverage the power of AI while mitigating the risk.</p>
<p>So, at the outset of 2024, I remain cautiously optimistic that the forces of good will prevail and it will be a utopian technology-fueled future.</p>

				  Save your organization valuable development time while building digital wallet functionality right into your existing applications.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>An organization’s digital app is often one of the most effective ways it engages customers. For example, the American Bankers Association found that <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/consumer-survey-banking-methods-2023#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20Generation,prefer%20to%20visit%20a%20branch.">48% of bank customers</a> prefer mobile apps as their method of choice for managing their finances.</p>
<p>Given this, you want to make sure of two things: One, that it offers easy-to-use features, and two,&nbsp; that your customers stay on your app spending their time and money with you rather than going elsewhere.</p>
<p>Indicio designed the Proven Mobile SDK specifically to help you do both of these things.</p>
<p>Faster App Feature Deployment</p>
<p>App design and construction is not a simple process: for applications with multiple features, most sources say the average development time is <a href="https://spdload.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop-an-app/">nine months or longer.</a> With this much time and money at stake, adding new features that require complex code changes is daunting, and it can be tempting to simply add on a third party application to achieve the required functionality.</p>
<p>But relying on a third party to handle features means sending your customers to that third party, reducing their time spent on your platform, and — crucially — losing control of their customer experience. For example, if you run a business and the only way to purchase something on your website is a third-party payment platform that is constantly buggy, the experience will be tied to using your website and risk losing you customers. People do not reward complexity and hassle online.</p>
<p>This is where the Proven Mobile SDK comes in. It helps you build digital wallet functionality directly into your existing application without your team having to reinvent the wheel. Built with packages for Swift, Kotlin, and React Native, your developers can add decentralized identity to your applications without the time commitment of learning new programming languages or practices.</p>
<p>But what functionality and features does the SDK add to your application that will enhance the customer experience?</p>
<p>Faster interactions through pre-verified data</p>
<p>Full digital wallet functionality allows you to hold and share verifiable data and identity information inside a digital credential —&nbsp;a “verifiable” credential. With verifiable credentials you can be cryptographically confident in who you’re interacting with online. Unlike passwords, verifiable credentials automatically share who issued them and who is presenting them in a provable way, as well as whether any information has been altered since being created, making them impossible to copy or steal.</p>
<p>Because these credentials can prove who you are on their own, they remove the need for the customer to jump through hoops when accessing their account, such as passwords, MFA, security keys, and more, letting customers move right on to what they came for.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Mobile SDK in action:</p>
<p>One powerful use case for verifiable credentials is Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. A financial institution can do its full customer vetting for account creation, a business loan, or mortgage and issue them a credential containing the relevant information. This means that the customer can share that information in a way that is provable,&nbsp; removing the need to repeat the expensive KYC process.</p>
<p>Schools can <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-revolutionizes-adoption-of-open-badges/">issue credential-based diplomas</a> that allow students to share them without the need to reach back out to the school for verification; businesses can use them for both <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven-works-verifiable-credentials-for-frictionless-secure-employee-identification/">employee access management</a> and customer loyalty programs; countries can allow their citizens to share their resident status for all kinds of things from <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">travel</a> to paying bills to <a href="https://indicio.tech/digital-identity-and-the-public-sector-using-verifiable-credentials-to-manage-social-security/">proving residency</a>.</p>
<p>In short, once you’ve met your initial identity assurance requirements, verifiable credentials can eliminate redundant paperwork and data input, and provide a simpler, streamlined, better customer experience.</p>
<p>And the Proven Mobile SDK provides all the pieces you need. In a fraction of the time. On any application. In whatever language your team is familiar with.</p>

 What is Customer Authentication? 



<p>Customer authentication is a critical security process that identifies and verifies users before allowing them access to digital accounts. It’s built on login credentials established during user onboarding, utilizing a blend of knowledge-based (passwords), possession-based (security tokens), and inherence-based (biometrics) authenticators. The adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become standard practice, requiring users to provide multiple identity proofs to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.</p>



<p>This security measure is essential for protecting against common threats like account takeover attacks by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Despite the prevalence of password-based systems, their effectiveness is compromised by common security pitfalls, such as the reuse of passwords. Therefore, more advanced authentication methods, including MFA and adaptive authentication, are increasingly important. These methods assess risk levels and adjust security measures dynamically, improving the security posture without compromising user experience. New technologies like FIDO2 passkeys and biometric authentication pave the way toward more secure, passwordless authentication methods, emphasizing ease of use and improved security.</p>



<p>Customer authentication is a crucial building block gatekeeper for user data and access in digital security. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, customer authentication methods have also undergone significant advancements, aiming to strike a balance between robust security and user-friendliness. This balance helps to ensure that authorized users can easily access the digital world while maintaining the highest level of security measures to protect sensitive information.</p>

 System to achieve full compliance of Crypto Asset Service Providers and self-hosted wallets with AML regulations and the Transfer of Funds Regulation&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, February 13, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, joins a consortium of five partners including the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the goal of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new TFR regulation in the EU mandates that all cryptocurrency transactions will need to carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver. According to the new rule, compliance with TFR is mandatory for all CASPs. Additionally, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0420">new AML Regulation</a> will require all CASPs to comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. For example, when a user opens an account and registers a wallet with a CASP, an identification process is required to comply with the new AML Regulation and TFR.</p>



<p>One challenge for CASPs to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>Raising trust and transparency in crypto asset transactions</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the partners have formed a consortium to propose a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process it has witnessed, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII. The resulting soul-bound token (SBT) can be used for blockchain processes, enabling web3 native interactions. Furthermore, the trusted party can reveal the identity information, if requested by an authorized party, such as law enforcement, as well as revoke the SBT, if needed.</p>



<p>Within the consortium, the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit foundation supporting the development of the IOTA protocol, will provide the underlying network as the proposed solution will be implemented on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. walt.id, a leading open source vendor of decentralized identity and wallet infrastructure, will develop, provide, and maintain the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs like identity proofs, while IDnow will deliver the identity verification solution to onboard users into the wallet solution. Bloom, an all-in-one wallet for the IOTA, Shimmer and EVM ecosystem, will provide the capabilities for users to store, present and prove ownership of the SBT. SPYCE.5, specializing in the integration of hybrid blockchain technologies, will provide the essential infrastructure for seamless interchain communication and transaction validation, ensuring the system’s overall efficiency and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Statements</p>



<p>“We are excited to be part of this forward-thinking consortium alongside highly esteemed crypto asset industry players to address a pressing need for crypto wallet solutions that comply with the latest EU regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto companies</a> are facing a race against the clock to implement new requirements, which is why we wish to submit this proposed solution to the EU for consideration to address the technological and regulatory challenges around AML, KYC and TFR in crypto,” says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be working with such incredible partners to create a truly seamless user experience and to provide the underlying distributed ledger technology. Identity verification in Web3 environments should be simple and straightforward, without sacrificing privacy or security. As regulatory requirements grow, we need innovative solutions that are easy to use for both businesses and everyday users,” says Dominik Schiener, Chairman of the Board of the IOTA Foundation.</p>



<p>“We have been building decentralized identity and wallet solutions for many clients across various industries, but this project is particularly interesting as it shows new ways of onboarding and verifying users for crypto and DeFi use cases that have traditionally been struggling with regulatory compliance,” says Dominik Beron, Founder of walt.id.</p>



<p>“Bloom is excited to be collaborating with the partners in this consortium. This project will ensure our users and the crypto ecosystem can benefit from a self-hosted wallet that complies with EU regulations,” says Nicole O’Brien, Co-founder of Bloom Labs.</p>



<p>“We’re proud to be part of this groundbreaking consortium, leveraging SPYCE.5’s hybrid chain architecture to navigate the complex landscape of EU regulations. Our innovative approach ensures not only compliance but also maintains the integrity and efficiency vital in the crypto space,” says Holger Köther, Managing Director of SPYCE.5.</p>

This Trust would gather individuals health data from many different sources (e.g. NHS Trusts, GPs, care services, pharmacists), assemble it in one place and sell it to Big Tech firms in the private&nbsp;sector.</p> How to build a bandwagon <p>Bandwagons wreak untold damage by following these basic four&nbsp;steps:</p><p>1) Admit there’s a problem with something you’ve been stubbornly ignoring for years. The NHS tells us that its new Federated Data Platform is needed because, historically, data was “held in different systems that didn’t speak to each other, creating burdens for staff and delays to patient care” and making it “difficult to work at scale and share information”. People (including us at Mydex) have been complaining about this for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>2) Wax lyrical about all the benefits that would flow if this problem was addressed. The NHS promises that improved data sharing will “bring big benefits for patients by ensuring more joined up care, greater choice and improved health outcomes”.</p><p>The Times <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24398476/times-health-commission_report_2024.pdf">Health Commission</a>, whose work is the subject of its front page article, tells us that by enabling patients to “have their health information digitally stored in one place any doctor treating them can access their records no matter where they are”. Patients would gain access to their own medical records, and be able to use the system as a gateway to book appointments, order prescriptions, view test results and contact&nbsp;doctors.</p><p>What’s not to like? We at Mydex CIC have been banging on about exactly these things for many years&nbsp;now.</p> Bait and&nbsp;switch <p>Then comes the crucial third step. 3) Propose a solution which seems to solve the problem but which doesn’t — which delivers an entirely different outcome instead. This is the crucial bait and switch; the secret sauce of every successful bandwagon.</p><p>The fourth step then follows so smoothly it’s almost automatic. 4) Use the excitement and enthusiasm generated for the benefits you are promising to implement the bait-and-switch solution — to deliver an entirely different outcome.</p><p>The likely end result in this case&nbsp;is:</p>  Huge amounts of available time, effort, energy and resources squandered on white elephant IT projects that never delivers their&nbsp;promise.  A raft of other ‘unintended’ consequences, such as handing over one of the country’s — and your — most valuable assets to big US tech monopolies.  <p>The trick with all such bandwagons is to exploit peoples’ best intentions — to harness their enthusiasm, commitment and energy — and to use this enthusiasm and energy for your own purposes, leaving them to suffer the consequences and clear up the&nbsp;mess.</p><p>In this case, it is absolutely right and necessary that available data is shared to generate more efficient joined up, seamless services that deliver better outcomes. But the solutions being proposed will do the exact opposite. Instead, they will neatly assemble our personal data into juicy packages and deliver them on a plate, ready and waiting for Big Tech vultures to&nbsp;pounce.</p> Real and pretend solutions <p>There are basically two different ways to share data: the centralised organisation-centric way, and the distributed, decentralised person-centric way.</p><p>This bandwagon is all about promising the benefits of the person-centric approach while delivering its opposite: recreating, deepening and extending the centralised approach that caused all of our current problems in the first place — only this time, at a higher, bigger&nbsp;level.</p><p>The organisation-centric centralised solution to the problem of data sharing has the following characteristics.</p>  It requires the Government to create vast new IT projects, which hand over hundreds of millions of pounds over to big US tech firms (such as Palantir). Such projects somehow never actually deliver what they were supposed to deliver, but always take far longer to complete and cost far more than their original projections.  It compounds rather than simplifies or eliminates the critical data logistics issues of how to move data from one provider to another (or provide access to this data) while a) ensuring its reliability and b) protecting the privacy of the individuals the data relates&nbsp;to.  It compounds rather than reduces the complexities and risks of managing consents, permissions and GDPR compliance, especially across borders. Proponents of these solutions always make a big point about patients being ‘in control’. But in reality, what they mean by this is that people will be bombarded with requests for permissions to access their data using processes that are both annoying and wide open to gaming — like the cookie pop-ups that plague our use of websites today. Meanwhile, they are disturbingly vague about who, exactly, would be able to access this data. (What do they mean, for example, by the word ‘researchers’?)  It limits the data that can be collected. As The Times Health Commission points out, one key problem with the current NHS Federated Data Platform is that it does not include GP or social care data, so even when it is implemented services will still not be properly integrated. The Health Commission therefore wants to go further, integrating data from GPs, NHS hospitals, pharmacies and social&nbsp;care.  <p>But even then, if your real goal is to address a person’s health, you would still be falling short. According to WHO, 60% of health outcomes are determined largely or mainly by lifestyle issues — data which health services do not collect. Which means that even if the Health Commission solution was implemented, many of its promises could never be realised.</p><p>But never mind. The bandwagoneers have an even better answer. In their proposals for the creation of an NHS Data Trust, Tony Blair and William Hague recognise this, talking of the need to integrate data about individuals’ “lifestyle, genetics, personality and physiology”, all of which could go into the individual’s ‘personal health account’&nbsp;… and put up for sale to private sector ‘researchers’ for the purposes of ‘commercialisation’!</p><p>What started out as a promise of citizen empowerment and seamless service provision somehow ends up as a Big Brother agenda for Big&nbsp;Tech.</p>  It limits the uses to which this data can be put. The biggest opportunity for improvement in health services today is not access to medical records per se but the organisation, coordination, planning, handovers and administration of all the activities that surround them. It’s about the ability to access and share exactly the right data at the right times. That requires a modular approach to data management, capable of instant and endless configuration and reconfiguration, that these centralised systems can never&nbsp;deliver.   Making real progress&nbsp;possible <p>Empowering citizens with their own data is the alternative approach to the problems the bandwagoneers are now claiming to address. Under this decentralised approach (which Mydex has been building for decades, and which is now live and operational) individuals are equipped with tools to collect all the data they need to manage their lives in their own database. This database remains directly under their control, in systems that work independently of the systems used by organisations that hold data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>These organisations deposit copies of key data in the individual’s personal data store. Individuals can choose to selectively share relevant portions of this data to service providers they trust and want to deal&nbsp;with.</p><p>This approach avoids all the problems associated with the new centralised systems now being campaigned for by the bandwagoneers.</p>  Far from requiring vast, expensive, time consuming new and risky IT contracts, the infrastructure already exists and can be implemented incrementally on a very low cost, case-by-case, test-and-learn basis.  It simplifies data logistics issues because it is designed at heart to enable automated data sharing (via APIs that create safe links between key data points) directly under the individual’s control (like a direct&nbsp;debit).  It simplifies issues relating to consents and permissions via standardised data sharing agreements that make it clear what data is being shared, with who, for what purposes. It builds implementation of human rights into the day-to-day operations of service provision.  It expands the range of data that can be collected, to include lifestyle data and data from other sources such as data from individuals’ own wearable devices. The only people able to see all of this data are the individuals themselves — because all the data is encrypted and only they have the encryption key that provides access to it. But they can share relevant bits of it whenever they need&nbsp;to.  It can simply be plugged into existing systems and services directly impacting operational delivery of health and care services, helping to heal the multiple flaws of the current organisation-centric approach.   Conclusion <p>It’s good that at last the great and good are beginning to acknowledge that instead of simply hoarding data, to streamline processes, create seamless services and deliver better outcomes, this data needs to be shared. The central question in health today is not whether we should do this, but&nbsp;how.</p><p>Elsewhere in Government, some genuine progress is being made. For example, the new UK Identity and Attributes Trust Framework envisages equipping people with their very own Personal Holder Service (personal data store) by which they can collect, receive, store and share data about their lives, where and when they want. These Holder Services give citizens agency and control while enabling safe, efficient, fit-for-purpose data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>What’s needed is new citizen-empowering data infrastructure such as this — infrastructure that tackles data sharing challenges at their root. But this is not what the bandwagoneers are proposing. Instead, they are simply offering more of the same, only at a different, higher level. Our health services and citizens need and deserve much better than&nbsp;that.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/beware-a-new-data-bandwagon-is-rolling-5eebf8501a42">Beware!

 We sit down with the romance fraud vigilante-turned-author to discuss the responsibility she feels for victims, why social media platforms need to be held more accountable, and why she put a photo of Keanu Reeves on the cover of her book. 



 



<p>Despite having a popular Twitter account (114,000 followers and growing), with the sole purpose of exposing romance scammers, Becky Holmes says she still gets contacted by hopeful, hapless fraudsters. In fact, she was contacted just 15 minutes before our interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fortunately, a lot of them are not very observant, so I get to do what I do without too much recourse,” said Becky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Becky does is two-fold: She exposes the often-hilarious exchanges with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scammers</a>, some of whom claim to be celebrities, and, more recently, provides a forum in which people can share their experiences and learn more about this increasingly common form of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation is clearly needed. Romance scams rose by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-released-on-rise-in-romance-scams-as-valentines-day-looms">19% globally in 2023</a>. Considering only 58% of victims ever report the crime to law enforcement, that figure is likely to be much higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Becky has just released her debut book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Keanu-Reeves-Not-Love-You/dp/1789651638">‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’</a>, featuring first-hand accounts of victims, examples of scripts used by fraudsters, and a look into the psychology of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the book itself only took nine months to write, the aim of helping people and raising awareness of the dangers of social media fraud began when Becky first joined Twitter (now X) in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost immediately I got a flurry of messages from all these fabulously handsome men, and they were all immediately in love with me. They all said the same thing and were all from very similar looking men. Some were in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/army-romance-scam">army</a>, and some were in pilots’ uniforms, and it was very clear that there was a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At first, I was blocking and deleting them and having a bit of fun by seeing how nonsensical I could be before they picked up on what I was saying. I began posting the exchanges on Twitter a few months later, and people found them funny and were laughing and we were all having a good time. Then, in 2021, quite a few victims of romance fraud got in touch with me and said that they’d been a victim and had lost a large amount of money. That’s when it all changed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss the different ways in which romance scammers tend to target men and women, the delicate balance in presenting information in a relatable, digestible format that does not undermine the danger and impact, and much more.</p>



 What were the main reasons behind becoming a ‘romance scam vigilante’? Did you ever become a victim yourself [i.e. transfer funds, or ‘fall in love’]? 



<p>So, I’m fortunate enough to have never been the victim of romance fraud. However, I was in a very coercively controlled relationship at one point, and the parallels between what victims of romance fraud go through and victims of coercive control are very similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I ended up speaking on the phone with many victims and they said they hadn’t told anybody, and they didn’t know what to do. I hated the idea of people feeling lonely because I’ve been in that situation myself. So, I became kind of a sounding board for a few people and felt a responsibility.</p>



<p>Most had reported to Action Fraud but not heard anything back, so were in a very isolated place.&nbsp;I started realizing what a huge subject it was and how underreported it was, and it became like a passion project.</p>



<p>[Read more about the steps that the UK government is taking to address fraud, in our blog <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">‘UK declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>]</p>



 I see that many of the messages you share on Twitter are actual Twitter exchanges, in your personal experience, is this where romance fraud is most common? 



<p>No, I get messages on Instagram, on Twitter, and dating sites are, of course, rife with them. I’ve also heard about people receiving messages on TikTok, and bizarrely, if you play online games, romance fraudsters are lurking there too. Whatever platform it is, the one thing they immediately want to do is to take you to WhatsApp or Google Chat. I have a separate Google Chat account where I have these exchanges.</p>



 Romance scams target both men and women. Are there any differences in approaches? 



<p>Although I never view stats as&nbsp;wholly reliable, statistically, romance fraud targets men and women equally. I want to stress that not all women are approached with the promise of romance and men with the promise of sex, but more men do tend to be victims of sextortion. Sextortion is when you have exchanged intimate images with somebody, and that person then blackmails you. For example, a married man with kids or a high position at work will send images to someone [who is almost certainly not a Russian model], and the recipient will then reply and say that they’ve hacked into your Facebook and can now see your children’s Facebook accounts, and your colleagues’ accounts, and that’s when the requests for money start.</p>



 It’s the old adage, isn’t it, and, of course, there’s a danger of generalizing, but men are more led by what they see, and women by what they hear. 



<p>That’s right, although the example that I use in the book is of a lady who believed she was in a relationship with somebody, but very quickly realized it was a scam. When she ended the relationship, he said, “Yes, you’ve caught me. I’m not this person, but I’ve got your images. I know who your children are on Facebook.” He extorted about £14,000 from her. With that case, she never tried to get the money back, or go to the police as she had grown up children and grandchildren, and even though I assured her that the police would keep such investigations confidential, she was terrified her family would find out.</p>



 I once <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy-limitations-police/">interviewed an ex-police officer</a> who believed the danger of romance scams/ pig butchering is how it often leads to more serious forms of deception, and often spoke about the biggest hurdle being the perception of fraud, with many people not taking it as serious as, say, burglary. What is your opinion on how fraud is perceived in the UK? 



<p>So, as you’ll know, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> originate from Southeast Asia and this is an area where human trafficking is rife, because during COVID people with good computer skills were offered jobs and taken to scam compounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in some cases, it’s very cruel for both sides – even the name, ‘pig butchering’ and likening it to fattening up a pig for slaughter is just so repulsive.</p>



<p>However, it’s hard for me to think of the majority of romance fraudsters as victims. I’ve spoken to a couple of scammers and most of them are definitely not being trafficked. Sometimes it even becomes a racial issue. One scammer from Ghana told me it’s a way of getting back at the West for everything that’s happened to them over the centuries, which is a ridiculous excuse because he’s not putting the money into rebuilding parts of his home, he’s spending it on trainers and luxury goods.</p>



 Are there any anecdotes that have stuck with you and that you would like to share? 



<p>I’ve heard of people taking their own life, which you can understand if they’ve lost absolutely everything and are in the depths of depression. Some of the pig butchering scams, which leverage fake investment platforms are technologically very impressive. Regarding stories that have stuck with me, there was a lady who contacted me after seeing my Twitter and we spoke on the phone quickly after. She told me she had stage 4 cancer and had lost a fortune to this one guy. She knew that he was a fraudster; he’d admitted it, but she was still sending him money because she felt this bond with him. </p>



<blockquote><p>I remember her telling me that the only time her son will know what’s happened is when she dies, and he sees that he’s got no inheritance.</p> Becky Holmes, author of ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ </blockquote>



<p>I interviewed her, and then a few months later, as I was getting closer to submitting the book to the editors, I messaged her and asked if we could we meet up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She replied and told me she was in a hospice, but that she really wanted to stay strong for the book launch, and I told her don’t worry, we can talk about this another time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days later, I received a message from her Twitter account, and it was from her son saying his mum had passed away, but that he had seen our exchanges, and knew she had lost money. He wanted to know what on Earth had happened. I remember calling him at about 9pm one Friday night and explaining what had happened to his mum and where this money had gone. The saddest thing for me was how lovely her son was. He said how he wasn’t angry with his mum; he was just devastated that she hadn’t confided in him. It’s heartbreaking to think how many people don’t confide in family and friends when they will probably get the same understanding reaction. There is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.</p>



 



 
 
 It’s a delicate balance to strike, between presenting this information in a relatable, digestible format, and in a way that undermines the danger and impact of romance fraud.  



 How did you decide the best way to set the tone in raising awareness of the scourge of romance fraud? 



<p>So, the feedback to the book has been exactly what I’d hoped it would be. People have said they’ve been able to digest it because it’s readable and funny, but I’ve also shared the victim stories, and explained what happens in some of the countries.</p>



<p>Humor to me is a really good way of bringing to life what can be quite a dry subject. Often when people talk about fraud, everyone in the room switches off, and so I think as long as it’s never seen as humor at the expense of the victims [which I’ve never been accused of], then it’s fine.</p>
 



 
  Becky Holmes, romance fraud vigilante  
 
 



<p></p>



 One thing that surprised me from researching for this interview you was the sheer number of ‘celebrity’ scams. This has never happened to me [yet!]. How common is it? 



<p>Well, I never received a message from a celebrity on a dating site, but Twitter and Instagram are crammed full of them. My book is called ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ because Keanu Reeves is not on any form of social media, and yet he is the most impersonated celebrity. Particularly on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something I always get asked is why anybody would send money to an apparent multi-millionaire. The fraudsters have come up with new ways of getting money from people under the guise of being a celebrity. One of the most common is that they will say they really want to meet the person, but their manager is a bit of a tyrant, and when the celebrity next comes to the UK, the manager wants to set up a series of meet and greets, all, of course, at a cost. Another effective approach is when they say that they are raising money for a charity. Then, even if you just send £10, you’re considered a viable target.</p>



 People exposing scams sometimes face repercussions. Do you ever fear for your safety? 



<p>I’ve had some death threats. Once, when a scammer asked me for money, I agreed and asked for him to send me his bank account details. Noticing it was registered in the United States, and obviously not his account, I contacted the bank and told them what it was being used for, and it was shut down. Obviously, as only a day had passed between him sharing his details with me and the account being closed, he knew it was my doing. So I received some horrific abuse and threats then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as I’ve spent so long researching this topic, I’m aware that a lot of these fraudsters are outside of the UK so have never been too concerned. Having said that, a lot of people will have links to the UK, so I never take my safety for granted.</p>



 How much do you hold these platforms accountable? Do you pass on the scammers’ details to relevant authorities, and how involved are you in the prosecution etc? Do you think enough is being done to crack down on this type of fraud? 



<p>Well, I mean certainly more could be done. It’s difficult, Jody, because a lot of the fraudsters are very technologically advanced and always seem to be one step ahead. I also hold the social media platforms accountable. In Nigeria, romance scammers are called the Yahoo Boys, and they even have their own Facebook group with almost 13,000 active members. Now I’ve reported the page, as have many other people, to Facebook, but it’s never been taken down. When the key word of the group is categorically associated with fraud, how is that allowed to stay up?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook should be 100% be held accountable. I think it’s outrageous. Twitter and Instagram are slightly better because they’re quite good at taking accounts down when they’re reported.&nbsp;However, all you need is for somebody to set up a new email address, and they’re straight back on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elon Musk removing the blue tick from Twitter is a fraudster’s dream. Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore. I obviously hold the fraudsters most accountable, but I do think the platforms have a duty to be looking at this more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s pointless me pointing out Twitter profiles of people because they’ve been kicked off the platform before, and they don’t use their real names either. I’ve also been told by UK police that if a WhatsApp number, for example, is out of UK jurisdiction, there is pretty much nothing they can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>40% of all crime in this country is fraud, and yet police dedicate just 1% of resources to combat it,&nbsp;so, they’re not going to use that 1% trying to find somebody overseas.</p>



 Certain platforms, such as LinkedIn are experimenting with an identity verification step, although it is not yet a mandatory requirement. Perhaps because they do not want to alienate their customer base? 



<p>Yes, some dating platforms also require an identity verification step, where you have to wave your hand to show you’re a living person; however, what’s to stop a fraudster just doing that? So, more can be done, absolutely. I know the CEO of the <a href="https://theodda.org/">Online Dating &amp; Discovery Association</a>, and I do know that they take it very seriously, and steps are being taken. For example, if a fraudster is swiping right on every single woman’s profile in the hope that somebody connects, the ODDA will pick that up.</p>



 How much do you keep in contact with victims after they’ve messaged you? 



<p>I count three or four of them as friends now. A lot of these women that I speak to are people that I would naturally gravitate to. They are intelligent, interesting women, and people that I would like to be friends with, and they’re kind as well, and we could all do with some kind friends, couldn’t we?</p>



 Technology offers great opportunities to flag problematic behavior and identity users, thereby creating safer online environments, but it is also a double-edged sword. With the advent of AI-generated content like deepfakes, how optimistic are you regarding the future of romance fraud? 



<p>I fear for the future. A lot of romance fraudsters will pretend to be in the army or on an oil rig or a doctor or a surgeon working abroad, which they’ll use as an excuse for not being able to speak to somebody. This reluctance to video call can be a major red flag. But now, fraudsters will be able to transpose someone’s face over their own face and talk naturally. It’s terrifying.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But although MFA makes organizations – and their users – feel safe, cybercriminals are constantly evolving their technologies and practices to get around this additional layer of security. Some of these methods rely on driving <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/mfa-bombing-dismantled.html">MFA fatigue</a>, but others are more insidious and seek to bypass the protection offered by MFA altogether.

<p>While breaches targeting identity as the initial attack vector are on the rise, with increasing success and significant financial and reputational damage inflicted, IdPs are quickly becoming the attack vector of choice. Attackers maximize the payload by infiltrating the most critical system in your organization designed to secure access to all your company and customer data.</p>
<p>The Threat in Context</p>
<p>Once a user with access to the organization’s IdP is compromised through an account takeover (ATO) attack, detection becomes increasingly difficult. The attacker gains persistence within the network, infiltrating multiple critical systems and applications. This enables them to cause damage over long periods of time.</p>
<p>One such <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/657106/what-you-need-to-know-about-oktas-security-breach.html">attack recently compromised an IdP vendor</a> through their customer support systems. The attack supposedly took place when a customer support user was logged in to their personal Google account and stored their username and password for their service account within Chrome. The attacker had compromised the employee’s Google account, thus gaining access to the credentials to the customer support system. Once access to the support system was gained, the attacker then used session tokens and cookies stored in the HTTP Archive (HAR) files (which were used to troubleshoot issues with the IdP) to access the customer’s network and deploy ransomware and/or exfiltrate data.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mgm-resorts-hackers-broke-tricking-111102542.html">attack took place at a large entertainment and hospitality chain</a> when an attacker used social engineering to gain access to information about a high-value target (user with privileged access to critical systems including their IdP). The attacker then contacted the IT support helpdesk requesting a reset of the high-value user’s MFA credentials. They provided all the required verification information obtained through the social engineering attack, enabling them to install their own MFA authenticator. The attacker was able to establish persistence within the organization’s network, gaining access to critical systems.</p>
<p>Securing Access to IdPs and Taking a Layered Approach</p>
<p>These examples showcase the need to secure access to IdPs with high assurance authentication. Privileged and high-value users with access to critical systems must use a high assurance passwordless authentication mechanism such as X.509 certificate-based authentication (CBA) when authenticating themselves. Enforcing CBA for users as well as devices ensures that the user is not logging in to critical systems on an unmanaged device. By enforcing CBA and eliminating passwords, organizations can defend against common identity-based attacks such as phishing and MFA bypass targeted at their privileged users. In addition, taking a layered approach to security is recommended, with risk-based adaptive access that can evaluate contextual information to dynamically grant or block access based on risk levels when authenticating to an application or service.</p>
<p>As we saw with the attack on the large entertainment and hospitality chain, protecting against these attacks during authentication is not enough; the processes of user registration or password/MFA reset requests must also be secure. By implementing identity proofing through identity verification of physical credentials such as passports and driver’s licenses, organizations enhance their security protocols. This is particularly valuable in processes such as resetting MFA credentials, registering or onboarding new users, or implementing step-up authentication for out-of-policy users or high-value transactions. By adopting these measures, organizations can further protect their critical systems and their existing IdP.</p>
<p>In addition to the above steps, organizations with on-premises environments can also secure their IdP with the use of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/use-case/why-use-an-hsm">hardware security modules (HSM)</a> that provide enhanced security for securely storing keys, secrets, and tokens.</p>

<p>Modern card issuance operations have embraced advanced technology, replacing outdated manual methods like clipboard monitoring. Today, operators and managers no longer jot down notes as they walk the floor; instead, they use digital platforms. Alerts, achievements, and operational details are instantly communicated across locations, giving operations executives real-time data to monitor machine performance and critical issues without leaving their offices. The shift to automated data analysis allows operators and technicians to access information from tablets anytime, anywhere, ending the need for manual charting. Additionally, aggregated machine intelligence provides a comprehensive view of plant productivity and cost-effectiveness in real time across multiple sites for an entire corporation.</p>
<p>These advancements are commonplace today, as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html">Industry 4.0</a> cements itself in manufacturing history. It’s no surprise that digital intelligence brings increased efficiency and ROI opportunities to the forefront of smart card manufacturing. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/adaptive-issuance-production-analytics-solution">Entrust Adaptive Issuance™ Production Analytics Solution</a> is a software and technical consulting platform built on delivering this value proposition to card personalization operations through a customizable, real-time, aggregated architecture. It continues to drive next-generation smart manufacturing, bringing positive Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and enhanced value to operations. OEE is expressed as a percentage sum of three key production indicators: availability, performance, and quality. Let us take a closer look at each and how they bring a deeper understanding to issuance environments, focusing on net losses:</p>
 
 Availability 
 
 Availability is the percentage of planned production time the operation is available to run. It is the ratio of Run Time to Planned Production Time and considers loss, which includes events that stop planned production. Run Time is defined as the total time when machines are used for production in a running state, excluding idle and pause. Planned Production Time is defined as the total calendar time for the measurement period minus planned downtime, such as maintenance tasks, changeover, holidays, and shift breaks. Availability Loss includes any unplanned stops such as idle time, equipment failure or material shortage, and planned stops as noted above. 
 
 Performance 
 
 Performance percentage is the actual total production output compared to theoretical perfect production output, which is calculated using the machine’s maximum cycle speed. A perfect performance score would mean machines are always running at maximum speed when active. Total Production is defined as the total number of cards processed, which includes both good and rejected cards. Maximum Machine Throughput is defined as the maximum machine speed in cards per hour, also considering that throughput could be reduced based on the total number of modules used. Performance Loss includes anything that causes the manufacturing process to run at less than the maximum possible speed when it is running. Examples of things that create Performance Loss include machine wear, inferior materials, line misfeeds, and jams. 
 
 Quality 
 
 Quality is the number of good units produced as a percentage of the total units started. A perfect quality score indicates that all products are good: successfully manufactured the first time, and no rejects were produced. Simply and more realistically, total production equals good production + rejected production. Quality Loss accounts for manufactured parts that do not meet quality standards as defined by the operation. Examples of Quality Loss include scrap and rework. 
<p>Net Losses</p>
<p>Net Losses for all three production indicators can be explored further here from <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-factors/">Vorne</a> as variations in issuance type, facilities, and machines contribute to loss variability. <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-six-big-losses/">The Six Big Losses</a> are also common in issuance operations and include: unplanned and planned stops, small stops, slow cycles, production rejects, and startup rejects.</p>
<p>To learn more about OEE and the three key production indicators, measurement &amp; analysis, and calculating speed and efficiency, read our white paper, <a href="https://go.entrust.com/production-analytics-solution-wp">“Understanding Production Efficiency in High-Volume Card Issuance Operations.”</a></p>
<p>The Future of Digital Intelligence and Production Analytics</p>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are expected to revolutionize the industry further. These technologies will be integral in production planning, inventory management, resource planning, and cost analysis. Next-generation Industry 4.0 subject matter experts will take the output from these technologies and use it to make improvements across operational architectures, building more efficiency into the process. Digital intelligence can be used to mitigate operational bottlenecks, quality gaps, and overall line inefficiencies by focusing on the three key production indicators.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Note: This episode isn’t an introduction to DIDs; for those new to the concept, we recommend revisiting <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/decentralized-identifiers-did-methods-did-documents-did-resolution/">Episode 52</a> of the SSI Orbit Podcast for a foundational understanding.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, we dive deeper into the world of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), moving beyond the basics to explore the critical aspects that will influence their trust and adoption.</p>
<p>Today, joined by Marcus, we embark on a detailed discussion framed around a SWOT analysis of DIDs, examining their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive conversation that not only highlights the significant advantages of DIDs but also addresses the challenges and potential pathways to their widespread acceptance. We delve into the nuances of DIDs, aiming to contribute to the broader goal of promoting their adoption.</p>
<p>We aimed to follow the SWOT model, though it proved challenging at times due to the nuanced nature of many topics. Interestingly, what some may perceive as a strength could also be seen as a weakness, leading to a blend of perspectives. This complexity added depth to our discussion, making it particularly engaging!</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Markus and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [00:47] Comparison of DIDs to Other Verifiable Identifiers: Exploring how DIDs contrast with other types of verifiable identifiers and their benefits over traditional identifiers like email addresses and phone numbers.

 Terminology 
<p>Digital Identity: An amorphous concept attempting the impossible job of capturing all that a human is in digital form, leading to many years of disappointing national projects and draft bills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID: A single attribute or fact about an entity, represented digitally, that is relevant in one or more specific contexts.</p>
 A big little shift in terminology&nbsp; 
<p>The draft Australian federal <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">Digital ID Bill</a> no longer uses the phrase “digital identity”. The same shift in language has been made by the <a href="https://nab.com.au">National Australia Bank</a> (NAB) in its year-long <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/digital-id-trust-who-you-choose-and-choose-who-you-trust/">multi-sector design collaboration</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the NAB and the Australian government now refer to Digital ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change is much more than semantics. I hope it reflects a recognition by government that identification is different from identity, and there is no universal way of identifying people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAB has highlighted that businesses and agencies are usually less interested in verifying “identity” than a particular attribute or eligibility. The bank’s <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NAB-Digital-Identity-Roundtable.pdf">roundtable report</a> states “it is very rare that individuals need to prove who they are” and instead suggests a reframing of digital identity around “what do we need to know about an individual for a particular purpose”; that is, the process of identification in all its local variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what does Digital ID mean? Well, it’s just shorthand for a credential in a certain context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reckon everyone knows what it means to be asked to “show some ID”.&nbsp; We effortlessly interpret “ID” in context, whether it’s proof of age at a bar, a student card when sitting an exam, or an employee ID when entering the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also familiar with the formal identification process carried out when opening a bank account or starting a new job. In these cases, we are generally asked to provide a number of IDs, from a pretty universal set of options including driver licence, birth certificate, Medicare card, passport and so on. And there are alternative forms of ID for people who need them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Fresh thinking; new precision 
<p>None of these IDs constitute our identity. And that’s how we like it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a rule, we should ask for and reveal as little personal information as possible, within the requirements of the transaction we’re doing. As the Canadian digital identity leader <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma once said</a>, “I want my identity to be less than the real me”.</p>
<p>Digital ID is concrete, specific and familiar. But “digital identity” is abstract and open-ended. It means different things to different people. Invariably, digital identity is interpreted as a new universal means of proving who we are. But there is no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So instead of imposing new identification standards and novel “digital identity” on Australians, the Digital ID Bill simply creates a governance regime to improve the quality and reliability of existing IDs when converted to digital form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will conserve the meaning of existing IDs and leave businesses and agencies free to conduct identification as they see fit. The Digital ID regulator is being tasked to create rules and technology standards, with a view to fostering a marketplace of vastly improved digitised IDs.&nbsp;</p>
 Best in class 
<p>I believe the AGDIS represents world’s best practice in digital identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AGDIS rules (to be developed after the Bill is enacted) will almost certainly embrace mobile phone digital wallets as carriers of Digital IDs. A large and fast-growing proportion of Australians are now familiar with using their payment cards in mobile wallets to “tap and pay” and “click to pay” (the Reserve Bank reports that <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2023/the-evolving-retail-payments-landscape.html">35% of card payments are now made via mobile wallets</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equivalent user experience of click-to-present any digital ID in context will be intuitive, widely available and vastly more secure than today’s plaintext handling of personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be able to prove relevant facts about ourselves with the same security, safety and privacy as we prove our credit card details.&nbsp;</p>
 We’ve done this before 
<p>Smart payment cards (EMV chip cards) were introduced to replace magnetic stripe cards as they became vulnerable to skimming and counterfeiting. Chip-assisted presentation of cardholder IDs replaced the plaintext of a mag stripe and, as a result, essentially eradicated physical card fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the speed with which smart credit card IDs cut payment fraud, we can expect mobile technology Digital IDs to dramatically reduce identity crime via stolen personal data and, as a result, neutralise the personal data black market. </p>

<p>The modern work environment creates situations unthinkable a decade ago. Today, many employees will never step foot in an office or have face-to-face interactions with colleagues. While this flexible work model offers advantages for businesses as well as employees, it also presents significant security challenges, especially when it comes to reliable <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-verification">identity verification</a>.</p>  
<p>Employee identity risk and fraud have skyrocketed in recent years. The <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI recently warned</a> that fraudulent job applicants are using deepfakes and stolen PII to obtain remote work positions. “Bait-and-switch” schemes are also on the rise, where the person interviewed by a company is not the person who is actually hired. In the best case, companies end up hiring someone completely unsuitable for the position. In the worst case, they onboard and provide access to cybercriminals who can install malware, steal confidential and privileged information, and more.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond hiring and onboarding. Just this week, a multinational finance firm revealed that an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">employee was tricked into making a $25 million wire transfer</a> by deepfake video and audio. The thieves used AI-generated likenesses&nbsp; of the company’s CFO and other known colleagues in a live video conference with the finance worker.</p> 
<p>Know Your Employee (KYE) ensures that your employees are who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Know Your Employee (KYE)?  
<p>Know Your Employee, commonly abbreviated as KYE, is the process of verifying the identities and backgrounds of an organization’s current workforce and prospective new employees. KYE aims to ensure that employees are who they claim to be, and do not have a criminal background that poses an undue risk.</p> 
<p>The KYE - Know Your Employee process continues past initial hiring and onboarding. Effective KYE involves continuous monitoring and regularly updating and reviewing employee information to identify any potential risks that may arise.</p> 
 KYE vs. KYC  
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Employee (KYE) are two essential processes in the realm of compliance and risk management. KYC verifies customer identities to determine if they are who they claim to be and discover any potential risks, ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulations. In contrast, KYE involves verification of employee identities and thorough background checks to reduce the risk of employee fraud and theft, and address internal compliance needs.</p> 
<p>Both KYC and KYE share the common goal of mitigating risks, upholding legal standards and preventing fraud. The main distinction is in their focus: KYC is customer-oriented, while KYE centers on internal workforce dynamics. KYC is a point in time process, while KYE should be a continuous process, throughout an employee’s tenure. Integrating both processes is crucial for a comprehensive risk management framework in business.</p> 
 The Growing Importance of Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>Identity verification poses an ongoing challenge for organizations. In fact, 40% of IT security experts named it a top identity security challenge in the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-workplace-identity-security-trends-2024">2024 Workplace Identity Security Trends report</a>. This is likely to climb as new attack and fraud tactics make accurate <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a> and verification increasingly difficult. A recent report by Onfido found a 3000% increase in deepfake attempts in 2023, thanks to face-swapping apps, generative AI and other readily available fraud tools.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond non-compliance. Employee fraud tactics such as interview fraud, bait-and-switch scenarios, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/employee-fraud-how-companies-can-spot-employees-outsourcing-their-jobs-2022-8">unauthorized outsourcing</a>, mean that the person doing the work may not be the person you interviewed or hired. This creates massive security risks for organizations.</p> 
<p>Moreover, identity risks persist throughout the employee lifecycle – not just at hiring and onboarding. The recent breach of MGM resorts succeeded because attackers were able to impersonate an employee and convince the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. Robust, continuous KYE processes could have prevented the attack. In this evolving landscape, a comprehensive KYE strategy is crucial for organizations to stay ahead of emerging threats, ensuring the integrity of their workforce and safeguarding against potential malicious activities.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>While every organization will approach KYE differently depending on their specific needs and structure, there are basic principles that hold across all workplaces.</p> 
 Employ Multiple KYE Verification Methods  
<p>A thorough KYE approach requires layering multiple verification methods — which ones, and when to invoke them, will depend on the risk level of the employee verification scenario as well as organizational and environmental risks at play. Verification methods include document verification, facial biometric verification, live video, chat verification, as well as passive signals such as device/endpoint and location detection.</p> 
<p>As we’ve seen, identity fraud techniques evolve rapidly — it’s critical that your KYE methods keep up. A robust KYE strategy should incorporate advanced technologies such as liveness detection to detect deepfakes and other AI-aided fraud.</p> 
 Make It Easy for Your Admins and Employees  
<p>It’s human nature to circumvent processes that add an unreasonable burden. When done well, KYE - Know Your Employee processes should be fast and easy for both employees and administrators alike. This means automating processes as much as possible, requiring the right level of identity verification for the scenario, and using technologies that people are familiar with, like their smartphones. Of course security cannot be sacrificed for usability.</p> 
 Continuously Monitor for Risk  
<p>Employee identity risks do not end with secure onboarding. Higher risk scenarios arise throughout an employee’s career. Resetting credentials, getting a new phone, logging in from unknown locations, gaining increased access privileges, personal financial problems, active cyberattacks — all can be situations of elevated risk. Your KYE controls should be ready to address these, taking specific measures according to risk level.&nbsp;</p> 
 Don’t Operate in a Silo  
<p>It’s critical that your KYE processes and tools are connected and synchronized to your <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce identity security</a> systems and HR system of record. The users accessing digital services may differ from the identities that IT believes they have. In other words, the digital identity may not match the real world identity. Your employee onboarding and identity verification procedures should be directly tied to your authentication processes, ideally using phishing-resistant, passwordless methods. As mentioned, it’s also important to invoke re-verification at certain times of increased risk. This means connecting your identity risk monitoring to your Know Your Employee (KYE) systems.</p> 
 Keep Up With Current Regulations and Compliance  
<p>In the current regulatory landscape, it's not just ethical but imperative for businesses across various industries to comply with applicable statutes and standards. The incorporation of a robust "Know Your Employee" (KYE) process is a key aspect of this compliance. These checks are vital for verifying credentials, ensuring workforce integrity, and meeting legal obligations.</p> 
<p>The consequences of non-compliance are severe, underlining the indispensability of KYE in any organization's overall compliance strategy. For example, a comprehensive KYE process is vital for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, helping identify potential risks and preventing misuse of the financial system.</p>

<p>Holochain provides blockchains with auditable applications that can be tied to on-chain transactions, opening new possibilities for NFTs, DAO communities, and more.</p> Binding Wallets to Holochain Apps <p>We’ve developed a proof of concept for binding together Holochain agent keys with public keys on blockchains. Holochain uses a system of source chain validation to ensure that any action taken in an application is auditable, creating a secure environment for most application needs. By binding a Holochain agent with a public key in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), data created by the Holochain agent can be associated with the EVM key. This setup allows for unforgeable and bidirectional verifiability, facilitating provenance confirmation on both Ethereum and Holochain.</p> Validated Content for NFTs  <p>Rather than storing NFT payloads in unvalidated and/or centralized storage, with Holochain you can create and validate the payload and the reference for an NFT fully within a distributed context. The demo below shows that you can also manage the minting and transfer of the NFT from a Holochain app precisely because you can first bind your wallet to your Holochain agent. By storing payloads for NFTs in Holochain, you can circumnavigate the storage limits of blockchain, providing a more validated and ultimately more dynamic solution than other current implementations like IPFS. </p> Notaries and Oracles <p>Combining patterns from oracles and notaries with agent binding on Holochain opens up new ways to move between peer-to-peer systems via “cross-chain” proofs. </p><p>Smart contracts pre-authorize the public keys of agents from whom they will accept proofs. The proofs are signed verifications that reference actions or decisions taken in Holochain, all of which are also transparent and verifiable by any member of the application. This enables scalable but still verifiable sensemaking. </p><p>An example of how this could be used is with DAOs. Large scale voting on-chain is costly, both in gas fees and network traffic. But a voting app on Holochain can provide the trust and transparency of blockchain without the gas fees, and then the fully verifiable decision can be notarized creating a proof which is used to make a single on-chain transaction. The cost savings to both individual DAO members and the organization as a whole are potentially immense. This also provides greater flexibility as DAO’s can now afford to conduct all of their business in validated environments.</p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">Explore other benefits Holochain brings to DAOs. </a></p> Data Storage  <p>Given the two examples above, you can see that what Holochain provides to blockchains is validated data storage. While the examples given talk about two major concerns for current blockchain development, you can store or interact with any data you choose to program into an application. Holochain is an incredibly flexible framework — the validation rules of each application can be customized based on the security and design needs of a particular use case. The combination of energy and cost efficiency, auditability, and flexibility makes Holochain a perfect choice for applications that need to interface with blockchain.</p><p>Plus, it’s all coded in Rust — with UIs using your favorite JavaScript framework — making it even easier for Ethereum devs to use and build with.</p> Learn More and Connect <p>Learn how Holochain can <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-web3?ref=blog.holochain.org">extend Web3</a>, and get involved by introducing yourself to our team and community on <a href="https://bit.ly/A-New-Link-in-Web3-DEV-HC?ref=blog.holochain.org">Discord</a> or by joining one of our <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-events?ref=blog.holochain.org">upcoming events</a>.</p>

<p>New technology is tough to explain sometimes. But Holochain isn’t reinventing the wheel. Rather, we are inventing the bicycle when all you have ever seen or used are wagons. </p><p>Holochain is built from familiar technical components and best practices, just as a bicycle is built from wheels, gears, frames, and steering mechanisms which all previously existed as basic forms or principles in other contexts. </p>Sum&gt;Parts: The key components of Holochain already existed, but we put them on a new frame<p>Our back wheel is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table?ref=blog.holochain.org">Distributed Hash Table</a>, similar to the ones used by <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">IPFS</a> to revolutionize peer-to-peer file sharing. This is the database structure that allows data to be transferred in the context of a distributed app.</p><p>Our front wheel is built on a lot of the same principles as <a href="https://git-scm.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Git</a> which pioneered <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/?ref=blog.holochain.org">local-first</a> version control as we know it today. While our local-first tools are built out of slightly different materials, the principle remains: Agents can always make local changes which then update the network when connected online. Not dissimilar to how the front wheel determines the direction of the bike. </p><p>These wheels are powered by a familiar device, the bike chain. Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">source chain</a> uses an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain?ref=blog.holochain.org">hashchains</a>, which were popularized by blockchains, to connect one action to the next, every action containing the hash of the last. Each agent has their own bike and so they each update their own source chain, independent of the actions of other cyclists. This provides mobility compared to the wide wagon of a single central chain. The beauty of bikes is their independence, the ability to act without everyone needing to be in the same wagon. </p><p>The handlebars that steer this contraption are also familiar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography?ref=blog.holochain.org">Public/private key cryptography</a> used for cryptographic signatures is a staple of most processes on the web, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS?ref=blog.holochain.org">HTTPS</a>, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol?ref=blog.holochain.org">Signal Protocol</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell?ref=blog.holochain.org">SSH</a> which is used by devs everywhere to access remote machines. Alongside encryption, these keys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate?ref=blog.holochain.org">act as the identity tools</a> which connect the user, the human riding the bike, to their actions on the digital road. Every action they take is signed, controlled through those handlebars, and only the rider is able to steer. </p><p>Holochain pulls together all of these time tested tools and reconfigures them to do something none of them can do alone. </p><p>We’ve been talking about Holochain from the perspective of the agent — the rider and their bike. But Holochain is an application framework. In this analogy, every application is a unique path that controls where a rider can go, what actions can be taken, and how data is formatted. We talk about this from the perspective of the rider because they get to determine which paths they ride. Riders bridge between paths, connecting them into personalized neighborhoods. Each new app increases the area that the rider can travel and grows an ecosystem of potential routes. Different paths take you to different places, but Holochain lets you move between them seamlessly. </p><p>The affordances of each road dictate what can be done on it. Wide roads let many ride together, small curvy paths mean you slow down, etc. In the same way, the application rules are baked in. Changing them would be the same as changing roads. </p><p>As a framework for peer-to-peer applications, Holochain is taking on some of the toughest challenges of distributed computing. Ensuring data is validated and secure without central servers, allowing for asynchronous action across a network, and keeping agents honest, are all hard tasks. But each individual piece of this puzzle already exists, we are just recombining them to offer new possibilities. </p><p>Holochain is built to allow any group to come together, develop a bike path, and each with their own bike traveling at their own pace, ride the path together. Many different bike paths can overlap and intersect, and riders get to choose their route through them — traveling freely and at their own will.</p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>One way to understand governance as a component of decentralized identity is to look at identity verification and data sharing as an “ecosystem.”</p>
<p>An ecosystem is any use case where you have:</p>
 
 One or more parties issuing verifiable credentials for digital identity to people, organizations, or devices. 
 People, organizations, or devices who then hold the credentials to prove their identity and share data within the credential to other parties. 
 People, organizations, or devices, that need to prove the identity of those presenting verifiable credentials, and the data within their credentials to accomplish some goal. 
 
<p>In an ecosystem, participants are interested in the same kind of data to solve the same kind of problems. This could be who is allowed to access a facility, an operational system, a software application.</p>
<p>Governance makes this happen.</p>
<p>The governance authority establishes who can issue credentials. If there is only one issuer, say in the case of a company issuing employee credentials, the company is the governance authority.</p>
<p>The authority establishes:</p>
 
 who can be issued a credential. 
 who else can issue credentials 
 What information is going to be issued in a credential. 
 How that information is to be interpreted — if x, then y 
 How that information can be shared in ways to comply with data privacy regulations. 
 
<p>While there are other technical aspects to governance (choosing credential formats, DID methods, protocols, cryptographic key management etc), the key governance actions can be reduced to two workflows:</p>
 
 Which credentials can I trust? 
 What data needs to be presented and authenticated and how does it need to be presented? 
 
<p>These questions are solved by machine-readable governance. The governance authority publishes a file in a format that can be read by the software required and held by each participant in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Once you have an ecosystem for a specific use case, you can extend the governance to other use cases, depending on how robustly you have authenticated the person, organization or device that you issued the credential to.</p>
<p>Governance would enable a credential issued to an employee to access a hospital to also access a specific database or device. Governance could allow this credential to be used as a proof of identity for specific organizations that provide employee benefits. So you’ve gone, just through a simple addition of code, from opening a door to opening an insurance policy.</p>
<p>Two different hospital systems could agree and use machine readable governance to authorize doctors in one system to work in another.</p>
<p>The fact that these rules can be rendered in a machine-readable format makes implementation and updating fast and simple. You can rapidly reconfigure your ecosystem to manage new data and requirements.</p>
<p>And once you are able to use verifiable identity and data, the permutations are limitless. Governance makes all these permutations work and enables expansion and scale.</p>
<p>It turns trust into an actionable, valuable commodity.</p>

<p>Everywhere you turn, it seems there’s a new process, a new technology, and a new consumer preference that is “going digital.” More and more cardholders around the globe are preferring, and expecting, a digital-first payment experience. Because of the technology behind it all, IT professionals are at the center of this digital transformation. The pandemic accelerated an awareness of and migration to contactless and digital payments, and the payments ecosystem is now one of the fastest movers when it comes to digitization.</p>
<p><a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">51% of U.S. cardholders</a> state that their mobile banking app is their preferred method to engage with their financial institution. This data shows us that customers are looking for seamless, digital-first payment and card management experiences. With that data guiding us, it’s clear an elevated and enriched issuance and payment enablement process is now the gold standard to meet the demand of cardholders.</p>
<p>Bridging Physical and Digital Experiences for Cardholders</p>
<p>That gold standard experience – providing a compelling, seamless digital card and payment experience – can help a bank to achieve <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/maintain-your-top-of-wallet-status-with-advanced-card-controls/">top-of-wallet status</a>. We learned in a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">recent survey</a> among 1,000 U.S. cardholders that digital card controls in the banking app make the cardholder more likely to use the card as a default payment method. This has led to some banks going all-in with fully featured, integrated digital card solutions. Others, especially small to midsize banks, have asked their IT teams to implement some fundamental digital features as building blocks to their digital card platform – a foundation that can be enhanced and expanded by partnering with a digital card solution provider to offer cardholders a truly digital-first payment experience.</p>
<p>But financial institutions have different challenges when it comes to enabling intuitive yet secure digital payment options for their cardholders. The building blocks themselves, like choosing the right digital features, knowing which features are most requested by cardholders, and meeting the demands of different demographic groups, can be challenging to organize and understand. Similarly, it’s important to consider a solution that is scalable and future-proof to ensure the biggest ROI. Most IT teams have heavy resource constraints with a multitude of existing projects. Smaller financial institutions may find it difficult to build out their own digital card solution, while bigger institutions will think closely about the existing infrastructure in place. For example, by leveraging what they’ve already put in place and partnering with Entrust, a financial institutions’ IT team can answer the need for an even more digital and seamless customer experience.</p>
<p>Simplifying Digital Card Implementation</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/entrust-digital-card-solution">The Entrust Digital Card Solution</a> is a single mobile software development kit (SDK) that’s easy to implement and opens a world of possibilities. The entire menu of capabilities becomes immediately available, but with the flexibility and scalability to pick and choose the right configuration for your customers at that point in time, adding more capabilities seamlessly as the organization’s payments enablement strategy evolves.</p>
<p>This innovative strategy shifts an IT team’s highly complex digital-first strategy to a unified and simplified integration for digital payments enablement. Our SDK or web service integration aims to create faster time to value with minimal intervention on behalf of IT. Our implementation helps IT teams overcome common challenges like internal resources among small departments, total cost of ownership across multiple features, and time to market.</p>
<p>Choosing a solution developed by experts focused on the digital card makes adding new integrations for the cardholder a much smoother, less time-intensive process. Ultimately, these specific capabilities enable IT teams to focus on mission-critical initiatives while promoting a fully integrated digital card solution.</p>

<p>As digital transformation accelerates across industries, technology thought leader Philip Sheldrake brings an urgent yet nuanced perspective on constructing digital identity systems centered on human needs.</p><p>With a perspective spanning engineering, computer science, and involvement in decentralized projects, Sheldrake understands the intricacies of designing digital ecosystems.</p><p>However, through his interdisciplinary lens, he sees profound gaps in how identity gets formulated in computational realms versus lived human experience.</p><p>In the same way that the internet has brought a series of helpful technological advancements, it’s also brought unintended consequences.</p><p>For Sheldrake, identity may be the premier challenge to align digital progress with human flourishing rather than harm.</p><p>By drawing out insights from his expertise in bridging social and computer sciences, this article explores the past, present, and most hopeful future pathways for digital identity.</p> Understanding and Describing Identity <p>Even defining digital identity proves slippery, as technologist Philip Sheldrake explains:</p><p></p><blockquote>“It’s so difficult to actually even describe the space we're about to talk about. It's astonishing how few words have real meaning in this space.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Identity intersects technology, business, government, philosophy, culture, and our personal lives. Thus, no singular perspective captures its complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake notes, “There are just a few throwaway phrases that just mislead people because they're so ubiquitous, they hardly mean anything anymore.”&nbsp;</p><p>Concepts like innovation, transformation, and disruption get used to the point of losing meaning. Making progress requires bridging disconnected outlooks. For example, social scientists and computer programmers use distinctive language and assumptions, often talking past each other. Successful digital systems blend these varied perspectives and provide enough interdisciplinary expertise to clarify complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake brings decades of experience working across domains, from helping launch open source browser Firefox to involvement with Ethereum and decentralized technology projects. He sees identity as the crux where technology and humanity meet — for better or worse:</p><p></p><blockquote>“I am obsessed with the potential for digital technologies to lend a hand in human flourishing. Except that, so far, the experiment of the digital has thrown up as many negative externalities… as positive. Little things, you know, like undermining democracy.”</blockquote><p></p><p>The alluring promise of technology remains unfulfilled until we construct frameworks elevating both computer science innovations and social scientific understandings of identity.</p> Technology Changes Identity Dynamics Over Time <p>While databases and algorithms remain constant, the societal outcomes and experiences with digital systems transform remarkably across months and years. Sheldrake explains how innovations go through a “series of phases” regarding consequences as usage patterns and cultural incorporation structurally mature.</p><p>In the early days of social media, few guard rails for behavior existed, enabling exploratory identity play. Yet, as digital engagement became mobile and pervasive, external constraints tightened. Structures accreted, along with probabilities of harm.</p><p>Sheldrake gives the example of shifting sentiment around decentralized technology projects like blockchain. Initial optimism about democratization gave way to backlash concerning crypto’s environmental impacts. This reveals less about the fundamentals of blockchain itself changing and more about the emergence of unintended externalities at scale.</p> Contrasting Views on Identity <p>There are fundamentally different perspectives on identity in computer science and social science. Sheldrake points out, “In computer science...nothing is addressable in internetworking until it has an entity and identifier.”&nbsp;</p><p>Rigid constructs like legal identities and cryptographic claims of personhood dominate programming approaches.</p><p>Meanwhile, in sociology and psychology, “identity is a sense-making capacity...a process, it’s a verb.” Human identity lives between people and contexts, ever-negotiated through information exchange. Instead of static entities, constantly co-created meaning flows.</p><p>Sheldrake argues the clash stems from differing historical customers driving innovation, noting “the first customers of IT were large corporations and governments...IT served the bureaucracy, it was the definition of bureaucracy.”</p><p>Thus, digitization elevated standardized legal identities for taxation and service provision — not the nuanced, fluid identities enlivening human relationships outside institutional walls. Much gets lost in translation.</p> The Path Forward Requires New Perspectives <p>Progress on digital identity relies on transcending entrenched disciplinary silos to enable genuine dialogue and collective innovation. While compromising on decentralized principles proves difficult, rigidly decentralized systems similarly risk harm without weighing human needs.</p><p>Sheldrake argues identity resides in “getting social science and computer science and the humanities, kind of riffing off each other's best strengths, rather than allowing computer science to riff off its worst weaknesses.” No single expertise holds the answers alone.</p><p>He continues: “One of my mentors mentioned to me, the beginning of the 90s, the 20th century was all about disciplinary excellence, the 21st century will all be about the interdisciplinary or even the transdisciplinary, trying to fill in the gaps between the disciplinary knowledge.”</p><p>To sufficiently fill those gaps, technologies like <a href="https://www.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> aim to bring individual sovereignty and collective capacity. While there isn’t a perfect formula for identity, the next wave of innovators can learn from how it’s translated digitally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been compromised credentials — in other words, the use of stolen passwords. MFA renders the use of stolen credentials futile, as attackers are highly unlikely to have access to a user's other authentication factors, such as a mobile phone.</p>

<p>Considering a decentralized identity (DI) solution? Is this your wish list:<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy DI capabilities in the simplest way possible.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to focus on your core business while leaving others to do the detailed technical work of deploying your DI solution.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy your DI solution faster and at a much lower total cost of ownership (TOC) than other deployment models offer.<br></p>



<p>To have those wishes granted, you need a cloud-based, SaaS deployment model—a complete and managed solution that includes the deployment, management, maintenance, and support of DI services. In short, you need the Anonyome Platform.</p>



<p>Read our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">whitepaper</a> or continue here for the highlights.</p>



 More companies are turning to a SaaS solution for DI &nbsp; 



<p>For software providers and integrators, adding a DI infrastructure to their product lines presents many of the same choices they faced when integrating other system elements: for example, will we host our web servers in own own local data center using our own hardware? Or should we opt for the simplicity of leasing server space from a cloud hosting provider?</p>



<p>Both methods have benefits. Some companies enjoy the peace of mind that comes with controlling their own hardware and software stacks. Others—an increasing majority—find peace of mind comes from knowing that the hardware and software stacks are delivered and maintained through a contract model.</p>



<p>The contract model is often referred to as cloud hosting or the more formal Software as a Service (SaaS) model because the vendor provider deploys, manages, maintains, and provides support for the software.</p>



<p>Calculating the total cost of ownership (TOC) usually determines whether to use a SaaS or on-site deployment model. The key cost drivers for any software implementation are the costs of:<br></p>



 
 software application 



 hardware/hosting 



 staff required to deploy, manage, maintain, and support the application. 
 



<p><br>Any of those cost drivers that a company can successfully outsource become line items in a budget without the operational complexities imposed by on-site deployments.<br></p>



 The Anonyome Platform embraces the SaaS model 



<p>Many companies have calculated the inefficiency, complexity, and additional expenses of the traditional on-site software model and have opted for the simplicity of the SaaS model. In fact, the SaaS model has become the de facto standard for delivering software solutions and the Anonyome Platform was built to embrace this model.</p>



 <br>Here are 7 reasons why: 



<p></p>



 1. No upfront capital costs 







<p>With the SaaS model, the customer doesn’t have to bear the upfront capital costs of deploying a software solution or even contracting their own cloud provider. Instead, the SaaS vendor incurs these costs (e.g., hardware/hosting, software application, and IT staff hiring and training). This simplifies startup and operating costs for the customer, the customer only pays a monthly or annual subscription cost, and deployment is immediate.</p>



<p></p>



 2. Fast deployment 







<p>SaaS delivers an almost instant solution to the customer, which is far more attractive than waiting the many months typically required for deploying and testing in-house solutions. Anonyome provides a fully automated approach to deploying new environments for customers.</p>



<p></p>



 3. Vendor-provided maintenance and upgrades 







<p>In the on-site solution, a customer is on the hook for updating and applying security patches to the software and operating systems, and for performing compatibility tests with every change. On the other hand, in the SaaS model, the software vendor maintains and upgrades the software, which includes delivering new versions and security patching the hosted system to protect against security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p></p>



 4. No staffing requirements 







<p>Paying staff to research, design, integrate, test, finetune, and launch any system is a significant cost with in-house solutions—up to 75% of the overall costs, in fact. The SaaS model eliminates the staffing concerns for contracted services.</p>



<p>In new emerging areas such as DI, it may be extremely difficult to find new hires with the right skills. The Anonyome Labs’ team, on the other hand, is highly experienced and highly trained in DI technologies. Beyond the Anonyome Platform, we support the ongoing development of DI by:</p>



 
 helping to run three DI-focused blockchains 



 being an active contributor to the DI standards organizations 



 contributing source code back to the DI open source community. 
 



<p></p>



 5. No-fuss application scalability 







<p>With in-house solutions, the customer must think about infrastructure issues such as network bandwidth, database and server sizing before deciding whether to ramp up their solution. But customers using the SaaS model don’t have to think about the technical how of scalability, because it’s already done for them. This leaves them free to focus on their business strategy and when to scale for maximum revenue.</p>



<p></p>



 6. 24-hour software support 







<p>The service level agreement (SLA) is key to a SaaS solution because it outlines the reliable actions and response times a customer can expect should an issue arise. With Anonyome’s global workforce across multiple time zones, staff are always on hand to respond to priority issues, even after hours at the customer’s site.</p>



<p></p>



 7. High level security and privacy 







<p>Under the SaaS model, the software vendor hires and trains people to maintain top security and privacy capabilities on the customer’s behalf, which is a significant resource saving.<br></p>



<p>DI is exploding as the new identity management solution</p>



<p>As you’d know, DI is the technology and standards that allow a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is more trustworthy, and respects privacy. DI puts the user in sole control of the personal information that forms their identity. It’s decentralized because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>According to June 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">figures, </a>more than&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">62 per cent</a>&nbsp;of US companies plan to incorporate a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">DI </a>solution into their operations, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">74 per cent</a>&nbsp;likely to do so within a year.</p>

<p>Centralized identity models are no longer sufficient to safeguard against exploitations from either rogue internal operators or external bad actors. DI has stepped into the breach, because:<br></p>



 
 DI is safer: Without central storage of credentials, DI presents much less risk of credential theft or other operational issues for the customer as custodians of sensitive data. 



 DI streamlines process:Organizations no longer have to repeatedly collect and distribute data, and sign-up and sign-in processes are faster because there’s no need to duplicate efforts and approvals. 



 DI gives individuals control over data:The customer controls their own data, which reduces risk, unifies user experience, and boosts their satisfaction. 



 DI reduces the compliance burden: The system eliminates manual error and inconsistent and redundant data distribution and validation. 
 



 The Anonyome Platform specializes in DI (and much more) 







<p>The Anonyome Platform does three things we know enterprise customers want:<br></p>



 
 Very quickly deploys DI capabilities in their application environment 



 Handles the deployment, management, maintenance and support of the DI solution 



 Allows the customer focus on high-level strategy instead of the technical intricacies. 
 



<p>Within the DI offering, the Anonyome Platform has five licensable products:</p>



 
 White label mobile DI wallet: A standalone mobile application for iOS and Android, a user can use the mobile DI wallet for DI interactions and storage: creating storing cryptographic keys; and creating connections for receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. It interacts with verifiable credential issuers and verifiers, and supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Mobile native DI wallet SDK: For customers who want to add the DI wallet functionality to their own mobile application, this native mobile SDK provides the capability for storage; creating cryptographic keys; establishing connections; and receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. 
 



 
 Verifiable credentials service/SDK/sample apps: This service establishes connections with DI wallets, issues verifiable credentials, and requests and verifies presentation proofs from DI wallets. It supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Relay service/SDK: This service introduces an always-on capability for a mobile DI wallet. Implemented as a cloud service, the relay service provides mediator capability for incoming/outgoing verifiable credential and other messages, so that sending and receiving is not limited to when the client implementations of the mobile DI wallet and SDK are online. 
 



 
 Governance framework:This framework empowers DI network participants to enforce rules while staying true to the tenants of DI. Organizations can define and enforce governance rules associated with their ecosystem, including which wallets, issuers, and verifiers are trusted and which credentials can be used and requested. 
 



<p>In addition to the current Anonyome Platform DI products, we are also developing:</p>



 
 Enterprise DI wallet: A combination mobile wallet application and cloud wallet, the enterprise DI wallet manages credentials associated with the enterprise. Differing from a personal DI wallet, the enterprise DI wallet is intended for one or more users to use simultaneously and to be inheritable by a future occupant of a particular job or position within an enterprise. 
 



<p>The Anonyome Platform is a SaaS-based, API-first developer platform of individualized services<br></p>



<p>Also known as the <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, the Anonyome Platform offers a set of DI, privacy, and cybersecurity services and SDKs that developers can add as capabilities to their existing or new applications.</p>



<p>When a customer has licensed one or more of the Sudo Platform services, we create a new Sudo Platform deployment instance for that customer, which contains their specific licensed services. One of Sudo Platform’s unique features is it doesn’t use a shared deployment model (common for SaaS environments). Rather, Sudo Platform deploys environments individually for each customer. This means the customer can customize the environment for their needs, and that customer’s data and processing are completely separate from those of other customers.</p>



<p>Once we have deployed and configured an environment for a customer, we maintain and support it, which includes updating and patching it, and monitoring it 24/7.<br><br><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">Now, head to our whitepaper for specifics on how the Anonyome Platform operates</a></p>



<p>Ready to start building?</p>



<p>Remember, we built&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;so you don’t have to, and we make it easy for you to make it your own. It’s a modular, turnkey collection of services including:</p>

<p>Recent reports from the FBI have shed light on the escalating cyber espionage activities orchestrated by state-sponsored actors, particularly those emanating from China. Case in point — the emergence of the Volt Typhoon botnet, as highlighted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/01/china-hacking-threat-us-volt-typhoon-botnet-fbi-warning">The Guardian</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-china-espionage-hacking-db23dd96cfd825e4988852a34a99d4ea">AP News</a>, underscoring the critical need to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity of digital identities, now more than ever.</p>
 Understanding the Threat Landscape 
<p>The FBI’s warnings regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage activities serve as a stark reminder of the sophisticated tactics employed by cyber adversaries. Coincidently, my last <a>blog</a> covered Midnight Blizzard – Russian nation state attackers on Microsoft. These threats pose significant challenges to national security and underscore the vulnerabilities inherent in identity verification and data protection. This also means the threat landscape is expanding.</p>
 Luckily, the Threat was Prevented 
<p>In this instance, the threat was thwarted before an incident occurred. In the case of the Midnight Blizzard attack on Microsoft, we were not so lucky. The warnings come as a shot across the collective bow for all organizations and serve as a reminder that this will not be the last time a foreign entity or any other hacker will target the vulnerable.</p>
<p>So, what are organizations to do to keep themselves out of the headlines? Not a huge surprise, but first we must all keep up with applying security patches and up-to-date versions of the OS and application layers. To restate the obvious, good system management hygiene is a must.</p>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth is that bad actors log in as frequently or even more often than using some sophisticated hack to gain access. Many organizations are minimizing dependence on passwords, but they are finding that the big challenge is addressing the many authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Windows Hello for Business conveniently supports passwordless access within the Microsoft platform, but try getting this to work with Mac OS, Linux or even your VPN. Domain controllers and virtual machines, for example, also continue to depend on passwords. To the delight of hackers, the resulting “passwordless strategy” resembles Swiss Cheese more so than it does a Swiss Army knife supporting the broad range of needs enterprise wide.</p>
<p>So, on the path to eliminating passwords it’s the diversity of information technology that needs to be managed, and for good reason. Most enterprise IT environments evolved over decades as did security standards. There should be little to no expectation that somehow magically all ways of authenticating into this morass would happen with some type of hand waving let alone a black box that effortlessly solves all unanticipated authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Identity, it turns out, isn’t sufficiently managed with a password, an SMS code or the knowledge of mother’s maiden name. This is not new … a long list of three letter acronyms including IGA, SSO, PAM, and IAM all recognize identity as a corporate asset that needs to be managed and governed. None, however, seem able to keep up with the unrelenting attacks using social engineering and pirated account credentials. You just need to read the headlines to know this.</p>
 Closing the Open Door 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we’ve always approached passwordless MFA as a feature, but we’ve viewed the root cause authentication issue as a business challenge revolving around identity. We solved that by performing identity verification and then generating as an artifact a non-phishable passwordless MFA credential with liveness detection.</p>
<p>But as our passwordless journey continued, something interesting happened. We found that placing identity outside of the application platforms and providing for various levels of identity assurance tuned to the risk of the digital interaction helped us rapidly evolve our identity and authentication platform to address the constant stream of use cases that surfaced in just about every customer deployment.</p>
<p>It turns out that not everybody wants an app, not everybody owns a mobile device, and some work environments outright prohibit the use of mobile handsets. By offering identity verification and authentication in a single privacy-by-design platform we’ve provided ourselves and our customers an elegant way to systematically accommodate the unexpected, and in a sense, hardest-to-solve authentication use cases.</p>
<p>This approach to identity modernization quickly augments core identity and access management to mitigate risk, reduce technical debt, and enhance access controls, effectively closing the open door that many hackers walk through unchallenged. By way of example, it’s why we’ve been able to rapidly release app-less authentication, browser-based identity verification journeys and most recently BlockID 1Key, a biometric security key.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe that by integrating identity proofing, credential verification, and strong authentication, we equip organizations with the tools and insights needed to combat identity-based attacks effectively – and in ways not possible before.</p>
<p>Through a collaborative and identity-centric approach to security, we help organizations bolster their resilience and navigate through this digital storm unleashed by sophisticated attackers like those behind Volt Typhoon.</p>
 Prepare Now for What May Come 
<p>Given the advanced warnings from the FBI regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage, we were lucky this time. But this sequence of events telegraphs the dangers that live among us and should serve as a battle cry for heightened security measures, starting with identity verification at first and every login … for customers, workers, and citizens.</p>
<p>Embracing innovative technologies that in turn enable rapid business innovation … it’s the path forward to reduce risk and deliver order-of-magnitude business improvement. It’s the logical path forward for organizations that thrive on the speed of innovation and want to de-risk their business plan by modernizing and simplifying identity and access management. It’s this bright future we at 1Kosmos envision for all organizations navigating digital transformation and the delivery of digital services.</p>

  <p>In November 2023 at <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/07952ef8-8603-4a94-8185-975ae95e53bb?source=sessions">Microsoft Ignite</a>, we announced Microsoft-managed policies and the auto-rollout of multifactor authentication (MFA)-related Conditional Access&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">policies</a> in customer tenants. Since then, we’ve rolled out report-only policies for over 500,000 tenants. These policies are part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative,</a>&nbsp;which includes key engineering advances to improve security for customers against cyberthreats that we anticipate will increase over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follow-up blog will dive deeper into these policies to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what they entail and how they function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft admin portals 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admin accounts with elevated privileges are more likely to be attacked, so enforcing MFA for these roles protects these privileged administrative functions. This policy covers 14 admin roles that we consider to be highly privileged, requiring administrators to perform multifactor authentication when signing into Microsoft admin portals. This policy targets Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per-user MFA is when users are enabled individually and are required to perform multifactor authentication each time they sign in (with some exceptions, such as when they sign in from trusted IP addresses or when the remember MFA on trusted devices feature is turned on). For customers who are licensed for Entra ID P1, Conditional Access offers a better admin experience with many additional features, including <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups">user group</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps">application</a> targeting, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions">more conditions</a> such as risk- and device-based, integration with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">authentication strengths</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session">session controls</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-report-only">report-only mode</a>. This can help you be more targeted in requiring MFA, lowering end user friction while maintaining security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers users with per-user MFA. These users are targeted by Conditional Access and are now required to perform multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It aids organizations’ transition to Conditional Access seamlessly, ensuring no disruption to end user experiences while maintaining a high level of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy targets licensed users with Entra ID P1 and P2, where the security defaults policy isn't enabled and there are less than 500 per-user MFA enabled enabled/enforced users. There will be no change to the end user experience due to this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication and reauthentication for risky sign-ins 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will help your organization achieve the Optimal level for Risk Assessments in the NIST <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> because it provides a key layer of added security assurance that triggers only when we detect high-risk sign-ins. “High-risk sign-in” means there is a very high probability that a given authentication request isn't the authorized identity owner and could indicate brute force, password spray, or token replay attacks. By dynamically responding to sign-in risk, this policy disrupts active attacks in real-time while remaining invisible to most users, particularly those who don’t have high sign-in risk. When Identity Protection detects an attack, your users will be prompted to self-remediate with MFA and reauthenticate to Entra ID, which will reset the compromised session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks%22%20/l%20%22sign-in-risk-detections">Learn more about sign-in risk</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers all users in Entra ID P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled, all active users are already registered for MFA, and there are enough licenses for each user. As with all policies, ensure you exclude any break-glass or service accounts to avoid locking yourself out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies have been created in all eligible tenants in Report-only mode. These policies are suggestions from Microsoft that organizations can adapt and use for their own environment. Administrators can view and review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>. To enhance the policies, administrators are encouraged to add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>. Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state. For additional customization needs, administrators have the flexibility to clone the policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Call to Action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't wait – take action now. Enable the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies now and/or customize the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies according to your organizational needs. Your proactive approach to implementing multifactor authentication policies is crucial in fortifying your organization against evolving security threats.

<p>In an era where data security and privacy are paramount, the use of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) in distributed ID and payment card printers is not just a recommendation but a necessity. These small hardware-based security modules serve as the sentinels guarding sensitive information in a digital age.</p>
<p>Security Significance of Trusted Platform Modules</p>
<p>At its core, a Trusted Platform Module is a dedicated microcontroller chip integrated into a device’s motherboard or system-on-a-chip. Its primary function is to secure and safeguard critical data, cryptographic keys, and system integrity. TPMs adhere to established industry standards and offer a range of cryptographic operations. They generate, store, and protect cryptographic keys and execute operations like digital signatures and card issuance. One of the most critical aspects of a TPM is its ability to provide <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5254641">Secure Boot processes</a>, ensuring that the device’s firmware and operating system remain unaltered and authentic. This fundamental feature prevents attackers from compromising the system at its root, thereby establishing trust from the ground up.</p>
<p>Government institutions worldwide recognize the necessity of Trusted Platform Modules in safeguarding sensitive data and critical infrastructure. In the U.S., <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final">all devices connecting to government networks are mandated to incorporate TPMs</a> as part of their security standards. These modules play a crucial role in protecting classified information, securing communications, and mitigating potential breaches. Government systems equipped with TPMs are not only more secure but also enable remote attestation, meaning that their status can be verified and authenticated by trusted entities. This is essential for ensuring that the device’s software and firmware have not been tampered with, guaranteeing the utmost security.</p>
<p>Imperative for ID and Payment Card Printers</p>
<p>Without a TPM, devices such as ID and payment card printers become susceptible to rising security threats. Hackers, malicious software, and unauthorized users can exploit vulnerabilities in these systems, potentially leading to devastating consequences:</p>
 
 Data Breaches: Sensitive personal and financial information, including ID and payment card data, can be compromised, resulting in identity theft and financial fraud. 
 Counterfeit Cards: Fraudsters may take advantage of unsecured printers to produce counterfeit identification and payment cards, posing a severe risk to both individuals and institutions. 
 System Tampering: The absence of Secure Boot processes leaves systems open to firmware attacks, making them more susceptible to malware and unauthorized access. 
 
<p>The inclusion of Trusted Platform Modules in distributed ID and payment card printers is a necessity. Government institutions understand the imperative need for TPMs in safeguarding sensitive information, and the same principle applies to banks, universities, and enterprises. The absence of TPMs leaves these entities exposed to security vulnerabilities that could have severe consequences.</p>
<p>By integrating TPMs into their systems, organizations can fortify their defenses against data breaches, counterfeiting, and system tampering. These modules, with their technical prowess and cryptographic capabilities, offer a solid foundation for robust security in the digital age, ensuring the trustworthiness of the devices that shape our lives. Entrust is the only provider globally using Trusted Platform Modules across our latest line of issuance systems.

<p>In recent months, ransomware attacks have gained attention and become a top concern across multiple industries. The threat has affected many well-known brands, ranging from cable providers and aircraft manufacturers to mortgage servicers and title insurance companies. Ransomware is a type of malware used to infect computers and encrypt data. Once infected, the ransomware attempts to spread to connected systems. This can include computers accessible on the network, shared drives, and backups. The goal of the attack is to render data and applications unusable for the victim until a ransom is paid.</p>
<p>According to Corvus Insurance, ransomware leak site victims reached a <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-victims-record-november/">record-high in November</a>: a 39% increase from the prior month and a 110% increase year-over-year. The report suggests the uptick was largely due to LockBit and the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4966">CVE 2023-4966 Citrix Bleed vulnerability</a>. The exploit allows threat actors to circumvent password requirements and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to hijack legitimate user sessions for harvesting credentials and accessing data. On November 21, 2023, the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also issued this <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-325a">advisory</a>.</p>
<p>For financial services organizations, ransomware attacks can be particularly damaging. In August 2023, real estate brokers and agents in the U.S. suffered from an <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/commentary/mls-cyberattack-a-wake-up-call-for-all-leaders">attack</a> that took 23 multiple listing service (MLS) systems offline. MLS systems are private databases created, maintained, and funded by real estate professionals to help clients buy and sell properties. In November, one of the largest <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/mr-cooper-data-breach-impacts-14-7-million-individuals/">mortgage servicers</a> in the U.S. experienced an outage impacting millions and homeowners were unable to submit mortgage payments. Weeks later, two large title insurance providers in the U.S. and UK were attacked and closing transactions were delayed. In early January, one of the largest non-bank lenders was also <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/loandepot-ransomware-exposes-17M-people/705169/">attacked</a>.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of a ransomware attack? Depending on the industry, the answer will vary. To understand the scope of impact, consider these two sample customer transactions: An iced latte beverage versus a residential piece of real estate. While the first is likely the smallest purchase a customer may make in a single day, the other may be the largest single purchase they make in their lifetime. If the ice cubes used for making the latte represent data, a real estate financing transaction is an iceberg. The volume of personally identifiable information (PII) involved with buying and selling a home and making monthly loan payments make real estate, mortgage, and title firms highly sought-after targets for would-be attackers.</p>
<p>The Ice Cube</p>
<p>When a national coffee chain is subjected to a ransomware attack, customers are likely to face temporary inconveniences. Systems may go offline. Point-of-sale systems for credit cards may be unavailable until the recovery process is complete. Perhaps loyalty rewards information or some confidential data is exfiltrated. If it is determined that a material breach occurred, the compliance team will act in accordance with state and federal breach notification laws. The impacted organization will notify, within a required timeframe upon discovery of the incident, the attorney general for each state in which affected customers reside. Impacted customers will subsequently receive a notification. If PII is stolen or lost for certain customers, those individuals may be offered free credit monitoring for a designated period.</p>
<p>The Iceberg</p>
<p>For a mortgage lender or title agency experiencing a ransomware attack, the incident response process is similar. However, the downstream impact can have significantly greater consequences. For those in the process of buying or selling a home, closings may be delayed. Outages may prevent appraisers from uploading reports. Title companies may be unable to disburse funds from escrow. Seller proceeds, mortgage payoff amounts, real estate agent commissions, and other payments will be delayed until systems are fully restored. The homeowner may be unable to make their monthly loan payment online. A mortgage servicer may be unable to receive borrower payments.</p>
<p>For most borrowers in the U.S., the mortgage servicer also facilitates the property tax and insurance payments on behalf of the homeowner. For these escrowed loans, the impact of a ransomware incident could disrupt real estate tax payments to counties and payments toward homeowner insurance policy premiums. The extent to which stolen data is used for other purposes beyond extortion, such as identity theft or credit card fraud, may also remain largely undetermined for an extended period.</p>
<p>The real estate mortgage and financing ecosystem depends on moving large sums of money in a timely manner between multiple transaction participants. Whether delayed mortgage payments or delayed real estate agent commissions, the immediate impact of a ransomware incident on a financial services organization can be substantial. A sustained outage could affect loan amortization schedules, interest calculations, and principal balances. To facilitate funding new mortgages, lenders regularly sell loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In turn, these GSEs offer mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which consist of a group of mortgages organized to pay interest like a mortgage bond. The mission for these entities is to help provide liquidity and stability to the U.S. housing market. Listed as one of 16 critical infrastructure <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/financial-services-sector">sectors</a> by CISA, financial services firms play an integral role in ensuring economic stability.</p>
<p>From making their smallest purchase in a single day to the largest single purchase of their lifetime, a customer’s expectations regarding data protection will vary. Leaking a customer’s latte purchase history is not a desired outcome; however, the theft of data containing a borrower’s credit history, income, bank account number, and transcripts of past tax returns is exponentially less preferred. A substandard approach to securing transactions for this segment of the industry can create dangerously high levels of risk. The real estate financing industry plays a vital role in helping individuals achieve home ownership, and customer data protection efforts should be considered accordingly.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Preparation, Prevention, and Mitigation</p>
<p>CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide">#StopRansomware Guide</a> provides ransomware and data extortion preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices. Preparation best practices focus on backups, incident response plans, and implementing a Zero Trust architecture. For prevention and mitigation best practices, CISA groups by initial access vectors, such as phishing and compromised credentials. Highlights from CISA’s recommendations include:</p>
 
 Maintain Frequent Backups: Encrypt backups of critical data and store them on separate devices inaccessible from a network. 
 Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): Organizations should consider implementing a Zero Trust architecture to prevent unauthorized access to data and services. 
 Update and Patch Systems: Ensure applications and operating systems have the latest patches and updates. Updates should be obtained directly from vendor sites rather than clicking on email links. Enable automatic software updates and do not use end-of-life software. 
 Email: If you are unsure whether an email is legitimate, CISA recommends verifying the email’s legitimacy by contacting the sender directly.

For more information, see the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/reports/gartner-mq">2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management</a> recognizing Entrust as a Challenger. 
 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-certificates/verified-mark-certificates">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> are digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails. A common delivery method for ransomware is phishing. Real estate brokerages, lenders, and title agencies leveraging VMCs can prove to their transaction participants that emails received are indeed from the sending organization and not spoofed emails. VMCs also help reduce the risk of wire transfer fraud and seller impersonation fraud. 
 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography">Post-Quantum Readiness</a> – Long-lived data, such as property ownership history and mortgage loan servicing information, are at greater risk of the “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” threat. Within the decade, quantum computing capabilities powerful enough to break public key encryption protocols are expected. Organizations involved in the real estate financing industry should take steps now to protect sensitive data, applications, and transactions.

<p>Bluesky is building an open social network where anyone can contribute, while still providing an easy-to-use experience for users. For the past year, we used invite codes to help us manage growth while we built features like moderation tooling, custom feeds, and more. Now, we’re ready for anyone to join.</p>
 
    <a href="https://bsky.app/">Sign up for Bluesky</a>
 
<p>Join more than three million people discussing news, sharing art, and just posting.</p>
 What is Bluesky? 
<p>To mark the occasion, we teamed up with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davis.social">Davis Bickford</a>, an artist on the network, to share why we’re excited about Bluesky.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>To learn more about Bluesky and how to get started, read our <a>user FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>And if deep dives are more your style, we worked with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/martin.kleppmann.com">Martin Kleppman</a>, author of Designing Data-Intensive Applications and technical advisor to Bluesky, to write <a href="https://bsky.social/about/bluesky-and-the-at-protocol-usable-decentralized-social-media-martin-kleppmann.pdf">a paper that goes into more detail</a> about the technical underpinnings of Bluesky.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>We’ve been working on more features that put you in control of your social media experience. Here’s what you can expect to see soon:</p>
 Stackable Moderation Services 
<p>Safety is core to social media. Bluesky moderates the app according to our community guidelines, and our vision for <a>composable moderation</a> allows users to stack more moderation services together, such as subscribable moderation lists.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we’re excited to release the labeling services which will allow users to stack more options on top of their existing moderation preferences. This will allow other organizations and people to run their own moderation services that can account for industry-specific knowledge or specific cultural norms, among other preferences.</p>
<p>One potential use case for labeling is fact-checking. For example, a fact-checking organization can run a labeling service and mark posts as “partially false,” “misleading,” or other categories. Then, users who trust this organization can subscribe to their labels. As the user scrolls through posts in the app, any labels that the fact-checking organization publishes will be visible on the post itself. This helps in the effective distribution of the fact-check and keeps users better informed.</p>
<p>We’ll be sharing more in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you’re interested in partnering with Bluesky and setting up a labeling service, contact us at <a href="mailto:partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz">partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz</a>.</p>
 An Open Social Network 
<p>When you log in to Bluesky, it might look and feel familiar — the user experience should be straightforward. But under the hood, we’ve designed the app in a way that puts control back in your hands. Here, your experience online isn’t controlled by a single company. Whether it's your timeline or content filters, on Bluesky, you can easily customize your social experience.</p>
<p>This month, we’ll be rolling out an experimental early version of “federation,” or the feature that makes the network so open and customizable. On Bluesky, you’ll have the freedom to choose (and the right to leave) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships can go with you.</p>
<p>For developers: We’ve already federated the network among multiple servers internally, and later this month, you’ll be able to self-host a server that connects to the main production network. You’ll be part of the first batch of servers that federate with the network, so expect to experiment alongside us! We’ll share more information on how to join the production network with your own server soon. In the meantime, you can test out your server set up via our developer sandbox. <a href="https://www.docs.bsky.app/blog/federation-sandbox">Find instructions here</a>.</p>

				  The first 2024<a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/"> Indicio Identity Community Meetup</a> saw Michael Zuriek of SITA and Heather Dahl of Indicio analyze the rapid digital transformation in travel and hospitality driven by the deployment of digital travel credentials. 
 Watch the recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here.</a>  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Indicio Identity Community Meetup kicked off its first discussion of 2024 with Michael Zuriek, Head of Innovation for Digital Travel at SITA, and Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio, diving into the ways verifiable credential technology will transform the experience of travel for everyone — passengers, airlines, airports, and governments.</p>
<p>First, some context. Indicio and SITA are partners who <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">successfully developed and deployed a Digital Travel Credential (DTC)</a> following International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.</p>
<p>Why is this a revolutionary technology for travel?</p>
<p>A paradigm shift is coming: Seamless travel</p>
<p>For years, countries have been storing traveler data in centralized databases and using complex agreements and policies to share that information to make travel possible. It’s why there are so many hoops travelers have to jump through when crossing borders.</p>
<p>Now, with a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) that follows ICAO’s global standard for storing identity data on personal mobile devices, there is no need for this complex, cumbersome system to facilitate border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the DTC allows security to simply scan the traveler’s digital information, in a fraction of the time of using a manual, paper-based system. And it provides a way to pre-authorize travel and check in before the traveler leaves home.</p>
<p>We have been conditioned to wait; but automation can severely reduce the bottlenecks in airports.</p>
<p>Dahl described using a DTC to pass through Aruba’s immigration as “almost magical.”: The system was so efficient and seamless that the border guard had waved her through before she was even aware of what was happening. The DTC allowed her paperwork and identity to be verified ahead of time and a biometric scan at the airport checked that she was the correct individual tied to that travel information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every traveler to Aruba will soon be able to have the same experience as the island implements DTC-enabled technology.</p>
<p>By using a DTC for all the touchpoints at an airport where identity needs to be checked, passengers get a much quicker experience, while airports, airlines, and governments benefit from the verified data, simplified privacy compliance, and enhanced security that comes from decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Airports have already invested significantly into biometrics when Covid hit, we could see rapid adoption of the DTC as some of the hardware is already in place.</p>
<p>The EU, US, IATA, and other governments and industry organizations are all currently working on bringing biometrics and digital travel together. Because Indicio and SITA’s DTC works on any airport system, deployment of the DTC will be rapid. The DTC makes biometric technology work much more efficiently and effectively, while simplifying data privacy compliance. And, on a practical level, as airports are an industry of fragmented IT systems, ease of adoption and integration is a critical value proposition. As many airports have biometric investments, the DTC is an easy way to capitalize on these investments and improve processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few of takeaways from the conversation; if you have time, I highly recommend you watch the full recording which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here</a>. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Get in touch</a> with <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> today to get the DTC for your business.</p>
<p>Join us for the next meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup, where we’ll be speaking with Klaeri Schelhowe, Executive Director of Trust Alliance New Zealand and their Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project a tool that enables farmers, farm enterprises, and industry organizations to manage critical farm data in an efficient and secure way.</p>

<p>There’s been quite a buzz about Zero Trust in the last couple of years. Its genesis dates back to 2009, when the then Forrester Research analyst John Kindervag popularized the term when presenting the idea that an organization should not extend trust to anything inside or outside its perimeters. However, Zero Trust is still not a theme that resonates with all IT security experts. There are some who find it too fuzzy and non-deterministic, given that it is more akin to a philosophy or organizational strategy than a prescriptive certification that can be followed to the letter.</p>
<p>Zero Trust Principles – A Look Back in Time</p>
<p>We concluded that Zero Trust is firmly rooted in traditional well-established security design principles. We reached out to our Director of Product Security, Pali Surdhar, to get his view on Zero Trust. Pali forwarded a vintage document for our edification. The document “<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/R01/75-protection.pdf">The Protection of Information in Computer Systems</a>,” authored by Jerome H. Saltzer and Michael D. Schroeder, was published a mere 49 years ago in 1975. This was a time when computers were the preserve of universities, industry, and governments, and usually so big that they needed a large room to accommodate them. It was a time when Gates, Allen, Jobs, and Wozniak were just fledgling computer enthusiasts about to start their transformational journey in personal computing.</p>
<p>A quote from the abstract section of the paper gives a flavor of the content. “[this paper] examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysis of protected subsystems and protected objects.”</p>
<p>Security Principles Circa 1975</p>
<p>The paper then introduces three security categories:</p>
 
 Unauthorized information release 
 Unauthorized information modification 
 Unauthorized denial of use 
 
<p>These terms still resonate, although today we’d probably describe them as data breach, code hacking, and finally, Denial of Service, or perhaps a ransomware attack, where a bad actor has taken measures to lock out the authorized user.</p>
<p>The paper then provides examples of security techniques sometimes applied to computer systems. We thought it would be worthwhile translating into today’s cybersecurity terminology.</p>

Access Control List – defines who has access to a system or application. Authorization and authentication could apply here too.
Yes


Verifying the identity of a prospective user by demanding a password
Password verification or even passwordless MFA
Yes


Shielding the computer to prevent interception and subsequent interpretation of electromagnetic radiation
Side channel attacks. Typically require an antenna or probe within close proximity of a device to eavesdrop by analyzing electromagnetic signals.
N/A


Enciphering information sent over telephone lines
Encryption, probably using TLS or similar. Refer to our last blog post <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/harvest-now-decrypt-later-fact-or-fiction/">Harvest Now, Decrypt Later – Fact or Fiction</a> for more information.
Yes


Locking the room containing the computer
Access control, defense in depth, secure room/vault, etc. These security measures are all still in use today.
Yes


Controlling who is allowed to make changes to the computer system (both its hardware and software)
Least privilege principle – only giving access to those who have the correct clearance and need access to the system
Yes


Using redundant circuits or programmed cross-checks that maintain security in the face of hardware or software failures
High availability would typically be used today with hardware devices having a backup device ready to continue service should a failure occur. Software can be designed with similar fault tolerance.
N/A


Certifying that the hardware and software are actually implemented as intended
In today’s IT environment this would involve a combination of internal quality assurance, security testing, and approval of hardware or software design. In addition, the code or hardware could be submitted to a third party for penetration testing and product certification against industry standards such as FIPS 140-2/3 or PCI DSS. Given today’s complex software and hardware systems, knowing the provenance of the components is essential. This is achieved through bills of materials, code signing, and security processors in hardware.
Yes



<p>So while the language used is reflective of the time it was written, we think you’ll agree that most of the ideas conveyed are security principles that equally apply in today’s modern distributed architectures.</p>
<p>NIST, CSA, and the CIA Triad</p>
<p>For those not inclined to read the 59-page NIST <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">SP 800-207</a> document, here are the seven core tenets of Zero Trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Building on the NIST publication, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has recently published its <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/zero-trust-guiding-principles/">Zero Trust Guiding Principles</a>. For anyone who wants to get up the learning curve on Zero Trust without digging too much into the weeds, it is an excellent read. It is also reassuring that the CSA Zero Trust Working Group are of the same opinion as us:</p>
<p>“Zero Trust is a collection of long-standing principles applied in a way that aligns the security architecture with the way we work and live.“</p>
<p>The CSA document then provides a list of the security principles critical to the success of your Zero Trust effort:</p>
 
 Concept of least-privilege access controls (e.g., preventative) 
 Separation of duties (e.g., preventative) 
 Segmentation/micro-segmentation (e.g., preventative) 
 Logging and monitoring (e.g., detective) 
 Configuration drift remediation (e.g., corrective/reactive) 
 
<p>While the term Zero Trust was coined by Kindervag 34 years after the Saltzer &amp; Schroeder paper, we think you’ll agree that many of those principles align with the 1975 document.</p>
<p>And while things have certainly changed since 1975, when computers were monolithic and had limited networking capabilities (think remote users connecting in from terminals), the concerns about security were the same: protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Hopefully most of you will be familiar with the CIA triad, another cybersecurity fundamental.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Unchanging Need for Robust Security</p>
<p>Today, while the concerns remain the same, the complexity of compute environments has greatly increased. For example, in current environments, systems can be spread out across multiple clouds, software systems consist of many microservices, and data resides everywhere, just to name a few of the complexities. Additionally, today’s users not only consist of internal computer users sitting at their desks with directly connected terminals, but also potentially anyone, anywhere on the planet, accessing these complex systems via the internet.</p>
<p>The problem, and the strategy to mitigate the problem, have remained somewhat unchanged over the years. It is just the scale of the problem that has changed. Saltzer and Schroeder knew that the identity of a user needed to be established. They specified using a password for this. At the time with the limited access (no wide area network) this was sufficient. Today users (and adversaries) can access systems from anywhere. This makes establishing identity require something more than a strong password.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Saltzer and Schroeder talked about locking their 1970s computer room (i.e., protecting the perimeter), they recognized that wasn’t in itself sufficient. In today’s world of distributed users and a multitude of devices wanting access, those physical walls have been replaced by a virtual perimeter, making it even harder to protect and further emphasizing the need for alternative approaches. Zero Trust therefore does not focus on perimeter defense, but instead advocates for strong identity (never trust, always verify) and micro-segmentation (to avoid lateral movement through the network). Sometimes what’s old is new, and that is because we have had a good thing all along.</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In this third blog of a 4-part series we are sharing a speculative future scenario based around a network of distributed bioregional banks. The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;three.</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">Blog&nbsp;2</a>)  What could a desirable future scenario actually look&nbsp;like?  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel system? (Please see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">Blog&nbsp;4</a>)   Part 3 (of 4): Imagining the distributed, bioregional banks of the&nbsp;future <p>In the previous two blogs we have been exploring monetary challenges and proposing some design principles that could underpin a response. In this post we are shifting to a more creative and imaginative space. The future is unlikely to unfold in a form that we can cognitively envision. If we accept that position then it might feel pointless to engage with imaginative scenarios or foresight exercises. On the other hand, it can be interesting to form a series of working hypotheses (or perhaps stories of change) that we can use as testing grounds for our current thinking. From there, we hope to move to a space of creative vulnerability where we dare to bring some of those thought experiments to life. It is highly likely that some of the ideas presented below won’t work. It is also likely that we will learn something important from each iteration, as we continually loop between what we can understand now and the edges of our potential.</p><p>This speculative proposition is centred on the idea of a series of distributed, bioregional banks. However, these next generation institutions will bear little resemblance to our current conception of a bank. In essence they will be stewardship interfaces that exist in service of the regenerative potential of their base region. When linked together via contextually respectful exchange rates they will realign our economic systems in service of planetary vitality. Ultimately the aspiration would be to create a new global reserve currency which itself is regenerative and decolonised by&nbsp;design.</p><p>What if a distributed bioregional bank actually&nbsp;existed?</p><p>It’s easy to find fault with our current banking system but what would we propose as an alternative? What would these distributed institutions actually do? Who would be involved and in what capacity? As a starting point to open this conversation up, we have been thinking about three stewardship functions that could be part of the remit of these next generation banks. We are framing these ideas as a story that is unfolding to try and illustrate how it might feel to interact with these future&nbsp;banks.</p>Image: Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs¹<blockquote>1. Multivalent currencies</blockquote><p>The future banks will be part of a vibrant ecosystem of decentralised multivalent currencies. The issuance and use of these diverse, infinite and resource-backed tokens will build a dynamic understanding of the integrity of the ecosystem as a whole. The key functions of the tokens will be fourfold:</p>  To demonstrate invisible or overlooked value&nbsp;flows;  To gather sensory inputs from different elements of the ecosystem;  To account for individual and collective contributions to the ecosystem’s health;  To form the basis for the overall RegenCoin for the bioregion.  <p>To illustrate how this might work we can use the example of a river printing its own solidarity tokens. People will receive river tokens in recognition of acts of care provided to the river. This might take the form of collecting rubbish from the river banks, introducing children to the joy of wild swimming or reducing the level of pesticides flowing into the water. Initially the system might be overseen by human guardians who vouch for such actions and communicate them to the Bank. As technologies are refined for this new way of living, a time will come where the river will be able to issue and destroy its own tokens via multi-sensory inputs.</p><p>The motivations for people to value the river tokens will be diverse. In the early days, it might be linked to respect and peer approval. Later, the tokens might become part of a blended measure of contribution that forms the overall currency for the&nbsp;region.</p><blockquote>2. Contextually respectful exchange</blockquote><p>The bank will provide a monetary stewardship function that will restrict the conversion of base assets into convertible tokens so that they align with the regenerative rhythms of the bioregion. For&nbsp;example:</p>  The Bank could regulate the sales of finite elements both within and outside of the bioregion.  The Bank could restrict the issuance of new debt to align with the underlying regenerative health of the region. Different types of debt could be issued that could only be used to buy or invest into specific classes of living agents (‘assets’ in today’s terminology). For example, on aggregate the bank would only issue debt for lumber processing activities that were forecast to be at a regenerative level for the region’s forests over the term of the&nbsp;loan.  The bank could designate taxes to be paid in a mix of specified tokens. This mix could be rebalanced periodically to incentivise the behaviours which are optimal for the fluid health of the ecosystem.  <blockquote>3. Probabilistic, participatory governance models</blockquote><p>The Bank’s governance systems will be based on Bayesian inference models. This is a form of dynamic statistical modelling that allows an initial set of assumptions to continually update depending on the information it receives. Critically, the output will be a blended result combining automatic sensory data inputs with the emotional values of the living community. For example, if a community upregulates the importance of river health then the overall value of the RegenCoin would fall if other activities were negatively impacting it.</p><p>These future bank activities can feel a bit flat and detached without a contextual grounding. One idea to bring them to life is to imagine how they could play out under different scenarios. We are suggesting two examples below and would be very curious to hear other ideas or interpretations:</p>  A house owner gifts their property back to nature: in this example a resident of the Bioregion decides that the area where their house has been built should be re-wilded in the interests of the bioregion’s health. When the resident nullifies their previous ownership rights, it will trigger a series of sensory credits to their RegenWallet. The regenerative generosity of the act will be upregulated by human and more-than-human voices. The result will be an amount of newly created RegenCoin being available to build a house in a more sensitive location.  A company tries to game the system to create rights over carbon credits: in this more negative example, we can imagine that a profit seeking company might want to manipulate the system for private gains. Their strategy might be to plant a dense area of trees to maximise their carbon credibility. However, as the sensory inputs are invisible, they would not know how their choice of tree species or location would be valued by the soil, pollinators or the trees themselves. In seeking to generate profits rather than regenerative potential they might in fact generate a negative&nbsp;return.  <p>Sitting in front of a computer in 2024, the scenario that we have outlined above might seem far fetched. If you take a deep breath, soften your gaze and meditate for a second on the extraordinary, complex beauty of life, perhaps it feels a little less fanciful. So much of the living world is beyond our cognitive understanding but entirely open to our sensory perception. To us this feels like both an invitation and a call to action. We already have the technological power of gods and we can choose to direct it in service of life. Grounding this aspiration in a practical context is the next important step in this journey. In our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">final blog</a> we will therefore begin exploring tangible elements of the scenario that we can start to build and test&nbsp;now.</p><p>We are incredibly heartened and grateful for all the messages that we have received so far in response to these blogs. We are still reading through some of the material and will aim to incorporate (and credit) these generous contributions wherever possible. One suggestion is to convene some online studios where we can begin sharing and exploring ideas — we are fully open to&nbsp;others.</p><p>This blog was written by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>).

<p></p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Hi, I am Rob MacDonald, vice president of product marketing here at 1Kosmos, and today I’m joined by Huzefa, co-founder and COO of 1Kosmos. How are you doing today Huzefa?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>I am doing great, Rob. It’s a Friday, so never better.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>It’s Friday, you’re in New Jersey, I heard it snowed a little bit this week, I hope you’re keeping warm.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>When you talk about snow, you’re in Canada, so I cannot talk to you about snow. We got a little bit of a sprinkling, that’s it.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Fair enough. All right, well listen, today, thanks for joining us, or joining me. We just made a recent announcement of a new integration partner, Amazon Cognito. So, before we talk about all the goodness of what we’re doing with Cognito, why don’t you tell me a little bit about what it is? What is Cognito?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, Cognito is a single sign-on platform, an IdP provider that Amazon Web Services provides, especially if you are building your applications on the AWS platform, this is the native integration that the AWS provides out of the box. So, Cognito is widely used across applications, individual applications that may be developed and have their own ecosystems within the AWS network.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Cool. So, interesting. Where is AWS deployed within an organization? So, you said it’s an IdP, I think everybody that’s probably listening to these understands what an IdP is, but where do you typically find it? Because, when we think workforce in particular, there’s Okta and Microsoft and ForgeRock and Ping. Where’s Cognito, where do you find that?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>They primarily operate in the customer identity and access management or CIAM space today. So, they have not published essentially their numbers of their deployment, but it’s pretty vastly adopted. So, any kind of a public facing application which is hosted on AWS application, and if they would not have a custom integration to be done on Okta or Microsoft, Amazon says, here you go, you can use AWS Cognito.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, the primary use case for this would be a CIAM type of initiative, somebody’s put some application on AWS, and then this is the identity management portion of that application, is that what I understood?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Makes sense. So, what motivated either 1Kosmos to partner with AWS or AWS to partner with 1Kosmos? How did that come to be?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, identity is our motivation. We’ve made some significant deployments in the CIAM space recently. 2023 has been a great year for us in that particular sense. And our customers were essentially looking for, hey, do you have these integrations with AWS Cognito that you provide out of box? Their footprint is pretty vast, which I got to know. And that has led to us building this integration with them and providing a more out of box solution with them as well.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, that’s amazing. Everybody knows AWS, everybody knows Amazon, and it’s cool to know that they’re doing this part of their business as well. So, we are now considered an AWS advanced technology partner. So, what specifically does that mean?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, our integration today with AWS is around us being a strong authentication for them. Meaning, if you need to do either multifactor authentication, if you want to do passwordless, if you want to have passkeys that you can deploy on your application that is supported by AWS Cognito, here you go. We are the partner of choice that you can go to. So, it’s pretty significant because most of the applications are now being mandated from a compliance standpoint that, hey, you need to have either Strong MFA or support passwordless passkeys in your application deployment stack, and that’s where our integration with AWS Cognito becomes extremely important. I just wanted to add that we want to continue this particular integration and develop further stories, more on the other sides of pieces that we have, identity proofing and better public mentions, but that is more in the future for us.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, based on what I’ve read on the Amazon Cognito site, they have more of these advanced technology partners. It looks like organizations that are aligned to that have gone through some sort of testing, is that correct? By Amazon?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Yeah, integration as well as testing. So, while anything that we’ve done with AWS, it goes through significant scrutiny and review. So, even this particular integration that we put together, we had to document it. The entire GitHub of this particular technical integration is available. It is referenced in a blog that is published by the AWS community that goes out to anybody, the AWS customer. You can essentially go back and look at it. There are references to the GitHub link as well and what that integration is. But, anyway, all of this was not put together by us. We provided the integration story, but it was reviewed through multiple different channels and reviews. I cannot even recall how many by AWS and published by them.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Well, that’s amazing. So, somebody looking at adding our technology into that stack can be pretty much rest assured that it’s been tested by Amazon to make sure that it works with their technology, and that the integration and implementation of us with Cognito would be seamless.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, if you’re a developer, if you’re watching this, if you have AWS Cognito, feel free to look at the blog. Maybe we can reference it into the link as well when we post this. But, it’s pretty simple, straightforward. You would essentially put a custom auth plugin with 1Kosmos, and there you go. You’ll be able to provide strong MFA or passwordless authentication to your end customers.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Awesome. We take user experience pretty seriously here at 1Kosmos. I guess, I’m sure you would agree with me on that. Everything we do revolves around that and basically privacy. But, it’s commonly known that users will go elsewhere if it’s too hard, if what they came to do wasn’t easy. How does 1Kosmos help Cognito users provide a better experience when they’re dealing with their end users?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, when the experience is, and I always want to highlight that there are two experiences. One is the strong MFA, because we believe in the story of you don’t have to completely take your organization from password to passwordless from day one to day two. You may have a transition period, so strong MFA becomes important. So, we have factored that experience in the entire channel where you can authenticate in Cognito, and then there’s a dialogue box that opens up, which essentially factors in what 1Kosmos provides to you, as any of the strong MFA options that you may have, push notifications, OTP, TOTP, et cetera. For our passwordless and passkeys, we provide an SDK, which again, from an end user standpoint, it seems seamless for them, where all they’re doing is entering their username, their backend API calls that we’re available, that contact 1Kosmos console or gateway that we have, and then we provide, we essentially see if this particular authentication is valid and give the signals back to AWS.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Listen, I think it’s amazing. So, when we look at Amazon Cognito customers, we touched on it earlier, but how easy, or a developer, how easy is it for developers to deploy 1Kosmos into a Cognito instance?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, like I said, you can sign up for a 1Kosmos instance by going to a developer environment. If you have a Cognito instance, you can sign up for a free account for Cognito as well. That is available on the AWS site. There are instructions to develop a custom auth plugin. And on that particular blog we also highlight, and the GitHub repository, what are the steps that you need to essentially use to integrate AWS Cognito with 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, then as a follow on to that question, that obviously sounds relatively easy. How would customers acquire an instance of BlockID? So, it’s like, I like it, I installed it at work, and the testing developer did all the great work. How do I then pay for the instance that I chose?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>We want to make the entire experience easy. So, if you’re a customer in the AWS ecosystem, we are listed on the AWS Marketplace. We have three distinct product lines that are available. So, you can choose any one of them. Most likely it will be around BlockID customer or verify. And you can sign up for the product through AWS Marketplace. You would get your instance, your license keys, et cetera, through that particular portal and you’ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>That’s cool. Listen, Huzefa, I know that you’re super busy as always, and I wanted to thank you for taking the time today to sit down and tell us about this exciting announcement that we made this week. And I wish you the best, and I hope you come back and talk to me again on a vlog soon.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Look forward to it, Robert. Thank you.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, listen, if you want to find out more about this integration, you can check out our website. We’ve got a data sheet and a press release there that you can go take a read and learn more about this Cognito integration. And then, plus, as Huzefa mentioned earlier, there’s a Amazon Cognito blog that you can read as well. We’ll put the links to all of those down below. Thanks again everybody. We’ll see you again shortly.</p>

<p>In 2024, our product vision is to continue delivering solutions that empower not only issuers, but all ecosystem participants in the tokenization journey to&nbsp;cultivate liquidity and accumulate more users.&nbsp;In our view, to achieve the liquidity endgame, we have to build it up through a few phases: standardization, digitalization, collateralization, distribution, and then reach the liquid secondary market.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Below, I’ll explain how we are turning our product vision into actionable steps to address your technical and operational pain points, smoothly transitioning to new phases, and adding value and services, all while improving liquidity for your investors.</p>
<p>Accelerating standardization phase:&nbsp;The industry now embraces the official token standard ERC-3643 for compliant tokenization. We’re working closely with the ERC3643 Association to swiftly advance standardization. Our focus includes developing key tools like the ERC-3643 DApp, streamlining the effortless deployment and management of ERC3643 tokens, and setting a new benchmark for simplicity in compliant tokenization.</p>
<p>Digitizing real-world assets and securities en masse:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Speeding up time to market:&nbsp;While our contributions to standardization are open-source, the value of Tokeny’s solutions extends beyond smart contract deployment (<a href="https://tokeny.com/what-should-you-expect-from-a-tokenization-platform-in-2024/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">more details here</a>). We are committed to enhancing our APIs and white-label SaaS solutions. Tailored products for diverse segments, ranging from asset managers to Web3 RWA projects, are in development to catalyze the RWA wave and advance the asset digitization phase.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Delivering immediate benefits:&nbsp;Accelerating towards liquidity begins with addressing immediate pain points for institutions. Why tokenize now? It’s all about enhancing operational efficiency and streamlining processes with 3rd parties applications, to slash costs. By solving these points, we can set the stage for bringing enormous high-quality assets on-chain, laying the foundation for the critical mass needed for advanced services, and emphasizing transferability, reach, and liquidity.</p>
 
 Improved operational efficiency:&nbsp;Manual, human-based processes are not just time-consuming but also costly. And it is a common challenge across the entire private market. To tackle this, we’re developing features and smart contracts for various business cases, automating workflows from onboarding, and corporate actions, to secondary tradings. Automation increases operational capability, empowering institutions to reach a larger investor base. 
 Bridging 3rd party digital applications:&nbsp;Another notable challenge arises from the fragmented collaboration between various applications, each operated by different third parties. The multitude of digital applications involved in operations can create gaps when assets are brought on-chain. To address this, our products will continue to connect these disparate solutions, ensuring a cohesive operational workflow between tokenized assets and the involved providers. 
 
<p>3.&nbsp;The powerhouse for major corporations:&nbsp;Our strategy revolves around seamless integration into legacy systems and forming partnerships with tech providers, such as custody solutions, integrators, and financial platforms. Through strategic ecosystem integrations, we empower partners to seamlessly utilize our engine, allowing them to concentrate on their core business and sales while we manage all technical aspects.</p>
<p>Enabling DeFi by building a common data set for private markets:&nbsp;Initiated by accelerating permissioned DeFi, this month, we co-developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/erc-3643-association-members-developed-open-source-ui-components-to-bridge-defi-and-regulated-rwa?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">an open-source UI component</a>&nbsp;with Dev.Pro. With this tool, DeFi is now equipped for regulated assets through ERC-3643, enabling any decentralized exchanges (DEX), automated market makers (AMMs), or lending protocol to provide compliant liquidity or collateralization for tokenized securities and RWA. Regulated entities can even launch their lending smart contracts. Our next move involves building a universal data set for tokenized securities through a product named AssetID, facilitating easy access to verifiable asset data for DeFi applications.</p>
<p>Building the distribution rails: DINO is an interoperable distribution network for digital securities that leverages the ERC-3643 standard. Our commitment to growth extends to integrating additional distribution channels into the DINO ecosystem. Compatibility with centralized exchanges (CEX) and AMMs is seamlessly established on our platform. As we eagerly await more DeFi protocols, the open-source UI component stands ready to welcome them. Think of us as a connector, ensuring a seamless convergence of all distribution rails on our platform.</p>
<p>Secondary market innovation:&nbsp;We will unveil an upgraded version of the Billboard, serving as a license-exempted P2P secondary market solution, enabling investors to seamlessly publish buy or sell intentions, just like placing an ad. Taking it a step further, we will introduce a fully decentralized version of the Billboard, entirely powered by smart contracts. This will allow counterparts to accept an offer directly on-chain, facilitating a peer-to-peer transaction. The offer can circulate across the entire distribution network, visible to all, but only eligible investors for the concerned tokens can accept it.</p>
<p>Exciting times lie ahead, and we look forward to embarking on this journey with you. Stay tuned for more developments throughout the year.</p>

 We can afford what we can actually do — 3 <p>Increasing financial constraints mean families, organisations and Governments are spending less money on the things they want and need, generating a doom spiral of decline. We need to find ways to <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">expand what we can actually do</a> outside of the straitjacket of ‘we can only do what we can afford’. This third blog in a three part series, looks at how we at Mydex are working to expand what we as communities and as a society can actually&nbsp;do..</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-2-96213dd4d546">the second blog</a> in this series we looked at eight interconnected ways of expanding ‘what we can actually do’. They&nbsp;were:</p>  think capabilities (not just targets);  think genuine productivity (not just cuts and savings);  think mutual self help (to escape dependencies on external funders);  think clubs and communities (which provide agency, and not just markets and states, which take it&nbsp;away);  think institutional innovation (not just working within existing institutional constraints);  think genuine investment (and not just financial extraction);  think demonetisation (all the things we can do without money having to change hands);&nbsp;and  think Fair Process (because that’s the best way to do all the&nbsp;above).  <p>Here is how the work we (Mydex) are doing fits this&nbsp;agenda.</p> Think capabilities <p>Mydex’s data sharing platforms are a new form of infrastructure whose whole purpose is to expand what we can actually do with data. This includes expanding what we can do with the data itself (especially in terms of productivity) and, therefore, what we can actually do in terms of the services that this data makes possible. New data capabilities are all about expanding people and organisations’ ability to actually do&nbsp;stuff.</p> Think genuine productivity <p>In our work we enable safe, efficient data sharing and reuse so that the right people and organisations can access and use the right, reliable data at the right times. As our White Paper on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> shows, this cuts a huge amount of FERC (Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost) out of existing processes, enabling people and organisation to do a lot more with the same resources. Everything we do is about enhancing genuine productivity.</p> Think mutual self&nbsp;help <p>Right now, a lot of the work we are doing is in what we call health and care ‘clusters’. This is where many different people and organisations all come together to better address a particular group of peoples’ particular needs. These clusters are a form of mutual self help in practice: different people and organisations coming together to share data and coordinate activities in order to help each other to produce better outcomes.</p> Think clubs and communities <p>The clusters we are working within in health and care are a form of club where everybody contributes their bit and everyone gets their share of the benefits. In addition, we have built an entire platform called Inclued to enable the data sharing that helps people share data and coordinate activities in mutually supportive communities.</p> Think institutional innovation <p>Mydex is a Community Interest Company. Yes, we make and spend money like every other organisation, because we live in a world constrained by ‘we can only do what we can afford’. But we don’t do what we do to make money out of it. We make money in order to invest it in our purpose: to advance the community’s interest when it comes to personal data. Everything about our legal form is designed to ensure this happens. CICs are a continuation of the long tradition of institutional innovation we referred to in the second blog of this series&nbsp;[LINK].</p> Think genuine investment <p>Mydex exists because, thankfully, some genuine investors still exist (as opposed to multiple ‘investor’ saboteurs who are only interested in financial extraction). We wish there were more genuine investors and fewer saboteurs!</p> Think demonetisation <p>One of the things that perplex people about Mydex data platforms is that no money changes hands for data. We are not building a market for data. We enable non-monetised data sharing for mutual benefit. That doesn’t mean it isn’t economically valuable or doesn’t make economic sense. Quite the opposite. Non-monetised data sharing unleashes enormous personal, social and economic value because of the productivity gains it unleashes and the opportunities for innovation it creates. In demonetising data, we are helping to demonetise genuine wealth creation.</p> Think Fair&nbsp;Process <p>Everything about Mydex as infrastructure and as an institution is organised around one thing: giving individuals a real say over how their data is used. Because this data is used to provide most services, this extends to giving people a say in how the services they used are organised and delivered. At one level, personal data stores are a technical solution to a technical data problem. But they are a lot more than that. They are also <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">engines of human&nbsp;rights</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>Throughout their history humans have wrestled with the paradox of having to work within constraints they are confronted with and cannot avoid while also working out ways to lift these constraints.</p><p>Today, increasingly harsh constraints of ‘we can only do what we can afford’ are closing down options for families, organisations and Governments, tipping them into a spiral of decline. That can only mean one thing: the quest to lift those constraints — of finding ways to expand what we can actually do — it also growing in importance as every day goes by. It’s the responsibility of all of us — no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in and no matter what level of responsibility or authority —to look for ways break out of the straitjacket of ‘we can only do what we can afford’ and to find ways to expand ‘what we can actually&nbsp;do’.</p><p>This is our quest. We hope you will join us in pursuing&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/increasing-financial-constraints-mean-families-organisations-and-governments-are-spending-less-e34ffc932dc4">Increasing financial constraints mean families, organisations and Governments are spending less…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>This week, we are thrilled to unveil six distinguished speakers who are at the forefront of the decentralized identity revolution. Their insights and expertise will shape discussions at the European Identity and Cloud Conference, paving the way for a new era of digital identity management.</p>
<p>Why Decentralized Identity?</p>
<p>Decentralized identity represents a paradigm shift, empowering individuals with control over their digital personas. No longer confined to centralized databases, identity becomes user-centric, enhancing privacy and security. Join us in exploring how this transformative approach is reshaping the way we authenticate, authorize, and interact online.</p>
<p>At this year's conference, we explore the practical applications of decentralized identity. Our carefully curated sessions will explore real-world use cases, showcasing successful implementations across industries. From secure authentication processes to streamlined access control, each presentation will offer valuable insights into harnessing the power of decentralized identity.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF74 rewards. DF75 runs Feb 1 — Feb 8,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 74 (DF74) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Jan 25, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 1. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF75 is live today, Feb 1. It concludes on Feb 8. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF75   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF75 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>METAR scores are made in every airport, every hour of the day. Can you predict the next few hours with the highest accuracy?</p><p>2024 marks the 3rd year of the Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Program initiative. ‘Aviation Weather Forecasting Using METAR Data’ is the second data challenge in 2024, and the second opportunity to score points in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges/">Championship Leaderboard</a> for this season. The challenge launches today Feb 1, 2024, with a deadline to participate ending Feb 20, 2024, 23:59:59 UTC. Access to the challenge description and submission guidelines can be found on the <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/18">Desights</a> platform.</p><p>The dataset used for the ‘Aviation Weather Forecasting Using METAR Data’ challenge holds METAR scores that update every hour of every day. at KPIM Miami International Airport. We will only use 1 airport for this data challenge, though METAR is a standard score updated at each airport. The data we use for this challenge is Miami's historical METAR logs from 2014–2023. Recognizing the symmetrical data structure of METAR as a metric, models developed in this challenge will be able to be run in real-time for 1–12hr ahead of present-time predictions for METAR score. This is a unique opportunity for data people to dive into real-world data and uncover insights that could shape the future of aviation safety, understanding, airline efficiency, and pilots driving&nbsp;planes.</p> Challenge Overview <p>Objective: Building upon the insights gained from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), participants in this data science competition will venture into hands-on, real-world artificial intelligence (AI) &amp; machine learning (ML). Their primary objective is to develop advanced models that accurately predict future weather conditions at KMIA (Miami Airport). These AI/ML models become invaluable tools for aviation operations and safety by harnessing the extensive historical METAR&nbsp;data.</p><p>Data Set: Access to the dataset of historical METAR data points is available to download from the Ocean Market via the Mumbai Test Network (Polygon Testnet), and via Polygon Mainnet. You can download the dataset directly through <a href="https://bit.ly/3SONYvf">Desights</a>.</p><p>Machine Learning Model: Participants have free reign to attack their model selection based on their own preferences. Some ideas for Python native ML to include ARIMA/SARIMA using 'statsmodels', LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) Networks using TensorFlow or Keras, Random Forest Regression using scikit-learn, or Gradient Boosting Machines using XGBoost. When implementing these models, you’ll typically start by preprocessing your time series data (e.g., normalization, choosing model weights, etc.), followed by feature engineering (like extracting time components and creating lag features). After that, you can train your model, tune its parameters, and validate its performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or MAPE and pursue the most accurate METAR prediction.</p><p>It’s also a good practice to perform cross-validation to assess the robustness of your model. Given the complexity and variability of METAR data, it might also be beneficial to ensemble different models to improve predictions in prior portions of the data challenge.</p> METAR <p>METAR is a format for reporting weather information. A METAR weather report is predominantly used by aircraft pilots, airlines, observation stations, and <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/science-art-meteorology/">meteorologists</a> who use aggregated METAR information to assist in current general weather forecasting.</p><p>Raw METAR is the most common format in the world for the transmission of observational weather data. It is highly standardized through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO), which allows it to be understood throughout most of the&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://metar-taf.com/explanation">This is how you read a METAR</a></p><p>Additional Clarity: <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/wrh/mesowest/metar_decode_key.pdf">METAR/TAF LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND&nbsp;ACRONYMS</a></p> Prizes <p>In 2024, we’ve increased the prize pool to $10,000 USDC (or recievable in OCEAN) per challenge.

<p>With the Verida Mainnet <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-mainnet-is-live-78fc4ff28561">now live</a>, we’ll soon be launching Verida Storage Credit Token (VDA), the native token of the Verida&nbsp;Network.</p><p>The Verida Storage Credit Token (VDA) creates a data economy enabling secure interactions between accounts to facilitate secure data storage, trusted sharing and fast querying.</p><p>Users can utilize credits to store and exchange data across the network. Storage node operators can stake VDA to provide storage capacity to the network, secure private data and get rewarded.</p> VDA powers the first private data DePIN for&nbsp;web3. <p>Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) are helping build a more crowdsourced or community led creation and operation of public infrastructure. In the same vein, the Verida Network is designed to provide a decentralized private data storage layer for the new self-sovereign data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Read more about how the Verida Network optimizes for speed, authentication and encryption <a href="https://www.verida.network/learn">here</a>.</p><p>The VDA token serves to coordinate resources in this new data-based economy. The network rewards infrastructure operators who supply storage capacity, and end users who bring their personal data onto the&nbsp;network.</p><p>These end user rewards can then be used to pay for storage with network storage providers. Applications built on the network may also choose to sponsor the storage needs of their&nbsp;users.</p><p>As users connect more data, there’s more aggregate value for both the user and network. The value of user data increases as it becomes&nbsp;denser.</p><p>A growing <a href="http://verida.network/ecosystem">ecosystem of partners</a> serve as private data oracles for Verida Network. Users can utilise these providers to take control and ownership of their data and store it privately under their control on the&nbsp;network.</p>Verida Ecosystem<p>Verida’s physical storage node infrastructure provides private encrypted databases, user control over where and how their data is stored, real-time synchronization, permissioned data access, and client-side encryption. This approach ensures decentralization of private data, as well as decentralized control, but without the added shortcomings of uncontrolled public distribution.</p><p>Verida’s open-source server nodes that can be operated by anyone, on their own infrastructure, to earn tokens on the Verida Network. Operators can run a node in the cloud, or on bare metal on standard, low cost hardware.</p><p>Learn more about how to run a node here:<a href="https://news.verida.io/decentralizing-the-verida-network-become-a-node-operator-e31a6a31daf1"> Decentralizing the Verida Network: Become a Node&nbsp;Operator</a></p> Verida Network keeps your private data&nbsp;private <p>One in two people have had their personal data exposed in data&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>Read more about how Verida encrypts and protects your private data&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verida.network/data-security">here</a>.</p><p>The current approach of storing personal data in multiple, centralized platforms, creates honey pots for hackers and creates huge risks for individuals, corporations and governments.</p><p>Global regulation is now forcing companies to open up access to user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Web2 offers an abundance of storage options for different use cases, but the data isn’t truly under our&nbsp;control.</p><p>Similarly web3’s unique needs will demand specific solutions. Existing web3 decentralized storage models such as Filecoin, Sia, and Arweave are robust for public data, but fall short for private personal data. They are designed for storing static content like images and documents, rather than being highly performant databases with real time syncing capabilities.</p><p>Verida is helping users “claim” their personal data and selectively open it up to the next generation of web3 applications for personalized products, services and AI powered digital assistants.</p> The economic stakeholders in the Verida Data&nbsp;Economy <p>The initial economic stakeholders are:</p>  End users: Use applications and pay for storage and application subscription fees on the&nbsp;network  Applications: Earn revenue from user subscriptions and by generating valuable data. Applications may pay storage fees on behalf of&nbsp;users  Storage Node Operators: Stake tokens to earn an income from providing storage capacity to the&nbsp;network   Network Economic&nbsp;Model <p>The Verida Network is a self-sovereign “user-pays” model, whereby users pay for their own storage needs. In this way, “access to user data” is not the product, rather the product is the “security and protection” of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Verida Network has the following storage objectives:</p>  Create a sustainable economic “user-pays” model  Maximize the geographical distribution of storage&nbsp;nodes  Maximize the availability and security of data stored on and across the&nbsp;network  Incentivize early adoption to bootstrap the&nbsp;network  <p>Users pay a monthly fee to access storage on the network. There are currently no charges for bandwidth, however this will be reviewed in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Storage node operators earn fees for the storage capacity they provide to the network that is utilized by&nbsp;users.</p><p>A small transaction fee, similar to gas fees on blockchain networks, is intended to be retained by the Verida Network to support its ongoing development and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Verida enables a “self-sovereign” data network, so it’s essential that all stakeholders have control and choice. Users can select which storage nodes they want to use for storing their data (or operate their own node(s)), while storage node operators have the choice to not provide their service to a particular user.</p><p>This creates a free market that can evolve as the Verida protocol matures and the network grows. Storage node operators will eventually be able to differentiate themselves by offering various options and features to users, including different pricing and service level agreements.</p> Community Pre-Sale: Get On The Whitelist <p>Verida will be enabling whitelisted community members to purchase Verida Storage Credits ahead of the public sale. This marks the first stage of the launch of the Verida Storage Credit token&nbsp;(VDA).</p><p>The exclusive Verida Whitelist is now open and will provide users with priority access to the Verida Storage Credit Pre-sale and further benefits over the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>A snapshot will be taken closer to the pre-sale date.

<p>In an age defined by relentless technological evolution, our lives have seamlessly integrated into the complex web of the digital world. From social interactions to financial transactions, our activities are increasingly finding their home online. Yet, this digital transformation is not without its challenges, particularly concerning identity and privacy. As our lives migrate into this digital sphere, ensuring the security and authenticity of our identities becomes crucial. This is exactly where decentralized identity emerges as a game changer for the landscape of digital citizenship.</p><p>As <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/nine-bangladeshi-nationals-held-in-mumbai-for-illegal-stay/articleshow/105968173.cms">reported</a>, nine Bangladeshi nationals were recently apprehended in Mumbai, India for illegal stay and fraudulent activities, including the obtaining Aadhaar cards and PAN cards with fake documents and the illegal transfer of money to Bangladesh.</p><p>This incident underscores the critical need for a robust and secure identity management system. Breaches in such systems can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and various other problems.</p><p>Enter decentralized identity, a game changer for the landscape of digital citizenship.</p><p>Revolutionizing Identity Management: A Shield Against Fraud and Illegal Activities</p><p>Traditionally, digital identities have been stored and controlled by centralized structures. This centralized approach poses significant risks, where breaches can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and an array of other problems. Decentralized identity, on the other hand, operates on the bedrock of blockchain technology. It allows individuals to reclaim control over their digital identities, free from the clutches of a central authority. Blockchain ensures security and transparency by storing data across a distributed network of computers. This decentralized approach to identity management has the transformative potential to revolutionize the way we perceive and protect our digital&nbsp;selves.</p><p>Decentralized identity extends a profound empowerment to individuals. In our current digital landscape, personal information is often surrendered to various platforms, with trust placed in them to safeguard it. Decentralized identity alters this paradigm fundamentally. It empowers individuals to own, manage, and authenticate their identities without relying on intermediaries. This not only grants people greater control but also mitigates risks associated with centralized databases. Your personal data retains its essence — personal.</p><p>Fortifying Digital Fortresses</p><p>In the digital age, security, privacy, and efficiency stand as non-negotiable pillars. Decentralized identity, fortified by advanced cryptographic techniques, exemplifies an impregnable fortress of security. Each user, armed with a unique digital signature, safeguards their identity without exposing sensitive data. Breaching this network proves an insurmountable challenge, thanks to blockchain’s robust security measures. <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Decentralized identity</a> not only repels identity theft and fraud but also champions privacy. By enabling users to share minimal, essential information for transactions, it revolutionizes the digital landscape. No longer subjected to constant surveillance, individuals navigate online spaces with newfound confidentiality. Additionally, this paradigm shift simplifies digital engagement. Picture a world where having many passwords is like using outdated things. This new way of managing identity puts everything together, giving one key to access lots of different things. It’s a mix of being safe, private, and quick, showing a future where people easily and securely control their online&nbsp;lives.</p><p>A Glimpse from Bhutan: A Beacon of Digital&nbsp;Identity</p><p>Bhutan has embraced decentralized identity as a foundation of its digital initiatives. Through <a href="https://ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, Bhutanese citizens now have a secure and private way to verify their identities online. This innovation not only enhances the efficiency of public services but also preserves the sanctity of individual privacy, aligning seamlessly with the nation’s Gross National Happiness philosophy.</p><p>The Road&nbsp;Ahead</p><p>While the potential of decentralized identity is vast, challenges persist. Further development and refinement are necessary to ensure seamless integration into existing systems. Moreover, legal and ethical considerations surrounding identity management need thoughtful addressal. However, amidst the complexities of digital citizenship, decentralized identity emerges as a light of&nbsp;hope.</p><p>In conclusion, decentralized identity is more than a mere technological innovation; it signifies a paradigm shift. It embodies a future where individuals reclaim control over their digital lives, privacy becomes a tangible reality, and the digital world follows the values of autonomy and security. As we move deeper into the digital age, embracing a decentralized identity isn’t just a choice but becomes a necessity. It is the foundation upon which a safer, more private, and more efficient digital citizenship can be meticulously built.</p><p>In the world of decentralized identity, <a href="https://ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> is committed to delivering innovative services that empower both individuals and institutions to confidently navigate the digital landscape.</p><p>You can contact us <a href="http://www.ayanworks.com/contact-us/">here</a>.

<p>Between the pings, swipes, and endless scrolls of the modern world, genuine human connection often feels out of reach. For Joe Feminella, the problem of fostering meaningful interactions in the digital era led him to found the dating app First Round’s on Me.</p><p>Sparked by his own fatigue trying to find deep relationships in a system obsessed with scale over substance, Joe’s journey reveals three pivotal insights on coordinating impactful collaboration.</p><p>Joe's experience in developing a dating app offers a unique perspective on how innovative technology can be used to create more meaningful connections.</p> How the Design of Coordination Systems Affect Outcomes <p>While technology has the power to connect people globally, design choices dictate impacts on relationships. App founder Joe Feminella observes, “I think technology is just moving so quickly that we often don't know what to do with it.” Rapid digitization makes it hard to accommodate the reality of everyday life.</p><p>Consequently, Joe watched social platforms overwhelm users with information rather than facilitating meaningful connections. Engineered to maximize matches, the barrage of stimulus short-circuited genuine intimacy.</p><p>Joe suggests that “progress requires transcending entrenched, engineering-only perspectives.” Bridging system gaps in belonging allows innovation to elevate, not exploit, understanding.</p><p>This involves recalibrating metrics to empower care-centered coordination. As Joe concludes, “user-informed design interweaves logic with healthy social values.” By grasping technology’s influence, we gain a conviction for writing social code that finally facilitates the connections we want.&nbsp;</p> Using Feedback to Build a Better App <p>User frustration often signals when tools hamper rather than help healthy relating. For app founder Joe Feminella, the frustration he and his dates shared about the platforms they were meeting on revealed recurrent unmet needs.</p><p>Across demographics and identities, people voiced the desire for more intentional interactions cultivating genuine intimacy. They felt starved of courtship customs signaling care, not just matches indicating cursory interest. Stark contrasts emerged between the claims of these dating apps, which promised meaningful connections, and the actual experiences of emotional depletion they provided.</p><p>Application users expressed feeling reduced to a number, valued for quantification over quality of character. As the number of dating apps grew, environments that should encourage vulnerability lacked sufficient moderation protections. Leaving many to feel objectified by digitally amplified attention patterns.</p><p>Joe suggests exploitation causes anxiety, stating “onslaughts of stimulus overload sensitivities crafted over millennia.” By focusing computing on growth before grounded human needs, innovation routinely agitates users.</p><p>This taught Joe the need for cross-discipline solutions. He felt compelled to bridge the gaps hindering healthy bonds and to leverage technology for good. As he concludes, “Progress means transcending entrenched perspectives across disciplines.” Collectively authored improvements weave care back into digital social fabrics.</p> Bringing More Heart Into Tech to Bridge Understanding <p>Holochain's framework is made for peer-to-peer applications that are secure, reliable, and fast. Moreover, Holochain is made for social applications that bring people together, centering the user. This technology aligns perfectly with Joe's vision of building authentic connections.&nbsp;</p><p>His experience developing a dating app that emphasizes genuine human relationships is paralleled by Holochain's goal to connect user devices directly in secure networks, giving users the autonomy of locally installed software that still benefits from the power and redundancy of cloud software.&nbsp;</p><p>Joe's insight into user experience and cross-disciplinary thinking are essential. New, innovative technology still needs to be user-friendly and accessible to help enable human connection. Hope persists for redeeming technology to elevate healthy bonds, not degrade them. Joe suggests progress stems from “transcending entrenched perspectives” — blending wisdom across domains to braid ethical values back into digital spaces.</p> A More Connected Future <p>The tools either dividing or uniting us remain unwritten, awaiting our choice. While scripts concentrating on control and surveillance surround us, we retain the power to edit the tale toward care.</p><p>Now more than ever, we require rewriting the social code — infusing creativity with conscience, and computation with compassion. Though challenges persist in balancing scalability with situated nuance, a more beautiful technology beckons just beyond reach when we link hands across domains.</p>

<p>This is another in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. As organizations continue to grapple with the reality of sophisticated cyber-attacks, it becomes imperative to look for additional alternatives to bolster defenses if a breach is due to a wider security vulnerability.</p>
<p>Considering the recent guidance provided by Microsoft on the “Midnight Blizzard” nation-state attack, we at 1Kosmos delve into the nuances of this threat and offer insights into how organizations can navigate through the latest attack vector.</p>
 Understanding the Midnight Blizzard Cyber-Attack 
<p>What was the Midnight Blizzard cyber-attack? As covered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, it represents a formidable challenge for organizations worldwide. Characterized by the group’s stealthy infiltration and persistent nature, this sophisticated attack exploited network vulnerabilities and breached Microsoft’s Outlook by using a test account to authorize a custom-built malicious application.</p>
<p>The group utilized a password spraying attack that successfully compromised a legacy, non-production test tenant account that did not have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled. The account inadvertently gave hackers access to the inboxes of various executives, including those in cybersecurity and legal functions.</p>
<p>This allowed them to steal copies of their emails and attachments through a legacy OAuth application that had elevated access to the Microsoft corporate environment. The group had access for approximately six weeks before they were discovered.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was not limited to Microsoft’s own environment. As part of their forensic analysis, Microsoft determined that the same group of attackers used identical tactics to target the inboxes of an unspecified number of Microsoft’s customers.</p>
 The Attack 
<p></p>
 1Kosmos Perspective: Building Security Resilience 
<p>The nature of this attack illustrates a need to eliminate passwords, strengthen multi-factor authentication, prevent lateral movement, and simpifly the IT (Information Technology) stack.</p>
 How 1Kosmos can help: 
<p>Prevent Password Spraying Attacks: 1Kosmos can eliminate passwords wherever possible, and where not possible, enforce regular password reset intervals with a password reset workflow that proves the user’s identity to ensure the reset request’s validity.</p>
<p>Zero Trust Methodology: 1Kosmos authentication methods exceed Zero Trust guidelines and mitigate the risk posed by attackers, by verifying every user and device attempting to access resources. The result can limit the lateral movement of attackers within their networks, thwarting sophisticated infiltration attempts.</p>
<p>Phish-Proof MFA: 1Kosmos strong identity-based authentication protocols perform strong authentication and significantly improve the user experience. 1Kosmos LiveID is a phishing-proof MFA that proves identity at every access request.</p>
<p>Risk Based Authentication: One-size-fits-all authentication solutions prove ineffective, underscoring the imperative for risk-based authentication to become the standard rather than the exception. 1Kosmos can use contextual factors like device details and location to assess the risk level and apply the right level of authentication.</p>
<p>Audit and Reporting: 1Kosmos is built on a private and permissioned blockchain. This private, permissioned ledger retains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all events, enabling visibility to all logins, access attempts, information updates, and shared information related to the digital identity. These logs can be shared with SOC teams and other platforms to ensure quick digital forensic analysis.</p>
<p>Collaborative Defenses: Collaboration and integration are key to a successful security infrastructure. 1Kosmos has built out-of-the-box integrations with industry peers (including Microsoft) to enhance the resilience of organizations against sophisticated attacks. Relying on a duct tape infrastructure and the gaps they inject is exactly what these hackers are looking to exploit. A tightly coupled integration will reduce gaps and improve an overall security posture.</p>
<p>Industry Certifications: 1Kosmos has taken the step to ensure the safety and security of our platform. For instance, 1Kosmos is certified to many standards including FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3, UK DIATF and iBeta DEA EPCS. The combination of these standards prevents identity impersonation, account takeover and fraud while delivering frictionless user experiences that preserve user privacy.</p>
 1Kosmos Prevents Identity Based Attacks 
<p></p>
<p>As the threat landscape continues to evolve, we must remain focused and adaptive in our cybersecurity strategies. The Midnight Blizzard attack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by nation-state adversaries. By embracing a proactive, collaborative, and identity-centric approach to security, organizations can bolster their resilience and effectively navigate through the digital storm unleashed by sophisticated attackers.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we empower remote identity verification and passwordless multi-factor authentication, facilitating secure transactions with digital services for employees, customers, and residents alike. Through the integration of identity proofing, credential verification, and strong authentication, 1Kosmos effectively combats identity-based attacks, empowering organizations with the tools, insights, and expertise needed to combat threats such as this one and safeguard their digital assets.</p>

 A Guide to Data Protection and Cybersecurity in the Blockchain Era <p>In today’s Web3 era, where online interactions are the norm — like chatting and shopping — the importance of digital identity and data protection cannot be overstated. Decentralized identity, as exemplified by initiatives like <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a>, offers an innovative and effective solution. It allows us to manage our information ourselves, avoiding central storage. This decentralization means we can decide who sees our information and when. Leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that our online identity is not only safe but also easy to&nbsp;manage.</p><p>The transition to decentralized identity goes beyond enhancing online safety; it’s about improving and simplifying a variety of digital interactions. Imagine being able to swiftly and securely verify your identity, be it at a bank, medical facility, or even during elections. This shift promises to revolutionize sectors like finance, healthcare, and governance, streamlining processes and safeguarding private information. However, the path to widespread adoption of these decentralized technologies involves overcoming significant challenges including interoperability, user education, and aligning with regulatory frameworks.</p> Key Points to Remember:   Enhanced Control and Cybersecurity: Decentralized identity systems significantly bolster the safety and ease of managing your personal information online.  Versatility in Application: These systems, rooted in blockchain technology, offer versatile applications, simplifying identity verification across various&nbsp;sectors.  Navigating Challenges for Widespread Use: Addressing challenges like scalability, user adoption, and regulatory compliance is crucial for the broader integration of decentralized identity.  A Paradigm Shift in Identity Management: Moving from centralized to distributed models, decentralized identity, powered by blockchain, enhances both security and trustworthiness.   Explaining the&nbsp;Idea: <p>Decentralized identity, or self-sovereign identity, is akin to having a unique key that proves who you are, under your exclusive control. It’s about creating and maintaining your own digital identifiers, a stark contrast to traditional identity systems. This approach significantly boosts privacy and cybersecurity, offering you the autonomy to make your own&nbsp;choices.</p> How Blockchain Helps: <p>Blockchain acts as a robust and secure digital ledger, underpinning decentralized identity. It’s like a consensus-driven digital notebook, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of your identity. This technology provides a transparent and tamper-proof record, fostering trust and reliability in digital interactions.</p> Advantages and&nbsp;Uses: <p>Decentralized identity systems offer enhanced privacy and security over traditional models. Their real-world use cases span various&nbsp;sectors:</p>  Healthcare: Patients control their health records, ensuring data&nbsp;privacy.  Finance: Secure and streamlined online banking experiences.  E-commerce and Insurance: Enhanced user trust through personal data ownership.  Travel: Secure sharing of identity documents, reducing data exposure&nbsp;risks.  Governance: Anonymous and safe interactions with government services.   Addressing Implementation Challenges: <p>For decentralized identity systems to function optimally, it’s essential to address scalability, encourage user adoption, and ensure regulatory compliance. These solutions enhance system performance, foster user trust, and meet legal standards.</p> Facilitating Growth and User Adoption: <p>To scale decentralized identities (DIDs), efficient network management is key. It’s about enhancing node efficiency, distributing workload, and employing off-chain solutions. Encouraging user adoption involves clear education, showcasing the benefits of security and privacy, and forming partnerships with trusted entities.</p> Navigating Regulatory Landscapes: <p>Decentralized identity solutions require careful consideration of regulatory landscapes. They must align with governmental governance frameworks for legitimacy. Achieving regulatory compliance involves monitoring evolving regulations, engaging with policymakers, and ensuring DIDs adaptability.</p> Ensuring Interoperability: <p>Developing standards for DIDs to work across platforms and jurisdictions is crucial for global efficacy. Establishing protocols for network nodes to interact with varying regulatory environments strengthens the viability of decentralized identity on a global&nbsp;scale.</p> Conclusion: <p>Decentralized identity systems represent a significant advancement in our digital world, offering a path to enhanced privacy and more secure online interactions. The adoption of these systems, integrated with blockchain technology, indicates a promising future, potentially transforming the landscape of online identity verification. The growth of this ecosystem hinges on widespread adoption and collaborative efforts among stakeholders, aiming to establish a norm where secure, private, and convenient identity management is the standard. While challenges in scalability, legal frameworks, and public understanding persist, the ongoing technological evolution and the growing emphasis on privacy suggest a bright future for decentralized identity&nbsp;systems.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/embracing-web3-with-decentralized-digital-identity-2e0200091cf3">Embracing Web3 with Decentralized Digital Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 ‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 2 <p>Across the country people from all walks of life — from those running families to those running organisations and Governments — are <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">having to ride two horses</a> at once: one that says we can only do what we can afford, financially speaking; and one that says we can afford what we can actually do. This second part of a three part series examines ways to expand what we can actually&nbsp;do.</p><p>In the dark days when the second world war was coming to an end people started discussing how to rebuild. As soon as they did so, they found themselves embroiled in a fundamental argument. Some said, there was little if anything we do, because we didn’t have the money to do it. Others, led by John Maynard Keynes said that was nonsense. As long as we had people who could work and resources they could work with, there were plenty of things we could do. “<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">We can afford what we can actually do</a>”, he&nbsp;said.</p><p>How then can we expand what we can actually do, in our current situation? Here are some of the things we at Mydex Community Interest Company have been thinking about and trying to put this simple but important idea into practice.</p> Think capabilities <p>In recent decades, policy-makers and decision-makers have become obsessed with targets. They believed that if they defined the outcomes they wanted to achieve and focused resolutely and exclusively on achieving these outcomes, then all would be well. It all sounded very sensible and practical, but in fact it was quite the opposite. Why? Because what really matters is not whether one particular outcome is achieved, but whether we have the ability to continue achieving this outcome. What really matters is our capabilities because results follow from capabilities.</p><p>Yes, it is possible to strain every nerve and expend every ounce of energy achieving a particular target (and then collapsing in a heap afterwards). But doing this doesn’t build capabilities. It destroys them. And that’s what’s been happening with decades’ worth of outcomes-obsessed target setting, outsourcing and so on, with institutions like the NHS effectively being run into the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Once we think of outcomes as the results of capabilities, then the main goal of every activity shouldn’t be just to deliver this or that particular outcome. It should be to do everything we can to build underlying capabilities alongside delivering the outcome in question.</p><p>Results are ephemeral. Once you’ve achieved them, they’re gone. But skills, knowledge, know-how and infrastructure are not ephemeral. They last. It’s capabilities that make results permanent — and that make it possible to improve on these results as time goes&nbsp;by.</p> Think genuine productivity <p>It’s all very well saying “we can afford what we can actually do” but what happens if what we can actually do is constrained — if our resources are&nbsp;limited?</p><p>This has been the human dilemma since the year dot. This is why expanding the scope, range and volume of the things we can actually do has also been the focus of human economic activity since the year&nbsp;dot.</p><p>At the heart of this lies productivity. Now, it’s sad but true: in recent times the word ‘productivity’ has got itself a bad name. It’s become associated with negative things like cutting corners or sweating the labour force — or, perhaps, with simply being boring and tedious. But in reality productivity is all we’ve got, because productivity is about making enough of the things we physically need practically available. Productivity is about building the ability to generate more, better outcomes using less resources — and what is more important than that? Without increased productivity it’s not possible to sustainably improve peoples’ material wellbeing.</p><p>Genuine productivity is liberating. When, for example, some clever sailors decided to start putting up sheets of fabric to capture the power of the wind rather than relying on rows of tired, sweating men desperately pulling on oars, they achieved a huge productivity revolution. Men who previously desperately hard days pulling oars could now devote their time and energy to doing other things. Boats could carry much bigger cargos (using the space previously occupied by oarsmen). And sailors could take these cargoes much further, because the wind never&nbsp;tires.</p><p>Sometimes productivity revolutions are generated by technical breakthroughs (LED lighting uses 85% less energy than previous forms of lighting). At other times, they are generated by changing the ways in which work is organised. Henry Ford’s moving assembly lines cut the time and labour needed to make a motor car by over 90%, making cars available to ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>Whether it’s from technical or organisational innovation, genuine productivity enables humans to achieve more using less resources: less time, less energy and effort, less materials. It is how real wealth has been created since the year&nbsp;dot.</p><p>But if Governments focus only on what they can afford — on the money overlay — while ignoring the underlying economic realities of what can actually be done, then the chances we have to improve produtivity will be be passed over.&nbsp;Ignored.</p><p>This has now been happening for decades, and it really is time that it&nbsp;changed.</p> Think mutual self&nbsp;help <p>In countless situations humans can achieve far more if they cooperate and work together instead of simply acting alone. It’s much easier for two people to push a broken down car than one. Even easier if it’s&nbsp;three.</p><p>Back in the day, before this country had a welfare state and before Governments and states grew so big and powerful, people had all sorts of needs that weren’t being met. Governments of the day would not, or could not, do anything to help them, so they had to learn how to help themselves.</p><p>That’s what the labour movement did, for example. It gathered people together to share resources and to use these resources to help each other help themselves. People did this in many different ways, building friendly societies, mutual building societies, burial societies, producer cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, trade unions, and so on — all of them acting not on the mantra of ‘we can only do what we can afford’ but focusing on the question ‘what we can actually&nbsp;do?’.</p><p>Decades ago, in the face of institutional inertia and failure, the people of this country created a flowering of institutional creativity, building completely new institutions from the ground up, designed to fit the circumstances they found themselves in. The welfare state — social security benefits, state pensions, the NHS and so on — were just further examples of a long and deep history of mutual institutional innovation.</p><p>With Governments once again saying there are things that they cannot or will not do, perhaps it is time to cherish and revisit that legacy. Perhaps, we as a society and citizenry need to stop looking up to the top with a begging bowl and start looking to each other again, to ask a different question: “OK. So what can we as communities (in, that is, countless different types of community) actually do with the resources we have&nbsp;got?”</p> Think ‘clubs’ and communities, not just ‘markets’ and&nbsp;‘states’ <p>In recent years, many people have pointed out that the classic left/right debates about ‘markets’ versus ‘states’ renders a huge part of our lives invisible — the fact that we live in communities. They may be local, physical communities or communities of interest or communities of practice. Either way, they’re important because they bring people together in ways where they share a common experience or interest.</p><p>In the context of expanding what we can actually do, communities are important because there are many ways to cooperate and share resources, things, information etc within a community that make things possible and enrich peoples’ lives without having to turn to either a market or a&nbsp;state.</p><p>But there is lots more where that came from. Back in the mid-sixties a young economist called James Buchanan wrote an article called ‘An Economic Theory of Clubs’. In it, he noticed that when we look at real world economic activities, very few of them fit the mould of either pure market (all just private individuals exchanging purely private property), or pure state (where everything is publicly owned and all decisions are made by the&nbsp;state).</p><p>In reality, he noted, most economic activities fit somewhere in the middle, in what he called clubs. This is where a number of people (but not everybody) contributes to creating a resource and enabling access to it and where, having contributed to this resource they share access to it according to rules that they have all agreed to. In a tennis club for example, every member contributes to maintaining the facilities, and every member gets to enjoy&nbsp;them.</p><p>To work well, clubs need boundaries. The tennis club can easily share a court between 100 or perhaps 1000 members. But if it becomes 100,000, then the court can’t serve them all. Likewise, five or six people helping to push that car is great. But if it is 50 or 60 it doesn’t work any more. So clubs happen when specific groups of people get together to do specific&nbsp;things.</p><p>Using Buchanan’s terms, firms a sort of club. So are supply chains and clusters where a number of organisations work together to achieve a common purpose — for example in health and care, dealing with one individual’s specific issue where lots of different inputs are required.</p><p>Once you think about it this way, it quickly becomes obvious that the vast majority of economic activity isn’t actually undertaken by either markets or states, but by ‘clubs’ where specific groups of people find ways of working together on particular things to improve on and expand what they can actually&nbsp;do.</p><p>This underlines the importance of human agency. Very often we find ourselves at the mercy of market forces, or dependent on the state. Markets and states are supposed to be complete opposites, but they have one thing in common. They both undermine and restrict human agency. (A key point about market forces is that they force us to behave in particular ways.) In contrast, clubs and communities emphasise and develop agency — our joint quest to lift the constraints we are faced&nbsp;with.</p><p>In short, there is a vast swathe of positive, productive economic activity that could be undertaken — that could expand what we can actually do — that needs neither remorseless market forces nor centralised bureaucracies to enable it to work. There is a vast untapped potential just waiting to be&nbsp;tapped.</p> Think institutional innovation <p>As Keynes pointed out, money isn’t a real economic resource. You can’t eat pound notes or build houses with them. To eat something we need food — a material thing, not a financial, symbolic thing. To have food we need to grow it. Growing food takes time, from planting to harvesting. Growing, processing and moving food requires energy and material resources like land, tractors and trucks. That is what the real economy is about: People, Time, Energy, Resources.</p><p>Money is just a poor symbol of these things. It’s supposed to represent real economic resources (though, increasingly it doesn’t), and it’s used as a mechanism to allocate and deploy these resources. But it is not the real thing. It is an institutional overlay, sitting on top of the real economy, creating a veil between us and the real thing (a veil which often obscures the real thing’s workings).</p><p>Institutions create the ‘rules of the road’ by which we humans get together and do things. We need these institutions. But sometimes they go wrong. Sometimes they are not well designed.</p><p>Money is one such institution. The institutional overlay of money and financial affordability works well when it deploys and allocates available human and material resources to meet human needs. But if and when it stops doing this job — if it creates a barrier between meeting human needs and the deployment of resources — then this institutional overlay is no longer fit for purpose. It has become a constraint that we need to&nbsp;lift.</p><p>The answer to not having enough money to spend on what we need is not to simply spend money as if there is no tomorrow. It’s not a choice between ‘fiscal responsibility’ and ‘fiscal irresponsibility’. It is to shift focus: to focus on expanding what we can actually do. To find new ways to connect real-world resources with real-world humans and their&nbsp;needs.</p><p>This isn’t just about technical innovation. It is about institutional innovation: building new institutions that create new rules of the road to enable people to get together. To make these connections in new ways to do new things. Just as the labour movement did a century&nbsp;ago.</p> Think genuine investment <p>In theory, the purpose of an investment is to build a capability that delivers better results. This is where the ‘returns’ on your investment come from. But over the past few decades, ‘investors’ have grown impatient with the time and effort that’s needed to build capabilities.</p><p>Instead, they have looked for ways to get better results wihtout having to worry about that pesky intervening bit of earning them via the extra wealth generated by the development of new capabilities. For example, if you can earn a bigger ‘return’ by shuffling the title deeds to an already-existing asset or gambling on its future price, why not? A return is a return. Who cares about how it’s actually&nbsp;created?</p><p>That’s why today, banks and the City of London hardly invest anything in real productive capacity. Virtually all of the money they ‘invest’ goes into the prices of existing assets such as houses, stocks and shares, or in gambling on the future prices of these in secondary ‘derivative markets’. For them, ‘investment’ is all about eating the cherries while doing nothing to plant the cherry trees or tending the cherry&nbsp;orchard.</p><p>The early 20th century economist Thorsen Veblen had a term for this. He called it sabotage. This was the process by which the people holding the money — the people deciding what is ‘affordable’ — go on strike if doesn’t guarantee them the quickest and highest possible return. Where they refuse to invest in things that may be immensely productive simply because it doesn’t line their pockets quickly&nbsp;enough.</p><p>In such a world it may be helpful to use the words ‘sabotage’ and ‘saboteur’ every time you come across the words ‘investment’ or ‘investor’. So, for example, if you see the term ‘social investor’, read ‘social saboteur’. With a few admirable exceptions it’s usually a good way of getting closer to the truth&nbsp;. But this is a truth that needs to change, with the return of real investors with a focus on expanding what we can actually&nbsp;do.</p> Think de-monetisation <p>For many decades now, most policy initiatives have focused on marketisation: where there is a human need it should have a price placed on it and for money to be exchanged. But if we enter a world where there is less money to spend, less money is exchanged, so fewer needs can be&nbsp;met.</p><p>It’s time to move in the opposite direction: to loosen this stranglehold by finding ways to de-monetise exchanges of value. If we focus on what we can actually do, rather than what we can ‘afford’ in narrow money terms, we find ourselves looking at real-world things like available time, energy (including human energy) and resources (both material and intangible e.g. knowledge, know-how, information and trust). To connect them, we might consider using local ‘alternative’ currencies or&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Such de-monetisation also opens the door to other forms of non-market exchange. Not everything has to be sold for a price. Things can also be shared, given, borrowed and lent. Deepening and extending what we can actually do includes deepening and extending what we exchange, and&nbsp;how.</p> Think Fair&nbsp;Process <p>A Fair Process is, if you like, a process for making and implementing decisions that treat those involved and affected with respect: giving them a voice, being impartial when assessing what they have to say, making decisions in their interests (rather than listening to some more than others, and biassing decisions in favour of particular vested interests). It’s a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">human rights approach</a> to whatever you are trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>That may sound obvious. But very often it’s not what happens. For example, ‘leaving the market to decide’ is an unfair process almost by definition. This is because markets are organised around the spending of money and that means those with the most money have the most say, while those without any money end up being&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>Fair processes, on the other hand, tend to produce the best decisions (precisely because all voices have been heard rather than just a select few). They also earn buy-in from those involved (precisely because the process is seen to be fair). This is crucial if and when to actually get something done we have to create a ‘we’: we have to bring people together in a way that encourages them to work together.</p> Conclusion <p>We now live in a world where what we can do is increasingly restricted by the institutional constraints of “what we can only do what we can afford”. Day to day, all of us at every level — from families to those working in Governments — have to find a way of surviving within these constraints. But as they get tighter we also have to look for wriggle room. We have to open up spaces which enable us to expand what we can actually do. This blog has suggested some ways we can do this (‘we’ being important here, because very often it needs a joint&nbsp;effort).</p><p>As a Community Interest Company, we at Mydex know all about the constraints of only doing what we can afford. We never have enough cash to do all the things we want to do. On the other hand, our whole raison d’etre is to expand what we as a society and individuals can do with data. So our next blog looks at how Mydex fits what we’ve been talking about&nbsp;here.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-2-96213dd4d546">‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   As Europe's largest economy and a major global financial powerhouse, Germany is unsurprisingly a major target for illicit financial activity.  
 In this installment of our Regulatory Focus Series, we take a look at Germany's key AML regulator BaFin and the KYC compliance rules it puts in place to curb money laundering and other financial crimes in the country.

				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Moving to digital trust and verifiable credentials is the goal of many current organizations. Doing so carries substantial benefits, including fraud reduction, increased data sharing with reduced integration costs, and even privacy law compliance.</p>
<p>Large-scale efforts by governments and orgs like GLEIF to create organizational identity are often championed as the foundations for this new digital world, and many are under the impression that it is one that we must wait for.</p>
<p>In reality, the relationships you already have are the key to building a digital ecosystem. Ecosystems need to identify the parties involved in the issuance and verification of credentials — who to trust for what. By contrast, large global identity projects&nbsp; will actually provide very little value to established ecosystems where the parties have established relationships with each other. Moreover, as ecosystems turn digital, newly created digital identifiers from ecosystem participants can be passed directly between participants and the ecosystem governance authority using existing communication channels and relationships; there is no need for that to be orchestrated by another party.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Employees within a company — companies already know their employees and have existing HR processes for interacting and coordinating with employees. Employees know which company they work for. Issuing those employees verifiable employment credentials requires no outside authority.</p>
<p>Trade associations — trade associations already know their member companies and have been working with them for a long time, in some cases, years or decades. Verifiable credentials for member companies, including certifications, proof of membership, and other benefit qualifications are all based on existing relationships.</p>
<p>Business partner networks — insurance companies are a great example of how to build on established trust. They know the providers in their network, and they know the insured individuals. They can provide both directories and introductions between newly connecting parties, all leveraging these existing relationships. Patient VCs can ease onboarding at a new medical provider, while providers can provide qualification credentials to patients. Data entry errors are minimized, efficiency is gained, etc.</p>
<p>None of these examples need anybody’s permission to start innovating with VCs and gaining immediate benefits.</p>
<p>So, what do these large government efforts and global identity programs provide? We’ve made it clear that existing relationships don’t need external parties. What these large identity systems do provide is a trusted foundation for new relationships. It simplifies the process of identifying new ecosystem partners and participants, which can be a major source of fraud. By streamlining the correct identification of individuals and organizations, ecosystems can grow rapidly and more efficiently.</p>
<p>So what’s the holdup on these large programs?&nbsp; It should be no surprise that policy creation, technology development, and often regulation take time to get right.</p>
<p>As these programs mature and deliver the right technologies, they will assist in the growth of already established identity and trust ecosystems. They’ll improve upon existing methods of vetting new partners and participants, and that’ll be great.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the technologies needed to enhance trust and create digital ecosystems from your existing relationships already exist. We at Indicio help our customers do just that, and we’d like to help you as well.</p>

  <p>I’m thrilled to announce the public preview of advanced certificate-based authentication (CBA) options in Conditional Access, which provides the ability to allow access to specific resources based on the certificate Issuer or Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our customers, particularly those in highly regulated industries and government, have expressed the need for more flexibility in their CBA configurations. Using the same certificate for all Entra ID federated applications is not always sufficient. Some resources may require access with a certificate issued by specific issuers, while other resources require access based on a specific policy OIDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, a company like Contoso may issue three different types of multifactor certificates via Smart Cards to employees, each distinguished by properties such as Policy OID or issuer. These certificates may correspond to different levels of security clearance, such as Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Contoso needs to ensure that only users with the appropriate multifactor certificate can access data of the corresponding classification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Authentication strength - advanced CBA options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the authentication strength capability in Conditional Access, customers can now create a custom authentication strength policy, with advanced CBA options to allow access based on certificate issuer or policy OIDs. For external users whose multifactor authentication (MFA) is trusted from partners' Entra ID tenant, access can also be restricted based on these properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This adds flexibility to CBA, in addition to the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advancing-cybersecurity-the-latest-enhancement-in-phishing/ba-p/2365681">recent updates we shared in December</a>.

 IDnow to become an active part of the European netID Foundation’s ecosystem 



<p>Munich, January 30, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, announces its cooperation with the <a href="https://netid.de/">European netID Foundation</a>. The goal: The introduction of an identity wallet for netID users in Germany as an alternative to the offerings of US platforms.</p>



<p>Developed by IDnow, the netID Wallet app will be available for users to download later this year and will allow them to reuse and share stored digital identities.</p>



<p>Self-determined and even simpler reuse of identities</p>



<p>netID is an open standard that enables users to access online services of netID partners (among others Süddeutsche Zeitung, Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, ProSiebenSat.1 and United Internet with the WEB.DE and GMX brands) via the same login details, all in compliance with data protection regulations. The introduction of the identity wallet will make storing and retrieving identities even easier for around 40 million potential users.</p>



<p>Bundled in one digital location, users can access and verify proof of identity such as ID cards, driving licenses, social security data and much more on their smartphone at any time – making everyday processes more efficient. netID partners, in turn, can significantly simplify their processes for verifying customer data, for example for invoice purchases, and thus make them more cost-effective. </p>



<p>Wallet can be used by the partners of the netID ecosystem</p>



<p>The initial verification of the user’s identity to create the wallet is carried out using the proven IDnow solutions. Once the identity has been confirmed and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> has been successfully created, the user decides with whom they want to share what data. Anyone who uses the wallet once to register with a mobile phone provider, for example, can use it again at any time with one of the partners in the netID ecosystem for verified identification.</p>



<p>The wallet is another step toward the future: the European Commission is about to publish a new version of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS regulation (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services)</a>, which is expected to come into force in 2024. All EU citizens should have a digital identity by 2030. The launch of the netID Wallet supports this goal.</p>



<p>“netID has been simplifying digital life in Germany since it was founded. Transparency and data protection have always been at the heart of what we do. We see the netID Wallet as the logical next step in the further development of the netID offering. Thanks to the cooperation with IDnow, we can offer our users secure and user-friendly identity verification that will even be able to serve regulated use cases in compliance with eIDAS in the future,” explains Uli Hegge, CEO of the European netID Foundation.</p>



<p>“We are delighted to have gained a trustworthy partner for our identity wallet in Germany in the form of the European netID Foundation and to be an active part of the netID ecosystem in the future,” says Uwe Stelzig, Managing Director DACH at IDnow.  </p>



<p>“IDnow and netID pursue similar goals in terms of data security and user-friendliness, which we are now also pursuing together in identity verification. With the introduction of the wallet, users no longer have to identify themselves again and again, but can save their verified identities and simply reuse them the next time. In this way, netID partners can offer their users even faster and secure access to their services,” continues Stelzig.</p>

   by Martin Kuppinger  A while ago, I was asked how to deal with cybersecurity for Web3 and the metaverses. There is not a simple answer to this. I talked about this last year at KuppingerCole Analyst’s cyberevolution 2023, our cybersecurity conference. It’ll be a hot topic again at the upcoming EIC, KuppingerCole’s European Identity and Cloud Conference, from June the 4th to the 7th in Berlin.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A while ago, I was asked how to deal with cybersecurity for Web3 and the metaverses. There is not a simple answer to this. I <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-metaverse-cre23">talked about this last year</a> at KuppingerCole Analyst’s cyberevolution 2023, our cybersecurity conference. It’ll be a hot topic again at the upcoming EIC, KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a>, from June the 4th to the 7th in Berlin.</p>
<p>Going back to the question: The easiest way to solve complex problems is by deconstructing them into smaller pieces, solving these, and putting everything together again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the graphic, foundational elements of Web3 converge with metaverses related technologies. It’s tough to try to solve security holistically, of course. But there is NFT Security as a smaller, yet complex&nbsp; challenge. There is DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Security — some of which we could deconstruct even further.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, there is a common universal element: Decentralized Identity. This is the glue. For solving security in a decentralized world, we need decentralized identity. Then we can solve the various challenges and construct a unified security approach.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identity, which is part of the broader theme of Digital IDs (aka Digital Identity) is one of the main themes of EIC 2024. Digital IDs are not just elements of Identity and Access Management (IAM). It is something much bigger. They relate to IAM, but in cross-organizational use (decentralized, reusable) and supply approaches that enable and leverage business models.</p>
<p>When we think about an avatar (or agent or whatever is the industry term de jour) in a metaverse, this is sort of a “digital double” to us. The term “digital twin,” unfortunately, is already used in another context (namely, manufacturing and simulation).</p>
<p>This digital double has an identity which relates to our digital identity. It acts on our behalf. This imposes challenges such as control, liability, and other concerns. Digital identity is the core of the solution, because we can define that identity, relate it to our identity and others, and keep control. Without this, we will fail in our journey towards new models, especially everything including autonomous or semi-autonomous (that is how I would name an avatar in a metaverse) systems.</p>
<p>While this field is still evolving, one thing is clear: A central foundational pillar of Web3 and the Metaverse (and every modern digital service and business) are Digital IDs, particularly decentralized identity. Also, don’t miss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/a-closer-look-at-eidas-20-and-the-eu-digital-identity-wallet">recent blog post of my colleague Alejandro Leal</a> on eIDAS and the EUDI wallet, another key topic at EIC 2024. There also is a lot of research on this topic available by KuppingerCole Analysts, such as the Advisory Note <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti">How Enterprises Will Learn to Love Decentralized IDs: The Roles of Distributed and Sovereign Identities in Our Private Metaverse</a> written by Mike Neuenschwander.</p>
<p>Look at our research, talk to the analysts of KuppingerCole, and don’t miss attending EIC 2024. See you in Berlin in June!</p>

<p></p>
<p>"Our current credit system says, 'Saddle yourself, so we can give you more to saddle.'" Eric Lapin, President of <a href="https://www.formfree.com/">FormFree</a>, stated during a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/TZkK8a64E7I?si=2qhaIF22uGbD7lbJ">TBD live stream</a>. His comment sheds light on a fundamental paradox of the U.S. credit system: it often requires you to accumulate debt as a prerequisite for obtaining loans, leading to more debt. This systemic issue is underscored by <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/credit-access#/experiences-credit-demand1">recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>, which reveals that 1 in 5 applicants for mortgages, car loans, or other types of loans were rejected — the highest rate in five years. This trend disproportionately impacts Black and Latino applicants. Guided by their slogan, 'Democratizing lending for all people without bias,' FormFree developed a platform built with Web5 and AI to address these issues.</p>
 Residual Income Knowledge Index (RIKI)<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/shifting-loan-power-to-borrowers#residual-income-knowledge-index-riki" title="Direct link to Residual Income Knowledge Index (RIKI)">​</a> 
<p>The Fair Isaac Corporation score, better known as a FICO score, is a three-digit score that helps lenders in the U.S. evaluate the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan. A higher score indicates greater reliability. However, achieving a high FICO score — or any credit score — largely depends on accruing and gradually repaying debt. This may come as a disadvantage for various groups of people who may not have a credit score, including veterans, formerly incarcerated individuals, immigrants, young adults, and folks who prefer cash transactions.</p>
<p>To provide a more holistic view of a person's creditworthiness, FormFree developed a new system called <a href="https://www.formfree.com/news-and-insights/formfree-releases-residual-income-knowledge-index/">Residual Income Knowledge Index™ (RIKI™)</a>. Instead, RIKI analyzes monthly income and spending. Integrating this method into our existing credit system provides greater opportunities for home ownership, car purchases, and other essential loans.</p>
 "It's like Tinder for banks!"<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/shifting-loan-power-to-borrowers#its-like-tinder-for-banks" title="Direct link to &quot;It's like Tinder for banks!&quot;">​</a> 
<p>During the live stream, FormFree Software Engineer, Jon West, showcased their <a href="https://passport.formfree.com/">Passport</a> product. The demo highlighted Passport's ability to match borrowers with lenders. This feature inspired an audience member to comment, 'It's like Tinder for banks!'"</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
 
 Borrowers securely connect to their bank account. 
 FormFree analyzes the account records and creates an anonymized credit profile for the borrower. 
 Lenders review these anonymized profiles and decide which borrowers to extend offers to. 
 Borrowers can now review offers from lenders and choose their preferred option. 
 All necessary borrower data is shared with the lender once a match is made. 
 
<p>Typically, borrowers endure aggressively pitched products from dozens of lending institutions. FormFree shifts control to users for more tailored loan consideration.</p>
 How FormFree Uses Web5<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/shifting-loan-power-to-borrowers#how-formfree-uses-web5" title="Direct link to How FormFree Uses Web5">​</a> 
<p>FormFree uses the following Web5 technologies:</p>
 
 <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> - After sign up, the application associates a user's account with a DID. 
 <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials (VC)</a> - A borrower's credit profile is secured as a Verifiable Credential enabling the borrower's information to stay anonymous and tamper-proof.

 Looking Back at 2023 
<p>2023 was a year of change for Public Trust Certificates – discussions on reduced validity periods, approval of new requirements, and significant progress in access to Verified Mark Certificates. Let’s review what happened in 2023 along with a few predictions for what’s to come in 2024.</p>
<p>TLS Certificates</p>
<p>The Google Chrome team was quite active in the TLS ecosystem. They began <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">promoting</a> modernizing PKI infrastructures including reducing the TLS certificate validity period to 90-days. Entrust provided <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/googles-90-day-proposal-for-tls-certificates/">our response to the 90-day proposal</a>. The Chrome team also provided the market with information to help secure TLS PKIs through automation for a safer more reliable internet.” You can then hyperlink the word “information.</p>
<p>The CA/Browser Forum (CABF) published ballots which updated the TLS Baseline Requirements (BRs):</p>
 
 <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/03/02/ballot-sc61v4-new-crl-entries-must-have-a-revocation-reason-code/">SC61</a> – New Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) entries must have a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/use-of-crl-reason-codes-updated/">revocation reason code</a> 
 <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/03/17/ballot-sc62v2-certificate-profiles-update/">SC62</a> – Certificate profiles update for the requirements and restrictions of the TLS certificate profiles 
 SC63 – Makes OCSP optional, require CRLs, incentivizes automation, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/short-lived-certificates-finally-approved/">finally approves short-lived certificates, which do not require certificate status</a> using CRL or OCSP 
 
<p>The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9345">IETF has published RFC 9345</a> to support delegated credentials for TLS and DTLS. The delegated credential mechanism allows a server operator to use the private key from their server to issue a delegated credential. The new credential will have a different private key and a validity period of no greater than seven days. Since the delegated credential is only valid for a short period of time, there is no status protocol required to be checked, that is, no CRL or OCSP response.</p>
<p>S/MIME Certificates</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/11/s-mime-baseline-requirements-approved-by-the-ca-browser-forum/">The CABF approved the S/MIME Baseline Requirements</a> in November 2022, which provides an S/MIME standard for the public trust CAs. The S/MIME BRs have been effective since the September 1, 2023. ETSI also released standard <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/11941106/01.01.01_60/ts_11941106v010101p.pdf">ETSI TS 119 411-6</a> to comply with the EU regulation on electronic signatures in email messages and to support the S/MIME BRs. This allows EU CAs meeting the S/MIME BRs to be audited using the ETSI audit criteria. The S/MIME BRs were also required by the Apple and Mozilla policies.</p>
<p>DigiCert provided an <a href="https://github.com/digicert/smbr-cert-factory">S/MIME certificate factory</a> with samples of certificates which meet the S/MIME BRs. They followed up with the <a href="https://github.com/digicert/pkilint">pkilint tool</a>, which can be used for S/MIME certificate linting to find errors when a certificate does not meet the S/MIME BRs. Entrust fully supports <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/digital-certificate-linting/">digital certificate linting&nbsp;</a> and its <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/deploying-digital-certificate-linting/">deployment</a>.</p>
<p>Code Signing Certificates</p>
<p>The CABF began requiring <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/ca-browser-forum-updates-requirements-for-code-signing-certificate-private-keys/">code signing certificate keys to be generated and managed in a crypto device</a> effective as of June 1, 2023. The goal is to reduce key compromise by removing the option to generate key pairs in software. The CAs must also verify if the keys were generated in a crypto device which would include server HSMs, USB tokens and cloud HSMs.</p>
<p>Ballot CSC68 was issued to update the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/code-signing-revocation-requirements-updated/">code signing certificate revocation requirements</a>. The purpose was to tighten up the procedure when a key is comprised, or if a subscriber signs suspect code. If the CA finds out that either of these occurred, then the certificate must be revoked within 24 hours. At a later time the CA may backdate the revocation time before the key was compromised or the suspect code was signed. This will cause signatures after the revocation date to fail.</p>
<p>Verified Mark Certificates</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/government-organizations-can-now-get-verified-mark-certificates-for-their-outgoing-emails/">Government organizations can now get Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs) for their outgoing emails</a>. This is equivalent to VMCs issued to companies which have registered marks. Google also strengthened VMCs by <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/gmail-now-offers-a-new-checkmark-for-emails-enabled-with-verified-mark-certificates-and-bimi/">adding a blue checkmark</a> which proactively indicates the sender of the email has verified that it owns the domain and the logo displayed in the avatar slot.</p>
<p><a href="https://bimigroup.org/resources/VMC_Requirements_latest.pdf">VMCR 1.5 was released</a> create Common Mark Certificates. This will allow a certificate applicant to submit either a modified registered mark or a prior use mark to be added to the certificate. The modified registered use mark will allow an applicant with a registered mark to make a change such as removing/moving words or removing a portion of the mark. This may allow the applicant to modify the mark to fit in place with different dimensions or perhaps provide a seasonal change to the mark. For prior use mark, the applicant must have historically displayed the mark for at least 12 months and the mark must be found in an archive webpage source. The Common Mark Certificate beta program has just started in December 2023. Note: we are not sure if both Google and Apple will fully support common marks and emails will not get the blue checkmark.</p>
<p>Mozilla sets Root CA Lifecycles</p>
<p>To support cryptographic agility which Mozilla states is the ability to replace cryptographic primitives, algorithms, and protocols efficiently at reasonable cost with limited impact on operations, Mozilla has <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_CA_Lifecycles">set a lifecycle schedule for trusted root certificates</a>. There is a migration plan for existing roots, but the ongoing schedule will be from the date of key generation, a TLS root will be removed after 15-years and an S/MIME root will be removed after 18-years. The lifetime will allow the CA time to get the root embedded and at least 10 years of use. The S/MIME roots have a longer lifecycle as S/MIME certificates are issued with a longer validity period.</p>
 To 2024 and Beyond&nbsp; 
<p>Here are some expected changes for 2024.</p>
<p>TLS Certificates</p>
<p>The CABF TLS validation subcommittee is working on <a href="https://github.com/ryancdickson/staging/blob/require-mpdv-v2/docs/BR.md#3229-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration">multi-perspective issuance corroboration</a> to ensure when verifying a domain name that the determinations made by the primary network perspective is correct before a TLS certificate issuance. Multi-perspective determination will be applied to both domain names and Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)record compliance. We anticipate multi-perspective will migrate to a “must” requirement in 2025.</p>
<p>Code Signing Certificates</p>
<p>The CABF code signing working group is working on updates for Signing Services and high-risk certificate applications. Signing Service will help the certificate subscribers to be complaint and ensure their key pairs are generated in a cryptographic module, the private key is protected, and only the subscriber can activate the private key for signing. The high-risk certificate application has been changed as now all key pairs must be generated in hardware, which mitigates some of the risks that were addressed in the CSBRs.</p>
<p>Key attestation is a method for the CA to verify that the private key was generated in a cryptographic module. There is no standard for key attestation, so this is difficult to implement. Members of the IETF are working on addressing this issue by generation an RFC for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-csr-attestation/">CSR attestation</a> and for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ounsworth-rats-x509-evidence/">X.509 based attestation evidence</a>. CSR attestation can be implemented with existing crypto modules and the RFC may be available in 2024. X.509 based attestation will take longer to define and would need to be implemented in new cryptographic modules; as such, we do not expect to benefit from this effort for many years.</p>
<p>S/MIME Certificates</p>
<p>The IETF publish RFC 9485 which supports <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/caa-for-s-mime-email-certificates/">certification authority authorization (CAA) for S/MIME certificates</a>. This will support domain name owners to provide the CAA record “issuemail” for their authorized CAs. The CABF S/MIME working group is developing on an update for CAA as a recommendation in late 2024 and a “must” requirement in 2025.</p>

 The landscape of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction monitoring is rapidly evolving, driven by increasingly complex global regulatory demands and sophisticated money laundering tactics. Financial institutions face the daunting task of adapting to this changing landscape, where technological advancements like AI and machine learning are reshaping traditional monitoring methods. The pressure to comply with stringent regulations while managing operational complexities is higher than ever. 



 



<p>Financial institutions must effectively identify, analyze, and report suspicious activities within a landscape marked by technological evolution. The dual challenge of staying compliant with rigorous regulations and handling the operational complexities of transaction monitoring is a significant burden. This challenge is compounded by the need to manage the operational complexities of transaction monitoring and integrate advanced technology solutions that are both compliant and efficient in managing fraud risks.

 What is Anti-Money Laundering Transaction Monitoring? 



<p>Anti-Money Laundering Transaction Monitoring is a process driven by compliance regulations to ensure that financial transactions conducted by institutions are not used for money laundering or terrorist financing. The process is mandated by regulations such as the <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/eu-context-anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism_en">EU’s AML Directives</a> and the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/usa-patriot-act">USA PATRIOT Act</a>, which set international benchmarks for companies that engage with the US and Europe. Financial institutions use rule-based or AI-enabled tools to identify and report suspicious transactions, and analysts are responsible for maintaining compliance and ensuring secure financial environments.</p>



<p>These solutions play a critical role in detecting money laundering and other illicit activities, thereby ensuring the integrity of the financial system. Compliance with AML regulations is not only necessary for regulatory purposes but also vital to avoid severe legal and financial consequences. In fact, recent statistics indicate that global fines for AML violations have exceeded $5 billion in 2022 alone. By adhering to regulatory compliance measures, financial institutions can foster trust and contribute to the transparency of the financial system. Furthermore, compliance standards have led to significant advancements in AML solutions, with regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act, USA PATRIOT Act, EU’s AML Directives, and FATF recommendations acting as catalysts for innovation in Anti-money laundering transaction monitoring technology.</p>



<p>The range of financial institutions that must comply with regulations has expanded to include fintech and cryptocurrency organizations, given the higher risk of money laundering associated with digital currencies and technologies. To address these new financial services, emerging regulations such as the “Travel Rule” from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the 5th and 6th Money Laundering Directives from the European Union have been introduced. The industry is also shifting towards the use of AI/ML technologies to detect suspicious activities more quickly and make more accurate decisions. Currently, 66% of financial services are investing more in AI to accomplish this.</p>

  <p>Tangle Labs are happy to share the release of Vira Wallet v0.3.0 one of the most advanced self-sovereign identity wallets on the market and just one step away from a full 1.0 release.</p><p>After rigorous testing over the past couple of months, and the impressive demonstration of interoperability with other projects, we have experienced significant positive feedback and ensured that the wallet has matured to a level where it is now being used for ticketing and open badge experiences in the real world. Learnings from such events and experiences have given the team valuable feedback that has Vira to develop into such an advanced application.</p><p>Vira is currently being used across a number of projects including the UNESCO Lifelong Learning project NGDIL, various real world event ticketing and open badge experiences, and has recently been declared a DIIP compliant wallet by the <a href="https://www.dutchblockchaincoalition.org/dbc-zone/diip-wallets">Dutch Blockchain Coalition</a>, alongside the UniMe wallet from Impierce Technologies. </p><p></p> Feature Updates <p>Whilst a lot has been done behind the scenes to streamline the app in the backend and to ensure its security, stability, and feature performance, the four big feature updates include:</p><p></p><p>Improved UX/UI</p><p>The Vira UI has developed into a seamlessly intuitive and easy-to-use user experience. The balance between user experience and security in the world of crypto and decentralised identity is a very difficult area, often sacrificing one for the other. Having worked alongside partners to build out seamless experiences, we have streamlined the Vira experience to be a smooth one, without sacrificing the importance of security and privacy for users. This important area of the development process can place Vira in the top ranks of user experiences in the identity wallet space.</p><p></p><p>Open Badge Support</p><p>Credentials can now be issued as standardised open badges, supporting the Open Badge Standard v3.0. Separating credentials by standardised types provides a versatile approach to how credentials are received, shared, and stored. The Open Badge standard, by Ed1Tech, is a world leading standard used all over the world. Having implemented the standard in its entirety in the latest release, Vira can now become an open badge compatible wallet that may be used by millions of badge holders in open badge ecosystems around the world.</p><p></p><p>Self-Signed Credentials</p><p>User signed credentials to allow self-declaration of information such as name and email. Having verified credentials issued by a third-party is one thing, but being able to verify that you have self-declared information personally, is another. By implementing self-signing within Vira wallet, this opens up a world of opportunity allowing users to assign self-signed data to profiles, such as name, telephone number, email address, and other data for profiling at the granular level whether its a business card, a user login, or another profile, Vira users can now declare the information they want to within their individual profiles.</p><p></p><p>Internationalisation and RTL Support</p><p>Fully integrated support for translation into any language allowing Vira to go global. Cross-border use is one of the huge value propositions of decentralised identity. With Vira now fully integrated with global internationalisation standards, it can support any language translation as we begin to be used in multiple countries around the world. So whether its an open-badge event in the Netherlands, a travel ticket in Germany, or a business document in UAE, Vira is poised to become a truly global app.</p><p></p><p>Login with DID</p><p>Login with DID support via open-source OpenID standards. Vira is 100% ready to allow its users to login with DID allowing any project to integrate login with DID into their apps and websites using the open-source libraries from Tangle Labs, giving users the opportunity to privately connect to services without the need for third-party identity providers such as Google, Facebook, or X, etc. </p> What’s next? <p>These updates alone have put us one step away from a final public v1.0 with a feature complete release scheduled for later in the year. With Vira already live in the real world supporting and showcasing decentralised identity in its many forms, the next release of v0.4.0 will add the final pieces of the puzzle to ensure the complete package is ready for adoption.</p><p>The next features to be updated and integrated into the 0.4.0 release for final testing include:</p>  <p>Full Multichain Support - to allow users to operate in different ecosystems by selecting which networks they wish to engage with.</p>  <p>Document Signing - allowing users to legally sign documents with digital signatures from within their Vira wallet</p>  <p>Translations - full translations to allow Vira to be used in various languages such as ES, NL, AR, DE, etc.</p>  <p>Verified Account Support - allowing users to verify their identity for reusable credentials</p>  <p></p><p></p>

 <br>
Background 
<p>At Northern Block, our journey toward enhancing Canadian critical mineral supply chain transparency and traceability collaboration began with an <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">innovative pilot</a> in 2022, in partnership with the Government of British Columbia, Copper Mountain Mining Corporation, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p>
<p>During this initial pilot, we successfully demonstrated that greenhouse gas emissions reporting could be converted into digital credentials, making this sustainability data verifiable and highly available for various systems within the supply chain. This demonstration effectively showcased how, by utilizing common standards and protocols, sustainability data can be seamlessly transferred between different organizations’ systems while maintaining its integrity (note: we cover more of ‘how this works’ in the section below ‘Why do digital credentials help create supply chain transparency in the mining industry?’)</p>
<p>In early 2023, we expanded our efforts by adding support for two new digital credentials:</p>
 
 Mines Act Permit: Easily prove your permit status (for major mine operators in B.C.) 
 Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM): Submit TSM scores and share verified environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data securely 
 
 <p>Both credentials are rooted in authoritative governance frameworks, and utilise OCA bundles for proper credential branding</p> 
<p>To support mining operators in receiving their Mines Act Permit in the form of a digital credential, we continued our ongoing partnership with the Government of B.C..</p>
<p>To transform TSM reporting data into digital credentials, we formed a key partnership with the <a href="https://mining.ca/">Mining Association of Canada (MAC)</a>, whose 100+ members account for most of Canada’s production of critical minerals. Canada already produces more than 60 minerals and metals and is a leading global producer of many critical minerals, including nickel, copper, potash, aluminum, and uranium. MAC is also behind <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/">the TSM initiative</a>, a globally recognized ESG standard implemented not only in Canada, but in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Spain, Argentina, and Colombia. TSM, first established in 2004, allows mining companies to turn high-level environmental and social commitments into action on the ground. Additionally, TSM was the first mining standard in the world to require site-level reporting with external verification. We anticipated that facilitating the creation of digital credentials for mines, based on a recognized and important reporting standard, should generate significant demand and value in downstream supply chains.</p>
<p>We worked closely with MAC to develop a set of rules and standards for this new type of digital certificate to mobilize the data generated through the&nbsp; TSM standard. This digital certificate, or ‘credential,’ is designed for organisations involved in extracting important resources. Our goal was to make this TSM digital credential as accurate and trustworthy as possible, similar to what we had previously achieved with the greenhouse gas credential in 2022. We aimed to base the TSM credential on direct, original data (source data) and combine technical methods with strong surrounding governance. This approach ensured that TSM data transmitted through this credential could maintain its reliability and integrity, increasing its value. It can then be used effectively by other companies and organisations further along in the supply chain.</p>
<p>TSM’s comprehensive approach, utilizing various environmental, social and climate change indicators, has been a great mechanism for promoting responsible production practices. Our work in this domain reflects our commitment to making TSM data not only more accessible but also a trusted element in global supply chains, reinforcing responsible mining practices worldwide.</p>
<p>In late 2023, we achieved a significant milestone by enabling mines&nbsp;to self-issue their TSM reports for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023 in the form of digital credentials, which were then digitally presented to MAC using this innovative method. This accomplishment marked a huge milestone for our objective of creating trusted data inputs for supply chains. In this process, we also involved PricewaterhouseCoopers and Envirochem, two recognised TSM verification firms. The two verification firms created externally verified TSM reports as digital credentials for the two mines in question. Essentially, this means that when a mining company receives one of these digital reports from their verifier, it comes with the verifier’s digital signature. This signature proves that the report is genuine and hasn’t been altered. When the mining company shares this report with other supply chain participants, everyone can trust the data accuracy and provenance.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the ecosystem which Northern Block is supporting with both the Mines Act Permit and TSM credentials:</p>
 <p>Note that in this image, the Government of British Columbia has developed its own digital credential system for government ministries, independent of Northern Block’s system. However, both systems are capable of communicating with each other due to their use of interoperable technology. It’s important to recognize that a digital trust ecosystem can involve many different actors, each potentially using services from various providers. A key advantage of this decentralized approach is the flexibility it offers participants, allowing them to choose their preferred platforms without being confined to a single, centralized system.</p> 
<p>This advancement was a substantial step in making the existing international TSM standard more accessible for supply chain participants. Our next focus is on broadening its use and creating a demand generation strategy. Given the increasing demand for high-integrity data in supply chains, we believe that our efforts have established crucial foundational groundwork.</p>
 Why do digital credentials help create supply chain transparency in the mining industry? 
<p>Digital credentials are based on internationally accepted technical and governance standards that are meant to facilitate digital trust. A digital trust architecture enables any two entities to share data between themselves in a trusted manner, independent of the system or application they’re using. This can be compared to email clients, where emails are reliably sent and received regardless of the different clients being used (e.g., like Microsoft Outlook and Google’s Gmail). This reliability is due to the use of common underlying protocols (a common language). Digital trust solutions leverage a common set of protocols, enabling them to exchange trusted data between themselves, with Security, Privacy, Authenticity and Confidentiality in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allowed us to conduct trusted data exchanges between different systems. For example, we facilitated a live exchange&nbsp; between the Government of British Columbia and CMM, where CMM was able to use Northern Block’s ‘Orbit Enterprise Wallet’ to receive a digital credential representation of their Mines Permit. This was issued by the Government of British Columbia, from their credential issuance system, and CMM was able to receive the offer, and upon accepting it, stored the credential within their digital wallet, hosted by Northern Block. This demonstrates that by speaking a common set of standards and protocols, technical interoperability is attainable, avoiding enforcing any supply chain participants to use a specific solution, similar to how email works!</p>
<p>A key aspect of digital trust stems from digital signatures using cryptography. Whenever a piece of data (a digital credential) is sent from an authoritative party to another, that data is signed, becoming tamper-proof and backed by verifiable governance processes. For instance, when a supply chain participant consumes verifiable TSM data as a digital credential proof, they can be confident about the data’s provenance, knowing it came from a mine or the mine’s auditor, and that it followed the correct governance established by MAC. This creates a root of trust for ecosystems that wish to consume that data.</p>
<p>Once these digital credentials are available, they can be shared with any participant in an ecosystem at the discretion of the credential holder. For example, a mining company can easily share this data with investors, buyers, or ESG marketplaces with just a click of a button. They can also selectively share different credentials, controlling what data they share and with whom. Being able to mix and match various types of verifiable data can unlock new efficiencies and value creation opportunities. For example, CMM may share with an investor a proof that they’re a recognised mine in British Columbia, along with selective ESG data from their TSM credential. In this case, they were able to share data that came from two separate, but verifiable sources. The investor will know that all data proofs shared are authentic. This example starts to make us think about some of the efficiencies and new opportunities when being able to mix and match data from various sources.</p>
<p>By converting this data into digital credentials and storing them in wallets owned by the data owners, it becomes easier to share within supply chains, thereby making it more available. This is particularly important in the context of ESG reporting, where fraud is a concern. Digital trust is crucial because it allows for the creation of supply chain data inputs that are authentic and verifiable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, digital trust technologies will elevate the level of trust within critical mineral supply chains. Creating supply chain transparency is only as effective as the data that flows into it. Our goal is to ensure that the data entering supply chains is of high integrity and value, and our work to-date aligns well with the Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy.</p>
 Northern Block’s Mining Credentialing Solutions 
<p>Northern Block has been dedicated to developing enterprise digital credentialing technology suitable for a variety of applications. In early 2020, we launched the first commercial graded digital credential management platform in Canada, called NB Orbit Enterprise ; a no-code digital trust web-based platform that facilitates the storage, issuance and verification of digital credentials that are held and owned by organisations in digital wallets. The platform contains a collection of components based on identity management, distributed and edge computing, distributed ledger technologies and cryptography. Importantly, it is compatible with global digital trust standards and protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the components available within Orbit Enterprise that we leveraged for this particular critical minerals digital trust project:</p>
 
 Organisational Wallet: a component that allows organisations to receive digital credential offers from their peers, such as governments and auditors, and securely store them in the organisational wallet (e.g., Mines Permit credential, TSM credential).&nbsp; 
 Secure Connection Manager: This tool helps organisations set up secure, two-way communication channels with each other. Once these channels are established, they can exchange information safely and privately, ensuring that all communications are genuine and confidential. 
 Digital Credential Creation and Sharing Module: This is a service that allows organisations to create and issue digital credentials, like digital IDs or certificates, either to themselves or to other organisations. It also includes features for requesting credentials, negotiating terms, and sending secure messages. This is particularly useful in business-to-business (B2B) situations, where two organisations need to collaborate on issuing these digital credentials. 
 Digital Credential Verification and Exchange Toolkit: This toolkit is used by organisations to either ask for proof of digital credentials from others or to provide proof of their own credentials. It supports collaboration and communication, similar to the credential issuance service, making it easier for organisations to verify each other’s credentials. 
 Credential Governance Toolkit: This toolkit is designed for creating and managing the rules and designs for digital credentials. It’s used by authoritative bodies to set standards and publish these credentials to trusted data registries. organisations can use this toolkit to follow these standards when issuing credentials. It also helps ensure that the branding and legitimacy of these credentials are consistent, especially in supply chains, so that everyone recognizes and trusts them. 
 
 Call to Action 
<p>If you are interested in contributing to the growth of this ecosystem, <a href="mailto:info@northernblock.io">we would love to hear from you</a>. Our initiative welcomes participation from a diverse range of stakeholders, including natural resource companies, data consumers in need of high-integrity sustainability data, government regulators, and technology solution providers. It will require the collective effort of many strong participants to elevate this ecosystem to the next level and generate a network effect. We are confident in the foundational elements already in place, especially our credentials rooted in authoritative trust. This foundation paves the way for an array of future use cases and broader applications.</p>

 ‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 1 <p>Across the country people from all walks of life — from those running families to those running organisations and Governments — are wrestling with financial shortfalls that restrict what they can do. This three part series asks ‘Is there a positive way forward?’</p><p>Sometimes, in order to deal with a difficult problem, we have to embrace a paradox. Paradoxes happen when one thing — call it Proposition A — is clearly, incontrovertibly, undeniably true, but when something else opposite — call it Proposition B — is also clearly, incontrovertibly, undeniably true. In situations like this, to move forward, we have to find a way of holding both ideas in our minds at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>Right now this paradox is hitting us all. Increasingly. With a vengeance. This is the paradox of ‘affordability’.</p><p>The first part of this paradox — the Proposition A bit — is the common understanding that “we can only do what we can afford”. If we’ve only got so much money to spend, there is only so much we can spend it on. Full stop. The simple reality of our situation. And, if because of circumstances beyond our control, we find ourselves with less money, then there are even less things that we can spend it on&nbsp;… less things that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>This is not a happy situation. It’s a tough, harsh reality affecting millions of people today in every walk of life. It’s the day to day misery of millions of families wrestling with poverty. It’s looming centre stage across the nation’s local authorities, with 20% of them verging on bankruptcy. It’s causing a crisis in health and&nbsp;care.</p><p>It’s also dominating Government policies. ‘Only doing what we can afford’ — ‘austerity’ — has been the one theme that has dominated UK Government policies for decades now, particularly since the great financial crash of 2008. Over many years the Scottish Government has promised to do many things such as abolish child poverty. But in the last few months it has presided over a budget which will result in the exact opposite. It, too, is knuckling down to the harsh realities of ‘we can only do what we can&nbsp;afford’.</p><p>If the Labour Party gets elected at the forthcoming UK General Election things may not change all that much either. Labour leader Keir Starmer is making a big point that whatever promises he makes “in the end the fiscal rule comes first”. We can only do what we can&nbsp;afford.</p><p>Yet&nbsp;…</p> We’ve been here&nbsp;before! <p>As a society we’ve been here before, only worse. In the dark days of the Second World War for example, Britain had run out of money. It had spent every penny fighting the Nazis. Then, in the early days of 1942, there was a chink of light. Perhaps, after all, we might actually win the war! As this thought took hold, peoples’ attention began to turn to the question: what comes next? How to win the peace? How to&nbsp;rebuild?</p><p>This triggered an almighty spat between the forces of financial orthodoxy — the people whose worldview was dominated by the mantra ‘we can only do what we afford’ — and those whose focus was on underlying economic realities.</p><p>John Maynard Keynes believed that keeping to the mantra ‘we can only do what we can afford’ would be disastrous. “At one level — the formal level of bank balances — it’s true we can only do what we can afford,” he said. “But at another level — of underlying economic reality — it’s nonsense. In fact, the exact opposite is true. In reality, we can afford what we can actually do”. This was his Proposition B.</p><p>Keynes didn’t actually use the words in the above paragraph. But below are the words he used in a BBC broadcast on 2 April 1942, when he took the spat between the two worldviews public. Keynes called for an ambitious programme to “build homes, libraries, theatres, concert halls and dance halls” so that “every substantial city [has] the dignity of an ancient university or a European capital”.</p><p>But the financial establishment would have none of it. We don’t have the money, they argued. We can only do what we can&nbsp;afford.</p><p>This is how Keynes replied to the financiers (whom he addressed as ‘Sir John’) in his BBC&nbsp;talk.</p><blockquote>“The money?”, I said. “But surely, Sir John, you don’t build houses with money? Do you mean that there won’t be enough bricks and mortar and steel and&nbsp;cement?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Oh no,” he replied, “of course there will be plenty of all&nbsp;that”.</blockquote><blockquote>“Do you mean,” I went on, “that there won’t be enough labour? For what will the builders be doing if they are not building&nbsp;houses?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Oh no,” he replied, “of course there will be plenty of all&nbsp;that”.</blockquote><blockquote>“Well,” I said “if there are bricks and mortar and steel and concrete and labour and architects, why not assemble all this good material in&nbsp;houses?”</blockquote><p>Keynes finished his talk by saying “anything we can actually do we can afford”: wherever there are people with skills and energy capable of doing work, and wherever there are sources of energy and materials that could be deployed, then it’s possible to bring them together to meet human needs. When push comes to shove it is what we can actually do that defines ‘affordability’.</p> Riding two&nbsp;horses <p>The point about paradoxes is that to embrace the truths they both contain, we need to keep them both in mind at the same time. For many people running families, organisations, institutions and Governments today Proposition A — that we can only do what we can afford — dominates their days. Day in and day out, they struggle endlessly with the realities of financial constraints; of having to make hard, miserable choices that stop them doing things they really want to&nbsp;do.</p><p>They feel they don’t have a choice and in one sense they are right. The institutional reality of their situation is that the less money they have, they less they can do. If they start spending money they don’t have — beyond what they can ‘afford’ — they risk going bankrupt.</p><p>Yet only acting on Proposition A ignores the truth of Proposition B — that, as a society we can afford what we can actually do. And the more we focus only on Proposition A the more we actually reduce what we can actually do. And over time, that makes our situation worse, not better. Focusing only on Proposition A is a trap, placing us on a spiral of&nbsp;decline.</p><p>Somehow, then, we have to find a way of acting on Proposition B even as we wrestle with the constraints that Proposition A forces upon&nbsp;us.</p><p>What does this mean? It means that none of us has only one job. None of us can focus only on doing what we can ‘afford’ to do. Even as we wrestle with the constraints of Proposition A, somehow, somewhere, we need to find ways of also opening up and expanding what we can actually do. We all have two jobs to do. Two horses to ride, even if very often they pull us in different directions.</p><p>Our next blog looks at some of the ways we can do&nbsp;this.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Reconfiguring Transition Landscapes</p><p>Entering 2024, it becomes increasingly important to shift the focus from immediate technological and demographic trends to the broader systemic tendencies that are likely to shape the future and options landscape. The seven drivers outlined below must be understood against a systemic backdrop of steadily declining foundational systems of civilisation — from decreasing available arable land along with structural decline in quality at a planetary scale, a quantum decline in energy returned for energy invested, to decreasing global well-being and a decline in life expectancy.</p><p>These fundamental shifts place us in a new paradigm where foundational resources are relatively diminishing in comparison to demand, while climate breakdown introduces increased volatility and shocks into the system. This volatility, coupled with a systemic decline, suggests we will face more shocks and an accelerating shortfall in nutrients, energy and well&nbsp;being.</p><p>As these factors converge, we don’t just mean fluctuating availability, but also significant price spikes. For instance, a 3–4% drop in food system availability, or 5% in aggregate, could lead to price increases of up to 400%. Such price volatility will lead to systemic inequality within and between nations, potentially triggering social tipping points. It is within this context and transition that we need to consider the following trends.</p><p>These structural tendencies, which demand both adaptation and mitigation, are key factors in determining how we evolve and adapt in the years (if not decades) ahead. Some of these tendencies will naturally allow for evolutionary progress, while others will require significant adaptation. Understanding these tendencies from a structural perspective is crucial because they form the undercurrents that will influence long-term trajectories. Recognizing and responding to these systemic tendencies and propensities will be essential in navigating the complex landscape of our future, and shaping our decisions, innovations, and strategies for the decades to&nbsp;come.</p><p>The essence of the “propensities” defined below lies in a profound transformation of our constraint space shifting our approach towards technology, society, and future planning. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that these propensities have historically always existed. What is now being manifested is that those propensities are not just a functional reality for the “ignorable many”, but becoming the dominant propensity at a planetary scale.This transformation is reshaping the very notions of progress, the integration of technology into daily existence, and the structuring of institutions.</p><p>These tendencies and propensities transcend the simple adoption of new technologies or the following of emerging trends. They represent a more profound, structural evolution in our collective thought processes and approaches. They signify a departure from linear, predictable models derived from extensions of ‘the adjacent possible’ socio-technical landscape based on present-day comprehensions.</p><p>In the following sections, 7 of these pivotal propensities are presented. Readers and participants are encouraged to critically engage with these ideas, offering their perspectives and insights. These shifts appear increasingly essential in framing and supporting the magnitude of the transition and more critically the innovation landscapes necessary to provide pathways for the transition.</p>  Multi-Perspectival Pathways for&nbsp;Tomorrow  <p>The transformation towards a multipolar world is one of the most structural shifts that the world is facing and it is driving profound changes in our pathway of transition. This multipolar world view increasingly extends beyond geopolitics, permeating into foundational shifts and divergences in transition pathways for societies.</p><p>The multiperspectival approach to climate transition underscores the growing portfolio of strategies being implemented globally — either passively or actively, each reflecting unique civilizational insights, lock-ins and interests. COP28 started to crystallize this emerging reality, with a breakdown in the hegemony of a singular transition pathway.</p><p>In this context, it is important to recognise that there appear to be at least three structural principal transition perspectives emerging:</p><p>Supply Side — Asset &amp; Investment Driven Transformation<br>Predominantly observed in the U.S., this strategy emphasizes the creation and enhancement of assets to revolutionize supply chains and technologies. It entails substantial investments in new technologies and infrastructure, nurturing innovation ecosystems, enacting supportive policies and regulations, fostering public-private collaborations, and integrating global supply chains. The goal is to transform supply and technology landscapes while promoting economic growth and competitiveness. It will necessitate new market design and financial innovations.</p><p>Integrated Transition Strategies:<br>This method aims to fundamentally alter supply-side technologies while simultaneously managing or reducing demand. Its’ complexity arises from the dual focus on high-cost supply-side innovation and transitioning demand, necessitating changes in consumer behavior and infrastructure adaptation. The central challenge is to harmonize advancing supply technologies with evolving demand trends, targeting resilience and sustainability. This strategy requires robust policy and regulatory frameworks for successful implementation but perhaps more critically the capacity for societies to make legitimate decisions at the speed and scale necessary.</p><p>Offset Systems<br>In regions like Saudi Arabia, where hydrocarbon energy base costs are low, investing in offset technologies becomes a strategic focus. This includes carbon capture and storage, efficiency enhancements, alternative hydrocarbon applications, and geo-engineering. This approach, contrasting with European or American strategies, leans towards maintaining the hydrocarbon economy while seeking to reduce or mitigate future environmental It’s’&nbsp;. This strategy necessitates novel methods for managing planetary risks and innovations. Moreover, the unproven technologies that it is reliant on will most certainly accelerate climate breakdown risks in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>These divergent transition pathways will require adopting shared, dialogic and negotiation frameworks for handling different planetary risks and allocations and making provisions for them, not just within national contexts but also in relation to the planet as a whole (i.e. if we are to avoid a race to the bottom and collective self termination). holding and management of these risks on a global scale calls for an innovative form of systemic-level innovation from countries. It means rethinking and redesigning the way that risks are assessed (including historically accrued risks), addressed, and mitigated, integrating both national priorities and planetary responsibilities. Such an approach is crucial for navigating the complex, interlinked challenges that define the current era. It requires a shift towards more collaborative, integrated risk management strategies at the planetary level.</p><p>The multiperspectival nature of the climate transition calls for diverse innovation economies, national and metanational alliances, and a reimagined approach to negotiation and collaboration. Navigating this multipolar landscape requires recognizing varied transition pathways, managing geopolitical effects, balancing risks and trade-offs, and adapting to a substantial shift in global transitions. This multipolar, multi perspectival scenario necessitates sophisticated, economic diplomacy to forge a viable, and non-self terminating, equitable future</p><p>2. Planetary justice as a precursor for a planetary transition</p><p>The emergence and embedding of a multipolar world is also revealing long-standing injustices and accelerating future injustices, previously obscured by asymmetric and extractive power dynamics. The addressing of these injustices is not just an ethical imperative, but also a practical necessity for any large-scale planetary agreement on the necessary transitions ahead. The danger is not just that and equitable transitions might be otherwise being impeded by deeply rooted systemic injustices but any transition will be impeded itself progressing us to a path of mutually assured destruction. This stalemate response when confronting structural barriers has hitherto been the status quo. Tackling such injustices on a planetary scale demands substantial and concerted effort as they prevent a viable pathway towards the magnitude of change that will&nbsp;be.</p><p>3. High Interest High Inflation Macroeconomics</p><p>The macroeconomic landscape is also shifting alongside the unfurling implications of climate change intensifying in an increasingly multipolar world. We are witnessing increased market volatility and a more pressing scramble for transition materials — driven not just by market dynamics but also by existential necessities and increasing conflict.</p><p>This confluence of factors is likely to induce a sustained high-inflationary environment within the economic system and might drive a persistently high interest rate environment that will systemically restrain investment broadly especially in environments most vulnerable to planetary risks. It will throttle our capacity to mitigate the runaway risks associated with climate breakdown (i.e. with the exception of entities wielding substantial economic&nbsp;power).</p><p>Moreover, such macroeconomic factors are going to systemically accelerate the missing trillions problem, throttling the flow of capital into the real world economy. This is because as both the volatilities increase, future uncertainties increase, and the cost of capital will become increasingly prohibitive.</p><p>Moreover, this shift is poised to aggravate systemic inequalities, disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable and marginalized by rapidly increasing the cost of living. As systemic inequality widens, it will threaten to destabilize nation-states. This paradigm shift presents a formidable challenge, making global economies more susceptible to fragility. Addressing these emerging vulnerabilities will require systemic innovation at the monetary level that cannot be discounted and will increasingly become a systemic throttle if not addressed.</p><p>4. Operating in a Security&nbsp;World</p><p>The transition from a world predominantly driven by free trade principles to one increasingly centered around security agreements has been accelerating over the past six years (e.g. the UK/US Atlantic agreement or UK/Japan agreement). The shift towards security-based alliances is expected to continue, with an evolving and broadening definition of security. Recent trends have started to integrate critical technologies into security frameworks, and we can foresee this expansion to further encompass areas such as nutrition, critical minerals (already a traditional focus in security) and essential health commodities and&nbsp;needs.</p><p>The expansion of the security domain will also necessitate an even greater systems-based approach to security.</p><p>In a more systems-oriented worldview, the traditional concept of nation-state boundaries will undergo a fundamental change. Instead of being defined by geographical lines, states will be characterized by their critical metabolic flows that do not respect national boundaries. It is foreseen that these flows, encompassing energy, materials, and other vital resources, will increasingly become the definitional landscape of statehood. This perspective emphasizes the importance of resource dynamics and interdependencies in defining national identity and capabilities.</p><p>Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that the increasing securitization of the world also paves the way for the weaponization of various elements. This might include areas such as food supplies, weather systems, geo-infrastructures, material goods, energy grids, and information systems. As security concerns broaden, so too does the scope of potential weaponization. This development raises fundamental questions about our response strategies. Relying solely on market transaction-based frameworks is increasingly insufficient for understanding the value and risks associated with such diverse sectors. A more comprehensive approach is needed to address the complexities that they&nbsp;present.</p><p>As we begin to recognize and operationalize security within these new frameworks of entanglement, we will see planetary-scale reconfigurations. This evolution signifies a deepening understanding of our interconnectedness and the need for comprehensive strategies in addressing security challenges.</p><p>The extension of the security framework to incorporate elements like energy, critical materials, food systems, and health infrastructures is poised to significantly reshape the planetary landscape. The move from a commodities-centric free trade world to one focused on security goods and security alliances will be pivotal in determining the pathways for future transitions. This growing emphasis on security is likely to transform international relations and economic agendas, marking a profound shift in the way that global interdependencies and cooperation are perceived and navigated. This evolution marks a new era in global geopolitics, where security considerations permeate multiple aspects of international engagement and decision-making.</p><p>5. The New Environmental Right</p><p>There is an emergence of what can be described as a surge in environmental nationalism (e.g. rise of AFD in Germany and its recent positions on environmental risks). This brand of nationalism is dedicated to the protection of environmental systems, advocating for methods such as population reduction (principally l by reducing migration) as means to conserve environmental resources. This is poised to be a defining feature of the new political right wing. Environmental nationalism is set to introduce a systemic form of austerity that transcends traditional public goods. Its primary focus will be on enacting austerity measures on essential environmental resources and might be used as a lever to propel a more nationalistic agenda.</p><p>Whilst such ideology is ostensibly aimed at preserving certain environmental aspects for particular socio-economic groups, it may also serve as a driving force for increasing systemic inequality. Its selective approach to conserving and allocating environmental resources is likely to generate imbalances, privileging certain groups while disadvantaging others and/or exacerbating existing disparities. A notable characteristic of such environmental nationalism will be its propensity to externalize environmental degradation. It prioritizes the maintenance and conservation of high environmental standards within its own borders, often by shifting environmental burdens to other regions or nations. This practice, akin to a form of passive economic warfare, is expected to intensify. Nations adopting this ideology may prioritize their internal environmental quality, frequently at the detriment of the broader global environment. This leads to aggravated issues like pollution and resource depletion elsewhere. Such externalization tactics, rapidly escalating under the banner of environmental nationalism, are likely to contribute to global environmental imbalances and tensions, complicating the quest for unified, worldwide environmental objectives.</p><p>6. Labour&nbsp;Crisis</p><p>Furthermore, a labor crisis is being evidenced in advanced economies that are grappling with diminishing labor supply, particularly noticeable in care and transition sectors. For example, numerous areas are readying for substantial urban and community retrofits, but face a shortfall in the workforce that is required to carry out such projects. Moreover, demographic shifts in these economies are outpacing the development of sufficient care infrastructure and labor resources.</p><p>To overcome such labor challenges, groundbreaking strategies are required. It entails a greater reliance on automation, significant investments in demand shifting infrastructures and human capital development and a structural reevaluation and reimagination of migration policies and international relations — such as multi-tier citizenships such as digital nomad and essential services visas or multi-tier participation rights and obligations. Such shifts are vital to reconfigure how we approach the new mass demands of work — from care provision to managing large-scale transition such as retrofits in a 21st-century context (especially considering the constraints on&nbsp;labor).</p><p>These labor issues and constraints are poised to drive profound change in the innovation landscape and transition strategies. The accessibility and distribution of labor and human resources will emerge as a key systemic limitation, with its impact varying significantly across the globe. This factor will be instrumental in determining the nature and efficacy of strategies for transition.</p><p>7. Information Flooding</p><p>The seventh foundational shift reshaping our organizational structures pertains to the nature of information economies. Human systems and institutional economies are inundated with an overwhelming flow of information, fundamentally altering our information processing methods. Instead of synthesizing and comprehensively understanding this influx, we are increasingly reliant on pattern-based computations. This approach involves identifying adjacent patterns to make sense of emerging data trends — a significant departure from traditional methods of knowledge processing.</p><p>However, knowledge institutions are designed to regulate the computation of knowledge rather than pattern recognition. Therefore they struggle to keep pace with the rapid influx of information, either in the computation of information or the pattern sharing. They are increasingly unable to adapt quickly enough to new demands or develop alternative frameworks for understanding. This gap in societal processing capability opens the door to the weaponization of pattern spaces, where myths and false narratives can proliferate, filling the voids left by conventional institutional computation. We are witnessing an era where the ‘hallucination of patterns’ becomes a systematic method to manage the deluge of information.</p><p>A critical challenge will be to construct a new institutional economy that is equipped to handle the scale of information overload. It necessitates a deep understanding of how societies process information and a structural reevaluation of current systems. Addressing this will be key to enhancing our collective capacity and capabilities for managing and facilitating the transition in an era of information abundance.</p><p>It is essential to effectively address societal capability to process vast quantities of information in order to construct robust decision-making structures that are fit for an era marked by heightened complexity and built on mass distribution of agency. The challenge will lie not only in developing information processing and decision-making systems for society, but also how to build such systems as a network capability of society as a whole, rather than for a representative few.</p><p>Moreover, the building of such systems is not just an operational necessity; it is a fundamental issue that sits at the heart of our societal evolution to transcend the transition challenge. These systems must be capable of managing the deluge of information and translating it into coherent, mass multi-agent decision-making processes that are both inclusive and effective in scope and&nbsp;context.</p><p>Navigating the Shift: A New Era of Planetarity **</p><p>The effort of this post is driven by the need to perceive, acknowledge and anticipate these structural changes with regard to our investments in innovation and transition frameworks and recognising that this is essential to prevent an escalating planetary landscape that becomes increasingly in crisis and at risk of geopolitical tension and conflict.</p><p>A dual purpose is served in understanding these contextual shifts. Firstly, the structural nature of the challenges that we face are acknowledged. More importantly, it involves devising of a new class of relevant innovative strategies and domains for the adaptation and mitigation of the impact of these shifts as society transitions.</p><p>Further, as we examine such transitions, we must recognize this moment presents a move from an era defined by industrial internationalism, with its colonisation and extractionism, to a new phase of multipolarity and systemic interconnectedness. This transition, from 19th century globalization to a nascent phase of planetarism, demands care if we are to preserve essential systemic capabilities that we have built as a planetary civilization (such as those exemplified by the microchip, antibiotics, satellites etc.), whilst we systemically and justly rewire our energy, materials, nutrient and cognition systems.</p><p>As we look towards the future, it is becoming increasingly evident that our pathways will not follow a single, universal transition. Instead, it will be characterized by a highly multipolar, multi-perspective, and hyperpluralistic approach. The critical question then becomes: how can we preserve this diversity of perspectives and multipolarity while fostering a new theory of diplomacy? This theory must be rooted in coordination, empathy, and respect amidst such diversity.</p><p>Central to this endeavor may be our ability to construct a new framework for diplomacy that can facilitate negotiation and understanding between various worldviews, playing a pivotal role in crafting a planetary future capable of embracing complex diversities (hard and soft power, new relational theories and a framework that acknowledges interconnected and, shared destinies on a global scale (both human, more than human and machine capability).</p><p>In addition, innovative institutions and the development of new institutional capacities will be required. The concept of diplomacy needs to be reimagined, including by the use of computational machinery and dynamic protocols that can make diplomacy not only more efficient but also legitimate by effectively integrating non-nation state actors and different regional blocs and perspectives, wider groups such as indigenous nations, and even diplomacy that takes into account future generations and more than human species. At last, the infrastructure exists to support the most providing the necessary infrastructure to support the most diverse of plurality. This will lay the groundwork for a new planetary future — and one that harmoniously integrates an array of perspectives and approaches.</p><p>Furthermore, it is also becoming increasingly apparent that as we shift away from our current material economy — a system that has generated abundance for some segments of society and scarcity for others — we are entering an era marked by greater scarcity. This transition could potentially lead us towards a novel concept of abundance. However, this journey is not without its challenges. As we begin to encounter the limitations inherent in our economies, particularly the rise of net-zero-sum scenarios, the risk of conflict and war further escalates.</p> The crucial question is: how do we navigate this transition? How do we move from a reality dominated by the dynamics of abundance through a valley of scarcity to a new paradigm of abundance? The new abundance could be conceptualized not just in material terms but also in terms of meaning. As we constrain our material economy and reshape the social signaling functions that it serves, we need to approach this transformation with careful consideration. There is a potential, perhaps in the next 40 years, to unlock a new era of energy abundance. This could revolutionize our material economy, creating both material and cognitive abundance in ways previously unimagined. <p>While this future pathway holds a promise, it is important to acknowledge that we are entering a world characterized by diminishing — particularly 19th century concepts of abundances. The implications of operating in such a world are profound and warrant significant attention and strategic planning.</p><p>Indy Johar with support from Dm colleagues — all errors and omissions are&nbsp;mine…</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/7-structural-shifts-25c5e0801b9b">7 Structural Shifts:</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Cloud storage is amazing — and risky 







<p>The 2000s may be over, but cloud storage is still amazing. Services such as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, Apple’s <a href="https://www.icloud.com/">iCloud</a>, Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Drive</a>, and Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage">OneDrive</a> all help users share files with friends, recover when a hard drive crashes, and move files between their devices. Still, hearing about data breaches[<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/dropbox-files-left-unprotected-open-to-all">1</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nz74qb/hackers-stole-over-60-million-dropbox-accounts">2</a>, <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/dropbox-breach-130-github/">3</a>] leaves people wondering whether their data is safe in the cloud.</p>



 Security on today’s cloud lacks end-to-end encryption 







<p>Today’s cloud storage services use fairly similar client–server architectures that start with a locally installed application that monitors a specific file folder on a user’s computer. When the app detects changes in the folder, it relays them to the user’s account on the cloud. The cloud service handles copying them to a user’s other devices.</p>



<p>One of the problems with cloud storage is that files are not end–to–end encrypted (E2EE) – meaning that files encrypted before leaving a user’s device do not remain encrypted until they return. Rather, most providers use the transport encryption + encryption at rest paradigm. In this model, transport encryption encrypts files sent to the server (e.g., HTTPS), but decrypts them upon arrival. Next, the server applies encryption at rest so that only encrypted files are stored. While providers tout the strength of their encryption algorithms (e.g., AES 256), what they don’t highlight is that the server decrypts user files before re-encrypting them and that they hold the decryption keys!</p>



<p>While this model is efficient, it is vulnerable to attack or service provider bugs and unfortunately is the mainstay of cloud storage. This leaves users wondering: Are cloud providers accessing my data? and Can hackers steal my digital files? &nbsp;</p>



 We can make the cloud safer with Decentralized Identity 



<p>Answering those questions is difficult and varies over time. So, how do individual users protect their files in the cloud? One idea is to help users layer end–to–end encryption (E2EE) on top of any features the cloud storage services provide. This is fairly easy using the cryptographic features of decentralized identity (DI).</p>



<p>The DIDComm messaging specification was created to provide a platform-independent yet interoperable encrypted messaging capability that enables users of a wide range of DI platforms to exchange end-to-end encrypted messages.</p>



<p>This E2EE messaging capability can be used to secure files stored on virtually any cloud storage platform without divulging any plaintext file data content to the cloud service. Further, by storing secure files in an encrypted messaging format, those files can potentially be activated to later perform a myriad of secure file services for security and privacy conscious users.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF73 rewards. DF74 runs Jan 25 — Feb 1,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 73 (DF73) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Jan 18, 2024 and ended 12:01am Jan 25. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF74 is live today, Jan 25. It concludes on Feb 1. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF74   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF74 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Are you the top Data Scientist in the land? Demonstrate your case for 1st place in this year’s data challenge championship season.  Introduction <p>This blog introduces the kickoff of the 2024 Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Championship. The<a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo"> first Data Challenge of the year</a> is live on Desights now and ends on Tuesday, Jan 30, 2024. ’24 is the 3rd year of Ocean Protocol-sponsored data science competitions. This year welcomes season 2 of the championship and leaderboard points. Additional details about the 2023 Season can be found <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/2023-data-challenge-championship-leaderboard-awards-f489cc45cf99">in this blog post</a>. Some minor details have been added/subtracted to this year’s championship, which are presented below:</p> What’s New This&nbsp;Season? <p>2023 welcomed over 200 unique data scientists competing in data challenges. To accommodate an increasing number of recurring participants, we have raised the prize pool for each data challenge from $5000 USD to $10,000 USD available every challenge. Due to this, the 200 OCEAN participation bonus for submitting reports &amp; proposals has concluded.</p><p>Starting with the current data challenge (<a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo">Road to Safety: Traffic Accident Analysis</a>) the $10,000 prize pool will be distributed to the top 10 scored submissions per data challenge. Additionally, leaderboard points for the championship season will be rewarded for every challenge, scaled to the top 10 on a given data challenge. All participants outside of the top 10 will not receive points towards the championship season leaderboard. Furthermore, new data challenges will begin roughly on 2 Thursdays of each month, and each will be open to participate for 20 days. 2022 &amp; 2023 data challenges tested different time durations between 7–30 days. It has been determined that initiatives and hypothesis testing that require longer than 20 days will be tagged and executed as something other than a data challenge (data science competition).</p><p>Beyond the program structure, new features and functionalities of <a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo">Desights.ai</a> continue to roll out regularly. Desights is the application that the Ocean Data Science team uses to conduct data challenges. The platform continues to mature as the web3 platform to crowdsource solutions to AI &amp; ML challenges, business intelligence, applied data science, and predictive analytics.</p> How It&nbsp;Works <p>There are 3 points to pay attention to while submitting:</p>  You will need a Desights Profile to submit to a data challenge. If you don’t have one, you can follow this simple tutorial to create one:<a href="https://docs.desights.ai/guides/creating-desights-profile"> https://docs.desights.ai/guides/creating-desights-profile</a>  Before submitting make sure you have the valid asset URL for your submission.

<p>When people talk about <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">onboarding and offboarding</a>, onboarding gets all the attention. We talk about how to make a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/what-to-look-for-in-an-employee-onboarding-tool-for-small-businesses/">seamless onboarding experience and get your new employee to work fast</a>. How to provide them with the birthright apps they need to do their job. But we don’t talk about what happens when it’s time to part ways with an employee and what needs to be done then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuring proper offboarding is a huge concern for small businesses. When you part ways with an employee, there’s a lot you can forget that can leave you vulnerable:&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the recovery email and phone number aren’t reset, the user might be able to regain access to their account. 
 If you forget to forward the user’s email, you might miss out on important communication from your customers.&nbsp; 
 If you don’t promptly deprovision the user’s accounts from third-party applications, you might be paying more in license costs than you need. 
 
<p>Luckily, it’s not all up to you to remember every step. Here’s how you can handle employee offboarding in YeshID.</p>
 Easier employee offboarding in YeshID 
<p>To offboard someone in YeshID, select that person from your Organization, and in the side car that opens, click ‘Offboard.’ From here, you can choose:&nbsp;</p>
 
 What action you wish to perform (suspending vs deleting) 
 Who, if anyone, to assign access to the employee’s Google Docs/Drive, Calendar, etc. data 
 Who, if anyone, should receive new email sent to the old address 
 When you would like the process initiated 
 
<p>As long as you are <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/3-reasons-to-ditch-the-access-management-spreadsheet-for-yeshid-access-grid/">managing application access</a> in YeshID, we will also create subtasks for applications which need to be deprovisioned. This is a big differentiator from how you can manage this process in the Google Workspace console. Offboarding directly in the console only turns off “sign in with Google” accounts for the user. But what about accounts that use a work email and password? YeshID helps you track all application access to make sure the user is offboarded from any company applications they had access to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let’s dive into each option.&nbsp;</p>
 Offboarding with the intention to suspend 
<p>This is a good option if you want to remove access for a user but don’t want to completely delete them. For example, maybe the user was privy to critical business data that you don’t want to risk losing, or maybe it’s a seasonal contractor that you plan to reinstate later in the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what happens when you suspend a user in YeshID:</p>
 
 The user’s data will be kept, but they won’t receive emails, calendar invitations, or files as long as they’re suspended (note: this does require you to maintain a Google Workspace license for the user).&nbsp; 
 Once you specify that the user is suspended, you will be prompted to create a task list to offboard the user from the applications they have access to.&nbsp; 
 Emails are sent to the application administrators, prompting them to remove access for the user at specified time. 
 You can “unsuspend” a user at any time, as long as they’re not deleted. 
 
<p></p>
 Offboarding with the intention to delete 
<p>This is a good option if you know that you want to remove the user entirely. When you delete a user, YeshID will:</p>
 
 Reset the Google Workspace password, which will revoke any application-specific passwords tied to the user’s account 
 Log the user out of every Google session across all of their devices by invalidating their session cookies 
 Delete the user’s account recovery email and phone numbers 
 Revoke all <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">OAuth grants associated with the user’s account</a> 
 Prompt you to create a task list to offboard the user from the applications they have access to 
 Send emails to application administrators, prompting them to remove access for the user at the specified time. 
 
<p>When you delete a user, YeshID will also create a list of tasks that an admin must manually complete. While the above steps will happen automatically, these steps require confirmation from the admin to continue:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Confirm that they have transferred all email from the account they wish to save, by using the Google Data Migration Service. 
 Initiate any data transfers that were configured in the YeshID offboarding dialog (Google Docs/Drive, Calendar, etc.). 
 Delete the account in Google Workspace. 
 Set the old email address as an alias on another account so you can continue receiving new email for the old account.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the last step here, creating an alias, can’t be done until you delete the user. Then you have to remember to come back to create the alias. It’s an easy step to forget — thankfully you have that task reminder in YeshID. 😉</p>
 Easier offboarding with technology

<p>A context note from Mary Camacho: </p><p>As the executive director of an organization exploring new models of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/revolutionizing-the-workspace/">human synergy and coordination</a>, I often think about how we can enable more inclusive collaboration globally.</p><p>So it was thrilling to have the chance to speak with Catherine Stihler, whose decades of experience in geopolitical relations has given her deep wisdom.</p><p>Our wide-ranging conversation covered many aspects of policy, technology, and governance. Fundamentally, it centered on a key question — how do we bridge the many divides that hinder human cooperation and collective problem-solving?&nbsp;</p><p>There were no simple answers, but identifying the barriers provided inspiration to keep striving for coherence across cultures. By exploring the intersections of technology, regulation, and how groups communicate, we identified commonalities underlying collective problem-solving. What follows is a summary of key noticings from the conversation.&nbsp;</p> Cultural Perspectives Complicate Collaboration <p>Successful <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blending-physical-digital-collaboration/">collaboration</a> requires navigating varied mindsets and worldviews — a complex challenge. As Stihler noted, “How do you culturally navigate spaces and places?”</p><p>Her multinational career has shown that coherence demands understanding perspectives. Within the EU parliament alone, discussion happens in over 20 languages, demonstrating the diversity of communication styles. Even basic terms can mean different things across cultures.</p><p>Friction naturally occurs when bringing together people with different assumptions and motivations. As Stihler experienced, this tension is integral, if sometimes uncomfortable.</p><p>During negotiations, she focused on the ultimate policy aims that transcended cultural barriers. She focused on finding common purpose-centered compromises. Still, bridging divides can be challenging, given subjective identities and priorities. We must accept messiness in sharing space.</p><p>Keeping communication open despite discomfort aids progress. And the groups who govern play a key role in establishing incentives towards mutual understanding.</p> Inclusive Governance Requires Uncomfortable Coherence <p>Governance and policy processes necessitate navigating conflicting interests to reach collaborative decisions. As noted, this process contains inherent “tension” and “discomfort.” When representing constituencies with varying needs and values, perfect solutions fail.</p><p>Progress means reconciling disagreements.&nbsp;</p><p>Stihler recounted challenging EU regulations where health priorities competed with economic ones. Compromising entailed painful sacrifices on multiple sides. However, with shared underlying aims, adversaries transformed into collaborators united by a common purpose</p><p>While universal access to collaboration and information is ideal, Stihler noted that some limitations can spur healthy competition, stating:</p><blockquote>“Not all barriers are bad. Some can encourage innovations.”</blockquote><p>For example, within a single economic market, preventing total domination by one company allows space for newcomers and alternate models like co-ops. Rules ensure stability while still providing openings for diverse contributors.</p> Overcoming Persistent Digital Divides <p>Despite the connectivity promised by digital tools, barriers still limit access and divide users. As Stihler explained, restrictions like “geo-blocking” prevent sharing media across country borders, hindering collaboration. While the EU’s “Digital Single Market” intended seamlessness, gaps remain, frustrating users across member states and other countries.</p><p>For non-EU countries, these false boundaries are especially visible. From a UK or US perspective, the borders seem technical and arbitrary, given the ability to instantly share data globally. However, preventing access contradicts the spirit of open digital space. We must keep pioneering tools giving users agency and accessibility.</p><p>While some limitations aim to encourage market competition, others serve little purpose beyond denying availability. More and more people cross borders because families, friends, and now businesses are moving. And the digital tools they use also evolve alongside this change. This is a sweet spot for Holochain because the architecture requires the consent of the users and apps built with it — rather than centralized server hosting to connect groups together.</p> Bridging Divides Through Understanding <p>Technology alone cannot solve barriers to cooperation stemming from varied cultural perspectives and incentives. However, frameworks that help build bridges and foster mutual understanding can assist with reconciliation.&nbsp;</p><p>As the EU demonstrates, keeping communication open across cultural divides provides critical conduits for compromise, even if tension persists. Institutions play a vital role in sustaining conduits for exchange.</p><p>While universal inclusion remains an ideal, moderate limitations sustaining diversity also prove essential for progress by preventing stagnant monopolies and stimulating competition. With open, equitable rules of engagement, such friction engenders innovation rather than isolation.</p><p>As remote and hybrid work evolve, integrating the magic of embodied teamwork with virtual capabilities remains imperative to human progress. For it is amidst the messiness of the human experience that the future unfolds.</p><p>If you enjoyed this article, feel free to share it or drop a comment and share your thoughts. We want to hear from you!</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has emerged as a pivotal tool in cybersecurity, a security key to bolstering the fortifications guarding sensitive information and systems. Essential to comprehending the broader discussion on MFA security is an understanding of the phenomenon termed “MFA Fatigue.” This concept encapsulates the exhaustion and inconvenience experienced by users due to repetitive and cumbersome multi-factor authentication and processes. Addressing this issue is instrumental in cultivating a cybersecurity environment that is both secure and user-friendly.</p>
 What is MFA Fatigue? 
<p>MFA Fatigue is a multifaceted challenge with various contributing factors. The core of this issue lies in the repetitive and often cumbersome login process and processes that users must navigate to authenticate their identities, compromised credentials, mobile device, username and password, and account. This can lead to exhaustion and frustration, diminishing the overall user experience and potentially leading to lax security practices.<br>
An in-depth examination of MFA Fatigue requires exploring its manifestations and impacts on user behavior. Recognizing the signs and symptoms is essential to preemptively addressing potential challenges and mitigating risks. It is crucial to analyze how MFA Fatigue influences user interactions with security protocols and its subsequent impact on user credentials and overall cybersecurity hygiene.</p>
 How does an MFA Fatigue Attack Start? 
<p>MFA Fatigue attacks begin by exploiting users’ weariness from engaging with multiple, repetitive authentication processes. Attackers anticipate that tired and frustrated users are more likely to make mistakes or bypass security protocols, making executing attacks like phishing or account and password hijacking easier.<br>
The attacker’s goal is to take advantage of these moments of vulnerability, where legitimate users might overlook suspicious activities or ignore security alerts because they desire a more straightforward authentication process.<br>
In these attacks, adversaries mimic legitimate authentication requests or login attempts, creating a sense of urgency, forcing the users to act quickly and without much thought. Users already fatigued by numerous authentication steps are more prone to fall for these tactics, giving attackers the access or information they seek, thus compromising the security defenses set by the MFA processes.</p>
 What is an example of a MFA fatigue attack? 
<p>One typical example of an MFA Fatigue attack is a phishing scheme where the attacker impersonates a trusted service with stolen credentials with which the user frequently interacts, such as an email provider or a corporate system.<br>
The user receives a message urging them to log in and attempt to confirm their identity by clicking a link. Since users often encounter multiple authentication requests, they might proceed without thoroughly evaluating the request’s legitimacy, potentially exposing sensitive information.<br>
Another example could be an attacker exploiting the users’ familiarity with authentication processes to make a login attempt to gain access or create a spoofed login page. Users, tired of repeatedly entering credentials and going through MFA procedures, may not meticulously check the URL or the page’s security, entering their information into a fraudulent site, which then captures their credentials and potentially bypasses MFA protections.</p>
 Is MFA fatigue social engineering? 
<p>MFA fatigue indirectly fosters a conducive environment for social engineering attacks. Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.<br>
MFA fatigue contributes to this by making users more susceptible to attacks due to their weariness and frustration from constant authentication requests. Most users might be less vigilant and more willing to comply with unusual requests, thinking it is just another part of the authentication process.<br>
However, it’s important to clarify that MFA request fatigue is not a social engineering attack. It is a state of user exhaustion and frustration due to repetitive MFA request processes, which attackers exploit using social engineering techniques, like phishing or pretexting, to deceive users into lowering their defenses and revealing sensitive information or access.</p>
 Evolving Landscape of Cybersecurity and MFA 
<p>Tracing the trajectory of MFA technologies provides valuable insights into their current state and future directions. Initially, MFA emerged as a groundbreaking approach to secure authentication, offering robust defenses against unauthorized access to login credentials, security keys, and authentication messages. However, as cyber threats have evolved, so have the demands on MFA technologies to provide enhanced security without compromising usability.<br>
The present landscape presents a crucible of challenges and opportunities. Technological advances and signs in a heightened threat environment necessitate continuous evolution and adaptation of MFA strategies. Organizations must be agile and responsive to maintain sensitive data integrity and security postures while mitigating MFA Fatigue.</p>
 Technological Innovations Targeting MFA Fatigue 
<p>Emerging technologies present promising avenues for alleviating MFA Fatigue. Innovations continually reshape the landscape, aiming to simplify authentication processes without compromising security. Evaluating the effectiveness of these technologies and their reception by users is integral to understanding their role in combating MFA Fatigue.<br>
Many technologies, such as biometrics and adaptive authentication, have been heralded as transformative in enhancing user experience. By staying abreast of these technological trends and their implications, organizations can make informed decisions that bolster their cybersecurity while easing user fatigue.</p>
 Legal and Compliance Considerations in MFA 
<p>In the labyrinth of multi-factor authentication (MFA), legal and compliance considerations are one example of pivotal guideposts. These elements delineate organizations’ boundaries and obligations to implement and manage MFA processes. The organization’s multi-factor authentication and legal landscape encompasses various facets, including data protection regulations, user rights, and industry-specific compliance mandates.<br>
Understanding and adhering to legal and compliance considerations are non-negotiable facets of responsible MFA deployment. Organizations must stay abreast of legislative developments, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices. This adherence is instrumental in safeguarding organizational integrity, user trust, and the overall robustness of cybersecurity defenses.</p>
 User Experience (UX) Design Principles for MFA 
<p>Incorporating User Experience (UX) design principles into MFA strategies heralds a reimagined approach focused on the user’s identity-centricity. This involves designing MFA processes prioritizing ease of use, intuitive interaction, and overall user satisfaction. Effective UX design in MFA seeks to reduce complexities and frictions contributing to user fatigue and dissatisfaction.<br>
By leveraging UX design principles, MFA processes can be transformed into seamless user journeys that harmonize security and usability. Such a design ethos fosters a positive user interaction with security protocols, encouraging compliance and enhancing the security keys overall effectiveness in authentication processes.</p>
 Organizational Strategies for Implementing MFA 
<p>Deployment strategies within organizations play a critical role in the reception and effectiveness of MFA processes. Thoughtful implementation involves careful planning, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement mechanisms. Crafting strategies that consider organizational dynamics, technical infrastructures, and user needs are paramount.<br>
Adoption and usability are key considerations in the strategic deployment of an MFA system. Organizations must foster environments supporting user education and adaptation, providing necessary resources, training, and support. Such comprehensive strategies pave the way for the successful integration of MFA as a robust and user-friendly component of organizational cybersecurity.</p>
 Continuous Improvement: Analytics and Feedback 
<p>Embracing a philosophy of continuous improvement propels MFA strategies toward evolving excellence. Utilizing analytics offers a lens into user interactions, behaviors, and challenges within the MFA processes. With user feedback, analytics forge a pathway to insightful enhancements and refinements.<br>
Feedback loops, encompassing user insights and analytical data, become the bedrock for informed decision-making. They facilitate the identification of areas for improvement, user challenges, and opportunities for optimization. By nurturing a culture of continuous improvement, organizations can maintain MFA processes that are both contemporary and user-centric.</p>

<p>Over the years, the ways in which we get from A to B have changed based on how the mobility industry has developed as well as major world events impacting travel choices and decisions. However, finding the fastest and easiest way to get to our final destinations still remains the major priority. But not only do we want fast and easy travel but also convenience paired with cost savings, and we want to be able to know all our options.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">Shared mobility</a> such as car sharing and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility</a> will continue to see growth <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/carsharing-market">over the next 10 years</a> due to increasing environmental regulations, there are plenty of choices for consumers, but how can they find the best based on their immediate needs?</p>



<p>Enter Mobility as a Service (MaaS)—a one-stop traveling shop, which takes every type of transportation into account and provides its users the best optimized route to their destination. A concept focusing on a “bundled service model,” consumers are in a sense buying into mobility, instead of investing in transport equipment such as personal vehicles.</p>



<p>With the global Mobility as a Service market projected to <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/mobility-as-a-service-maas-market-102066">grow from $236.42 billion in 2022 to $774.93 billion by 2029</a>, companies need to bear in mind where MaaS is headed and how they can become part of this growing movement.</p>



 What is Mobility as a Service (MaaS)? 



<p>Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is an emerging trend that is transforming the way we use and access transportation. The overarching idea of MaaS is that it is an integration of various forms of transport and transport-related services into a single, comprehensive and on-demand mobility service. Basically, everything at the touch of a button. This in effect allows users to access all types of transportation (walking, car sharing, public transportation, micromobility, etc.) in one application with a single payment channel. Say goodbye to the multiple ticket purchasing stress.</p>



<p>Instead, services are <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">becoming consolidated</a> by having one application for all their travel needs.</p>



 Why is MaaS important? 



<p>The importance of MaaS lies in the concept itself. By reducing the inconveniences associated with accessing individual transportation services, MaaS provides a one travel service from planning to booking to paying, creating a more fluid and integrated experience of transportation. This results in less congestion, fewer emissions and lower operating costs all while providing a more accessible and inclusive journey for those individuals with limited mobility. Plus, MaaS allows for the integration of smart city data to create efficient and cost-effective traffic management systems. In the long run, MaaS holds great promise for improving accessibility, affordability, sustainability and efficiency in our transportation networks.</p>



<p>Additionally, every person has their own unique needs based on their job, interests, financial profile, physical capabilities, behaviors, relationships, personal preferences and more. Putting these all together creates a specific identity that can be tailored to when it comes to transportation and exactly what MaaS will provide since alternative transport options will be available in a one-stop shop.</p>



<p>In short, MaaS could be the final puzzle piece needed to make urban life smoother, faster and cheaper for everyone.&nbsp;</p>



 What are Mobility as a Service examples? 



<p>Mobility as a Service can sometimes be confusing when wondering which apps and operators fall under which category. Some MaaS providers, such as ride hailing apps (Uber) and peer-to-peer rental services (GoGet &amp; FlexiCar) are currently good examples of MaaS that focus on one or two areas. However, with the <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/mobility-as-a-service-market">expected CAGR around 7.43% over the next five years</a> and Asia-Pacific the fastest growing market, major players in the MaaS industry include Enterprise, Hertz and Moovit.</p>



<p>However, the future of MaaS looks toward apps that can provide all services in one place such as Whim based in Helsinki, but also available in the UK, Belgium, Austria, Japan, etc. Whim combines over 2,500+ taxis, car rentals and public transport options, helping users plan and book better journeys through smartphone technology. This can also be seen from the business side as well. UK-based company Mobilleo is a Mobility as a Service app specifically for businesses. Whether a self-employed business or a fleet manager, Mobilleo combines thousands of travel providers into one app to help businesses find, book and pay for their journey in one solution.</p>



 



 

 



 Digital identity: the building block of MaaS. 



<p>But what does this mean exactly for users and operators? Well, for one it means the importance of data. In order to provide what consumers are looking for data must be shared. However, security concerns arise from both the consumer and operator when it comes to data collection and could keep MaaS from growing. Consumers fear the attractiveness this service would be for fraudsters, while also doubting the legitimacy of ID verification platforms. On the other hand, operators worry about the challenge of proper driver’s license verification and preventing minors/fraudsters from using their services.</p>



<p>In a way, the root of the problem is the lack of security on both ends and the possibility of the mishandling of data, which would put the fate of MaaS in jeopardy. A strong <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/mix-maas-mobility-service-final.pdf">framework for data sharing</a> and identity verification therefore needs to be put in place in order for MaaS ro be successful. But there’s really no need to worry because there is a solution.</p>



 The missing link: security through identification. 



<p>The key to this new service is what connects the various modes of transportation and their service operators in order to support MaaS and provide a smooth multi-leg and multi-modal journey for customers. But what exactly is the key? Simple. Digital identity verification.</p>



<p>With all transportation options listed in one area, having digital identity verification is crucial so providers know who is using their services. Plus, providers want to offer the best service to their customers (in hopes that you will use them again) and can do that by way of having the digital identities of its users. But consumers also benefit by seeing what the mobility providers can offer them. Basically, it’s a two-way street where both parties can be satisfied.</p>



<p>But why exactly is digital identification necessary? Not only does it provide consumers and companies the benefits of this two-way street, but it offers trust, which is the foundation of any relationship.</p>



<p>Because MaaS is a platform displaying various modes of transport, there are some services that will need to know if a customer possesses a valid driver’s license or is the appropriate age to use their application. Additionally, any leasing contracts for car-sharing also can require a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">qualified electronic signature</a> or proof of bank account. But no matter what they may require, a one-time, fast, seamless and automated identity verification is all that is needed.</p>



<p>Plus, as more and more services become digitalized, companies will offer the opportunity for users to store their digital identities in a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> so verification can become even more simplified and efficient while traveling. Since MaaS is housed all in one application, all needed documents, tickets, etc. will be in one place while on-the-go. Travel will be like it never has before. &nbsp;</p>



 







 Convenience is the goal. 



<p>Though still a new concept, MaaS will become more popular in the future due to its main function. It provides convenience for all its users. Mobility doesn’t need to be a hassle or stressful and people don’t want it to be. Instead, it should be easy and smooth. MaaS provides exactly that with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">assistance from digital identity verification</a>.</p>



<p>Not only is MaaS convenient, but so is proving your identity. IDnow offers automated solutions which require only a quick photo snap of your ID or driver’s license. Even a qualified electronic signature can be added when necessary. With a process that only requires a few minutes, users can do so from on-the-go, wherever they may be. IDnow is the solution for knowing customers’ true identities so they can carry on with their journey.<br><br>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">Fueling the demand of convenient mobility</a></p>



 A partnership leading us into tomorrow. 



<p>In today’s growing mobility sector, having a digital identity is essential for both consumers and businesses. Both want to authenticate the other and feel secure in their relationship. Thus, these digital identities are at the core of MaaS since it is a one-stop shop. It truly is a digital identity solution partnership that will lead us into the world of tomorrow’s transportation.</p>

 In 2023, new entrants to the financial system reached a monumental milestone, for all the wrong reasons. 



 



<p>Last year, for the first time ever, crypto firms and fintechs received more fines than traditional financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f2a8c1e4-30f2-49c7-939b-73e0d1a22033">data analysed by the Financial Times</a>, crypto and digital payment companies paid an eye-watering $5.8 billion in fines due to a multitude of reasons, including non-compliance in anti-money laundering checks and failing to uphold sanctions and other financial crime issues.</p>



 Findings and failings. 



<p>In total, crypto firms recorded 11 separate fines in 2023 compared to an annual average of just two over the last five years. Meanwhile, payments firms recorded 27 fines, which was a huge increase on their annual average of five per year from 2018 to 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most fines levied against payments groups were to fintech groups that were less than 20 years old.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is a surprising shift in the global payments space, and just goes to show that such punishments can be levied out to even the most digital-savvy sectors.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director, Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at&nbsp;IDnow</blockquote>



<p>“Gone are the days where bad behavior will be tolerated by newcomers to the financial industry. With major players like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-first-hit-1-bln-assets-2024-01-19/">Blackrock recently launching its bitcoin ETF</a>, which boasts huge compliance operations as well as general risk aversion, the industry is likely, and will need to, grow up quickly in 2024 and beyond,” added Rayissa.</p>



<p>The main contributor to the astronomical amount of 5.8 billion in fines was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/21/binance-settlement-crypto-exchange">$4.3 billion penalty</a> levied against crypto exchange Binance, which was set “purposefully high.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reasons for the mammoth fine were attributed to violations of:&nbsp;</p>



  The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)<br>  Failure to register as a money transmitting business<br>  Violations to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).&nbsp;  



<p>“Binance became the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in US history. The message here should be clear: using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor, it makes you a criminal,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen was even clearer in her <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">damnation of the crypto platform</a>, stating how Binance’s “wilful” failures to adhere to AML and sanctions compliance allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, this was not the only wake-up call that should have set off alarm bells in the crypto community in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The much-publicized decision to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d153b0-0c28-4946-acbe-2e93329bca52">convict the founder of FTX of money laundering</a> and fraud sent further shockwaves through the industry. Despite such turbulence, there were also significant steps taken to stabilize crypto in 2023, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Market in Crypto Assets regulatory framework (MiCA)</a>, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer of Funds regulation (TFR)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed regulatory regime</a>, which neared ever closer to completion. As the regulations are finally likely to be enforced in 2024, this could not happen at a more crucial time.</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-first-future-trends-2024/">Discover which trends are likely to affect the crypto (and gambling and financial services) industry in 2024.</a>  



<blockquote><p>2024 may very well prove to be a watershed year for the crypto industry. It’s likely that the upcoming crypto regulations will have a positive impact and act as a stabilizing force, while the fines should serve as a deterrent and remind crypto firms that AML laws and regulations apply to them too.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director, Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at&nbsp;IDnow&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>“However, there’s also a very real chance that firms, especially new entrants to the crypto and fintech market that are in a rush to establish themselves and onboard as many customers as possible, may bypass certain steps in customer controls. This is not advisable. KYC processes, and rigorous identity checks are in place for a reason – to protect the business and the customer.”</p>



 Light at the end of the tunnel? 



<p>Besides the aforementioned regulatory frameworks due to be enforced later this year, 2024 has already started with some reassuring developments regarding crypto regulation. Chief among these was guidance issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which extended its <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-issues-guidance-crypto-asset-service-providers">guidelines on money laundering and terrorist financing</a> to crypto asset service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Council and European Parliament also recently announced that it had reached a provisional agreement on the decision to create the brand-new <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/12/13/anti-money-laundering-council-and-parliament-agree-to-create-new-authority/">Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA)</a> – a European authority with the expressed purpose of countering money laundering and financing of terrorism. Technical negotiations are expected to be ongoing for months, with a tentative aim of formally adopting final agreement by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proposals put forward include:&nbsp;</p>



  Requirements for financial institutions to conduct <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/enhanced-due-diligence/">enhanced due diligence</a> on wealthy individuals, or on transactions involving high amounts.<br>  Enhanced due diligence for cross-border crypto transactions.&nbsp;  



<p>While obliged entities, including financial institutions, banks, real estate agencies, asset management services, casinos, and merchants traditionally enforce AML requirements like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a>, the new rules now cover most of the crypto ecosystem. All crypto-asset service providers will now be required to conduct due diligence on customers, including verifying personal KYC data, with such data required to accompany transfers under the Travel Rule when transactions exceed €1000 or more.</p>



 Stronger together. 



<p>In February, 2024, we joined a consortium of five partners, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a>, with the aim of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;[Read more about TFR in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">blog, ‘EU extends TFR to crypto, requiring KYC for all crypto transactions.’</a>]</p>



<p>A major challenge for CASPs will be to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the consortium has proposed a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII.</p>



<p>Discover more about the consortium by reading the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/consortium-crypto-assets-compliant-eu-regulations/">press release </a>and watching the explainer video below.</p>



 



 

 



 Putting the KYC into crypto and fintech. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also an important requirement to comply with AML, MiCA and other crypto-related regulation. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The bottom line is that KYC and Know Your Business is at the nexus of this world and people are catching up to this reality – you have to know who is out there – as people go on or off chain or in and out of the traditional banking world,” warned Rayissa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">fintech</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our online identity verification methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

			 Year of Tokeny: 2023’s Milestones &amp; 2024’s Tokenization Predictions 
 
<p>I hope you kicked off the new year with great energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, our people are what make us outstanding. As a remote-first team, we prioritize coming together each year for retreats to forge physical connections, align our visions, and simply share great moments.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Last week, our journey led us to the picturesque Puigcerdà in Spain. Amidst breathtaking mountain hikes, indulgent spa experiences, and delightful culinary adventures, we also found time for some highly efficient meetings. It was truly amazing, and we had the pleasure of meeting one of our first members, Nida, who finally joined us in person after six years of dedicated work at Tokeny from Turkey.</p>
<p>As we reflect on the achievements of 2023, we are thrilled to share the highlights that have propelled us to the forefront of tokenization.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>? Tokeny’s Triumphs:</p>
<p>2023 marked Tokeny’s 6th year, a milestone that brought numerous celebrations, including:</p>
 
 45 new financial institutions as customers and partners 
 Apex Group Investment: We secured new investment from Apex Group, which underscores institutional support for tokenization, enabling us to scale further. 
 Security Focus: We continued to demonstrate our commitment to the highest security standards, earning a perfect&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/hacken-grants-tokenization-protocol-erc3643-a-10-10-security-audit-score/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TWJvQCv5Tmn4PFraBdAJfM5dPEqyzi3LMCaA0aSR2YexP0dbsuLhW18K2gWtTTmmrvwpC">10/10 audit score</a>&nbsp;from Hacken and obtaining&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/how-tokeny-became-the-most-secure-tokenization-platform-worldwide/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TWJvQCv5Tmn4PFraBdAJfM5dPEqyzi3LMCaA0aSR2YexP0dbsuLhW18K2gWtTTmmrvwpC">SOC2 Type 1</a>&nbsp;certification. 
 Revenue Boom: We increased our annual revenue by a stellar 100%. 
 176k readerships of our newsletter. 
 5,679 companies contacted us to collaborate or learn from us. 
 Team Growth: Our team expanded by 25%.
 
 And, two of our team members expanded their family by welcoming a newborn ?.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>? Eventful Year:</p>
<p>We gained global presence by attending 52 events worldwide, and speaking at 38. Additionally, we participated in 16 webinars, and featured in 2 podcasts.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>We selected some of the most interesting digital content for you:</p>

<p>? Growing Network of Issuers, Asset Managers and Servicers:</p>
 
 LinkedIn Reach: We saw a 48% growth in our follower base, reaching over 8k followers on LinkedIn. 
 Newsletter Expansion: We welcomed 2.4k new subscribers, our newsletter community now stands at 9.9k, including influential institutional subscribers from top asset managers like JP Morgan, State Street, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs. 
 
<p>? ERC-3643 Standardization Contribution:</p>
 
 Association Launch: We successfully launched the ERC3643 Association with 45 prominent actively participating members, including top-tier financial institutions, global law firms, and blockchain leaders like SS&amp;C, Invesco, CMS, Apex Group, and Polygon. 
 EIP Recognition: Achieving final status in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), the ERC-3643 was officially recognized as the de facto token standard for compliant tokenization. 
 
<p>Predictions for 2024</p>
<p>The upcoming year promises to be full of tokenization breakthroughs. Our predictions are:</p>
 
 5 out of the top 10 asset managers will tokenize assets:&nbsp;Tokenized products will be introduced by half of the top 10 asset managers. 
 Standardization with ERC-3643:&nbsp;The entire industry will start to build valuable use cases and form a dynamic ecosystem with a validated token standard ERC-3643 instead of reinventing the wheel. 
 Regulated entities will start tokenizing cash: A few large financial institutions will issue stablecoins, e-money or deposit tokens. 
 US regulation will open up:&nbsp;The US market is set to open up, compelling others to hasten their initiatives. 
 Institutions go public blockchain:&nbsp;It opens the door for interoperability with DeFi, driving demands from investors by adding utility to their assets and innovation. 
 
<p>As we kick-off 2024, we are prepared for the challenges and opportunities in the tokenization landscape. Your support has been pivotal, and together, we are set for an even more dynamic year ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a crucial part of Tokeny’s journey!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/quicktake/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a> (AI) has many upsides, but a significant downside is its role in creating <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">deep fakes</a> and other identity theft fraud mechanisms. The technology is increasingly accessible and affordable, manipulatable media is freely available across the internet, and detecting real from fake is growing more difficult by the day.</p>



<p>A ‘deep fake’ is a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">video</a>, image, or audio of a real or fictitious person’s likeness or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1165448073/voice-clones-ai-scams-ftc">voice</a> that was substantially modified or generated using <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-machine-learning-everything-you-need-to-know/">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">generative AI</a>. The result is convincing content that looks and sounds like it comes from a specific person. In the case of the popular <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/grandparent-scams-get-more-sophisticated">grandparent scam</a>, that ‘specific person’ is the victim’s grandchild whose voice and image have been manipulated to convey a fearful message, while in the growing number of corporate or <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/regulating-ai-deepfakes-and-synthetic-media-political-arena">political deep fakes</a>, the subject could be a CEO, political opponent or even a president.</p>



<p>Deep fakes are used to defraud money and spread disinformation. They threaten privacy, reputation, finances, and peace, potentially on a global scale.</p>



<p>The US government is moving to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">regulate</a> deep fakes, and some commercial operations have introduced <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">deep fake detection technology</a>, so there are solutions on the horizon. But a solution we see enormous potential in is <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/08/17-industries-with-viable-use-cases-for-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity technology</a>, grounded in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">blockchain</a>.</p>



<p>In a nutshell:</p>



 
 Web3 and DI technologies would deliver some secure content “locks” that could be quickly checked and verified as irrefutable proof of authenticity. 



 Blockchain would make it incredibly difficult for malicious actors to manipulate or tamper with digital content since every change would be permanently recorded and verifiable. 
 



<p></p>



<p>There are a few ways to leverage this technology:</p>



 
 A person would possess an official <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identifier</a> (DID) (which includes a public key) on a public blockchain. Any piece of content that person creates would be cryptographically hashed and signed with a digital signature created by the private key associated with their public key, proving its authenticity, or 



 A person would hold verified credentials for their digital persona in a digital wallet, which again would prove the authenticity of their created content. In the digital wallet, they would also store other verified real-world credentials for their digital persona, such as driver license, passport, proof of residency and so on, or 



 A person could store in their digital wallet <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFT ) backed by blockchains to prove ownership of digital assets including video and voice recordings.&nbsp; If a recording is protected by an NFT owned by a reliable person or organization then the recording can be trusted and is not subject to fraud. 
 



<p>With all these solutions, anyone watching a video or listening to or reading a piece of content could be assured of the content’s author and that the content has not been modified. This provides protection against deep fakes, including those created using AI.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decentralized-signature-countering-deepfakes-julien-maldonato/">great article</a> from Deloitte summarizes the 6 ways Web3 and DI would act as a safeguard against deep fakes and other generative AI scam mechanisms:</p>







<p>1. Provenance tracking: Cryptography and distributed ledger technology makes it almost impossible to conceal manipulated origins of content.</p>







<p>2. Self-sovereign identity: DI gives the user complete control over their identity, including their content, shutting out the potential criminal element.</p>







<p>3. Tamper-proof meta data: Embedding cryptographically verified metadata such as timestamps, location, and device information, readily distinguishes authentic content from manipulated versions.</p>







<p>4. Authenticity certificates: Digital certificates attached to validated original media act as irrefutable proof of authenticity.</p>







<p>5. Algorithmic detection: Blockchain-based platforms can use deepfake detection software that algorithmically flags suspected fakes and deters bad actors.</p>







<p>6. Incentives alignment: Leveraging tokenized incentives and reputation staking, common in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a> models, may discourage the production and dissemination of manipulated content.</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more …</p>



<p>Interestingly, on the flip side of AI is its potential to combat the scams it actually helped create by shoring up Web3 and DI systems. AI can help secure identities and monitor social networks for suspicious activity or profiles, weeding out forgeries and inauthentic content.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/28/how-ai-and-web3-id-tech-can-defeat-deepfake-frauds/?sh=158ec8394814">Forbes</a> writer describes this “quid pro quo” arrangement between Web3/DI and AI this way: “Blockchain-verified profiles can offer a type of ‘proof of humanity,’ a place to store digital assets and identifiers, and a single point of access into the Web3 ecosystem—all while keeping the user’s privacy under their control. Meanwhile, AI can work to monitor and secure these profiles, keeping people from becoming the next victims of AI-wielding criminals.”</p>



<p>We can act right now</p>



<p>This is an interesting and rapidly evolving topic. For now, the key takeaway is that AI-driven fraud will likely remain a threat for some time, but leveraging Web3 and DI technology grounded in blockchain and even pairing it with AI technology presents a viable solution that’s available right now. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Explore the solutions we offer in Sudo Platform</a>.</p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Decentralized identity governance covers both the traditional remit of governance —&nbsp;who is in control and therefore accountable — with the technical policies, rules, and procedures that apply to any given use of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>This hybridity can be a source of confusion. Those from the business world may think in terms of corporate governance and those from the engineering world may think in terms of technical stacks. In merging the two, the goals of clarity and simplicity — hallmarks of good governance — run into the complexity of technology, which in the case of decentralized identity, is compounded by its recent emergence, protean capabilities, and unfamiliar concepts and terms.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to simplify and help you understand the basics so that you can start implementing the technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started 
<p>Let’s assume that you’ve already decided that you want to use decentralized identity and verifiable credential technology to share and verify data without the need for direct integrations or third parties.</p>
<p>To implement your solution, you need to ask yourself/team/partners the following question: Do you want to—</p>
<p>create an ecosystem of your own (by ecosystem we mean a complete system for issuing, holding, and verifying credentials/data/identity for a specific use case)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>only issue credentials on an existing ecosystem</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>only verify credentials on an existing ecosystem?</p>
<p>Answering “yes” to the first means you are the governance authority (or you and a partnering organization or government will co-create the governance if the solution has multiple stakeholders).</p>
<p>A “yes” to the second or third means you need to evaluate the governance of the ecosystem you’re joining to see if it meets your needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are creating an ecosystem and the use case comes with a regulatory requirement to run your own verifiable data registry/distributed ledger network, you’ll need to create network governance.</p>
<p>The image below illustrates the decision process.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>One thing to note is that most solutions do not require creating and running your own verifiable data registry/distributed ledger network. There are global networks to choose from, including the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a>, which is purposefully designed for enterprise grade solutions. The point is not having to create a distributed ledger network radically simplifies the amount of governance you have to create and manage, something that’s not always apparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 One solution, three governance elements, 
<p>For the next step, we’re going to borrow a visual aid from St. Patrick, a shamrock. Right now, any implementation of decentralized identity is going to have the following governance elements.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Ecosystem governance applies to the Issuers, holders, and verifiers of verifiable credentials. A governance authority establishes rules for participation and interaction. If you’re creating an ecosystem, as we’ve noted, you are the governance authority for all these participants.</p>
<p>Machine-readable governance is a way to encode ecosystem governance rules — that is, who is a trusted issuer, what attributes must be presented — in a file that agent software (the software used by issuers, holders, and verifiers) can access and cache. It enables human governance rules to be automated. And because the rules are cached, credential verification is possible in offline situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Network governance comprises the governance for a distributed ledger network, which includes the legal agreements for credential issuers to write to the ledger. As noted, you’re unlikely to need to create this, but you will have to evaluate other networks based on their governance and, if issuing credentials, you’re likely going to have to sign agreements to write to a network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are the key governance issues in each of these elements?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>To implement governance, you are going to have to make a series of policy and technical decisions on each of the bullet points in Ecosystem Governance, and evaluate competing networks on the bullet points in Network Governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the important decisions you are going to have to make when creating governance for an ecosystem&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity assurance —&nbsp;are you issuing credentials to people, organizations, or things? How much information in the credential will identify the person compared to describing&nbsp; the credential? For the personal identity attributes, do you need an identity assurance process?</p>
<p>Credential issuers — Will there be multiple credential issuers in your ecosystem? If so, how are they to be onboarded?</p>
<p>Credential types — what credential type should you use for people, organizations? Do you need selective disclosure? What are the policies and procedures for credential expiry, revocation? Are there any restrictions on who can verify credentials?</p>
<p>DID methods — What DID methods for which participants? Should you use a DID method with communication endpoints? How much durability do you need in your ecosystem?</p>
<p>Protocols — Do you need secure protocols for notification and confirmation? What device capabilities will your participants have?</p>
<p>Cryptographic keys — How will you manage key rotation?</p>
<p>Wallets — What are your options and requirements? Do you have a recognizable brand?</p>
<p>Networks — Will you use a network? Which one will you choose and how will it benefit your solution? (Learn more about the networks Indicio offers and <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-deep-dive-into-the-indicio-networks/">how to choose the best one to fit your needs.</a>)</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of things to consider or the place to dive in and provide analysis and recommendations. But looking at these issues and making decisions is not an Everest-summiting task. In all likelihood, you will make them in consultation with one or more partners who will likely have specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The net result will be a set of approved credential issuers (a trust list) and a set of rules for interaction between all participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We strongly recommend encoding these rules in machine-readable files that can be downloaded by each participant in the ecosystem/use case. Why? It’s simple, it’s flexible, it makes governance portable —&nbsp;and it has provided the best solution for our customers (we’ve created a <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">governance editor</a> to help automate the process).&nbsp; </p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Those are the basics. You should have a broad idea of what you need to address in order to implement or evaluate governance for your solution. It’s the starting point for understanding the decisions you need to make, and we’ll cover those decisions in future blog posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is one thought to end with, it is to choose options that provide the most flexibility for future development. Technology is not static and with something as powerful as verifiable data, the only thing you can be sure of (besides the data) is that people will innovate in ways that cannot be anticipated. We always recommend building solutions that are capable of managing multiple credential formats, easy key rotation, and (quite essentially) provide communication endpoints so that you won’t find yourself at a sudden competitive disadvantage.</p>

<p>Following a <a href="https://medium.com/@finclusive/verida-and-finclusive-bring-private-verified-identity-to-web3-and-defi-ef9ffac656fc">successful Proof of Concept (PoC) between Verida and FinClusive</a>, we are excited to announce the launch of an end-to-end solution for reusable and verifiable Known Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) credentials. This solution streamlines client onboarding and associated compliance, reduces onboarding costs, increases operational efficiency and meets existing and emerging regulatory requirements for both traditional and growing alternative and decentralized financial services.</p><p>We are continuing to build on the initial PoC with <a href="https://finclusive.com/">FinClusive</a> and <a href="https://cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>, who provides the infrastructure for credential issuance, verification, suspension and revocation. Together we can scale this combined application and enable financial services of all types to condense client onboarding times, while enabling portability and privacy controls for&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Interested organisations from traditional and web3 sectors, please <a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">book a call</a> with our joint representative Alex to capitalise on the benefits of reusable KYC/KYB credentials.</p><p>Combined, this solution provides a plug-and-play platform for financial services’ KYC/KYB needs while providing reusability, client privacy, portability, and embedded compliance controls. The technology and capabilities provided through this alignment result in the following benefits for organisations that adopt this solution:</p>  Cost Savings: Significantly reduced costs for KYC and KYB verification, by a factor of&nbsp;10x.  Efficiency: A simplified customer experience, reducing customer drop-off rates and friction during onboarding, and making re-validation and monitoring real time. Simultaneously, for companies, it reduces manual document verifications and time-sinks through instantaneous verification and trusted&nbsp;checks.  Regulatory Compliance: Full regulatory compliance for customer onboarding and associated KYC/KYB, background due diligence (basic to enhanced and bespoke), with full real-time AML checks, risk scoring and background screenings, and an ongoing monitoring engine in keeping with global best practices and requirements.  Interoperability: Full compatibility and interoperability with other organisations issuing or accepting digital credentials, with no vendor lock-in–with a growing ecosystem of vendor/partners, our combined platform can enable multiple vendor engagement, and importantly accommodate financial institutions’ individual risk profiles and methodologies.  Enhanced and Embedded Privacy: Improved data sovereignty and privacy for customers, via holding their credentials in a self-custodied wallet and explicitly consenting to when they are shared, with whom, and what data is verified. Digitally verifiable KYC/KYB-backed credentials protect sensitive underlying personal and entity identifying information (PII/EII), as well as sensitive accounts and payments information (e.g. account numbers, wallet addresses, payments flows), that can be attached to these credentials — providing essential proofs while eliminating continual data disclosures in current practice.  Standardisation: Future-proofed technology in line with the upcoming eIDAS 2.0 regulation, and in keeping with ongoing international data standards from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and International Organization of Standardization (ISO).  <p>Within Q1 2024, FinClusive will be rolling out the first verifiable credentials for KYC and KYB to streamline onboarding for financial services in web2 and also regulated organisations such as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) within&nbsp;web3.</p> Solving onboarding challenges, while reducing&nbsp;costs <p>There are currently significant challenges for companies around customer onboarding and verification where it is too costly in terms of time and money, leading to inefficiencies, to build trust in their customer-base.</p><p>This “verifiable” KYC/KYB solution positions itself to solve three major challenges faced by most companies which require identity verification checks in their course of business.</p>  High costs for KYC/KYB. With digital credentials that can be reused, this solution significantly reduces the costs for onboarding and verifying customers, for industries such as financial services, as well as opening up KYC/KYB into new&nbsp;markets  Challenging and costly compliance requirements. With an instantaneous check feature for AML assurance, risk scoring and other background screenings, compliance requirements can be met more easily than ever&nbsp;before  Time inefficiencies spent on identity assurance. With verifiable data sharing, secured by cryptographic primitives, we can provide a high level of assurance without any manual effort, saving employees and employers time.  <p>Through addressing each of these problems, we are bringing significant value to the market, with reduced costs and improved efficiency.</p><p>Amit Sharma, Founder and CEO of FinClusive has commented “The rising cost of inefficient compliance in the client onboarding, KYC/KYB and verification process is both crippling for service providers and detrimental to customers’ experience and privacy. Integrating the cheqd network into the Verida Wallet to allow users to store and share their FinClusive credentials sets an industry benchmark for a regulatory-compliant digital credential application and introduces a more efficient model for the traditional finance&nbsp;sector.”</p><p>“Expanding our partnership with Verida with the support of cheqd is very exciting as we work to build a ‘consortia’ of partners. Together, we intend to securely issue compliance credentials across a decentralized finance network, modernizing the existing process. We are excited to grow these capabilities with partners in expanding a robust, globally transportable KYC/KYB verifiable credential that streamlines essential compliance processes and brings needed privacy controls and efficiencies to client onboarding and engagement in both traditional and decentralized financial services.”</p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">Book a chat</a> with our joint representative Alex now to create a seamless client onboarding and engagement experience while enjoying the pros of reduced cost for your organisation.</p> A feature-rich solution that meets global standards <p>As a full end-to-end solution, FinClusive integrated with cheqd and Verida can offer the following capabilities for achieving the first regulatory compliant process for verifiable KYC sharing and reliance:</p>  Identity verification: FinClusive currently supports identity verification coverage in over 170 countries.  Digital credential issuance: Through cheqd’s <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/credential-service/get-started">Credential Service</a> we can issue reusable and verifiable digital credentials based on the results of these identity verification checks — for both individuals and entities (including their beneficial owners and control persons).  Credential storage and backup: Users can securely store their KYC/KYB credential in their <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Vault</a>, backed up on the decentralized <a href="http://verida.network">Verida storage&nbsp;network</a>.  Endpoints for applications and services: Applications and services can request access to this KYC credential, validating users without requiring them to repeat the KYC, creating a seamless user experience, and a value-added identity asset for clients as they engage more services from their providers and work to enable cross-services and open banking opportunities.  Real-time suspension and revocation checks: Using cheqd’s decentralized infrastructure, we provide instantaneous lookups for AML screenings and other background checks. Combined with automated ongoing client monitoring from FinClusive, credentials can be issued, managed, shared, verified, revoked as necessary in keeping with a client’s status at any given time. Further, multiple credentials can be issued and monitored in keeping with a client’s risk profile or a service provider’s risk appetite.  <p>All of these capabilities solve pain points for both traditional bank and nonbank financial institutions as well as decentralized and web-native services providers. Moreover, they facilitate a full end-to-end compliance solution while also giving customers “self-sovereign” control of their own KYC/KYB data. Not only does this have benefits in terms of data reusability, costs and data efficiency, as illustrated above, but it also meets existing and upcoming best practices for data protection requirements and eID, including:</p>  GDPR and CCPA: Achieving data minimisation and providing data subjects their rights by&nbsp;default  eIDAS: Meeting emerging European eIDAS 2.0 standards and digital credential requirements for service providers, which will set a global benchmark.  <p>In combination, this solution modernizes existing processes for both web2 and web3 regulated industries. Customers no longer need to go through a KYC process multiple times for each service they onboard to, and can be verified near instantaneously, while assuring the requisite privacy protections of their personal and financial information, which traditionally is disclosed by and between verifying institutions. This creates a more efficient market for identity verification and reduces the replication and storage of sensitive personal identification documents, while providing client control of their sensitive data and embedding the necessary protections for financial system integrity.</p> A first-of-its-kind differentiator for regulated industries <p>For most regulated industries, such as financial services, companies are obligated to put in place AML and KYC/KYB controls for their customers. However, many service providers are unaware of their obligations to conduct essential KYC/KYB beyond initial onboarding.</p><p>These extra obligations include ongoing client monitoring, dynamic risk scoring and continuous AML screening checks — required to meet various regulations across jurisdictions.</p><p>These post-onboarding obligations are vital because when sharing KYC data between two organisations, the relying party may also require “real-time” data on the client to satisfy a requisite level of assurance, minimize their counterparty risk, and to meet regulatory requirements.</p><p>Our combined solution provides such needed modernization across:</p>  Client onboarding;  Ongoing monitoring and essential compliance for regulated service providers;  Real-time compliance checks for relying&nbsp;parties.  <p>For client onboarding, our solution automates and fully digitizes the onboarding experience using digital credentials issued upon successful KYC to a users’ wallet (with FinClusive and cheqd facilitating the issuance and Verida providing the wallet and storage capabilities for the&nbsp;user).</p><p>For regulated entities and financial services, our solution automates client monitoring for dynamic risk scoring by ‘embedding’ monitoring and screening controls into an easy-to-use dashboard (using FinClusive’s existing compliance suite and tooling).</p><p>For relying parties, our solution provides real-time verification of the KYC credential AND a live “double check” of the data, feeding from on-going monitoring of the client data happening in the background (using cheqd’s decentralised and privacy-preserving status list infrastructure, in conjunction with FinClusive’s compliance suite).</p><p>“This collaboration has allowed us to innovate with real-time monitoring and verification checks in a fully decentralized and privacy preserving format. This is completely new to the market and enables us to provide a fully regulatory compliant solution for customer onboarding and monitoring, while simultaneously being future proofed for the new eIDAS 2.0 regulation for digital credentials. This can revolutionise the existing paradigm for customer data sharing, reducing costs and friction within existing regulated industries and emerging markets where identity verification is currently too costly” says Alex Tweeddale, Product Lead at&nbsp;cheqd.</p><p>Using the existing infrastructure with FinClusive, cheqd and Verida, this verifiable KYC/KYB solution can be used across various use&nbsp;cases:</p>  Financial Services: Onboarding at any bank or nonbank financial service, lowering costs and friction. Sharing reusable and trusted data between financial services, while meeting counterparty risk and compliance requirements.  Web 3.0: Reusing “Web 2.0” KYC and ongoing monitoring compliance processes to onboard to regulated Virtual Asset Service Providers at low cost and with increased efficiency  eCommerce and Online Retailers: Reusing verifiable KYC/KYB to purchase goods online, reducing the risk of fraud and phishing.  Age Restrictions: Reusing verifiable KYC/KYB to access age restricted content, such as alcohol, gambling or gaming — meeting upcoming compliance requirements for&nbsp;vendors.  Government Services: Government agencies can use reusable KYC/KYB to streamline processes for citizens accessing various public services, reducing the administrative burden on both the government and citizens.  Cross-Border Transactions: Reusable KYC/KYB can be beneficial in cross-border transactions and international business dealings, where having a standardized and recognized identity verification process can facilitate smoother collaborations.  Others: Combining KYC/KYB credentials with other credentials (e.g. employment, accomplishments, loyalty, heath) to build higher levels of assurance and digital reputation.  <p><a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">Schedule a meeting</a> with our joint representative Alex to become a pioneer in your industry by offering a fully decentralised and privacy preserving way to verify reusable KYC/KYB credentials.</p> A truly global collaboration <p>“We are thrilled to have successfully integrated the cheqd network into the Verida Wallet and work closely with the Finclusive team to provide a seamless user experience to end users to receive, store and share their reusable Finclusive credentials. This successful proof of concept is a showcase of what industry standard best practice looks like for regulatory compliant credential activities, while also demonstrating a more streamlined and efficient model for the traditional finance sector. We are incredibly excited to continue working with FinClusive and cheqd to roll this technology out across the wide range of global use cases.” says Chris Were, CEO at&nbsp;<a href="http://Verida.io">Verida</a>.</p><p>Verida, based in Australia, provides a mobile wallet used by a Holder to receive, store and present their VCs. This mobile wallet also provides an embedded crypto wallet combined with the world’s leading decentralized, encrypted private data storage network suitable for storing VC’s. This provides a simple interface for end users to interact with traditional finance products and blockchain digital assets in a regulatory compliant manner.</p><p>cheqd, based in the UK, is a purpose-built network for decentralised identity. It maintains an array of packages with varying levels of integration complexity to allow its partners and customers to have a variety of ways of plugging into cheqd’s identity functionality. Via these different packages, customers and partners can issue and verify Verifiable Credentials, create cheqd DIDs, DID-Linked Resources, Status Lists and Schemas with different levels of integration effort and flexibility, enabling frictionless verification, real-time monitoring and decentralisation for resilience, uptime and efficient cross-border lookups.</p><p>FinClusive, based in the US, is a KYC/KYB and full-stack anti-money laundering and financial crimes compliance (AML/FCC) platform with due diligence coverage in over 180 countries–providing automated KYC/KYB, requisite customer due diligence (basic to enhanced) with global coverage, ongoing monitoring and transaction tracking. The platform automates the verification and/or issuance of digitally verifiable compliance-backed Identity credentials that can be verified centrally through FinClusive or decentrally in collaboration with Verida and cheqd using&nbsp;VCs.</p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">Arrange a conversation</a> with our joint representative Alex to start optimising your business and reduce avoidable KYC/KYC verification cost.

<p></p> 
<p>One of the biggest security weak points for organizations involves their <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/authentication">authentication</a> processes. According to <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/gcat_threathorizons_full_jul2023.pdf">Google Cloud’s 2023 Threat Horizons Report</a>, 86% of breaches involve stolen credentials. Our own research found that <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">60% of organizations reported authentication-related breaches</a> in the past year. Context-based authentication offers an important tool in the battle against credential stuffing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>, MFA prompt bombing, and other attacks on authentication systems.</p>  
<p>Also referred to as <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-adaptive-authentication">adaptive authentication</a> or <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/risk-based-authentication">risk-based authentication</a>, context-based authentication layers on dynamic security controls that use contextual signals and other indicators of risk to make access decisions. When used in conjunction with secure passwordless authentication, it helps better protect your resources while providing better employee and customer login experiences.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Context-Based Authentication?  
<p>Context-based authentication goes beyond traditional methods by controlling access and user authentication flows based on dynamic risk calculations. It analyzes information such as user behavior, device signals, and risk signals from other security tools to dictate access policies. This is a departure from traditional authentication, which relies solely on presenting the correct credentials. Based on this risk information it may, for example, prompt users for an additional authentication factor, require them to re-affirm their identity through a proofing process, or block access altogether. Incorporating context and eliminating insecure passwords from the authentication process significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, thereby lowering the chances of a potential data breach.</p> 
<p>In its simplest terms, context-based authentication involves two parts:</p> 
  
  Establishing a baseline: In order to determine what behavior and scenarios are suspicious, the systems must first establish a baseline for each user that defines what is normal.  
  Responding to anomalies: Once a baseline is set, the context-based authentication system evaluates each login attempt against this norm. It actively scans for potential anomalies, such as login attempts originating from unusual geographic locations or suspicious VPNs, during periods of user inactivity, if the device is rooted or jailbroken, and other factors that indicate a higher risk. It also takes into account the type of access requested — for example a high-risk transaction. If elevated risk levels are detected, the system triggers additional authentication factors or verification steps.  
  
 Key Components of Context-Based Authentication  
<p>Any context-based authentication system contains these basic components, although they will vary in both how they are constructed and how they get used. The best context-based authentication processes assess multiple layers and signals in order to effectively optimize for both security and user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
 Risk Engine  
<p>The heart of context-based authentication is the risk engine. The risk engine continuously collects and analyzes data to determine the risk level associated with each user access request. Modern authentication risk engines use machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to detect malicious behaviors and threats in real time. The broader and more varied the information sources and risk signals, the more accurate and effective the risk engine.</p> 
 Context Sources  
<p>As mentioned, the effectiveness of the risk engine fully depends on its data sources. Sources include things such as device health posture, mobile, web and browser contextual signals, real-time events, user behavior and access patterns. Ideally, your sources also include risk data from EDR systems and other cybersecurity tools deployed in your organization.</p> 
 Action Orchestration  
<p>Real-time risk information holds little value if it cannot also be actioned upon in real time. Context-based authentication systems use the risk insight to enforce access policies. This can range from simply denying access, to requiring additional authentication steps, to requiring the person to prove that they are the person they claim to be using identity verification technologies.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Benefits of Context-Based Authentication  
<p>Context-based authentication provides multiple advantages for organizations.:</p> 
  
  Prevents attacks: Context-based authentication operates as a continuous gatekeeper, actively scanning for anomalies and high-risk activities. This proactive approach prevents unauthorized access attempts and significantly reduces the risk of successful attacks, protecting sensitive data and fortifying the organization's security posture against evolving threats.  
  Improves User Experience (UX): By leveraging contextual cues to streamline access, it ensures that legitimate users can navigate seamlessly through the authentication process. This not only enhances overall user satisfaction but also minimizes friction, making security measures more user-friendly without compromising on protection.  
  Ensures Regulatory Compliance: Context-based authentication allows organizations to continuously assess identity threats and mitigate risks as required by NIST, ISO, HIPAA, GDPR and other regulations. It also can ensure only authorized users access sensitive information in accordance with requirements under <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/pci-dss-4-password-mfa-requirements">PCI-DSS</a>, FISMA, FRCP and HITECH.  
  Enables Zero Trust Architecture: <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/risk-based-authentication-essential-to-zero-trust">Context-based authentication aligns with Zero Trust</a> “never trust, always verify” principles. It assumes that no user or system is inherently trustworthy, requiring continuous and ongoing verification. When used in conjunction with phishing-resistant AAL3-compliant authentication methods, it provides a strong foundation for building a Zero Trust architecture.  
  
 Implement Context-Based Authentication With HYPR Adapt  
<p>Context-based authentication employs risk-based analysis to determine and adjust authentication security controls in real time. The level of security it delivers depends on multiple factors including the sophistication of the risk engine, the breadth and depth of contextual information it uses, and the range of security controls it can affect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TL;DR? Here’s the cheat sheet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Microsoft Authenticator announces phishing-resistant passkey support. 
 More configuration options for PIV/CAC authentication. 
 FIDO2 support for iOS and MacOS applications. 
 Managed policies help you with “secure by design, secure by default.” 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details below!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Authenticator is becoming phishing-resistant! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/identity-at-microsoft-ignite-securing-access-in-the-era-of-ai/ba-p/2747279">announced</a> at Ignite 2023, in the first half of 2024, Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to register and sign in with device-bound passkeys managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app. This is a cost-effective, phishing-resistant credential available to anyone with the Authenticator app! Passkeys provide you with the latest and greatest security enhancements that will come to the FIDO standard over the next many years – and Authenticator integration lets you take advantage of the security innovations and advanced features Authenticator provides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Passkey managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: In new updates from the previous version of this blogpost: Microsoft Authenticator is not yet FIPS 140 compliant on Android. Microsoft Authenticator on Android is currently pending FIPS compliance certification to support our customers that may require FIPS validated cryptography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS is already FIPS-140 compliant, as announced in December of 2022. Learn more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app#fips-140-compliant-for-microsoft-entra-authentication">FIPS 140 complaint for the Microsoft Authenticator app.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved configurability for organizations that uses PIV / CAC 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last year since we announced the General Availability of Certificate-based Authentication (CBA), we’ve seen an increase of over 850% in Entra ID CBA usage for US Government customers. CBA helps our customers in their Zero Trust journey, migrating from on-premises IdPs such as AD FS, while continuing to provide familiar end user experience using PIV / CAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continue our investments in cloud-based CBA with recently added capabilities that allow you to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group. You can now select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multifactor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Additional phishing-resistant authentication options for mobile: FIDO2 support for iOS and macOS applications 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 2023, we announced support for <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/advancing-modern-strong-authentication/ba-p/3773135">FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS web browsers</a>. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS . With this release, users who have Microsoft Authenticator installed on iOS or Microsoft Intune Company Portal installed on macOS can sign into Microsoft applications using a FIDO2 security key. This feature is available now on iOS and will be available early next year on macOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO2 authentication is also available in MSAL-enabled third-party apps on iOS and macOS that meet the requirements listed in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/support-fido2-authentication">Support passwordless authentication with FIDO2 keys in apps you develop</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Adopting secure defaults, aligned with “Secure by design, secure by default” approach outlined by CISA 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/">Secure Future Initiative</a>. As part of this initiative, we will start <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=132044">Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies</a>. These initiatives align with the “Secure by design, Secure by default” approach called out by The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to ensure consumers can trust the safety and integrity of the technology that they use every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that tackling cybersecurity challenges is a collective effort. We're dedicated to collaborating closely with government agencies, security experts, and the broader community to strengthen our collective defenses against cyber threats. Our aim is to provide government customers with the tools and knowledge they need to stay ahead of evolving risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent releases and ongoing commitment to enhancing cybersecurity will support our broad set of customers, including the U.S. government customers who are working to meet the Executive Order. Together, we can build a more secure digital future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve&nbsp;currency <p>In this second blog of a 4-part series we are sharing some design principles that could underpin a desirable future scenario. The blog series is centred on the following enquiries and this reflection aims to address question&nbsp;two.</p>  What are the issues that make money (and our dominant monetary systems) so problematic? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog&nbsp;1</a>)  Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios?  What could a desirable future scenario actually look like? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-951ca09dd76d">Blog&nbsp;3</a>)  What can we start building and testing now to begin scaffolding a parallel system? (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">Blog&nbsp;4</a>)   Part 2 (of 4): Can we use design principles to help us imagine desirable future scenarios? <p>In the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">first blog</a> of this series we explored a number of factors that make our current monetary system incompatible with a regenerative and equitable future. Highlighting such issues feels important but it should not be the end goal. If something is threatening our shared fates, then it is our collective responsibility to try and create an alternative. Our aim is to learn from sharing these initial thoughts by inviting comments and critiques. Ultimately we hope to convene a community who have diverse skills and experiences beyond our own; a distributed team united in designing and building the alternative monetary system that we so desperately require. A first step towards that is to think carefully about what a desirable monetary system might in fact&nbsp;contain.</p><p>We are approaching this challenge in two&nbsp;parts:</p>  Firstly, by sharing ten design principles that we think should underpin a regenerative monetary&nbsp;system.  Secondly, we are in the process of developing aspirational future scenarios that respectfully explore the above principles.   Design principles <blockquote>Copper reserves cannot be equated with a forest. Carbon sequestration is not interchangeable with soil microbes. A whale’s life is not proportional to a barrel of&nbsp;oil.</blockquote>Credit: Dr Martin&nbsp;Lorenz<p>The following principles underpin a vision that opens up the future rather than closing it down. Whilst it is critical to understand the constraints (such as energy and carbon), we also need to seed a desire for non-competitive, infinite economies. Value flows such as solidarity, information and care can be managed in a different way to finite economies, providing a liberating release valve to our current scarcity&nbsp;mindset.</p>  Maintain interregional stability via organised exchange: our global supply chains are complex and entangled. Currently, the major reserve currency is backed by military force rather than by the collective values of the global population. As the polycrisis² intensifies we must ensure that we have the systems in place to trade fluidly and to provide a strong incentive to maintain peaceful relations.  Uplift economically poor but regeneratively rich regions: in much of the world our conception of profit and wealth is perverse, but it can be reconceived in service of regenerative potential. Regions and communities that are regeneratively abundant should automatically derive transactional rights that can be used to uplift critical infrastructures.  Elevate decentralised, value-backed currency issuance: Bitcoin is an example of alternative currency with a link to the physical world. This is achieved by the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp">proof of work function</a> that rewards miners who solve a mathematical problem with newly issued bitcoin (or with transactional fees). This principle builds on the requirement for a tangible link with the biosphere to break the cycle of growth linked extraction which we explored in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-dac459dc844e">Blog 1</a>. However, it seeks to achieve it by stewarding and increasing regenerative potential rather than by solving inane calculations.  Steward respectful interchangeability: we must clearly understand that finite elements of our world are not commensurate. Copper reserves cannot be equated with a forest. Carbon sequestration is not interchangeable with soil microbes. A whale’s life is not proportional to a barrel of oil. We must create closed loop cycles of stewardship that ensure respectful fungibility.  Quantify rather than price: markets provide a powerful distributed allocation mechanism for private assets, but are dangerously inadequate in relation to common elements such, soil health and air quality. Our attempts to price ‘nature’ and ‘natural assets’ have to date only yielded further extraction. We thus need to think about using measurements to account for the base reality of our systems rather than their priced abstractions.  Build visceral accountability: our transactional worldview allows people to separate their lived experience from their monetary choices. To maintain healthy relationships with each other and with our ecosystems, we must reconnect our animate senses to our decision making processes. Unless we can sense and feel how our actions play out, we are unlikely to tap into the wisdom required to steward a densely populated planet.  Commit to computational collaboration: the increasing ability to digitalise living systems can be directed to help us understand diverse perspectives, including those of the other-than-human world. What would it mean to create technologies of care? Could we use computation power to build interfaces that clearly visualise and recognise the complexity of entangled value&nbsp;flows?  Drive dynamic, iterative decision making: we must avoid the conceited falsity of being in control of living systems. Instead, the data that we collect can be used to create a dynamic understanding of complex interactions. For example, how are the different elements reacting with each other? How does the picture evolve as more data comes in? What does this mean in terms of acting as a respectful ecosystem collaborator?  Strengthen participatory value governance: building on principles 7 and 8, we must design governance systems capable of understanding the collective values of nested communities. This form of open society will transcend narrow voting behaviours in service of our collective thriving.  Interweave spiritual and political logic: we must aspire to preserve the aesthetic, intrinsic sacredness of life whilst recognising the political reality of our time. Holding both perspectives, whilst the transitional reverberations rip through the fabric of society, will be a critical aspect of this&nbsp;work.   Outlining a desirable scenario <p>Imagine a situation where currencies and capital are fundamentally linked to the objective, intersubjective and intrinsic value of interconnected relationships. Where the accounting and forecasting systems allow for multivalent factors and unforeseen possibilities. Where multi-sensor inputs are connected to a continuous participatory governance structure and trans-contextual decision making is the norm. This might sound complex and opaque, but in reality the technology either already exists or is close to reaching this level of functionality. The constraints are primarily those of path dependency² and power defending inertia.</p><p>We fully acknowledge that we cannot simply transcend the structural reality of our existing socio-economic systems. The aim is therefore to present the seeds of a cohesive alternative, because whilst we cannot possibly imagine the exact form of a future monetary system, we can think about the building blocks that it might contain. In our <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-951ca09dd76d">next blog</a> we will share an outline for a possible scenario that we hope to use as a conceptual baseline for an initial prototype. If the above principles have sparked any ideas regarding what a desirable scenario might contain, or if you are already working in this field, we would really value your thoughts.</p><p>This blog was written by Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) under Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB. We aspire to start working on some tangible proofs of possibility for bioregional currencies in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>References:</p>  We are using the term polycrisis to describe how multiple crises are interrelated and coalesce to create compounded effects.  Path dependency refers to processes where past events or decisions constrain later events or decisions.   <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">Towards multivalent currencies, bioregional monetary stewardship and a distributed global reserve…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How inclusive are your services? We explore how video verification can help give your company a competitive edge. 



 



<p>Inclusiveness escaped mere buzzword status and took some significant steps into the mainstream in 2023. This year, it’s sure to become an even more important competitive differentiator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being able to offer a truly inclusive workplace; one that is respectful of a team’s differences, whether that be gender, race, sexuality, or disability is a non-negotiable for the modern workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, a more diverse and inclusive corporate culture has been shown to create multiple benefits, including:</p>



  Bigger talent pools<br>  More ‘heard’ and satisfied staff<br>  Better reputation among peers<br>  <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">Optimal business performance</a><br>  Improved understanding of customers  



<p>But, what about a company’s actual customers? Besides the carefully crafted core values, and specific selection of stock photographs on a company’s website, how accessible are their products? How easy do organizations make it for customers to register, to use, and to integrate their services into their daily lives?</p>



 Accessibility for all. 



<p>With over <a href="https://helpfulprofessor.com/types-of-genders-list/">80 different cultural descriptions of gender</a>, amid growing sentiment that people should be able to self-identify, the challenge to offer fully inclusive identity verification has become increasingly complicated. Nobody should be denied access to online products; whether that’s opening bank accounts, renting scooters, or any other service that requires users to verify their identity.</p>



<p>There are many factors that can lead to inequality and a lack of inclusiveness in identity verification. For example, deeply entrenched racial bias has been discovered in many AI-based identity verification systems. Facial recognition software, in particular, has a long history of failing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender">recognize certain ethnicities.</a> Other incidents of racial bias include black applicants receiving a disproportionate percentage of rejections via an AI-based applicant screening process. In 2022, the UK data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) began a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/14/uk-data-watchdog-investigates-whether-ai-systems-show-racial-bias">three-year study</a> into ‘AI-driven discrimination’ by analyzing the effects of using algorithms to sift through job applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of AI has also revealed a worrying trend to discriminate against women by, for example, continuing to use gendered terms like policeman or fireman in text creation. In AI-prompt video generation, traditionally female roles, like carers, are <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/sponsored/4148316/gender-biased-ai-sending-us">still depicted by females</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There has also been evidence of <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/4-ways-to-address-gender-bias-in-ai">higher gender identification error rates among female subjects</a> by AI-enabled computer vision systems.</p>



 Fighting bias, one face at a time. 



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias, IDnow is collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, as part of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ai-bias-facial-verification/">MAMMOth project.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency, the goal of the project is to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so that they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.</p>



 Great UX for all users. 



<p>Additional factors such as age, disability, and neurodiversity are other areas that pose usability and inclusivity challenges, as is low proficiency in technology, or poor internet infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also the issue of those who do not have identity documents. Populations without paper or photo ID face an uphill struggle to verify themselves digitally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lack of identification has always been a barrier to economic and social inclusion, and in the digital age, without access to digital IDs and digital verification solutions, this is still the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/articles/women-in-identity-launch-code-of-conduct-project-challenging-digital-identity-teams-to-create-more-inclusive-solutions">one in four people</a> in the UK do not have traditional identity verification, yet smartphone ownership is on a steady march to capacity.</p>

<p><br>
Trust registries can quickly become a powerful tool for the discovery of services, including digital credential exchange services.</p>
<p>There’s a common misconception that trust registries are only necessary once digital credentials become widely adopted. However, I think the reality is quite the opposite. Trust registries are not just supporting systems; they are enablers of digital credential adoption.</p>
<p>What is a Trust Registry? In simple terms: Some list of authoritative identifiers that are governed. In the context of digital credentials, when a person presents a credential from their digital identity wallet to a verifier, the verifier might question the legitimacy of the issuing entity behind the credential presented. This is where a trust registry becomes invaluable. It can provide verifiers with the information needed to confirm whether the issuer is authorized by a governing body, under a governance framework.</p>
<p>The Dual Role of Trust Registries. Trust registries serve a dual purpose. Yes, they can be used by entities, such as verifiers, seeking inputs to help them make trust decisions. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly to where we’re at in the adoption cycle of digital credentials: trust registries act as discovery mechanisms. For example, if I’m looking for an authorized auditor for a specific function, a verified auditors list in a trust registry can provide essential information to initiate contact and potentially help me form business connections.</p>
<p>In the digital trust context, this could lead to forming direct connections or requesting credentials to further business processes. Therefore, trust registries are not only useful for making trust decisions during credential exchanges but also serve as powerful tools for decision-making prior to any credential exchange, acting as a strong discovery mechanism.</p>
<p>Investing in trust registries is crucial for the broader adoption of digital credentials – that’s why we’re spending a lot of time at Northern Block building foundational infrastructure for trust registries. They provide the necessary infrastructure for trust decisions and discovery, facilitating smoother and more reliable digital interactions in various business contexts.</p>

<p>The age old method of keeping track of who has access to different applications is typically a spreadsheet. People on the left, and apps on the top. A new person comes or goes, and you update the spreadsheet. Easy enough, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except that your head of engineering gave Jira access to someone and forgot to tell you.</p>
<p>And then there was that time that you were on vacation and didn’t get to personally handle offboarding, so who knows what did or didn’t get deprovisioned. Oh, and of course, there’s that one contractor who just needs access to a few things — wait, are they still doing work for you?</p>
<p>Suddenly what you’re calling access management doesn’t feel reliable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, it’s time to ditch the spreadsheet in favor of technology that makes your life simpler. Today, we’re excited to introduce Access Grid for YeshID, the only identity and access management platform purpose-built for companies running in Google Workspace.</p>
<p>Access Grid might look like what you’re used to, but it’s much more powerful and easier to maintain. By reducing the orchestration of access management, we make it easier to be efficient and compliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are three reasons to ditch your spreadsheet this year.</p>
 
  A spreadsheet is static. 
 
<p>Your spreadsheet is just that — a spreadsheet. It’s simply a list you have to maintain. Your spreadsheet doesn’t automatically send an email or remind someone of a provisioning task.&nbsp; Updating a field in Access Grid, on the other hand, kicks off a workflow, allowing you to track access as it’s being granted or revoked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you check a box to indicate that a user should have access to an app, a task is automatically created and assigned to the administrator of the app. Access Grid shows a grayed box, indicating that it’s still to be provisioned. Once the administrator confirms that they’ve granted access, Access Grid is automatically updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
  A spreadsheet is manual. 
 
<p>Unlike with your spreadsheet, Access Grid has the ability to automatically identify <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshid-integrations-an-easier-way-to-manage-app-access-for-smbs/">users for commonly used applications</a> that YeshID is integrated with. That means you don’t have to manually input who has access to your organization’s instances of Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Depending on the size of your organization, this can save tons of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
  A spreadsheet is “all you.” 
 
<p>Access Grid’s centralized workflow makes your spreadsheet a living access table — and that means it’s not solely on you to ensure it’s always current. Once you kick off that workflow, you can set, forget, and let Access Grid handle the rest. By automating requests to your internal application owners, you can take yourself out of being the middleman.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Ditch your access management spreadsheet 
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. What’s more, access management isn’t just about ensuring internal accuracy. It presents a <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2">security and compliance risk</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re ready to ditch the spreadsheet for a more <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/what-to-look-for-in-an-employee-onboarding-tool-for-small-businesses/">streamlined way to onboard/offboard</a> and a more secure way to manage app access, look no further. YeshID is <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-new-era-of-secure-it-identity-management-yeshid-soc-ii-and-you/">SOC II compliant</a>, in the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/yeshid_onboard/456377342688">Google Workspace Marketplace</a>, and has a big ol’ DELETE button if you decide it’s not for you. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Learn more</a>!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity forms the foundation of the modern workplace. Nearly every task depends on the ability to securely access systems using valid digital credentials linked to verified employees. Identity and access management (IAM) must constantly balance between security on one hand, and convenience and productivity on the other.</p>  
<p>The increasing interconnectedness and decentralization of systems, together with the surge in digital identities, are placing tremendous strain on these IAM processes, and attackers have been quick to take advantage. The past year saw regular reports of identity-related breaches, with increasingly severe consequences. Take the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">2023 hack of MGM Resorts</a> — their systems were down for ten days after hackers impersonated an employee and tricked service desk personnel into granting them access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In order to better understand what we can expect in 2024, the research team at Vanson Bourne surveyed IAM security leaders across the United States about the current <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce identity security</a> practices and pain points in their organization.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Identity Security Trends: Key Findings  
 Identity Challenges Abound  
<p>Our research shows that all organizations still struggle when it comes to securing their workers’ identities. The top pain point, cited by 40%, is employee <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a>/verification. Many organizations use a series of manual processes that are disconnected from their primary identity systems. Authentication comes in at a close second challenge, with 37% admitting that their authentication processes are vulnerable to phishing and credential attacks. Other top challenges include implementing continuous risk assessment and reducing authentication application sprawl, both named by 35% of organizations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Organizations Contend With Frequent Identity Risks  
<p>The findings show that employees engage in risky activities on a regular basis. Around seven in ten organizations (71%) report detecting risky user behavior or unexpected changes in the risk environment multiple times each week; nearly a quarter experience daily risks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Moreover, In all likelihood, these risk figures skew much higher. Organizations admit their visibility into identity risks remains incomplete. On average, they monitor fewer than half (49%) of their employees’ identities on a daily basis for risk or indications of compromise. This potentially leaves a large swath taking risky actions that go undetected.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Employee Identity Fraud: Organizations Find It Difficult To Verify Employees in Real Time  
<p>More than ⅔ of organizations spend over two hours performing <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-verification">identity verification checks</a> when an employee needs to replace a device, when a risk is flagged by security systems or when employees change roles. In some cases the average time spent is much higher. For example it takes an average of 8.52 hours to verify identity when an employee changes roles.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Identity Fraud Is Rampant and Costly  
<p>The widespread reliance on insecure identity security solutions is leaving the door wide open to security threats, with undeniable consequences. Identity fraud is so prolific among organizations that over three quarters (77%) report falling victim multiple times within the last 12 months.</p> 
<p>Organizations are feeling the impact in their balance sheets. On average, identity fraud cost organizations an average of $4.33 million in the last 12 months.</p>

   Account takeover fraud (ATO) is a form of identity theft where fraudsters overtake an online account and pose as real users. Typical means for ATO include compromised credentials, session-hijacking, social engineering, and device takeover.&nbsp;

<p>Account takeover fraud (ATO) is a form of identity theft where fraudsters overtake an online account and pose as real users. Typical means for ATO include compromised credentials, session-hijacking, social engineering, and device takeover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, ecommerce sites are common targets for ATO fraudsters for a variety of reasons, including the fact that quite a lot of sensitive and financial data are stored there, and yet individual users may be less vigilant with their security than in some other verticals. Once bad actors gain access to an ecommerce account, they can make purchases with the card on file, but they can also view sensitive personal data such as credit card numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Not only does this example show how an ecommerce platform can be damaged by ATO, but it also highlights how ATO is used for identity theft. Similarly, a bad actor may seek access to an online banking portal in order to transfer funds or to harvest enough PII to use elsewhere – for example, at another financial institution to apply for a loan under a stolen identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATO is a problem in most industries that do business online. The following industries are especially common targets for ATO:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Financial services</p>
 
 <p>Online retail &amp; ecommerce</p>
 
 <p>Healthcare</p>
 
 <p>Social media</p>
 
 <p>Video streaming &amp; entertainment</p>
 
 <p>Online gaming</p>
 
 Utilities 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Common ATO Red Flags 
 &nbsp; 
 
 <p>Odd Login Behavior: Logins from new devices, new locations, new times, or anything outside of previous common behavior is considered a red flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Large Number of Failed Login Attempts: When multiple login attempts occur in a short period of time, this may indicate a brute force attack, which involves repetitive attempts to “guess” a password based on minimal pieces of PII.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Login Spikes: Bots are commonly used to flood the system, similar to a brute force attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Account Detail Changes: If there are changes to an account’s preferred email, phone number, or security/account recovery details, especially all at once, this can indicate an ATO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Suspicious Activity: High volumes of chargebacks or purchases from new locations should be considered suspicious.

				  2024 will be a huge year for verifiable data. As the industry continues to develop, our team wanted to call some interesting trends to your attention and put together some predictions for what we think will happen this year.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
<p>AI technology exploded in 2023, with <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year">60% of organizations</a> reportedly using generative AI in some capacity. Two major categories of AI use cases are when an AI does things on a human’s behalf—such as an <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">AI assistant</a>—and when a human uses a generative AI to create things—such as <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT</a>, which can create written documents or images. Our team believes that as AI grows in popularity, particularly in business deployments, the need for identity integrations for both of these categories will grow with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to acting as an assistant and doing things on a user’s behalf, AI will need to be able to prove that it is authorized by a human to act on their behalf. It’s very usefulness as an assistant&nbsp; is tied to whether you can trust it with your secure information. For example, an AI that you can ask to play music for you is useful — but an AI you can trust with your credit card and ask to buy groceries, pay a bill, or even book a vacation? That is what people will pay for. To achieve this level of trust in a robot will require more security than passwords have proven they can provide; it will need mutual authentication and verifiable identity from both the user and the AI.</p>
<p>Generative AI has already caused quite a stir, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/12/30/ai-generated-art-was-a-mistake-and-heres-why/?sh=cc26b683fef3">particularly from artists</a> whose work these platforms have been trained on. While the internet has always been somewhat murky on the origins of work, the ability to give a&nbsp; computer a series of prompts and some guidelines and have it generate a visually-believable image or a plausibly correct article creates a whole new level of skepticism. This problem can also be solved by using verifiable credentials at the point of creation to record a digital “signature” that will allow anyone to check with certainty where a piece originates from and if it has been altered since that creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multi-Credential Systems</p>
<p>Recently, organizations have realized that there is no one “golden” credential type that fits every use case. In fact, our team has seen several platforms moving to support combinations of JSON-LD, SD-JWT, and AnonCred credentials as projects using multiple credential types gain traction. As ecosystems grow and begin to overlap, we will continue to see multiple credential types being used due to their unique benefits, not just due to competing ideas and organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials Will Be Folded into Existing Systems</p>
<p>Businesses have begun and will continue focusing on combining verifiable credentials with their existing systems, rather than approaching decentralized identity as an independent technology. Verifiable credentials almost always need to be paired with existing workflows to unlock the value of verified data — once you are certain of the data, then you need to do something with it. In addition, once you have established a trusted digital relationship using the inbuilt secure, bi-directional communication features, a series of other powerful use cases become possible. Some examples include mutually authenticated chat (confirm it’s a real Nigerian prince before you engage with him), faster, more secure interactions with organizations such as your bank, and a better way for employers to manage access for employees.</p>
<p>One real world application that Indicio has been working on in partnership with SITA and the Government of Aruba is verifiable credentials for travel. Using verifiable credentials as the underlying means of data transfer and authentication, travelers can store all the information they need to get through the airport quickly and efficiently, including their passports, VISAs, and boarding passes. Any of these credentials can be stored and verified with a single scan, resulting in a much faster experience at various touch points in a travel journey. And because these credentials draw on the information embedded in an official document, they eliminate the errors that inevitably occur when people are asked to fill in paper forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While credentials are an integral part of the equation, many travelers will never think twice about them, and may not even realize they are using decentralized technology.&nbsp; We see this simplicity and speed driving adoption in many other industries, as they realize the time and cost savings to be gained.</p>
<p>Better Awareness of Full Ecosystems</p>
<p>Our team predicts that, as we move through 2024, more people will realize the idea of credential ecosystems as ways to unlock all the benefits&nbsp; of decentralized identity. Being able to verify the integrity of a credential is a huge step forward, but equally important is being able to verify the issuer. For example, if you have a digital driver’s license and you use it as proof of identity to take out a loan, the bank would need to trust that your driver’s license hasn’t been tampered with AND know which authority issued it. From there the bank can make the human decision of whether or not we trust that source. As we continue to build this technology, more people will realize that without a mechanism to decide if you can trust the issuer, a credential alone is insufficient</p>
<p>Organizations Will Learn That They Can Go to Production with What They Have Now</p>
<p>Many organizations have been hesitant to openly adopt this technology or go to market for a&nbsp; variety of reasons, including a feeling that the technology isn’t ready or complete and concerns about needing permission to proceed or authorization from central gatekeepers, such as governments or standards bodies. But this technology is ready right now, and is already in use today. It doesn’t require a huge lift and shift, can be rolled out at whatever scale comfortable with to start, and most importantly, it provides a better way for organizations to manage their tremendously valuable data and implement the governance of their ecosystems. In 2024 our team sees many realizing that they can move forward without the need to wait for others to solve root trust issues or grant them permission to manage their own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Overall 2024 will certainly be one to watch for decentralized identity!</p>

 What is FIDO Passwordless Authentication? 
<p>Fast Identity Online (FIDO) is an advanced security protocol that seeks to eliminate the need for passwords, moving towards a more secure and user-friendly authentication process. FIDO passwordless authentication is a modern approach to two-factor authentication that deviates from traditional methods that typically rely on usernames and passwords. Instead, it leverages cryptographic techniques and private keys to ensure that users are who they say they are.</p>
<p>This approach fundamentally differs from traditional authentication systems. Unlike conventional password-based methods of authentication, where users must remember and input passwords, FIDO facilitates authentication by verifying the user’s device or biometrics.<br>
This ensures direct communication between the user’s mobile device, computer browser, and the server, minimizing the risk of phishing attacks and data security breaches.</p>
 
The Importance of Secure Authentication 
<p>Password-dependent authentication has long been a vulnerability relying solely on passwords for securing accounts, and sensitive data has led to a surge in cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access, stolen credentials used to user’s identities elsewhere.<br>
By focusing on only secure authentication methods, the FIDO passwordless and universal authentication framework also emphasizes reducing password-associated risks.<br>
It addresses the vulnerabilities of username and password-dependent authentication methods alone, making it challenging for attackers to compromise the user’s computer accounts, thus fortifying online security.</p>
 
Overview of How FIDO Works 
<p>FIDO (Fast Identity Online) offers a revolutionary take on user authentication through the security keys and its nuanced, cryptographic approach, differing substantially from traditional password-based systems. Here’s a more in-depth technical breakdown of how FIDO operates:</p>
 
 Asymmetric Cryptography: FIDO relies on a pair of cryptographic keys — a public key registered with the online service and a private key securely stored on the user’s device. This pair is used to authenticate users securely. 
 Local Device Authentication: Before the cryptographic process begins, the user must unlock the local device through a secure action such as entering a PIN, using a fingerprint sensor, or leveraging facial recognition technologies. 
 Authentication Request and Response: When authentication is needed, the service challenges the user’s device. The device then responds using the private key to sign the challenge, which the service verifies using the public key. 
 User Verification and Key Pair Generation: During registration with an online service, the user’s device creates a new key pair on behalf of the user, keeping the private key securely on the device while registering the public key with the service. 
 Limited Reliance on Centralized Servers: The private keys never leave the user’s device, limiting centralized servers’ necessity and minimizing the attack surface. 
 
 What is the FIDO Alliance? 
<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> is a robust consortium of leading international companies and organizations dedicated to establishing and promoting authentication standards that reduce the world’s over-reliance on passwords.<br>
Through a collaborative approach, the FIDO Alliance aims to create secure, user-friendly, and universally applicable authentication methods that seamlessly integrate across various online platforms and systems.<br>
Members of the FIDO Alliance contribute to the development, standardization, and widespread adoption of passwordless authentication practices. These contributors range from tech giants and financial institutions to government entities and other industry players, collectively driving innovation and fortifying global online security landscapes.<br>
The FIDO Alliance’s pioneering work nurtures a resilient digital ecosystem where businesses and users can interact confidently, benefiting from enhanced security and a simplified user experience.</p>
 
Advantages of Implementing FIDO Passwordless Authentication 
 
Enhancing User Experience 
<p>FIDO’s passwordless authentication significantly improves the user experience. Users find the authentication and registration process more convenient and less cumbersome without remembering and managing multiple passwords. This reduction in friction enhances user satisfaction and fosters a more streamlined and efficient user account and journey.<br>
Implementing FIDO’s username and passwordless approach simplifies the user’s interaction with digital platforms, security devices, and services, encouraging more frequent and confident use of online services. It marks a considerable step forward in creating an even online service environment where security and usability coalesce.</p>
 
Boosting Security Levels 
<p>One of the fundamental advantages of FIDO passwordless authentication lies in its enhanced security levels. Using cryptographic principles such as public key cryptography and private and public key two pairs, FIDO passwordless sign ensures that user credentials remain secure, minimizing the potential attack vectors typically associated with traditional password-based security usage.<br>
FIDO reduces the vulnerability of authentication processes by more user attempts and eliminating the dependence on passwords for user attempts. It mitigates common attack strategies like password cracking and phishing, contributing to a fortified security framework that confidently safeguards the user’s account data and privacy.</p>
 
Reducing Costs and Resources 
<p>The implementation of FIDO passwordless authentication can result in substantial savings for businesses. Reducing the reliance on passwords decreases the number of password reset requests and the associated administrative support, thus saving time and resources.<br>
Moreover, enhanced security mechanisms considerably reduce the risks and potential costs associated with data security breaches and cybersecurity incidents.<br>
In doing so, FIDO passwordless authentication presents itself as a cost-efficient alternative to password theft that optimizes user identity security and resource allocation.</p>
 
Implementing FIDO Passwordless Authentication in Businesses 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Steps to Adopt FIDO Authentication 
<p>Adopting FIDO Authentication in your organization entails a series of well-planned and executed actions. Here are specific steps</p>
 
 Gap Analysis: Conduct a thorough review of your existing authentication infrastructure to identify weaknesses, redundancies, and areas for enhancement.<br>
Map out the user authentication journey to understand the user experience and identify potential friction points. 
 Strategic Planning: Develop a comprehensive strategy outlining the implementation process. Consider timelines, key milestones, and necessary resources. Align the FIDO authentication implementation strategy with broader organizational cybersecurity objectives. 
 Selecting Appropriate FIDO Solutions: Choose a FIDO-certified solution like BlockID that aligns with your organization’s needs. Consider factors such as usability, scalability, and compatibility. Engage with vendors and solution providers for product demos and technical consultations to make informed decisions. 
 System Integration: Collaborate with IT teams to integrate the selected FIDO solutions within the existing technology infrastructure. Conduct rigorous testing to ensure the new authentication mechanisms’ compatibility, reliability, and performance. 
 Staff Training and Awareness Programs: Organize training sessions to educate employees about the new FIDO authentication processes, especially those in IT and security roles. Develop user guides, FAQs, and other resources to assist users and ensure a smooth transition. 
 Pilot Implementation: Begin with a pilot phase, implementing the FIDO solutions in a controlled environment to gather feedback and identify potential issues. Use insights from the pilot phase to make necessary adjustments before a full-scale rollout. 
 Full-Scale Rollout: Roll out the FIDO authentication solutions organization-wide, ensuring that all systems are updated, and all users are onboarded. Continuously monitor the implementation for user feedback, system performance, and any signs of security vulnerabilities. 
 
<p>By following these steps, security professionals can ensure a successful, secure, and user-friendly implementation of FIDO authentication security key, within their organizations.</p>
 
Common Concerns and Solutions with FIDO Passwordless Authentication 
 
Addressing Skepticism and Doubts 
<p>Misconceptions and uncertainties often surround new technological advancements. For FIDO passwordless authentication, addressing skepticism is vital to foster understanding and adoption of the operating system. Clarifying that FIDO’s protocols are built on strong cryptographic principles and industry best practices can dispel doubts regarding its security and reliability.<br>
Businesses can navigate uncertainties and build confidence in FIDO’s passwordless authentication methodologies by providing factual information on the authentication method used and demonstrating its effectiveness through successful implementations.</p>
 
Technical Challenges and Their Mitigations 
<p>Technical challenges such as integration difficulties, compatibility issues, and the requirement for ongoing support and updates are inherent in implementing any new technology.<br>

The collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) resulted previously in <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping/urban-land-ownership-mapping-in-copenhagen-eb13bfbbded1">mapping of Copenhagen</a> and aims to continue its investigation further in Athens and&nbsp;Lisbon.</p><p>Through findings in this blog, we aim to question the importance of ownership data protection rules in the context of Europe’s rising costs of living crisis. The difficulty of access paralyses the research arena and informed public discourse on distribution of wealth and social responsibility (incl. involvement of journalists, academics, city administrations, etc.) further jeopardizing spatial justice. Ultimately, this hinders facilitation of adequate policy, law enforcement and action against exploitative practices such as property flipping, foreign investments, tax avoidance, money laundering and future responses to climate&nbsp;impacts.</p> Introduction <p>Across Czechia, housing prices rose by more than 130% between 2015–2021 (<a href="https://vdb.czso.cz/vdbvo2/faces/en/index.jsf?page=vystup-objekt&amp;pvo=CEN15A1&amp;z=T&amp;f=TABULKA&amp;skupId=86&amp;katalog=31782&amp;pvo=CEN15A1&amp;str=v136&amp;c=v136~8__RP2021">Czech Statistical Office</a>) and continue to do so.

Several large parcels of land in this category are owned by real estate companies.</blockquote><blockquote>By hovering over a parcel you can then check who is the owner through <a href="https://nahlizenidokn.cuzk.cz/VyberParcelu/Parcela/InformaceO">this website</a> (see also the Data Access and Methodology sections&nbsp;below).</blockquote> Why is housing in Prague unaffordable? <p>The <a href="https://iprpraha.cz/">Institute of Planning and Development of the Capital City of Prague</a> (IPR) estimates that the city needs 9,000 new apartments per year to fill the housing gap and accommodate the growing urban population, while <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/08/03/pragues-housing-crisis-surfs-brownfield-wave/">another estimation</a> calls for 20,000 to return prices to reasonable levels. However, the lack of supply and increased demand only tell part of the&nbsp;story.</p><p>As cheap mortgages were available for years, housing became a popular investment product resulting, for example, in ca 220,000 investment flats in Prague, mostly in the historical centre. Furthermore, some of the following factors helped push homes out of reach for&nbsp;many:</p>  years of <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/26609-restituce-privatizace-deregulace-a-politika-bydleni-je-v-troskach">housing policy which has deregulated the market</a>, leading to an increase in privatisation and commodification, coupled with recent attempts for its&nbsp;renewal  little incentive to <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/32627-mesta-v-pronajmu-delat-bytovou-politiku-znamena-zacit-sbirat-data">create accessible, coherent datasets</a> that might reveal uncomfortable truths e.g. about the concentration of&nbsp;wealth  slow bureaucracy (e.g. <a href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/362481530288062060-0080022018/render/EUSNDBCZLaunchFactsheetEnglish.pdf">slow construction permitting</a>) resulting in stretched planning across political cycles,  low property taxation that does not reflect the value of land (flat tax per district, i.e. in the same district tax on the most fashionable street can be the same as on the peripheral areas), as well as lack of preventative measures such as e.g. <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/08/03/pragues-housing-crisis-surfs-brownfield-wave/">dynamic property taxation</a> for owners that leave investment apartments empty or developers that leave land banks&nbsp;fallow,  little land-value capture (LVC) utilisation (<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/408eaca3-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/408eaca3-en">OECD</a> classifies the developer obligations, land readjustment and strategic land management instruments of the LVC as “used rarely” in Czechia), with only the recent introduction of limited <a href="https://www.praha.eu/file/3254972/metodika_kontribuce_investoru.pdf">developer contributions</a> in forms of cash, schools, parks or other public amenities (see: Bubny-Zatory or Zizkov Freight Station brownfield developments).  years of <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/35777-priciny-krize-bydleni-zacinaji-uz-u-vlastnictvi-pozemku">continuous sale of municipal land</a> (albeit we can also a see positive signs of declaring a halt to those practices)  <p>These policies have reinforced the emerging global narrative which depicts city authorities as powerless in the face of developers, but this myth can be debunked through recognition of a new set of capabilities within administrations.</p><blockquote>Municipalities can recognize the power of ownership data and its usage as tools for regaining agency in city development.</blockquote><p>As European real estate prices keep rising under the prevailing economic, taxation and housing policy regimes, many urban problems call for reforms around land ownership, its leverage power, and data transparency at the EU, national and city&nbsp;levels.</p> Pledge for data transparency <p>Lack of easily accessible ownership datasets of land ownership, human-business networks and real estate transactions creates a condition where speculation can happen behind the scenes, away from the civic eyes and sense-making capabilities. In an attempt to protect individuals, GDPR data protection rules end up hiding exploitative behaviours, for example by making it impossible to reveal linkages to tax havens, uneven accumulation of wealth through the ownership multiple apartments or land sites, shell companies, and more. As a consequence, the right to land, and housing are further undermined.</p><p>Unfortunately, the European Court of Justice recently declared that the public access of registers containing information about beneficial owners of businesses breaches the right to privacy. Consequently, not just Luxembourg but also the Netherlands has restricted access to the registry of real owners following the verdict. This further sets a precedent for other member states despite having been highlighted by <a href="https://denikreferendum.cz/clanek/34655-rozhovor-ztizeni-pristupu-doevropskych-registru-vlastniku-jevelky-krok-zpet">Denik Referendum</a>, journalists and experts as a significant regression in endeavours to enhance transparency and uncover unjust financial transactions.</p><p>In the Prague context, wide transparency and ease of access for all to land, real estate ownership, transaction and business register data would&nbsp;entail:</p>  ease of access for download of whole-city datasets for city administration, politicians, journalists, researchers, and eventually the general&nbsp;public.  ability to search through the register by owner’s&nbsp;name  ability to link and visualise individuals and their connections to companies and owned land (historical and&nbsp;present)  ability to show transactions.  <p>Current land registry systems are predominantly centralized with data maintained by the govenrmnet or a central authority making the system vulnerable to corruption, hacking, fraud, registration gaps. An update through a transformation of land registry to a blockchain database could alter the data governance framework and render beneficial effects. While <a href="https://journals.muni.cz/mujlt/article/view/11622">benefits and dangers</a> should be taken into consideration this idea has already numerous examples in practice (initiatives undertaken by governments in Republic of Georgia, Sweden, Ukraine, as well as Ghana, Brazil, Honduras, India and&nbsp;Japan).</p><p>All of this could play a key role in improving housing affordability by unlocking:</p>  measures to capture real estate value uplifts due to e.g. public investments, through spatial taxation (see: <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Smart-Commons-A-new-model-for-investing-in-the-commons">Smart&nbsp;Commons</a>)  progressive taxation on the among of land&nbsp;owned,  taxation of empty housing stock or multi-apartment ownership (hindering speculative behaviours)  real estate developer contributions (large and small) in exchange for usage or plugging in to the municipal assets such as heavier usage of roads, electricity grid, parking space, pressures on the water systems and infrastructure, urban green&nbsp;etc.  greater possibility of building affordable housing thanks to better overview of municipal assets and their relation to other city landowners  expansion of multiplicity of actors able to research, analyse and engage with the data (e.g. urban heat islands and climate adaptation of streets — researchers could develop models which include mostly affected citizens, owners, and tenants to inform and organize collectively towards climate adaptation, as well as whole-city retrofit, and&nbsp;more)   Necessary alliances <p>In this context, the current continuation of the aforementioned <a href="https://cities4rent.journalismarena.media/">Cities for Rent</a> initiative — the <a href="https://urbanjournalism.org/">Urban Journalism Network</a> and its project Ground Control aims to gather investigative journalists from around Europe to address land ownership issues.
